plaintiff ellen devlin appeals from a final judgment entered in the united states district court for the district of connecticut dorsey,granting the government motion to dismiss a negligence action brought pursuant to the federal torts claims act,et.we vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.
background 
plaintiff brother,michael murratti,began his employment as a letter carrier for the united states postal service usps in new haven,connecticut,on june.as a federal employee,he was covered by the federal employees life insurance program established by the federal employees group life insurance act feglia,et.he completed a form,known as a standard form designation of beneficiary,to name his mother,margaret devlin,as the beneficiary of of the life insurance proceeds,and his nephew,david spinato,as the beneficiary.on july,this form was properly filed in murratti official personnel file.
on november,murratti,while acting within the scope of his duties,was involved in a car accident.this accident left him permanently disabled,and he received federal employee compensation thereafter.
on may,murratti went to the personnel office of the usps in new haven and requested assistance from blase redding now blase pierce or barbara walcott,or both.redding and walcott were employed as personnel assistants their duties included helping postal service employees and employees receiving federal employee compensation benefits complete designation of beneficiary forms.murratti sought to change the beneficiaries of his life insurance policy.to do so,muratti completed and signed a new form,which was witnessed by both personnel assistants.that form named murratti mother as the beneficiary and plaintiff,murratti sister,as the beneficiary.
because of murratti status as a compensationer,that is,as a recipient of federal employee compensation benefits,see a his form,in order to be effective,had to be filed in the office of personnel in the personnel office in new haven.plaintiff alleges that murratti advised redding walcott that he was receiving federal employee compensation benefits.plaintiff also alleges that,consistent with the personnel assistants usual practice for compensationers and regular employees alike,murratti was given a carbon copy of the form,and the original was retained by either redding or walcott for filing.
the personnel assistants,however,never forwarded the form to the office of personnel management.instead,the form was erroneously put in murratti official personnel file in the personnel office in new haven.
murratti mother died on june,and murratti died several months later on october.upon his death,both plaintiff and murratti nephew,spinato,submitted claims for the life insurance proceeds to metropolitan life insurance company metlife,the underwriter for the federal employees life insurance program.metlife denied plaintiff claim.on may,plaintiff filed an administrative claim with the usps,alleging that e mployees of the united states postal service negligently failed to comply with the filing requirements of were negligently trained in the proper filing procedure.that claim was denied on april.
plaintiff then brought timely suit against the united states pursuant to the federal torts claims act ftca,et.her complaint alleged,inter alia,that the usps employees were negligent in assuming the duty and obligation to properly file the designation of beneficiary form with opm after taking the completed form from michael murratti,which duty was breached by their failure to effectuate proper filing.complaint a.
the district court dorsey,initially denied the government motion for summary judgment.see devlin united states,d,vacated by devlin united states,d.it rejected the government argument that the ftca misrepresentation exception,h,barred plaintiff claim.id.at.additionally,the court held that,if the facts revealed that the usps employees did assume the task of completing the processing of murratti designation of beneficiary form,the government could be found liable under the negligence doctrine accepted in connecticut that where a person gratuitously undertakes a duty to perform a task,that person must exercise reasonable care in performing that task.id.at hereinafter referred to as the good samaritan theory of liability.
the government moved for reconsideration,and the district court granted that motion,vacated its earlier decision,and granted summary judgment in favor of the government on the ground that plaintiff claim did not qualify as one for injury or loss of property,under section b of the ftca.b.devlin united states,d.plaintiff appealed.
discussion 
we review a district court ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo,examining the evidence in the light most favorable to,and drawing all inferences for,the nonmoving party.hotel employees rest.employees union,local city of new york dep t of parks recreation,cir.
in addition to the ground on which it won below,the government advances the following alternative rationales for upholding the district court grant of summary judgment the claim is barred by the ftca misrepresentation exception,see h the claim is barred by the ftca exception,see congress intended feglia remedies to be exclusive of ftca remedies in this type of case plaintiff claim is essentially one for estoppel,and estoppel does not lie against the government in this context plaintiff does not state a claim under connecticut tort law and even if connecticut law permitted plaintiff claim,that law would be preempted by feglia.
we decline to address the government argument based on the ftca exception,because we have not had the benefit of the district court initial consideration of that issue we also will not address whether plaintiff states a claim under connecticut law,but note that the district court,upon reconsideration of the issue,should examine whether connecticut has resolved whether a plaintiff may rely upon a good samaritan theory of liability where a the plaintiff is a with no special relationship to the defendant,b the claim is one of negligent,rather than intentional,conduct,and c there may be an absence of physical harm.based on our preliminary review of the state case law,this important question may well remain an open one accordingly,the district court might deem it advisable to take advantage of connecticut certification procedure,see.stat,for guidance.
we do,of course,reach the issue addressed by the district court in its latest the ftca injury or loss of property clause bars plaintiff claim.we disagree with the district court determination that it does and therefore vacate and remand for further proceedings.we also consider the government argument that the plaintiff claim is barred by the ftca misrepresentation exception,and agree with the district court conclusion in its first opinion that this exception does not apply to plaintiff good samaritan theory of liability.finally,we consider and reject the government arguments regarding feglia preemption and estoppel.
i.the ftca injury or loss of property requirement 
enacted in,the ftca waives the federal government sovereign immunity against certain tort claims arising out of the conduct of its employees.section b provides 
t he district courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the united states,for money damages,accruing on and after january,for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.
b.see federal deposit ins.meyer,d a claim must allege the six elements contained above to be actionable under b.section provides in relevant part 
the united states shall be liable,respecting the provisions of this title relating to tort claims,in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,but shall not be liable for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages.
finally,section lists various exceptions to the ftca waiver of immunity,such as an exception for claims arising out of certain intentional torts.
the district court held that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff claim because the claim did not satisfy section b injury or loss of property requirement.devlin,d.the court began by observing that the meaning of property is a matter of federal statutory construction.id.at.it pointed out that the term was not defined by the ftca and that it therefore had to be construed in accordance with its ordinary and natural meaning.id at.the court then cited a black law dictionary definition of property t hat which is peculiar or proper to any one person that which belongs exclusively to one or ownership the unrestricted and exclusive right to a thing the right to dispose of a thing in every legal way,to possess it,to use it,and to exclude everyone else from interfering with it.id.citing black law dictionary ed.noting that the plaintiff does not contend that she has a legal claim as a beneficiary of the insurance policy,the court characterized what she claims to have lost as a result of the government negligence as an expected property interest.id.at.it then cited a connecticut marital dissolution case for the proposition that a n expectancy is only the bare hope of succession to the property of another,such as may be entertained by an heir apparent such a hope is inchoate.it has no attribute of property,and the interest to which it relates is at the time nonexistent and may never exist.id.quoting krafick krafick.the court concluded from this that plaintiff inchoate interest does not satisfy the definition of property under the ftca,and cited a district of maryland decision as support i n order to be covered by the ftca there must have been a physical impact of some type on the plaintiff or its property id.citing charles burton builders,united states.the court also stated that the ftca waiver of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed in favor of the sovereign and that it is the plaintiff burden to show that her claim falls within that waiver.id.
the phrase injury or loss of property is not defined by the ftca,see defining other terms,and has not been interpreted by the supreme or by any previous decision of this court.the meaning of the phrase is obviously a matter of federal statutory interpretation,see molzof united states,d what the term punitive damages as used in section of the ftca signifies is by definition a federal question.but recognizing this only sets up the first issue to be congress intended the phrase to have a uniform federal meaning or,alternatively,meant the phrase to refer to the applicable state law for its content.see de sylva ballentine.the scope of a federal right is,of course,a federal question,but that does not mean that its content is not to be determined by state,rather than federal law.the district court opinion did not squarely analyze this issue,nor do the briefs submitted by the parties.
this court decision in birnbaum united states,cir,strongly suggests that the phrase incorporates state law.that case dealt with the phrase personal injury in the larger clause for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death.b.in birnbaum,we upheld the government liability for the tort of intrusion arising from the cia reading of certain mail sent to and from the soviet union the court began by stating that there was subject matter jurisdiction under the ftca only if there was a personal injury as defined by state law,and if the acts causing the personal injury would give rise to liability under state law if executed by an employee of a private person.id.at emphasis added.on the first issue,the court held 
although upon the consolidated trial it appeared that no plaintiff was touched physically or harmed financially,and that the sole damage claim was mental suffering,new york recognizes as personal injury mental suffering that results from a known category of tort.
id.citing new york cases.
it would,of course,be anomalous if personal injury was defined by state law but the neighboring phrase injury or loss of property were not.and,although birnbaum did not pause to consider them,there appear to be good reasons for taking this approach.an important factor in deciding whether to give a statutory provision a single federal meaning or one that varies by state is whether nationwide uniformity is important to the proper functioning of the statutory scheme in question.for example,in reconstruction finance beaver county,the supreme court held that a federal statute that subjected the real property of certain agencies to state,territorial,county,municipal,or local taxation to the same extent according to its value as other real property is taxed,left the definition of real property to local tax laws,so long as those laws did not discriminate against the federal government.in disagreeing with the government position that a uniform federal definition should apply,the court stated 
t he government relies on the generally accepted principle that congress normally intends that its laws shall operate uniformly throughout the nation so that the federal program will remain unimpaired.but congress in permitting local taxation of the real property,made it impossible to apply the law with uniform tax consequences in each state and locality.for the several states,and even the localities within them,have diverse methods of assessment,collection,and refunding.tax rates vary widely.to all of these variable tax consequences congress has expressly subjected the real property of the defense plant corporation.in view of this express provision the normal assumption that congress intends its law to have the same consequences throughout the nation can not be made.
similarly,the ftca basic thrust was decidedly not to create a federal common law of torts,but expressed in the final clause of section b and in section tie the government subject to a host of the disparate and always evolving tort law of the several states.see birnbaum,at b y adopting the law of the place as the source for rules of decision under the federal tort claims act,congress expressly negated any possible inference that federal courts were to exercise any common lawmaking power to fashion torts under the act in the interest of national uniformity.richards united states,d in holding that the rules of the state in which the negligence occurred are controlling,the court stated we should not assume that congress intended to set the courts completely adrift from state law with regard to questions for which it has not provided a specific and definite answer in an act such as the one before us which,as we have indicated,is so intimately related to state law.emphasis added.it would be antithetical to the ftca structure if each term in section b,such as cause and negligent,were given a uniform federal meaning,thereby requiring plaintiffs to satisfy a layer of federal tort law requirements in addition to satisfying those of the law of the relevant state.
the supreme court has itself endorsed the incorporation approach with regard to a closely related clause in williams united states.per curiam that case held that the phrase while acting within the scope of his office or employment in section b is to be given meaning by the law of the relevant state.see also united states,cir williams disposed of the contention that the phrase acting within the scope of his office or employment was to be interpreted as a matter of federal law.
other supreme court cases,however,suggest that the phrase injury or loss of property might instead be assigned a uniform federal meaning in laird nelms,d,for example,the supreme court interpreted the phrase negligent or wrongful act or omission to bar the plaintiff claim,which sought recovery under a strict liability theory for damage resulting from the sonic booms produced by military planes.the court stated 
the necessary consequence of the court holding in dalehite is that the statutory language negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government,is a uniform federal limitation on the types of acts committed by its employees for which the united states has consented to be sued.regardless of state law characterization,the federal tort claims act itself precludes the imposition of liability if there has been no negligence or other form of misfeasance of nonfeasance,on the part of the government.
id.at.internal quotation marks omitted the phrase at issue in laird appears immediately after the phrase that is of interest to us here,and this may suggest that the latter should also be assigned a uniform meaning.laird,however,took the uniformity approach only so far.it by no means assigned an independent federal content to negligent whereby plaintiffs would first have to prove negligence under federal common law standards and then,having cleared that hurdle,prove negligence under the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.rather,laird established that congress a had in mind a taxonomy in which strict liability,negligence,and intentional torts were distinguished from each other b excluded the first category from the ftca scope and c left the content of the latter categories to the law of the relevant state.laird,therefore,stakes out a hybrid approach on the continuum between a purely federal definition of a term and a purely one 
by contrast,molzof united states took a purer approach in its interpretation of the ftca bar on the recovery of punitive damages,see.in molzof,there was no suggestion that that term was meant to incorporate the understanding of punitive damages held by each state.rather,the court treated punitive damages as a term of art with a widely accepted meaning,d referring to judicial decisions and to legal dictionaries in existence during the drafting of the ftca that defined punitive damages as damages awarded to punish defendants for torts committed with fraud,actual malice,violence,or oppression.but,of course,molzof dealt with a separate section of the ftca from the one before us,and it interpreted a clause expressly designed to exclude federal liability.as such,its application of a uniform federal definition is both understandable and not especially applicable to the instant case.
although we are inclined to agree with the approach over the uniformity indeed may well be bound by birnbaum united states to adopt the need not conclusively determine the issue,because we conclude that,under either approach,plaintiff claim is one for injury or loss of property.we will apply each approach in turn.in order to do so,however,we must first decide how to characterize the loss that the plaintiff claims to have suffered.
the government argues that the fact that plaintiff would have become a beneficiary of her brother life insurance policy had the designation of beneficiary been filed properly is beside the point s he was not properly designated and she did not become a beneficiary.even though she may have expected to become a beneficiary upon her brother death,her disappointment was not an injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death.we disagree.the proper characterization of plaintiff loss is of her status as beneficiary,that is,of what she would have been in the period before murratti death had she been designated in a proper fashion.had that happened,murratti would still have retained the right to change beneficiaries at any time by filing another designation of beneficiary form.it is this status,as a beneficiary that could be removed,that plaintiff would have had but for the government alleged negligence.the question then becomes whether the loss of such a status or interest qualifies as an injury or loss of property under the ftca.
a.the uniform definition approach 
when giving a term a uniform definition for purposes of a statute like the ftca,the term can either be given its ordinary or natural meaning or be treated as a term of art that has a conventional meaning compare meyer,at.construing the ftca use of term cognizable in accordance with its ordinary or natural meaning and citing a black law dictionary definition smith united states,d construing the ftca exception for claims arising in a foreign country in terms of its commonsense meaning,and thus as referring to a region or tract of land and not a sovereign state and kosak united states,d stating,in reference to the ftca exception for claims arising from customs officials detention of goods,that t he starting point of our analysis of these competing interpretations must,of course,be the language of c.we assume that the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used.quotation marks and citation omitted with molzof,at.stating,in reference to the ftca bar on the recovery of punitive damages,that p unitive damages is a legal term of art that has a widely accepted meaning,and noting the cardinal rule of statutory construction that holds that w here congress borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries and practice,it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken in such case,absence of contrary direction may be taken as satisfaction with widely accepted definitions,not as a departure from them.internal quotation marks omitted id.at.this rule carries particular force in interpreting the ftca.certainly there is no warrant for assuming that congress was unaware of established tort definitions when it enacted the tort claims act in,after spending some years of congressional drafting and redrafting,amendment and.internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court seemingly took neither approach.after defining property in a dictionary fashion as,inter alia,the right to dispose of a thing in every legal way,to possess it,to use it,and to exclude everyone else from interfering with it,it relied on a district of maryland decision that i n order to be covered by the ftca there must have been a physical impact of some type on the plaintiff or its property,charles burton builders.at emphasis added.in doing this,the district court was positing a definition of property that emphasized tangibility or.but this definition is not only contrary to property ordinary dictionary meaning it is also clearly untenable in the context of the ftca.section b manifestly encompasses some torts that are not accompanied by a physical impact.there is no doubt,for example,that legal malpractice is cognized by the ftca because congress has prescribed special rules for ftca claims relating to the malpractice of department of defense and coast guard lawyers,including an exemption of such claims from the ftca misrepresentation exception and a provision making the ftca the exclusive remedy for such negligence.see a e.
that section b encompasses a wide sweep of intangible tort claims is also evidenced by congress decision to limit that liability by setting out specific exceptions in section.these exceptions exclude some but not all harms.see h barring claims arising out of,inter alia,libel,slander,misrepresentation,deceit,and interference with contract rights.if the kind of harm at stake in actions did not qualify as injury or loss of property in section b,there would have been little reason to exclude such actions in section see kosak,at.a construction of one provision of the ftca that renders another provision mere surplusage is subject to considerable doubt.
congress was indeed interested in limiting the scope of the government waiver of immunity from suits for negligence and intentional torts,but we have found no indication either in the language or legislative history of the act that congress meant to accomplish this through the phrase injury or loss of property,and every indication that congress did so through the specific and detailed exceptions it established in section it is little surprise,then,that both the supreme court and the federal appeal courts have regularly looked to those exceptions to effectuate congress desire to limit governmental tort liability,rather than doing so by reading limitations into the concept of property.see,united states gaubert,d claim barred by exception where a shareholder sued to recover,inter alia,the loss in value of his shares allegedly caused by the government negligent supervision of directors of a savings and loan association united states neustadt,d claim barred by misrepresentation exception where a purchaser relied on a faulty federal housing administration appraisal and consequently paid too much for a house see also jones united states,cir claim barred by misrepresentation exception where plaintiffs sold stock for too low a price in reliance upon the geographical survey inaccurate estimates concerning the oil productivity of certain land art,united states,claim barred by exception,where a contractor charged general services administration with tortious interference with prospective economic advantage for having constructively excluded plaintiff in violation of federal procurement regulations.significantly,in none of these cases did the courts suggest that the plaintiff claim was not for injury or loss of property.
but finding that injury or loss of property encompasses harm that is not physical does not suffice to support plaintiff claim.we must also determine whether her interest in being a beneficiary is sufficiently substantial to qualify as property for purposes of this torts action.admittedly,the technical meaning of property is more difficult to pin down than that of punitive damages,which was at issue in molzof.this is so because property is a term with a famously diffuse set of meanings across a range of areas of law.and,at least since the end of the nineteenth century,the conceptualistic approach to understanding its meaning has given way to a functionalist approach that designates something as property according to the context and purpose of the designation consequently,examining the use of the word property in the law of,say,taxation may be of little help if we are interested in the meaning of that term in a statute dealing with torts.segal rochelle,d observing,in interpreting the bankruptcy act,that i t is impossible to give any categorical definition to the word property,nor can we attach to it in certain relations the limitations which would be attached to it in others.whether an item is classed as property by the fifth amendment clause or for purposes of a state taxing statute can not decide hard cases under the bankruptcy act,whose own purposes must ultimately govern.internal quotation marks omitted.
in tort law,injury to property and loss of property have neither conventional nor ordinary,meanings.they are,instead,defined in terms of the kinds of harms to property for which a plaintiff may seek redress.as a result,in order to determine whether there exists an injury or loss of property,we must examine whether plaintiff claim seeks to vindicate an interest that is given protection by the general common law of torts.in other words,we must determine whether plaintiff interest is treated as property for torts purposes.for the reasons given below,we conclude that plaintiff claim satisfies this requirement.
the parties focus their energies on whether the interest of a beneficiary of a life insurance the analogous interest of a potential heir to a a mere expectancy or something more substantial.and,predictably,they take different sides on the matter.in fact,according to a leading insurance treatise,states take one of two views.a majority of jurisdictions hold that,where a right to change the beneficiary is reserved in a life insurance policy,the beneficiary has only a revocable expectancy contingent upon being the beneficiary at the time of the insured death.couch on insurance ed.collecting cases see also restatement third of property wills don.trans.comment d before the decedent death,a potential heir has no property interest but merely an expectancy an inchoate interest in the decedent intestate estate.a minority of jurisdictions,by contrast,holds that a beneficiary of a life insurance contract acquires not merely an expectancy in the anticipated benefits,but a qualified vested interest subject to be divested if a change in the beneficiary is made.couch also using the terminology qualified property right.
couch treatise,however,notes that there is little,if any,practical difference between the mere expectancy and qualified property right positions 
t o the extent that the concept of a qualified property right,or of a vested right subject to divestment,has been adopted to give the beneficiary standing to object to a change of beneficiary,the same result could be reached by simply interpreting expectancy in the property law sense,which enables an heir to challenge the validity of a disinheriting or excluding will even when the heir right to the property in question is merely an expectancy.
although the power to change beneficiaries is reserved,the beneficiary interest is sufficiently substantial that it may be recognized in law or equity.
in other words,the label given to a beneficiary interest seems not to be determinative of what recourse the law gives to a beneficiary to protect her status against the actions of third parties.indeed,the treatise goes on to note that,under the majority rule,where a change of beneficiary has been accomplished by fraud or undue influence practiced by the substituted beneficiary,the rights of the original beneficiary are not cut off by the attempted substitution.equity may entertain jurisdiction to set aside a change to a substituted beneficiary the original beneficiary may also sue the second beneficiary for damages id.id.a minority view holds that where the insured had the right to change beneficiaries,the original beneficiary has no vested right which gives him or her any standing to protest that the insured was fraudulently induced to exercise his or her right.
were this all we had to go on,we would be hard put to say which view should be deemed that taken by the ftca.if,however,we look to the most relevant area of law,torts,the matter becomes much easier.for,in tort law,we find that the interest of a beneficiary or heir is regularly afforded substantial protection for example,the restatement second of torts delineates a cause of action for the intentional interference with inheritance or gift as follows 
one who by fraud,duress,or other tortious means intentionally prevents another from receiving from a third person an inheritance or gift that he would otherwise have received is subject to liability to the other for loss of the inheritance or gift.
restatement second of torts see also id.comment b gift includes the designation of another as a beneficiary under an insurance policy.significantly,for the issue before us,whether the beneficiary interest is treated as a mere expectancy or as something more is not a threshold consideration going to whether a tort action lies.rather,the contingent nature of the interest goes instead to the existence of factual causation.accordingly,the beneficiary must provide proof amounting to a reasonable degree of certainty that the bequest or devise would have been in effect at the time of the death of the testator or that the gift would have been made inter vivos if there had been no such interference.id.comment d.
most states that have decided the issue in the inheritance context are in accord with the restatement approach.see diane klein,the disappointed heir revenge,southern style tortious interference with expectation of survey with analysis of state approaches in the fifth and eleventh circuits,baylor,reporting that approximately states have recognized tortious interference with expectation of inheritance,less than states have rejected it,and the rest have not decided see also sonja soehnel,annotation,liability in damages for interference with expected inheritance or gift,at,wl in those cases in which the courts have expressed a general view as to the propriety of a cause of action for damages for interference with a gift,which include a number of cases involving interference with an inheritance,the courts have generally stated that such a cause of action would lie.
the early,and hence leading,case of mitchell langley,in which the plaintiff sued her sister for writing letters to their ill that wrongfully induced him to cancel a benefit society certificate that had named all three sisters as equal beneficiaries,and for leading him to obtain a new certificate making the defendant the sole beneficiary,stated it thus 
the fact that this status has not ripened into a vested and irrevocable ownership of the beneficial interest,and that the member has a right to change it,does not authorize a third party to maliciously and fraudulently destroy the status and thus prevent the interest or expectancy of the beneficiary from ripening so that he will receive the fund.the reserved right of the member is one thing the malicious and fraudulent interposition of a third party to destroy the status is another.
further support for our conclusion that one interest as a beneficiary or heir is sufficient to support liability in tort can be found in the cases dealing with a lawyer liability to an intended heir for the negligent preparation of a will or other device.the privity requirement that once blocked from bringing professional negligence claims has eroded steadily since glanzer shepard,cardozo,so that,today,an overwhelming majority of jurisdictions recognizes an intended beneficiary cause of action for the negligent drawing of a will.see barcelo elliott,cornyn,dissenting collecting cases and reporting that only four states in addition to texas do not allow the intended beneficiary to sue.in these cases,the contingent nature of the plaintiff the fact that,had the plaintiff been properly named in the will,the testator,before her death,could have revoked the plaintiff status as an heir and designated given no special attention.
in view of the widespread recognition of liability for tortious interference with an inheritance and of a lawyer liability to an intended only now,but at the time congress used the phrase injury or loss of property in the conclude that the loss that plaintiff complains of would fall within the meaning of that phrase it would,that is,if the phrase is to be given a uniform,federal definition.what,however,if the phrase depends for its meaning on the law of the relevant state 
b.the approach 
we believe that the same result is reached if injury or loss of property is defined federally for purposes of the ftca,in reference to the law of connecticut,the relevant state in this case,rather than in reference to the general common law.
when a federal statute looks to state law to give meaning to one of its provisions,it does not do so indiscriminately.thus,in our case,given the many uses of the term property across the range of statutory and fields,it would not do to throw a dart at the connecticut case reports and use whatever definition of property is thereby encountered.rather,we must do what the supreme court did in de sylva ballentine,and focus on that aspect of state law that is most relevant to the purposes of the federal statute at issue.in de sylva,after deciding to refer to california law to determine whether illegitimate children are children under the copyright act and therefore empowered to renew their deceased parents copyrights,the court examined california inheritance statute,since t his is really a question of the descent of property.id.at.the court found it sufficient that the child was eligible for inheritance under this statute,regardless of the fact that the child was not legitimate for other purposes under california law.id.by doing this,the high court made clear that to decide the state meaning of a federally used phrase,federal courts should be guided by those state cases that deal with the circumstances akin to those at play in the federal statute.
the parties submissions,in the instant case,do not comport with the above principle.thus,the government offers ample connecticut case law to support the proposition that,under.stat,which deals with equitable distribution upon the dissolution of a marriage,a person interest as a potential heir is not subject to distribution because it is a mere expectancy.see,krause krause,interpreting a predecessor of and stating expectancy is the bare hope of succession to the property of another,such as may be entertained by an heir apparent.such a hope is inchoate.it has no attribute of property,and the interest to which it relates is at the time nonexistent and may never exist.internal quotation marks omitted rubin rubin,holding that an expected inheritance is not subject to distribution under.
for her part,plaintiff conversely and correctly points out that,in the life insurance context,connecticut adheres to the view that the interest of the beneficiary of a life insurance policy is more than a mere expectancy.see couch placing connecticut in the qualified property right or vested right subject to divestment category see also allen home bank,holding that a widow interest before her insured husband death was more than a mere expectancy under connecticut law where,as here,the right to change beneficiaries is reserved to the assured,the interest of the beneficiary is yet deemed to be vested,although qualified in that it is subject to be defeated by an exercise of the right reserved so long as the power of defeasance is not exercised,beneficiaries stand in the position of one having a title which the law will recognize,and for the protection of which they are entitled to the usual legal and equitable remedies.internal quotation marks omitted second alteration in original klebanoff mutual life ins.of new york,cir noting that,under connecticut law,a beneficiary stands in the position of one having a title which the law will recognize so long as the power of defeasance is not exercised.
the parties thus confront us with cases standing for seemingly conflicting propositions.in some contexts,an interest analogous to the one before us is termed a mere expectancy,while,in others,the interest is described as more than a mere expectancy and is the sort that commentators call a qualified property right,see couch.this situation,however,only underscores the fact that the appropriate place to find the meaning of injury or loss of property lies in connecticut tort law and not either in the law of marital dissolution or in that of insurance that is,the approach we took in the last section,when we were seeking a uniform federal meaning for the phrase,is also the one we must follow with regard to the law of the relevant state.
the question thus becomes whether a person interest as a named beneficiary or potential heir is a property interest that is protected by the tort law of connecticut we conclude that it is because connecticut follows the majority of jurisdictions both in recognizing the tort of interference with an inheritance,see benedict smith,and in recognizing an intended heir cause of action against a lawyer for the ne ligent drawing of a will,see stowe smith,krawczyk stingle,
it follows that,under either the uniform federal approach or the one,plaintiff claim satisfies the requirement of injury or loss of property.
ii.the ftca misrepresentation exception 
the government argues that plaintiff claim is barred by the ftca misrepresentation exception,which excludes a ny claim arising out of misrepresentation.h see also neustadt,at.both negligent and intentional misrepresentation claims are barred.we agree with the district court conclusion expressed in its first opinion in this case that this exception does not apply 
the government reasoning was rejected persuasively by the fifth circuit in metropolitan life ins.atkins,cir,the facts of which are strikingly similar to those of our case.in atkins,the plaintiffs the mother and sister of the deceased insured alleged that a federal personnel clerk negligently failed to secure and retain a signed copy of a feglia designation of beneficiary form,thus preventing the plaintiffs from becoming proper beneficiaries.the fifth circuit stated that the appropriate inquiry was whether the focal point of the plaintiffs claim was negligence in the communication of or the failure to communicate information or negligence in the performance of an operational task,with misrepresentation being merely collateral to such performance.see id.at.we conclude that,as in atkins,the focal point of plaintiff claim is that the postal employees failed to forward the designation of beneficiary form to the office of personnel management,an operational task.see also block,at.holding that the plaintiff good samaritan claim that defects in a house were partly attributable to the farmers home administration failure to inspect the house properly during construction did not fall within the misrepresentation exception,even though a different negligence theory focusing on the plaintiff reliance on the administration inspection reports might have fallen within that exception.accordingly,plaintiff claim is not barred by the misrepresentation exception.
iii.feglia preemption and estoppel 
the government makes several arguments related to feglia.we will address them collectively.first,the government contends that,in enacting feglia,a narrowly drawn,detailed statutory scheme for administering a federal life insurance program,congress clearly evinced its intent that feglia should be the sole and exclusive mechanism for determining and deciding all claims founded upon feglia.as a result,the government asserts,feglia remedies occupy the field and bar plaintiff from seeking relief under the ftca.see,united states demko,d holding that remedies for prisoners injured as a result of prison work are exclusive of ftca remedies.second,the government argues that,even if connecticut law permitted plaintiff claim,that law would be preempted by feglia.according to this contention,feglia overall structure and,particularly,its supercession manifests congress intent to preempt tort actions for recovery of lost feglia benefits.the government claims that a ny connecticut cause of action that gives legal effect to muratti alleged intent that plaintiff replace his nephew as the beneficiary would be inconsistent with feglia and would therefore be preempted.finally,the government asserts that e rroneous advice given by a government employee to a benefits claimant can not estop the government from denying benefits not otherwise permitted by law.this action must fail because feglia does not permit the payment of the feglia benefits to plaintiff.
although these arguments vary in gloss,they fail for essentially the same reasons.plaintiff tort claim does not seek to function as an alternative enforcement mechanism to obtain benefits under a feglia policy nor does the claim seek to give legal effect in any meaningful sense of that murratti intent to substitute plaintiff for his nephew as a beneficiary and,finally,plaintiff claim does not seek to estop the government from refusing to pay her feglia benefits as though she were a proper beneficiary quite simply,plaintiff is not asking to be paid benefits under a feglia policy she concedes that she is not a proper beneficiary of such benefits.indeed,that is precisely her point her allegation is that the postal employees negligence prevented her from becoming a proper designee under the policy.she is seeking to be compensated for that negligence.if a friend of murratti had undertaken to file his change of beneficiary form and then had failed to perform this duty,plaintiff could sue the friend on the same negligence theory assuming it was available under the applicable state law as that which she is now asserting against the government.under those circumstances,it would be clear that plaintiff would not be seeking to recover benefits under a feglia policy.and that would be so even if the policy were in some sense the measure of plaintiff damages.the same holds true for her suit against the allegedly negligent government employees for whose default the government chose to answer under the ftca.
for these reasons,and given the government failure to cite any authority that remotely supports its position,we reject the government arguments based on estoppel and feglia preemption.
conclusion 
we hold that the district court erred in determining that plaintiff claim is not one for injury or loss of property under the ftca.accordingly,we vacate its grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.in those proceedings,the district court will determine whether ftca exception applies will on its own or after certifying to the connecticut supreme plaintiff suit states a claim under connecticut law but will reject the government arguments based on the ftca misrepresentation exception,feglia preemption,and estoppel.
