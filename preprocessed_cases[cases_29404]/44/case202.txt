this case,involving the saga of an extremely frustrated boat owner,provides further support for the occasionally expressed view that the two happiest days of a boat owner life are the day he buys his boat and the day he sells it.appellees will have to remain satisfied with this allotment of joy,as we now reverse the district court and hold that there was insufficient proof of causation to support finding the appellant liable.
background and prior proceedings 
appellant marine world distributors,marine world does business in the sale,service and repair of marine vessels,with its principal offices in san juan,puerto rico.in,marine world offered for sale a previously owned foot bayliner ciera motorboat the boat.on march,carlos suárez,a certified marine surveyor,inspected and appraised the boat,noting that the engine could not be tested because no cooling water was available.nevertheless,suárez concluded that the boat was good for intended cruising around puerto rico and coastal waters.on august,appellee richard fairest knight fairest knight purchased the boat from marine world for fairest knight had no previous boating experience,and this was his first boat purchase.the boat was purchased as is,as expressly provided in the sales order,and fairest knight was aware that no express or implied warranty resulted from marine world sale of the boat.fairest knight insured the boat and contracted with a company that provides emergency towing assistance.
while operating the boat on january,approximately five months after he purchased it,fairest knight observed that the boat oil alarm was triggered and that oil had drained from the engine into the motor compartment.on january,marine world inspected the engine,and on february,it performed the work necessary to correct the oil leakage,as authorized by fairest knight.this incident would become one in a series of periodic breakdowns and other problems with the boat over the next several years.on each occasion,fairest knight would bring the boat back to marine world to be repaired,at which point marine world would inspect the problem,tender a diagnosis and perform the indicated repairs.marine world frequently performed sea trials to confirm that the problem had been corrected.no other person or entity serviced the boat during this time.over the years,the repairs performed by marine world included the following 
a cleaning the engine room and replacing the oil sender thread,oil sensor and various other corroded fittings february,
b performing a tune up,replacing the impeller,and sanding and painting pulleys june,
c replacing the sea water pump and serpentine belt august,
d removing the engine,disassembling the manifolds and elbows,starter,engine points,power steering pump,and pulleys,as well as cleaning and painting those parts and the oil pan,followed by a sea trial october,
e installing a missing power steering pump bracket november,
f reconnecting gps terminals,performing a tune up,and conducting a sea trial may,
g replacing the electric fuel pump,cleaning the carburetor,and conducting a sea trial may,
h conducting a sea trial june,
i removing and charging the batteries august,
j replacing the fuel tank vent august,
k conducting a sea trial august,
l replacing the fuel assembly august,
m overhauling the engine,replacing the manifolds and elbows,and conducting a sea trial november,
n replacing the exhaust flappers december,
o replacing the engine longblock february,
p replacing the impeller kit and flappers may.
despite these repairs,fairest knight experienced repeated malfunctions while using the boat,often involving complete engine failures that required towing the boat back to port.
the culmination of these incidents occurred on april,when fairest knight,together with his wife and two sons,also appellees,embarked on a trip to costa bonita,located on the island of culebra,approximately twenty miles east of puerto rico.after several engine failures,large amounts of smoke began to emanate from the engine compartment.fearing that the boat might ignite,sink explode,the family donned life jackets and prepared to abandon the vessel.fairest knight opened the engine compartment and the smoke began to dissipate.the boat was then towed back to puerto del rey in fajardo,where the boat has since remained,unused.between may and may,marine world performed repairs to the boat without charge to fairest knight,who was unaware that this work had been completed until after proceedings in this case had begun.
between august,when the boat was first delivered to fairest knight,until he last used it in april,fairest knight incurred expenses totaling for repairs,for towage and for wharfage and insurance.during this time,a period of months,the boat was undergoing service or was otherwise unuseable for days,or approximately months.
on august,fairest knight filed a complaint against marine world in the district court of puerto rico,raising claims under admiralty law and article of the puerto rico civil code.after a bench trial,the district court found that marine world breached its duty to a workmanlike performance upon which plaintiffs had a right to rely.the district court found that the repeated repairs which had to be done to the boat over an extended period of time was evidence of marine world breach,noting that there was a repeated failure to identify the source of the engine failure despite representations to plaintiffs that the boat was in a seaworthy condition,and that marine world was the only entity which serviced the boat during the period of time at issue.the district court rejected marine world theory that fairest knight failed to properly maintain the boat as not credible,given that the evidence at trial showed that fairest knight followed the recommendations made by marine world as to replacement of parts and the boat maintenance,and that,given how much time the boat spent in its shop,the onus was on marine world to notice and inform fairest knight of any need for maintenance.the district court awarded fairest knight for the faulty repairs for towage expenses for storage and insurance expenses up to june,and per day thereafter until the entry of judgment to fairest knight and his family for the negligent infliction of emotional distress and pain and suffering and costs and attorneys fees.marine world appealed on march.

was marine world liable 
marine world contends that the district court erred in finding it liable to appellees for having breached its duty to carry out the repairs in a workmanlike fashion.marine world insists that there was insufficient evidence that their repairs were the cause of the repeated problems experienced by appellees boat.fairest knight argues that a party does not need to act negligently to be in breach of the implied warranty,and that marine world inability to finally resolve the various problems plaguing his boat shows that it was in breach of its implied warranty of workmanlike performance.
c ontracts for repairs to a vessel come under the scope of admiralty jurisdiction.la esperanza de,pérez y cía.de,cir.this brings such a case under federal jurisdiction.see const.art.iii.admiralty jurisdiction brings with it a body of federal jurisprudence,largely uncodified,known as maritime law.ballard shipping beach shellfish,cir.in the absence of a relevant statute,the norms of the general maritime law,an amalgam of traditional rules,modifications of those rules,and newly created rules,governs actions in admiralty.la esperanza,at quoting east river transamerica delaval.although state law may supplement federal maritime law when the latter is silent or where a local matter is at issue,it may not be applied where it would conflict with a federal maritime law.floyd lykes,cir.
the first circuit has acknowledged three potential sources of liability under federal maritime law for a ship repairer infelicitous work.these are liability via expressly assumed contractual obligations,the maritime tort of negligence,and the implied warranty of workmanlike performance that attaches to admiralty contracts under the rule of ryan stevedoring pan atlantic.la esperanza,at.the theory of liability relevant to this appeal is the latter,the implied warranty of workmanlike performance.
although originating in disputes involving the indemnification of shipowners,we recognized in la esperanza that liability under the implied warranty of workmanlike performance extends to disputes between shipowners and shipyards.in la esperanza,a shipowner sued a shipyard for negligently damaging the boat it had been hired to repair.we affirmed the district court finding that the shipyard was liable for the negligence of its repairs,noting that the shipyard failure to properly complete the requisite repairs constituted a breach of an express and implied contractual obligation,particularly in view of the fact that evidence in the record substantiates that similarly situated ship repairers could have completed the repairs correctly.id.at 
we additionally noted that although the implied warranty of workmanlike performance does not impose a strict liability regime on ship repairers,and instead parallels a negligence standard,nevertheless,a shipowner could recover for a breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike service even when such performance was done without negligence.id.at quoting ss amazonia export marine carpenters,cir see also feliciano compañía transatlántica española,cir noting that the implied warranty cause of action acknowledged in ryan was based neither on negligence or unseaworthiness,but is strictly contractual in nature,existing independently of tort.however,la esperanza did not reduce or eliminate a plaintiff burden of proving that the defendant conduct caused his injury.see ss amazonia,at stating that recovery under a breach of an implied warranty of workmanlike performance claim requires showing that the work performed caused the damage claimed.
for starters,although recovery for breach of implied warranty does not invariably require proof of negligence,the implied warranty does not go so far as to impos e strict liability.la esperanza,at.but in this regard,it is surely notable that even claims of unseaworthiness,which do impose a strict liability regime upon shipowners,napier deesie,cir,require the plaintiff to show that the defendant conduct was the proximate cause of his injury.in other words,even the absolute duty of shipowners to furnish a seaworthy ship is limited to those injuries caused by any defect in a vessel or its appurtenant appliances or equipment.id.at emphasis added see also poulis minott smith,cir ferrara fishing,cir.because la esperanza acknowledged liability under a theory of a breach of an implied warranty to be more limited than strict liability,and because strict liability claims in the form of claims of unseaworthiness themselves require proof of causation,it stands to reason that la esperanza did not absolve parties claiming breach of an implied warranty of workmanlike service from proving that the alleged breach caused their injury.causation must be established by a preponderance of the evidence.see marquette trans.mach,cir 
moreover,although in la esperanza we stated that h ere,one witnesses a ship that came in for repairs under her own power but somewhere,somehow,something went wrong,at,a substantial portion of the opinion in la esperanza was in fact devoted to explaining how the shipyard performance its unsuited method of removing the existing hull plates,its equally unsuited method of patching the holes it thereby created,and the careless way in which the boat was subsequently stored had caused significant damage to the ship hull,electrical system,upper deck and carpeting.see la esperanza,at.the shipyard also never fully completed the repairs and,seeking to extricate itself from a predicament of its own making told the shipowner,essentially,that it had a problem on its hands,and maybe it should consider hiring a special welding consultant.id.at.rather than mere speculation,in other words,there was quite substantial evidence that the shipyard conduct had caused the damage to the plaintiff vessel.
by the same token,our observation that where a shipyard represents itself as being a competent shipyard skilled in doing the type of work requested by the shipowner,then the latter has a right to rely on the shipyard expertise and may expect a stable seaworthy vessel upon completion of the repairs,regardless of the condition of the boat prior to repairs,la esperanza,at internal quotation marks omitted,should not be read as appellees appear to suggest to hold that once a shipyard has undertaken to repair a boat,any subsequent breakdowns or problems may,without more,be presumed to have been caused by the shipyard.the facts in la esperanza clearly indicated that it was the shipyard inability unwillingness to properly complete the work it had specifically contracted to do that had caused the damage to the ship,which bolstered the finding of liability.
in light of these observations,the fact that neither the appellees nor the district court were able to provide an explanation as to how the chronic problems with the boat were the result of marine world acts or omissions takes on dispositive salience in supporting its liability determination,the district court stated that 
e vidence of the breach of marine world are the repeated repairs which had to be done to the boat over an extended period of time there was a repeated failure to identify the source of the engine failure marine world was the only entity which serviced the boat during the period of time at issue the best evidence that the repairs to the boat by marine world were faulty are the invoices which show the boat could not be used for its intended use over extended periods of time because the boat was being repaired for multiple malfunctions.
we can not agree.the fact that multiple repairs were required,without more,can not be taken to establish that it was marine world unworkmanlike conduct that brought about the need for the repairs.in other words,if the hypothesis is that marine world unworkmanlike performance caused the need for the repeated repairs,then the fact that the repairs were required can not itself be adduced as evidence supporting that hypothesis it is what needs explaining,and so can not,on pain of circularity,be what does the explaining from what we are able to ascertain in the record,marine world was generally able to diagnose and repair each problem as it arose fairest knight conceded at trial that he had no evidence of performance by marine world.no evidence was introduced that marine world employed improper repair procedures or used parts,nor is there any evidence that marine world at any point the specific problem reported by fairest knight.there is no evidence that it was poor work by marine world rather than poor design,poor manufacture,poor maintenance or abuse by the boat previous owner,or something else including the appellee admitted inexperience with boat ownership that caused the boat various problems.we have no basis on which to even speculate as to whether the same series of problems would have arisen had fairest knight brought the boat to a different shipyard for repairs.see la esperanza,at.
although circumstantial evidence may in some cases be used to establish causation,the circumstances must nevertheless allow for a strong inference of causation.see marquette,at.exclusivity of control or possession is an important factor in supporting this inference.id.at ins.of,at where defendant marina did not have exclusive possession of the boat,no presumption of fault would apply.in this case,we note that possession of the boat alternated between fairest knight and marine world during the relevant time period,and that fair
