james fiori won a jury verdict against truck drivers local local or the union,a massachusetts branch of the international brotherhood of teamsters teamsters.fiori was awarded damages on two different claims but only the libel award,in the amount of as reduced by the judge is challenged by the union on this appeal.the background events are largely undisputed.
on may,while working for tresca brothers sand and gravel tresca,fiori injured his back while shoveling gravel and began receiving workers compensation of.a few days later,local began a strike against tresca that would last three years.union member since in the strike by walking the picket lines three days a week for all three years.
local paid weekly strike benefits to union workers participating in a strike,ranging from at the beginning of the strike to by the end.fiori asked ernie tusino,local principal officer of local,who had authority to speak for the he was allowed to receive these strike benefits in addition to workers compensation.tusino said he could.during the strike,fiori collected a total of in strike benefits and more than in workers compensation payments.
the strike ended in,and fiori returned to work as a truck driver for other companies.in fiori ran for of local,and won.soon after fiori took office a power struggle began within both local and its parent teamsters union.both fiori and ernie tusino supported james hoffa,the son of former teamsters president jimmy hoffa,in the teamsters presidential election.the other officers of local supported the incumbent,ron carey.
in spring the midst of the national president carey removed tusino from his position in local,and replaced him with richard foley.foley and other local officers began an investigation into fiori receiving both workers compensation and strike benefits at the same time during the tresca strike several years before.foley exchanged letters with teamsters officials,who opined that violated union rules.
in february,foley filed internal union charges against fiori,and in march,local executive board found fiori guilty of and removed him as vice president.fiori was ordered to repay the strike benefits he refused and was suspended from union membership on july.in the same month foley sent all the union members a letter the foley letter,written on official local stationary,that underlies this appeal 
in substance,the foley letter informed all union members that fiori had improperly collected strike benefits and workers compensation at the same time.the letter is factual in tone it claims to present nothing but the undisputed facts it states that fiori had improperly received and it emphasizes that this purloined sum was your dues money.emphasis in original.this letter was sent in july,four months before the local election in which fiori ran for and lost the position of business agent.
fiori filed unsuccessful protests within the union challenging the executive board action,and then a complaint with the national labor relations board.the nlrb heard evidence and concluded that local charges against fiori were politically motivated retaliation the charges were not brought until three years after fiori stopped receiving benefits and began soon after he openly supported an opposition candidate.local was found to have committed an unfair labor practice,and the union was ordered to revoke its demand for repayment of strike benefits.
the nlrb decision did not issue until august.in the meantime,the local elections had been held and fiori had been defeated by eight votes for the position of business agent.fiori filed the present action against local in federal district court.only two claims survived the union motions to dismiss and for summary judgment fiori claims that he had been libeled under massachusetts law and that his removal from office constituted retaliation in violation of the reporting and disclosure act,a.see generally linn united plant guard workers,local,d.
the jury found for fiori on both counts.it awarded him in compensatory damages on his libel claim and in compensatory and punitive damages on his retaliation claim.on motions,the district judge reduced both awards through remittitur the libel award was reduced to because the judge concluded that the jury had not properly taken into account fiori duty to mitigate damages.
local now appeals,limiting itself to several different attacks on the libel award,all of which concede that the foley letter was libelous.local first argues that there was insufficient evidence that the libel harmed fiori in any way,so the claim should never have gone to the jury.there would be enough evidence for an award based on mental suffering even if fiori loss of the election for business agent were disregarded but,as we will see,the real issue turns out to be the election.
under massachusetts law,allowable defamation damages include special damages proximately caused economic also in the case of libel any harm to reputation and mental suffering.shafir steele,ravnikar bogojavlensky.the emotional distress need be no more than outrage and anger upon seeing the libelous statements,shafir,at,since mental distress is the natural result of libel,id.citing markham russell.
fiori testified that he felt humiliated when he saw the foley letter,said that he had to deal with a lot of accusations from other union members,and explained that there not enough hours in the day to explain to the people that do know you that it inaccurate,it not true,and that i did do anything wrong.he testified about his embarrassment and how he did sleep good after the accusations.
this mental distress is sufficient to allow the libel claim to go to the jury.see shafir,at.the fact that fiori admitted he had no physical symptoms besides minor sleep loss,sought no medical attention and took no medicine might limit the award that could reasonably be allowed for mental suffering.however,in this case mental suffering may be beside the point as the district judge concluded in his decision granting remittitur,the award was pretty clearly premised on an award of economic damages.
tusino had testified over objection that the business agent job paid about.proof of mental anguish was modest.local argues on appeal,t he only explanation for the jury award of on the libel claim is that the jury drew an impermissible inference that the plaintiff lost an election for a term as business agent,at per year.we will assume arguendo that this inference was drawn by the jury whether it was permissible is the next question.
the union presents its claim of error under two heads first,that the evidence did not permit a rational jury to conclude that the libel caused fiori election loss,and second,that the judge should have granted the union request for an instruction forbidding the jury to consider the election loss as a basis for economic damages.the issue can largely,although not entirely,be dealt with under the first heading,that is,as a claim of jury error.
ordinarily,a jury verdict on an issue of causation in,whether the libel likely caused the election reviewed with great deference,the court asking whether any rational jury could so find.see wortley camplin,cir.but out of concern that libel judgments constrain free speech,both federal and massachusetts courts tend to be somewhat more searching in their review of defamation awards we begin by considering the basis for the jury verdict and then return to the first amendment concerns.
the issue is certainly close.the union argument is terse its brief relies primarily on one decision,kirk transport workers union,and one central point the union claims that fiori failed to offer any evidence of the election,who voted,the number of votes,the voter motives,the possibility of changing votes,thus,says the union,the record is void of evidence of harm.we begin with the evidence and then address precedent.
what the jury learned was that several months before fiori ran for business agent,foley had sent all union members a letter on official stationary informing them that fiori had improperly collected strike benefits and workers compensation,depleting the members dues money by over.the union does no
