this case asks us to decide whether the united states has waived its sovereign immunity for a suit by a private owner to recover monetary damages for its cleanup of past oil contamination on property that was formerly a united states navy base.finding that the united states has not waived its sovereign immunity,we affirm.
background 
in,the united states acquired acres of land located in quincy,massachusetts,including the subject of this litigation,a acre parcel of land referred to by the parties as lot.from to,the united states used the acre parcel,including lot,for various defense purposes,including as a naval air station.in conjunction with the property operation,the united states government made various improvements to the property,including construction of an airplane hangar,an airplane parking lot,and the installation of a gallon underground storage tank to hold fuel oil for the hangar heating system 
in,the navy deactivated and closed the base,and subsequently offered the property for sale.on december,the acre parcel,including lot,was transferred to boston edison company by deed without any covenants or warranties whatsoever,either express or implied.during boston edison ownership of the property,the airplane hangar was removed,and approximately two to three feet of fill was placed on lot,covering the hangar concrete foundation and the surrounding asphalt airplane parking area.
at some time in,peter gordon,looking for a potential site for the construction of a nursing home,began negotiating for the purchase of a parcel that included lot as part of a due diligence inspection,an environmental site assessment of the property was prepared.because of the property prior use,the site assessment noted that there could be underground storage tanks on the property,and advised that a geophysical survey be conducted to determine whether any underground storage tanks were present.gordon decided not to further investigate the matter,and marina bay development group,llc mbdg,a gordon entity not a party to this appeal,purchased the parcel on october,pursuant to a quitclaim deed which provided that the property was being transferred as is,where is,and with all faults.
mbdg then subdivided the parcel into three lots one of which is lot,and,in december,transferred lot to appellant marina bay after the transfer,marina bay engaged an environmental consulting firm to conduct an environmental investigation.their work detected elevated levels of petroleum hydrocarbons in the soil.
a second environmental consulting firm conducted further investigation,and located a corroded gallon underground storage tank and an intact gallon underground storage tank containing fuel fuel.marina bay had the second firm remove the two underground tanks and excavate the contaminated soil around the corroded tank.the of the site was completed on december.
during the time between the first environmental firm detection of the contamination,and the second firm removal of the contamination,problems arose with marina bay efforts to secure financing for the construction of a nursing home on lot largely as the result of the property being located on a flood plain.apparently frustrated with the financing problems,gordon decided to sell lot.
on september,appellant marina bay sold lot to alliance and,as part of the transaction,appellant neponset agreed to transfer to alliance its nursing home business.alliance also paid marina bay for expenses and agreed to pay appellant gordon development to supervise and oversee the construction of a nursing home on lot for alliance.a nursing home was then constructed on lot.
on august,appellants marina bay and neponset brought this action against the united states in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts seeking recovery of approximately in cleanup costs and million for what it claimed to be increased construction and finance costs associated with the delay experienced as a result of the contamination discovered on the site.the appellants raised four claims in their complaint counts i and ii alleged that the united states was liable for costs under massachusetts general laws chapter chapter,sections a and a,implicitly claiming that the united states had waived its sovereign immunity for such liability under section a of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra,a count iii alleged that the united states was liable for appellants costs under chapter,claiming that the united states had waived its sovereign immunity for such liability under the federal tort claims act ftca,b,and count iv alleged a common law negligence claim,implicitly asserted through the ftca.
the united states filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that neither the rcra nor the ftca waived its sovereign immunity for private money damages arising from the alleged past contamination.the united states also argued that liability for the ftca claims contained in counts iii and iv were barred by the discretionary function and misrepresentation exceptions of the ftca on july,the district court granted the united states motion in part,dismissing counts i and ii,finding that the rcra did not waive the united states sovereign immunity from suit for private money damages.the district court denied the united states motion as to counts iii and iv,finding that the united states would not enjoy sovereign immunity if the plaintiffs proved,as they alleged in their complaint,that the united states was negligent or wrongful in its contamination of lot,and that the discretionary function and misrepresentation exceptions contained in the ftca did not bar the plaintiffs claims.
at the close of discovery,the united states filed a motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs claims for consequential damages,that is,the claims alleging that the united states was liable for increased construction and financing costs,arguing that the plaintiffs had not incurred any such costs the court granted the united states motion for summary judgment just prior to the commencement of trial.
trial then commenced on plaintiffs two ftca claims,counts iii and iv,now seeking recovery only for plaintiffs actual costs.on the fifth day of trial,plaintiffs rested their with the exception of one expert witness named that witness was unavailable.the united states filed a motion for judgment on partial findings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c,arguing that the ftca only waives sovereign immunity for negligent or wrongful conduct by a federal fact that the united states argued the plaintiffs had failed to prove,could not prove with the testimony of rogers,and could not establish through chapter causation requirement.as a result of scheduling conflicts,the court adjourned the trial and took the government motion under advisement.on may,the district court granted the united states motion and entered judgment for the united states stating that the plaintiffs appear to concede that they have not proven negligence and finding that w here there has been no showing of negligence or other tortious conduct,the ftca does not waive sovereign immunity for a violation of chapter.the plaintiffs filed this timely appeal.
ii.analysis 
claim that the united states is liable under chapter,section,and common law negligence,for appellants costs associated with the oil contamination.the united states,however,enjoys sovereign immunity from such a suit absent a waiver that must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text.lane pena,d.a waiver will not be implied,and a waiver of the government sovereign immunity will be strictly construed,in terms of its scope,in favor of the sovereign.id.thus,t o sustain a claim that the united states is liable for awards of monetary damages,the waiver of sovereign immunity must extend unambiguously to such monetary claims.id.and,a statute legislative history can not supply a waiver that does not appear clearly in any statutory text.id.
here,the appellants argue that two statutory provisions,one contained in the rcra,and the other contained in the ftca,do waive the united states sovereign immunity and thus the united states can be held liable for the costs allegedly incurred by appe
