josé appeals from the district court dismissal of his negligence suit for lack of jurisdiction.invokes the federal courts diversity jurisdiction,arguing that because he was domiciled in texas and the defendants were domiciled in puerto rico at the time the suit was filed,there was complete diversity.the district court found,instead,that both and the defendants were domiciled in puerto rico and dismissed the case.we conclude otherwise,that had not abandoned his texas domicile while receiving medical care in puerto rico,and,that in any event,he had reinstated his texas domicile before suit was filed.we reverse and remand.
on may,filed a complaint in the puerto rico federal district court against the municipality of caguas municipality,consolidated waste service corporation conwaste,and,conwaste insurance provider.the issue in this case is where was domiciled as of may.

in the complaint,stated that because he was domiciled in texas and each of the defendants was domiciled in puerto rico,the district court had diversity jurisdiction over his tort claims.see a.
each of the defendants filed an answer denying jurisdiction.conwaste and filed a complaint against eddie jiménez cosmo cafeteria la terraza de eddie cafeteria la terraza de eddie claiming that it was responsible for the waste deposited in the dumpster and for maintaining the area around the dumpster.between the defendants were also filed that are not relevant to this appeal.the district court held a status conference on november,at which the court jurisdiction was challenged.the parties suggested that the issue may be ruled on without an evidentiary hearing,and so the court ordered the parties to file simultaneous briefs and supporting documents on the issue.
on january,the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.see fed.civ.b.on the same day,made a filing in support of diversity jurisdiction on march,the defendants filed a motion to strike sixteen of the documents appended to filing.the motion to strike was denied on june.
the dispute between the parties boils down to whether on may,the date the complaint was filed,was domiciled in texas,creating complete diversity and affording the federal district court jurisdiction,or puerto rico,defeating complete diversity and depriving the federal district court of jurisdiction.
the facts relevant to domicile,which are largely undisputed,are as follows.was born in río piedras,puerto rico,in.in the late,after service with the army reserve in puerto rico and the puerto rico national guard,he moved to florida to work as a professional truck driver.after a few years as a commercial dump truck driver in florida,he moved back to puerto rico,bringing his dump truck with him.
in,he moved to arkansas and obtained an arkansas commercial driver license.from to,he worked as an interstate truck driver based in arkansas.in,he purchased his first truck,a freightliner condo.
in,left his job in arkansas,moved to laredo,texas,and began working for a trucking company called landstar.while working for landstar,he traded in his semitrailer truck for a freightliner condo.
later that year,left landstar,returned his second truck,and relocated to puerto rico to help his father,who had fallen ill,with his asphalt business.in,after his father health improved,he returned to texas to continue his truck driving career and purchased,with the help of a loan from first national bank in laredo,a third truck,a freightliner condo.from to,based out of laredo,worked for a trucking company called land carrier.he stated that because he was a truck driver,he would frequently stay in laredo at a hotel,at the trucking company terminal,or in a small utility apartment,and while on the road he often lived out of his truck.in,he obtained a texas class a commercial driver license.
on july,while in puerto rico to marry his second wife,maría teresa báez,suffered the injury giving rise to the instant lawsuit.he remained bedridden in puerto rico until he was able to return to texas.after the accident,he obtained medical coverage through puerto rico government health plan,then known as reforma.when applying for benefits,provided báez address in caguas,puerto rico.he explained that he gave báez address because that was where he was staying while recovering.he and báez divorced two years later in september of.
returned to texas in late after recuperating from his accident.the back pain caused by his accident prevented him from completing his truck routes with land carrier on schedule,so he eventually left land carrier and began working for another trucking company called hotfoot logistics,which had a terminal in laredo.his time at hotfoot logistics was short lived after three months,he found that his persistent back pain prevented him from continuing driving.
in september,about a month after he left hotfoot logistics,and still based out of laredo,he started working for warren transport.on a personnel form that filled out for warren transport titled warren transport wants to get to know you he wrote caguas,puerto rico in the blank space following i make my home in.he later explained that he had been directed by warren transport to do so.the form also asked him to provide the names of his family members as well as a list of interests and hobbies.during his deposition,stated that a dispatcher had told him that the purpose of the form was to list the names of individuals who would be authorized to ride along with him in his truck and so he listed caguas because that is where báez,to whom he was still married at that point,lived.according to,warren transport management already knew that he lived in laredo.on other warren transport forms,he listed his address as a box in laredo.
for the tax years to,filed all of his federal tax returns using his texas address.from to,he never filed state personal income tax returns in puerto rico.
starting in,began traveling back to puerto rico for longer visits to receive physical therapy,staying at báez residence in caguas.in september,he applied for and received a disability parking permit in puerto rico.in the application for the permit,he stated that his address was in puerto rico.in january,he obtained a puerto rico driver license,which also listed his address as being in caguas.he explained that the address he provided was báez,even though by that point they had been divorced for several months.
on may,suffered a bout of paralyzing back pain that left him immobile on the ground of a parking lot in laredo.a week later,he resigned from warren transport,sold his truck,threw away everything he had in the truck including clothes and documents,and returned to puerto rico to recover at his parents house in canóvanas.in early,he filed a merchant registry certificate with the puerto rico department of treasury,listing his address as being in caguas.he also submitted an application to the medicaid program of the puerto rico department of health.in february,his texas commercial driver license expired.
returned to laredo at the end of april.he stayed with a friend and began looking for work as an interstate trucker.he also arranged to attend,in texas,medical examinations for a social security disability benefits application that he had submitted before leaving for puerto rico.an official record from the texas department of public safety indicates that a medical certificate was issued to on may,as part of his application to renew his texas commercial driver license.says that a renewed texas commercial driver license was issued to him on the same day.this was three days before the complaint was filed.
on may,the day the instant lawsuit was filed in federal district court in puerto rico,says that he was physically present in laredo,texas organizing his personal and professional affairs to continue residing and working there as he had done the previous nine years since approximately.
in july,leased an apartment in laredo.around the same time,he set up electric and cable services with local texas providers.according to,once he moved into his apartment,he notified the texas department of public safety of his new address,and on september,a new texas commercial driver license was issued to him listing the new address.he says that the texas department of public safety took and kept the license that had been issued to him on may.
found a job as a contract driver for a company operating out of laredo in july,but because of his back pain he was only able to complete a handful of trips by early.in september,he filled out a texas voter registration application,and in november he voted in texas.he also purchased a chrysler pt cruiser in laredo and obtained a texas license plate and disability parking placard.
on march,received a notice of decision from the social security administration at his postal address in laredo informing him that he had been found completely disabled as a result of the paralyzing incident in may,and soon after he began receiving monthly disability payments.in july,unable to work and declared disabled by the social security administration,he returned to puerto rico.he rented an apartment in puerto rico in december and as of january had not returned to texas.
on june,the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss for lack of diversity jurisdiction,finding that was domiciled in puerto rico on the date that his case was filed.dávila municipality of caguas,wl,at june.the court found that while was not a resident of puerto rico from the early until around,after his injury he reestablished domicile in puerto rico because he refocused his life to obtain medical treatment in puerto rico.id.at.the district court noted that by had sold his freightliner condo truck,thr own away everything he owned,traveled to puerto rico,let his texas commercial driver license expire,and severed relevant links to texas,making puerto rico his home.id.the court also placed particular emphasis on forms that submitted to several entities between and in which he listed his residence as puerto rico.id.at.according to the district court,though he may have sought to reestablish links with texas in july lease agreement september car purchase,and consumer account application with wells fargo bank and october voting registration certificate,these events all occurred after may and therefore could not support a finding that he had abandoned his domicile in puerto rico and established a new domicile in texas before the filing of the instant lawsuit.id.
this appeal followed.
though the issue of domicile is a mixed question of law and fact,we nevertheless review the district court determination of the plaintiff domicile for clear error.see sánchez,cir.pavía,cir.valentin hosp.bella vista,cir.this standard applies where,as here,the district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing but instead relied on a paper record.see hawes club ecuestre el comandante,cir.however,where the district court result is based entirely on documentary evidence,the presumption that the court reached a correct result is somewhat lessened relative to findings based on oral testimony,at citing bose consumers union of,noting that the presumption of correctness that attaches to factual findings of the district court has lesser force where those findings are based on documentary evidence as opposed to oral testimony.
federal courts have jurisdiction over cases in which the amount in controversy exceeds and where the parties are citizens of different states.a.diversity must be complete the presence of but one nondiverse party divests the district court of original jurisdiction over the entire action.in re olympic mills,cir.citing strawbridge curtiss,cranch.for purposes of diversity,a person is a citizen of the state in which he is domiciled,at.a person domicile is the place where he has his true,fixed home and principal establishment,and to which,whenever he is absent,he has the intention of returning,cir.quoting wright,miller cooper,federal practice procedure,at ed.proving domicile requires two showings physical presence in a place,and the intent to make that place one home.valentin,at.necessarily then,domicile and residence are not the same thing.after it is established,a domicile persists until a new one is acquired.id.
once challenged,the party invoking diversity jurisdiction must prove domicile by a preponderance of the evidence.garcía pérez santaella,cir.there are a variety of factors that are relevant to determining a party domicile current residence voting registration and voting practices location of personal and real property location of brokerage and bank accounts membership in unions,fraternal organizations,churches,clubs and other associations place of employment or business driver license and other automobile registration and payment of taxes.id.at alteration in original quoting wright,supra.no single factor is dispositive,and the analysis focuses not simply on the number of contacts with the purported domicile,but also on their substantive nature.id.
we believe that the district court committed clear error.in a nutshell,the evidence establishes that was domiciled in texas before his accident,that his stays in puerto rico while obtaining medical care needed in the aftermath of the accident were insufficient to effect a change of domicile from texas to puerto rico,and that accordingly he was domiciled in texas on the date his case was filed.
no one seriously disputes that was domiciled in texas before his accident.he first moved to laredo,texas,in and began working for landstar.though he left texas in late to go to puerto rico,it is undisputed that the purpose of this relocation was to help his sick father with his business.there is nothing to suggest that this move was intended to be permanent.in fact,once his father health improved in,returned to laredo.he then obtained a loan from the first national bank in laredo to purchase a freightliner condo truck,and he spent the next two and a half years working out of laredo for a trucking company called land carrier.in,he obtained a texas class a commercial driver license.laredo was his base of operations during his tenure at land carrier.moreover,for tax years to,he filed all of his federal tax returns using his texas address.as of the date of his accident,july,was clearly domiciled in texas.
where the district court erred was in concluding that had changed his domicile from texas to puerto rico after his accident,as of the time he filed suit in puerto rico.
the bulk of the district court justification for finding that was domiciled in puerto rico is based on representations that made about his residence in various forms including an application to participate in puerto rico reforma health plan an application for medicaid benefits,an application for a disability parking permit,a form submitted to the puerto rico department of treasury,and a form submitted to warren transport.he also obtained a puerto rico driver license that listed an address in caguas.the district court reasoned that s trong evidence of domicile is found in representations a party has made on reports and documents submitted to third parties,and,citing a treatise,that a lthough residence alone is not the equivalent of domicile,the place of residence is prima facie evidence of a party domicile.dávila,wl,at.
while the district court was certainly correct that residence is relevant to the question of domicile and that representations of one residence in certain instances are entitled to significant weight,lundquist precision valley aviation,cir.per curiam,the court erred by placing altogether too much emphasis on this factor in light of the circumstances.when considered in the context of reason for being in puerto rico in the first place medical treatment these representations about his residence,many tied to getting such treatment,do not themselves result in a change in domicile.see garcía pérez,at emphasizing that the court must consider the substantive nature of the party contacts with the state.
shuttled back and forth between texas and puerto rico between and so that he could obtain medical care and assistance from his family as he attempted to recover from the injuries from his fall.the district court concluded that severed relevant links to texas.dávila,wl,at.but the record shows that he never stopped returning to texas to work and that he continued to file his federal taxes from texas.he never filed tax returns in puerto rico.when he was in puerto rico,he stayed with his parents or with his,báez.after his last stay in puerto rico from may to april,he returned to texas where he renewed his texas commercial driver license,leased an apartment in laredo,reactivated his bank accounts at wells fargo,and registered to vote in texas.while several of these actions occurred after the filing of the lawsuit,subsequent events may bear on the sincerity of a professed intention to remain.garcía pérez,at.in this case,the actions that took in texas after filing his lawsuit are strong evidence that he never harbored an intention to change his domicile to puerto rico.
to be sure,connections to texas were weakest in the period between the paralyzing incident in may and his return to texas in april.at the same time,though,his connections to puerto rico during this period were not meaningfully stronger than they were before the may incident.the district court placed substantial weight on representations about his residency in puerto rico between and.many of these representations were made before the may incident,when he maintained stronger ties to texas.after the may incident,however,he continued to make the same types of representations.so even if his ties to texas were weaker after the may incident,his later,equivalent representations about his residency in puerto rico are insufficient to show that he thereafter intended to change his domicile.
jurisdictionally speaking,residency and citizenship are not interchangeable.valentin,at.c itizenship or domicile,not residence,is the basis of subject matter jurisdiction.bank one,montle,cir.see also lundquist,at t he relevant standard is citizenship,domicile,not mere residence.indeed,w hile a person may have more than one residence,he can only have one domicile.bank one,at.this is why residence is not dispositive of the domicile inquiry but rather one of many factors that the federal courts consider when determining a party domicile.see garcía pérez,at.given the circumstances of ongoing medical treatment in puerto rico,the unremarkable fact that he claimed a residence in puerto rico and listed it on a variety of forms,several of which pertain directly to his medical condition and treatment,is weak evidence of an intent to remain in puerto rico indefinitely and give up his texas domicile,particularly in light of his continued ties to texas while he was recovering in puerto rico.
our conclusion here is guided by our prior decision in valentin.there,the plaintiff was a resident of puerto rico when she began experiencing severe abdominal pain.at.complications ensued as a result of surgery she received in puerto rico,and so she moved to florida to seek more sophisticated medical care.id.while there,she stayed with her sister and.id.she did not terminate her employment in puerto rico and instead used sick time donated to her by her coworkers and,when that ran out,unpaid leave.id.at.she also left most of her belongings in puerto rico,kept her car registered there,and maintained a puerto rico bank account.id.at.on the other hand,she obtained a florida driver license and a charge card from a florida bank,and she even took a florida nurse licensing exam and applied for nursing jobs.id.at.on appeal,we affirmed the district court determination that despite her contacts with florida,the plaintiff remained a domiciliary of puerto rico.id.at.we held that bearing in mind that the plaintiffs sic primary purpose in going to florida in april of to secure advanced medical treatment for the complications arising out of her surgery was fully consistent with transient status as opposed to outright relocation,we can not say that the district court clearly erred in concluding that the plaintiff had not become a florida citizen.id.
other cases from this circuit reinforce the importance of context in cases involving individuals who relocate for periods of time to a new jurisdiction for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.in garcía pérez,two parents brought a medical malpractice suit against a doctor and a hospital in puerto rico after three of their four quadruplets died around the time of their birth and the fourth suffered from a series of complications.at.the family relocated to florida to obtain medical care for the surviving daughter.id.we reversed the district court finding that the plaintiffs remained domiciled in puerto rico,concluding instead that they had established a new domicile in florida.id.at.this finding,however,was based on much more than mere residence in florida.the parents maintained much stronger ties to florida than did to puerto rico.we noted that the parents had registered to vote in florida,had acquired florida driver licenses,had sold their car in puerto rico and purchased two new cars in florida,had rented out,but not sold,their house in puerto rico,and had opened a miami bank account.moreover,the father had studied for and passed the florida bar exam and expressed a clear intention of practicing law in florida.id.at.
in hawes,a husband and wife filed a tort claim against various defendants after the husband was rendered a quadriplegic when a horse jumped over a fence at a horse show the couple was attending and struck the husband back with its front legs.at.at the time of the show,the pair lived in puerto rico,but they soon decided to move to new york so that the husband could seek treatment at a rehabilitation center there.id.at.the couple took their personal belongings to new york,leaving their furniture in puerto rico with a friend.id.the wife closed her puerto rico bank accounts and opened a new one in new york.id.she also obtained a residence in new york.id.the couple younger daughter moved with them to new york and enrolled in school there,but the older one,an eighteen year old,stayed in puerto rico.id.while the wife did not quit her job,she remained on leave without pay so that she could keep her accumulated retirement benefits.id.eventually,though,she obtained employment in the suburbs of new york and then employment in manhattan.id.at.she also filed federal income taxes from new york after the commencement of the tort action.id.at.on these facts,which again implicated much more than just residence,the court concluded that the plaintiffs clearly intended to move to new york city for as long as the husband physical condition required,and that they made a deliberate decision to go to new york city for an indefinite period of time.id.at.
because valentin,garcía pérez,and hawes,like the case at hand,were before this court on clear error review,we can not and do not suggest that their outcomes are strictly determinative of this case.but they do illustrate the need to look beyond the facts regarding residence when faced with a party who relocates to a new jurisdiction for the purpose of seeking medical care.in the end,this case is most akin to the facts of valentin,where the plaintiff had minimal contacts with the jurisdiction in which she sought medical care.like,the plaintiff in valentin stayed with family while receiving medical care and obtained a local driver license she went even further than and applied for jobs.both she and also maintained connections to their professions in their home jurisdictions.ties to puerto rico are quite superficial when compared to the parents in garcía pérez.and while hawes presents a closer case somewhere between valentin
