bruno lloyd appeals from an order of the district court of the virgin islands compelling arbitration of his claims against wyatt,wyatt or and hovensa,llc hovensa collectively,appellees pursuant to the federal arbitration act faa,et.wyatt from the district court order insofar as it denied wyatt motion for a stay of the proceedings on lloyd claims pending arbitration.
lloyd,who applied for employment at wyatt,brought suit against appellees alleging,inter alia,discriminatory conduct in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,et.invoking the provisions of an arbitration agreement entered into as a condition of lloyd application,appellees filed a motion to compel arbitration of lloyd claims and to stay the proceedings pending arbitration.the district court granted appellees motion to compel arbitration,but dismissed the case with prejudice rather than granting a stay.for the reasons that follow,we will reverse the district court order and remand with instructions to enter an order consistent with this opinion.
lloyd worked for more than twelve years as a boilermaker and pipefitter for various contractors at the hovensa refinery in croix,virgin islands.although the contractors for maintenance and repairs changed over these years,lloyd remained employed at the hovensa refinery.in november,lloyd was working for,one of the contractors at the refinery.at that time,hovensa awarded a contract to wyatt,a newly created subsidiary of wyatt field services company wyatt field services,for services that had been performing.lloyd was then informed by that he would be when contract expired on december,after wyatt was awarded the new contract,it filled positions in its upper management with persons on the continental united states who were already employed by its parent corporation,wyatt field services.these persons,according to lloyd,were predominantly white.
in january,wyatt began to hire between and people in the virgin islands.also in january,wyatt began requiring all applicants to sign a dispute resolution agreement dra as a condition of having their applications considered.app.at.the dra states,in relevant part 
i recognize that differences may arise between wyatt and me in relation to my application for employment.both wyatt and i agree to resolve any and all claims,disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to my application or candidacy for employment,the terms and conditions of my employment,and any claims arising from or relating to the employment relationship exclusively by final and binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator pursuant to the american arbitration association national rules for the resolution of employment disputes aaa rules this agreement extends to disputes with or claims against wyatt,hovensa,and any of their related or affiliated companies,entities,or individuals as intended third party beneficiaries.
on january,lloyd applied for employment with wyatt and signed the dra.he was not hired.lloyd thereafter filed this action against both wyatt and hovensa.the complaint alleged violation of the federal civil rights act of violation of titles and of the virgin islands code wrongful discharge by hovensa breach of an implied contract of good faith and fair dealing by hovensa and negligent intentional infliction of emotional distress.lloyd requested punitive as well as compensatory damages.
on september,wyatt filed a motion to compel arbitration,pursuant to the dra,and to stay the proceedings pending arbitration.lloyd opposed this motion,arguing that the agreement to arbitrate was unenforceable because aaa rules,and with respect to confidentiality,aaa rule with respect to discovery procedure,and the dra provision were all unconscionable and against public policy.lloyd also requested that the district court allow him further discovery based on his belief that wyatt use of the dra only in the virgin islands was motivated by bad faith or an otherwise improper motive.he claimed that,if wyatt had indeed discriminated against black or hispanic virgin islanders through the use of the dra,then the dra would be violative of federal and virgin islands law and unenforceable as a matter of public policy.
on november,wyatt filed a reply to lloyd memorandum opposing arbitration and hovensa filed a notice of joinder,thereby joining wyatt motion to compel arbitration.the district court held a hearing on the motion on january,at which the testimony of several witnesses was taken.
after the evidentiary hearing,the district court granted wyatt motion to compel arbitration and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.the district court held that aaa rules,and,as incorporated into the dra,were unconscionable.in addition,the district court denied lloyd request for discovery on his theory that wyatt used the dra in a racially discriminatory manner.the district court noted that lloyd had never filed a motion for an order to conduct discovery,in accordance with.b or local civ,during the nearly three months between his october,memorandum opposing arbitration and the evidentiary hearing.the district court further held that the most lloyd had shown was that wyatt differentiated between applicants on the basis of residency and nothing more.accordingly,the district court found that the dra had not been used as a tool of unlawful discrimination.finally,the district court severed the confidentiality provisions of aaa rules,and from the dra and granted wyatt and hovensa motion to compel arbitration.rather than stay the proceedings pending arbitration,however,the district court dismissed the action with prejudice because it found all of lloyd claims to be arbitrable and thus left no claims for adjudication by the district court lloyd filed a timely notice of appeal and wyatt subsequently filed a notice of.
the district court had jurisdiction over this case under and a,because the case arose under,inter alia,title vii,et.the district court exercised supplemental jurisdiction over lloyd virgin islands claims pursuant to and a.
we have jurisdiction over this appeal and pursuant to a because the district court order constituted a final decision with respect to an arbitration.see green tree fin.randolph,d we recognize that a district court order compelling arbitration is usually an interlocutory order that can not be appealed.see b in this case,however,the district court both compelled the parties to arbitrate their dispute and also dismissed the matter with prejudice.in green tree,the supreme court also considered an order compelling arbitration and dismissing the plaintiff case with prejudice,and,applying the meaning of the term final decision,ruled that such order 
plainly dispose s of the entire case on the merits and le aves no part of it pending before the court.the faa does permit parties to arbitration agreements to bring a separate proceeding in a district court to enter judgment on an arbitration award once it is made or to vacate or modify it,but the existence of that remedy does not vitiate the finality of the district court resolution of the claims in the instant proceeding.the district court order was therefore a final decision with respect to an arbitration within the meaning of a,and an appeal may be taken.
at.accordingly,we have before us a final appealable order that we may address on the merits 
we first address the issue of whether the district court erred in dismissing lloyd complaint with prejudice rather than staying the proceedings pending arbitration.on,wyatt argues that pursuant to of the faa,the district court was required to grant appellees motion to stay the litigation of lloyd claims pending the outcome of the arbitration and that the dismissal of lloyd case was therefore improper 
courts of appeals have reached different resolutions of the issue of whether a district court has discretion to deny a motion for a stay pending arbitration and dismiss a complaint where it finds all claims before it to be arbitrable.compare choice hotels,bsr tropicana resort,cir notwithstanding the terms of,however,dismissal is a proper remedy when all of the issues presented in a lawsuit are arbitrable,and green ameritech,cir the weight of authority clearly supports dismissal of the case when all of the issues raised in the district court must be submitted to arbitration,and bercovitch baldwin school,cir remanding a case to the district court to decide whether to dismiss or stay,depending upon whether all issues before the court are arbitrable,and alford dean witter reynolds,cir,and sparling hoffman const,cir,with adair bus sales,blue bird,cir holding that where a defendant moved for a stay pending arbitration under,the district court erred in instead entering a dismissal and the proper course would have been to enter the stay.we have not heretofore had occasion to resolve the issue today,we side with those courts that take the congressional text at face value.
section of the faa provides 
if any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of the united states upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration,the court in which such suit is pending,upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration under such an agreement,shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement,providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration.
emphasis added.
in accordance with the supreme court instruction in green tree,we apply the the plain language of the statutory text in interpreting the faa.see at.holding that the plain meaning of the term final decision in a must be applied.here,the plain language of affords a district court no discretion to dismiss a case where one of the parties applies for a stay pending arbitration.the directive that the court shall enter a stay simply can not be read to say that the court shall enter a stay in all cases except those in which all claims are arbitrable and the court finds dismissal to be the preferable approach.on the contrary,the statute clearly states,without exception,that whenever suit is brought on an arbitrable claim,the court shall upon application stay the litigation until arbitration has been concluded.in this case,wyatt requested a stay of the proceeding as part of his motion to compel arbitration.accordingly,we hold that the district court was obligated under to grant the stay once it decided to order arbitration.
we are free to disregard an unambiguous directive of congress only in the rare instances where failing to do so produces a nonsensical result that could not have been intended.mitchell horn,cir we do not look past the plain meaning of statutory language unless it produces a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters or an outcome so bizarre that congress could not have intended it.this is not one of those rare exceptions.congress adopted the faa to establish,promote and facilitate a national policy strongly favoring arbitration as a process for resolving disputes.alexander anthony int l,cir.holding that congress intended to deprive the district court of discretion to deny a stay produces results that effectively promote and facilitate arbitration.
contrary to lloyd suggestion,the district court has a significant role to play under the faa even in those instances in which the district court orders the arbitration of all claims.even in those instances,the parties are entitled to seek the court assistance during the course of arbitration.for example,the faa allows arbitrating parties to return to court for resolution of disputes regarding the appointment of an arbitrator or the filling of an arbitrator vacancy.similarly,parties may ask the court to compel the attendance of witnesses,or to punish the witnesses for contempt.then,after an arbitration award is rendered,a party is entitled to seek relief in the district court in the form of a judgment on the award or an order vacating or modifying the award.see.if the plaintiff case has been dismissed rather than stayed,the parties will have to file a new action each time the court assistance is required,with the attendant risk of having their case assigned to a new judge.on the other hand,if the court enters a stay of the action and retains jurisdiction,then proceedings under,or may be expedited,as the parties may simply return the to the same district judge presiding over the plaintiff case.
there is an even more important reason,however,to hold that congress meant exactly what it said.whenever a party is subjected to litigation on any issue and is found to be entitled to arbitrate that issue,of the faa,as we have noted,mandates that a stay be entered by the district court.the effect of that stay is twofold it relieves the party entitled to arbitrate of the burden of continuing to litigate the issue while the arbitration process is,and it entitles that party to proceed immediately to arbitration without the delay that would be occasioned by an appeal of the district court order to arbitrate.under of the faa,whenever a stay is entered under,the party resisting arbitration is expressly denied the right to an immediate appeal the legislative scheme of the faa thus reflects a policy decision that,if a district court determines that arbitration of a claim is called for,the judicial system interference with the arbitral process should end unless and until there is a final award.
if an exception to the mandate of were to be fashioned,thus giving the district court discretion to dismiss the action rather than enter a stay,a party who has been held entitled to arbitration would be deprived of an important benefit which the faa intended him to right to proceed with arbitration without the substantial delay arising from an appeal.stated conversely,the effect of recognizing an exception to the mandatory directive of is to give the district court the power to confer a right to an immediate appeal that would not otherwise exist.
while it is true that the suggested exception would extend only to cases where the claim subject to arbitration is not asserted along with other is,where all asserted claims are of the courts that have been willing to endorse it has suggested a reason why congress might have wanted a party entitled to arbitration to be subjected to an immediate appeal or not depending on how his adversary has chosen to draft his complaint.
in short,a literal reading of of the faa not only leads to sensible results,it also is the only reading consistent with the statutory scheme and the strong national policy favoring arbitration.accordingly,the district court erred in refusing to enter a stay order.
although we agree with wyatt that the district court order dismissing lloyd case must be reversed,we reject the argument that reversal would,in turn,deprive us of jurisdiction to hear the merits of lloyd appeal.relying in part on green tree,at,wyatt suggests that if we vacate the district court dismissal,we would be left with an unappealable interlocutory order.this argument misconstrues green tree.in that case,the supreme court noted that h ad the district court entered a stay instead of a dismissal,that order would not be appealable.id.emphasis added.in this case,however,the district court did not enter a stay.wyatt argument assumes that a conclusion that the district court should have entered a stay is tantamount to the conclusion that the district court did enter a stay.this is simply not the case.as we have noted supra,the order before us is a final decision that is appealable under a.
while it is clear that a court in this procedural context has jurisdiction to address the merits of the appeal,it may choose to defer to the faa policy favoring expeditious arbitration proceedings and decline to do so when it believes addressing the merits will prolong the ultimate resolution of the dispute.see,adair bus sales,at.here,however,we are called upon to exercise our discretion after this appeal has been fully briefed and argued,and in a context where resolution of the merits is likely to advance,rather than prolong,the ultimate resolution of the dispute by arbitration.we will therefore proceed to consider the merits of lloyd appeal.
