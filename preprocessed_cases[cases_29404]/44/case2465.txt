after booking,garretson was placed in a holding cell.she claims that she informed the john doe officer who escorted her to this cell of her medical needs,and he allegedly responded that he would see what he could do.she claims that throughout the night she suffered symptoms of insulin deprivation and high blood sugar and that she knocked on the cell door to get assistance,with no response.the cell contained an activated telephone,but garretson made no calls.
the next morning she was questioned by detective roberts.garretson informed him of her condition and her desire for treatment.after concluding his interrogation,he arranged for her to receive emergency medical treatment.at that time garretson was not exhibiting physical symptoms of distress,and she was returned to her cell.paramedics arrived,and she was transported to an emergency room.following treatment,she was arraigned.she was then transported to north oakland medical center where she remained for several days,receiving treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis.

ii.standard of review 
this court reviews de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.farhat jopke,cir.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
iii.discussion 
fourteenth amendment 
garretson has asserted a claim against madison heights and several individual officers under and the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution the fourteenth amendment due process clause grants pretrial detainees a right to adequate medical right analogous to the eighth amendment rights of prisoners.watkins city of battle creek,cir.
madison heights 
the language of does not create municipal liability unless action pursuant to official municipal policy of some nature caused a constitutional tort.monell of soc.serv.of city of new york,d.additionally,a municipality can not be held liable solely because it employs a,in other words,a municipality can not be held liable under on a respondeat superior theory.id see also stemler city of florence,cir while a municipality may be held liable under for a constitutional violation directly attributable to it,does not impose vicarious liability on a municipality for the constitutional torts of its employees.to prove her case,garretson must show that the madison heights officers acted with deliberate indifference to her medical needs.stemler,at.this is a stringent standard of fault,requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his action.id.at internal quotations omitted.furthermore,madison heights can only be liable under if the risks of a constitutional violation were plainly obvious.id.citing county comm rs of bryan county brown,d.
garretson argues that madison heights conduct,and that of its police officers,was premised on an unwritten custom of not providing medical attention to detainees prior to policy or custom of inaction.she refers to the madison heights policy on medical care while in custody to support her position.such an alleged policy of inaction must reflect some degree of fault before it may be considered a policy upon which liability may be based.york city of detroit,citing canton harris,d.garretson must show a clear and persistent pattern of mishandled medical emergencies for detainees notice,or constructive notice of such pattern,to madison heights tacit approval of the deliberate indifference and failure to act amounting to an official policy of inaction and that the custom or policy of inaction was the moving force,or direct causal link,behind the constitutional injury.see doe claiborne county,cir.
here,there is no evidence that madison heights,or its police department,had a custom of denying medical treatment to detainees.nor is there evidence that madison heights had notice of a clear and persistent pattern of such treatment demonstrating the existence of a policy of inaction.nor,as the district court noted,is there evidence that madison heights was the moving force behind garretson injuries.therefore,the decision of the district court that the city,and its police department,are entitled to summary judgment on the claims is affirmed.
the individual officers 
qualified immunity is an affirmative defense available to government officials performing discretionary functions.see generally owen city of independence,d.this issue of qualified immunity for the individual officers was not addressed by the district court.apparently,having decided that summary judgment was appropriate on the merits of garretson claims,the court determined issue of qualified immunity was moot.however,this issue must be addressed more closely here.
we must first determine whether garretson has alleged facts which,when taken in the light most favorable to her,show that the officers conduct violated a constitutionally protected right.comstock mccrary,cir citing saucier katz,d.if this threshold question is answered affirmatively,we then address whether such right was clearly established at the time of the violation.id.
