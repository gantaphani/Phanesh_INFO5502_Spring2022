we granted certiorari in this case to decide three questions whether the virgin islands supreme court correctly applied independent appellate review for determinations in libel suits,what the appropriate standard is in cases,and whether the justices should have recused themselves.we conclude that although the supreme court misapplied independent appellate review,it correctly held that leon kendall a judge formerly on the virgin islands superior court can not establish actual malice for his libel claim.this conclusion means that we need not decide the recusal question because our plenary review makes any potential error from the alleged bias harmless.accordingly,we will affirm the court judgment.
factual history 
judge kendall contends that the daily news and joy blackburn the defendants or daily news defamed him while reporting on three events in his judicial career his decision to grant bail to daniel castillo,his decision to place ashley williams under house arrest,and his decision to retire.most of the daily news articles admitted into evidence discussed the bail decision.castillo appeared before judge kendall in march of for a preliminary hearing for a charge of aggravated assault.the government requested that bail be set at because he had previous encounters with the criminal justice system a felony conviction for possession of stolen property and a rape charge that according to the government had been dismissed.castillo criminal record contained the conviction but stated that the rape charge had no known disp osition.in actuality,the rape charge had been one of nine charges which were dismissed when castillo entered a plea agreement for assault with a deadly weapon.these charges and the assault conviction were absent from the criminal record presented to judge kendall.thus,nothing presented at the hearing indicated that castillo had a history of violence.
judge kendall released castillo on his own recognizance.on april,castillo murdered a girl.coverage of the murder in the april,edition of the daily news explained that castillo was free on his own recognizance on the aggravated assault charges when he committed the murder.after recounting the alleged facts of the assault,the daily news described the preliminary hearing kendall found probable cause to charge castillo with assault but released him pending trial despite castillo history of violence including charges of rape,assault and weapons violations.judge kendall contends this statement and similar statements in subsequent articles were defamatory because they implied that he was aware of castillo violent history when,in fact,he was not.
the second set of articles at issue covers judge kendall decision to place ashley williams under house arrest.on november,a jury convicted williams of rape,assault,and unlawful sexual contact.after receiving the verdict,the government sought to have williams remanded into custody.williams,however,requested that he be free over the weekend to get his affairs in order before reporting to prison.judge kendall granted williams request but placed him under house arrest.
williams failed to report to jail the following monday as required by judge kendall order.instead,williams refused to leave his home and threatened to blow himself up during a standoff with police.in a november,article,the daily news reported on the standoff and explained that williams was at his home because after he was convicted of rape and assault,he was allowed by a judge to spend the weekend in the community unsupervised before he was supposed to report to jail monday.the article further explained that judge kendall had released williams and that t ypically,people convicted of violent crimes are remanded into custody to await sentencing once they are found guilty.judge kendall contends that the daily news defamed him by stating that williams was unsupervised in the community when,in fact,williams was under house arrest at the time of the standoff with police.
the final event at issue was judge kendall decision to retire.in a february,article,the daily news reported on that decision in an article subtitled t hree judicial complaints against him still pending.this subtitle referred to three complaints filed against judge kendall with the virgin islands commission on judicial disabilities for allegedly misapplying the law in his bail decisions.at the time the article was published,judge kendall had successfully challenged the authority of the commission to hold hearings regarding the complaints in the district court of the virgin islands.this ruling,however,was still on appeal to this court.judge kendall argues that the daily news defamed him by stating that the complaints were still pending,even though they had been dismissed by the district court.
procedural history 
on october,judge kendall filed this libel action against the daily news and two of its reporters,joy blackburn and joseph tsidulko,in the virgin islands superior court.after judge kendall amended his original complaint to include the retirement article and the parties completed discovery,the case proceeded to a jury trial.the jury returned a verdict in favor of judge kendall for,and against the daily news and blackburn.the jury determined that tsidulko was not liable.the daily news and blackburn subsequently moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.the superior court granted this motion and entered a directed verdict in their favor.
judge kendall appealed the superior court judgment to the virgin islands supreme court.judge kendall requested that the justices recuse themselves because they had initiated a criminal contempt charge pending against him the supreme court denied his request and affirmed the superior court judgment on the narrow ground that judge kendall could not prove actual malice for any of the statements.we subsequently granted certiorari to answer three questions 
whether the actual malice standard articulated in new york times sullivan,d,can be satisfied by a defendant mere awareness of a defamatory implication as opposed to an actual intent to convey that implication and,if so,whether the standard was satisfied in this case 
whether the virgin islands supreme court review exceeded the scope of the independent examination required by bose consumers union of,d and 
whether the virgin islands supreme court justices erred in not recusing themselves from this matter.
we exercise plenary review over decisions of the virgin islands supreme court that relate to questions of federal constitutional law.see people of the john,cir pichardo comm r of labor,cir.
before turning to the merits,we must first examine whether congress has removed our jurisdiction over this case with recent legislation that changes how decisions of the virgin islands supreme court are reviewed by federal courts.see in re flat glass antitrust,cir noting that we have an independent responsibility to examine our own jurisdiction sua sponte quoting in re ford motor,cir.
in the revised organic act of,as amended in,congress authorized the virgin islands legislature to establish its own local appellate court and provided that when it did so,we would exercise certiorari jurisdiction over that court final decisions for a limited period of institutional development.see defoe phillip,cir laying out the history of our relationship with the courts of the virgin islands.our certiorari jurisdiction was to last up to fifteen years from the creation of the virgin islands supreme court enough time for the virgin islands supreme court to develop sufficient institutional traditions of its own to justify direct review by the supreme court of the united states.recognizing that the virgin islands supreme court might develop sufficient institutional traditions before the mark,however,congress required this court to regularly evaluate and report on its progress.see also defoe,at.the virgin islands supreme court passed that test with flying colors last year when a committee of this court recommended to the third circuit judicial council that congress eliminate our certiorari jurisdiction over virgin islands supreme court decisions in favor of direct review by the united states supreme court.see judicial council of the court of appeals for the third circuit,report on the virgin islands supreme court,available at.
congress agreed and quickly acted on the third circuit recommendation.by december,both the house of representatives and the senate had passed,a bill that would eliminate our certiorari jurisdiction over final decisions of the virgin islands supreme court and replace it with direct review by the supreme court of the united states.see an act to amend the revised organic act of the virgin islands to provide for direct review by the united states supreme court of decisions of the virgin islands supreme court,cong.president obama signed into law on december.
we must now decide whether strips us of our certiorari jurisdiction over cases like this one in which certiorari has been granted and the matter is awaiting decision at the time of the bill enactment.we hold that it does not.
when interpreting a statute,we normally presume that the statute does not apply retroactively that is,to cases pending on the date of the law enactment absent clear congressional intent to the contrary.hamdan rumsfeld,d citing landgraf usi film,d.this presumption against retroactivity,however,does not apply to statutes that only alter jurisdiction.u nlike other intervening changes in the law,a or statute usually takes away no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear the case.id.at quoting hallowell commons.consequently,as the supreme court has explained,no retroactivity problem arises with respect to an intervening change in jurisdiction because the change in the law does not impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase a party liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.id.at quoting landgraf,at.
that does not mean,however,that all provisions must apply to cases pending at the time of their enactment.id.after all,n ormal rules of statutory construction may dictate otherwise.id.quoting lindh murphy,d.here,congress spoke clearly t he amendments made by that is,the elimination of the third circuit certiorari jurisdiction and substitution of such review by the united states supreme court apply to cases commenced on or after the date of the enactment of.no matter whether cases commenced carries a broader meaning referring to the filing of a complaint in the superior court or a narrower meaning referring to the filing of a certiorari petition in this court an issue we need not decide today kendall commenced this case long before enactment.
we are mindful that the ninth circuit reached the opposite conclusion about congress elimination of its certiorari jurisdiction over the guam supreme court decisions.see santos guam,cir.there,the ninth circuit concluded that congress elimination of its certiorari jurisdiction and substitution of direct review by the supreme court of the united states did apply to pending cases.
but santos is distinguishable for at least two reasons.to the extent that santos interprets supreme court precedent as holding that provisions automatically apply retroactively absent an express reservation of jurisdiction over pending cases,the supreme court subsequently rejected such an approach in hamdan.see hamdan,at rejecting this inflexible rule advanced by justice scalia dissent and by the government.more importantly,the provision in santos differs markedly from the one we confront here.in santos,the ninth circuit addressed a statute in which congress was completely silent about the effective date of the provision.santos,at explaining that congress did not express an intent as to the effective date.by contrast,congress was explicit that amendments apply only to cases commenced on or after the date of the enactment of the statute.see.as a result,we retain certiorari jurisdiction over all cases commenced before the president signed,including this one.see hamdan,at drawing the negative inference that congress did not intend to eliminate jurisdiction over pending detainee habeas petitions where the statute was silent about whether its subsection applied to cases even though it expressly made two other subsections retroactive.
independent appellate review 
the parties disagree whether the virgin island supreme court correctly applied the standard applied to determinations of actual malice.see bose,at.independent appellate review is a process.the reviewing court first determines what credibility determinations the jury must have made.this is done by discarding the evidence or testimony that the jury must have rejected on the basis of the trial court instructions,the jury answers to special interrogatories,and an understanding of those facts not in dispute.harte hanks commc ns,connaughton,d.these credibility determinations are reviewed under the standard.id.at.
the evidence which is not excluded by the harte hanks test is then weighed alongside the undisputed evidence to determine if the defendant acted with actual malice.id.at.in other words,as the ninth circuit explained in eastwood national enquirer,cir,we must figure out,as best we can from the cold record,which evidence the jury accepted as credible,and which it discarded.then we must determine whether the believed evidence establishes actual malice.id.at.
the virgin islands supreme court did not apply this standard in its review.at no point did the supreme court analyze what credibility determinations the jury must have made,nor did it express the need to defer to the credibility determinations of the jury.as seen in the process described,however,i ndependent review is not a limitless ransacking of the record as a whole purely factual determinations such as credibility calls remain subject to the usual degree of deference.mandel boston phoenix,cir.the virgin islands supreme court thus erred by not determining whether the jury made any credibility determinations to which it had to accord deference.
actual malice 
the virgin islands supreme court misapplication of independent appellate review is reversible error only if we were to reach a different result by applying the standard appropriately.see harte hanks,at affirming a circuit court holding even though that court had misapplied the standard.the virgin islands supreme court concluded that the evidence was insufficiently clear and convincing to support a jury finding of actual malice.before we can decide whether that conclusion is correct,we must resolve a dispute between the parties regarding what constitutes actual malice in cases 
in cases,the alleged defamatory statement has two possible meanings,one that is defamatory and one that is not.see d libel and slander explaining that d efamation by implication occurs when a defendant juxtaposes a series of facts to imply a defamatory connection between them.these cases differ from ordinary defamation cases in which the alleged defamatory statement has only a defamatory meaning.see id.collecting manners in which a statement can be defamatory see also restatement second of torts explaining that a communication is defamatory if it tends to so harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him.in ordinary defamation cases,the standard is relatively clear and undisputed by the parties.the supreme court has defined actual malice as knowledge that a statement was false or made with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.schiavone constr.time,cir quoting sullivan,at quotation marks omitted.recklessness is shown by demonstrating that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of the statement or that the defendant had a subjective awareness of probable falsity.id.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.this standard is a subjective one,based on the defendant actual state of mind id.citing amant thompson,d.
the parties disagree,however,on what constitutes actual malice in cases.they agree that there are two elements to actual malice in these cases a falsity element and a communicative intent element.the parties also agree as to what satisfies the falsity element that is,the extent to which defendants must be aware that the defamatory meaning of their statement is false.for this element,the parties concur that plaintiffs must show that the defendants either knew that the defamatory meaning of their statement was false or were reckless in regard to the defamatory meaning falsity.
they disagree,however,over what is sufficient to satisfy the element that is,the extent to which defendants must be aware of the defamatory meaning of their statement.the daily news argues that plaintiffs can satisfy this element only by showing that the defendants intended the defamatory meaning.judge kendall agrees that intentional communication of the defamatory meaning is sufficient but argues that plaintiffs can also satisfy this element by showing that the defendants were aware of the defamatory meaning and acted recklessly in regard to it.
resolving this disagreement requires us to answer two questions does the standard apply differently in cases than in ordinary defamation cases such that more than knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard for truth is required as the parties believe if the standard is different,then is actual malice established,on one hand,only by showing that the defendant intended to communicate the defamatory meaning or,on the other hand,by showing either that the defendant intended to communicate the defamatory meaning or was aware of the defamatory meaning and reckless in regard to it 
we agree with the first,sixth,seventh,and ninth circuits plaintiffs in cases must show something beyond knowledge of,or recklessness in regard to,the falsity of the statement defamatory meaning.compuware moody investors,cir howard antilla,cir newton broad,cir saenz playboy,cir.the supreme court has explained that in the libel context,m alice has been defined in numerous ways,but in general depend s upon a showing that the defendant acted with improper motive.herbert lando,d.showing motive hinge s upon the intent or purpose with which the publication was made.id.at.these statements show that the intent of the publisher is linked to determining if that publisher had the actual malice necessary to support a libel claim.harte hanks,at explaining that actual malice involves a subjective inquiry into a defendant mental state rather than just an objective determination of a statement truth saenz,at proof of actual malice depends upon the defendant actual state of mind.citing herbert,at.
the need to show intent necessarily means that the standard will have different elements of proof in ordinary defamation cases than in cases.in ordinary defamation cases,intent to defame can be established solely through knowledge that the statement was false.after all,if the defendants knew that the statement made was false and defamatory,then they must have intended to defame.and while the statement itself rarely indicates whether its publisher knew it was false,the statement does show that its publisher knew it was defamatory because it can have only defamatory meanings.so all a plaintiff needs to demonstrate in ordinary defamation cases to establish intent to defame is that the defendants knew their statement was false.
but in cases,showing known falsity alone is inadequate to establish an intent to defame.in these cases,we may no longer presume with certainty that the defendants knew they were making a defamatory statement because the statement has defamatory and nondefamatory meanings.therefore,in such cases,plaintiffs must show something that establishes defendants intent to communicate the defamatory meaning.
this second element of actual malice showing the defendant communicative intent can be satisfied,as judge kendall argues,by demonstrating that the defendant either intended to communicate the defamatory meaning or knew of the defamatory meaning and was reckless in regard to it.this approach necessarily follows from the supreme court inclusion of recklessness in the standard.sullivan,at.actual malice is a term of art that the court has explained should not be confused with the concept of malice as an evil intent or a motive arising from spite or ill will it should be understood to be a shorthand used to describe the first amendment protections for speech injurious to reputation.masson new yorker magazine,d.recklessness has always been included in the definition of actual malice under the first amendment.see,sullivan,at defining actual malice as speaking with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not masson,at restating sullivan definition of actual malice.the court has even described reckless disregard as the line which our cases have drawn between false communications which are protected and those which are not that represents the appropriate balancing of the interests at stake in first amendment cases.amant,at.recklessness is thus the outer limit of actual malice,which means that the element of actual malice in cases can be satisfied by reckless disregard for the defamatory meaning of a statement.
this approach is supported by the first,sixth,and seventh circuits.these courts have stated that to find actual malice in cases,the plaintiff must show with clear and convincing evidence that the defendants intended or knew of the implications that the plaintiff is attempting to draw from the allegedly defamatory material.saenz,at see compuware,at howard,at.this formulation of the rule was first stated by the seventh circuit in saenz,which the first and sixth circuits subsequently quoted without elaboration.see howard,at compuware,at.admittedly,this statement of the standard uses the phrase knew of the implications rather than recklessness.the saenz court,however,treated the phrase knew of and the word recklessness as synonymous,which is evident in its rearticulation of the standard as requiring the plaintiff to establish that the defendants intended to imply or were reckless toward the defamatory implications.saenz,at.the standard we adopt is thus the same as that articulated by the seventh circuit and later adopted by the first and sixth circuits.
we emphasize the recklessness conception of this test rather than the know of conception because recklessness conforms more closely with the supreme court definition of actual malice.furthermore,mere knowledge of the defamatory meaning of a statement that also has a nondefamatory meaning can not be enough.the supreme court balancing of the first amendment interests in libel suits favors permitting some libelous conduct to avoid chilling protected speech.see amant,at explaining that the recklessness standard is preferable to a standard because protect ing some erroneous publications as well as true ones is necessary to insure the ascertainment and publication of the truth about public affairs.yet if mere knowledge were sufficient to find defamatory intent,then actual malice could be found no matter how unlikely it is that a listener would interpret the statement as having the defamatory meaning.this is contrary to the supreme court preference for a broader scope of protection for potentially libelous speech.recklessness,by contrast,captures this preference because it requires that the defendants knew that the defamatory meaning was not just possible,but likely,and still made the statement despite their knowledge of that likelihood.harte hanks,at defining reckless disregard for the truth as instances where the defendant actually had a high degree of awareness of probable falsity.
the defendants rely on the ninth circuit newton decision which does not include reckless disregard for,or knowledge of,the defamatory meaning in its articulation of the element.at explaining that libel liability can not be permitted for what was not intended to be said.the newton court did not consider,much less reject,whether the element may be satisfied by showing a reckless disregard for the defamatory meaning of a statement.see at.the decision thus does not necessarily conflict with the standard we now adopt.see howard,at treating the ninth circuit newton decision as compatible with the seventh circuit saenz decision.moreover,to the extent the ninth circuit usage provides any persuasive value to the defendants argument,that value is outweighed by the inclusion of recklessness in the supreme court definition of actual malice.
we next consider whether the virgin islands supreme court erred by ruling that judge kendall can not establish actual malice.we will reverse the supreme court only if our independent review of the record shows that a jury could find actual malice by evidence.tucker fischbein,cir.this standard requires the plaintiff to provide evidence so clear,direct,weighty,and convincing as to enable a clear conviction,without hesitation,about whether or not the defendants acted in a way that renders them liable.see amica mut.ins.fogel,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.judge kendall contends that the virgin islands supreme court erred by holding that the evidence is insufficient to find actual malice for statements made in the articles relating to his release of castillo on his own recognizance,his decision to place williams under house arrest,and his decision to retire.we agree with the supreme court ruling in its entirety and will thus affirm.
castillo articles 
judge kendall argues that the defendants articles relating to his bail decision in daniel castillo case are defamatory because they implied that he knew of castillo history of violence when he released castillo on his own recognizance.the defendants articles contained the statement or statements similar to kendall found probable cause to charge castillo but released him pending trial despite castillo history of violence including charges of rape,assault and weapons violations.although this statement does not explicitly say that judge kendall released castillo despite knowing of his history of violence,judge kendall contends that this is the implication the defendants intended readers to understand.as we have explained,to show actual malice for defamation by implication,judge kendall must show by evidence both that the defendants either intended the defamatory meaning or knew of the defamatory meaning and were reckless in regard to it,and that the defendants made the statement with knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not,schiavone constr,at quoting sullivan,at quotation marks omitted.
judge kendall first argues that we must disregard the testimony of blackburn,who authored the articles,because the jury must have found her testimony incredible.see harte hanks,at.we agree.blackburn testified that when she wrote the statement,she intended a nondefamatory meaning that castillo had a history of violence and judge kendall did choose to release him.the jury must have concluded that this testimony was incredible because to decide otherwise that blackburn did not intend the defamatory meaning would have prevented them from finding actual malice,as they did.we thus can not consider blackburn testimony about the meaning of her statement.
the jury rejection of her testimony does not end our analysis,however.mere disbelief of a defendant statement ordinarily is insufficient to establish malice.bose,at when the testimony of a witness is not believed,the trier of fact may simply disregard it.normally the discredited testimony is not considered a sufficient basis for drawing a contrary conclusion.judge kendall argues that the element of actual malice is satisfied through blackburn coverage of protests that followed castillo murder of a year old girl.judge kendall contends that even if the defendants were initially unaware that their statement could imply that he was aware of castillo history of violence when he released him on his own recognizance,they were made aware through the protests organized by people who,as blackburn acknowledged at trial,understood that judge kendall had released castillo despite his history of violence.once the defendants were aware of what the public understood their statement to mean,he argues,their continued publication of the statement was at least reckless.
this evidence is insufficient to satisfy the element by evidence in light of the subjective nature of the inquiry.schiavone constr,at quoting amant,at.the subjective nature of this inquiry requires that there be some evidence showing,directly or circumstantially,that the defendants themselves understood the potential defamatory meaning of their statement.id.quoting amant,at.no direct evidence in the record of this case suggests that the defendants themselves knew of,much less intended,the defamatory meaning.
there is also no circumstantial evidence of record linking the protestors understanding of what took place with the statement made by the defendants.the protestors testimony did not establish that the daily news was their source.the protesters could not recall at trial whether their source was the statements by the daily news or coverage from other virgin islands news outlets.if the daily news reporting had been the sole source of information for castillo case,then judge kendall would have a stronger basis for inferring the defendants knowledge of and recklessness with regard to the defamatory meaning of the statement.but here,the story was covered by several news outlets,which makes it impossible to know whether the protests were caused or informed by the defendants statements.consequently,we can not conclude with clear conviction and without hesitation that the defendants were made aware of the defamatory meaning of their statement through their coverage of the protests.amica mut.ins,at explaining what satisfies the standard.because judge kendall can not establish that the defendants intended the defamatory meaning or knew of it and were reckless in regard to it,he fails to prove actual malice by evidence 
williams articles 
judge kendall next argues that the daily news articles regarding ashley williams are defamatory because they stated that judge kendall allowed williams to spend the weekend in the community unsupervised.in fact,judge kendall had placed him under house arrest.this is an ordinary defamatory statement rather than one by implication,so to establish actual malice,judge kendall must show that the statement was made with knowledge that the statement was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.schiavone constr,at quoting sullivan,at quotation marks omitted.
there is no evidence that the defendants knew their statement was false.blackburn,who authored this article,was not informed that the statement was incorrect until litigation commenced.judge kendall argues,however,that blackburn testimony demonstrates actual malice through recklessness.he contends that the jury must have determined from her testimony that she fabricated her unsupervised description because she did not have a source for the assertion.fabrication may constitute recklessness,amant,at,but the jury did not necessarily conclude that she was without a source for her article.the relevant testimony is 
q you did tell the public that williams had been placed under house arrest with arrangements to be made by the marshals,right 
a no one there that night,none of those officers who were there,not a single one of them were saying,oh,williams is under house arrest.
q did you ask that question 
q miss blackburn,did you walk over to any of those people,those law enforcement people,and say,could you tell me what going on here what are the circumstances of williams being in his home 
you had already written your story two days earlier.you knew he had been convicted.
a yeah,i knew he had been convicted.and 
q so,did you think it was important,before you told the community that judge kendall had just let him out unsupervised in the community,to be accurate and truthful 
a nobody who was there was saying the man is supervised.
q now,you claimed,as i understand it,that the source for the words that you used released unsupervised in the community was assistant attorney general renee gumbs carty who said those words to you on a telephone call in which another assistant attorney general name d kerry drue supposedly was listening in.is that your testimony 
q and i just want to b
