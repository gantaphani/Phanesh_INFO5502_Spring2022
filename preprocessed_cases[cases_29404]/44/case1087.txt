opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on an appeal from an order of the district court entered march,denying,the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons and the american association of orthopaedic surgeons together the aaos,motion for judgment as a matter of law and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.for the reasons we set forth we will affirm the march,order.
the aaos is a voluntary professional organization for orthopaedic surgeons,which has adopted professional standards,including member grievance procedures.though most orthopaedic surgeons are members of the aaos,it is not a licensing authority and consequently an orthopaedic surgeon need not be an aaos member to practice orthopaedic surgery.this case is an outgrowth of an aaos grievance proceeding that an aaos member,menachem meller,initiated against another aaos member,steven graboff,a orthopaedic surgeon.meller filed the grievance claiming that graboff wrote an inaccurate report based on incomplete information that was used against him in a civil malpractice case.the report charged that meller departed from reasonable and accepted standards of medical care in treating the plaintiff in the malpractice case.after determining that graboff testimony violated the aaos standards of professionalism,which require its members to provide honest and accurate testimony when serving as expert witnesses,the aaos suspended graboff from membership for two years.the aaos published a description of the grievance proceedings in aaos now,an aaos newsletter.graboff,who has resigned from the aaos,then sued the aaos,alleging that the aaos now article the article was actionable both as defamatory and a invasion of privacy because it selectively recounted the circumstances of the grievance proceedings to imply that he had testified falsely.
at the conclusion of a trial the district court submitted the case to the jury to answer interrogatories.the jury answered that the article did not contain any false statements,but did contain statements portraying graboff in a false light,and it awarded graboff in damages.though the jury through its answers did not address the ultimate question of whether the aaos was liable on either the defamation or claim,the district court treated the answers as having found in favor of graboff on the claim and in favor of the aaos on the defamation claim.the aaos subsequently moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict,but the court denied the motion.
the aaos appeals,arguing that,under the district court treatment of the jury answers,the answers were inconsistent because,as a matter of law,the jury finding that the aaos had not made false statements foreclosed the possibility that it could be liable on the claim.thus,the aaos contends that it was entitled to a judgment in its favor on both claims.we,however,hold that the answers can be reconciled and thus were not inconsistent.but we conclude that the district court erred by treating the jury findings as returning a verdict in graboff favor only on the claim as we are satisfied that the findings established that the aaos was liable on both the and defamation claims.nevertheless,the error was harmless and,accordingly,we will affirm the order of march.
ii.background 
in,graboff drafted an expert report that was used in jones meller,a malpractice case against meller filed in the court of common pleas of philadelphia county,pennsylvania.graboff draft report stated that meller treatment of the malpractice plaintiff departed from reasonable and accepted standards of medical care.although graboff had included the words draft report in bold,underlined letters at the top of his report,the law firm representing the plaintiff in the jones case,without graboff consent or knowledge,whited out the draft report designation and used the report to obtain a settlement from meller.
meller filed a grievance against graboff with the aaos asserting that graboff had provided false testimony in the malpractice case against him.meller based his grievance on the aaos standards of professionalism which,among other provisions,require orthopaedists serving as expert witnesses to provide honest and accurate testimony.the aaos enforces these standards through its professional compliance program grievance procedures.these procedures provide that aaos members can file grievances with the aaos when they believe that a fellow member has engaged in unprofessional conduct.in graboff case there were two hearings before aaos administrative bodies.at the first hearing,meller confronted graboff with of the jones plaintiff that graboff had not seen when he prepared his expert report.based on these,graboff admitted that his report was flawed and that meller treatment of his patient had satisfied the appropriate standard of care.graboff also testified that he believed his report had been preliminary,and that he had not expected it to be used in litigation.ultimately,however,the aaos board of directors reached a final decision that graboff had violated its standards of professionalism,and it suspended him from membership in the aaos for two years.
pursuant to its bylaws,the aaos published a summary of the grievance proceedings against graboff in aaos now,a publication available to both aaos members and the public.the article described the jones case and the grievance proceedings against graboff,but did not mention graboff exculpatory testimony from the grievance proceedings that he considered the report to have been preliminary,that it had been altered,and that it had been used improperly to settle the case.instead,the article explained that graboff was initially absolute in his opinion that meller had violated the standard of care,but later contradicted himself and admitted his report had been based on lack of information.ja.the article was publicly available on the aaos website and appeared in online searches of graboff name.
on april,graboff instituted this action against the aaos alleging,as we have explained,that the article was actionable as it was defamatory and was a false light invasion of privacy.though these charges set forth separate causes of action,the actions are related and include,as will be seen,certain common elements.at the ensuing day jury trial,graboff testified that the article omitted the fact that his report had been a draft,made it seem that he had access to the prior to drafting the report,and implied that he intentionally had falsified information rather than explaining that the report had been a preliminary draft based on limited information.graboff,who,until the time of the publication of the article,frequently testified as an expert witness for both plaintiffs and defendants,including defendants insurance companies,also testified that his credibility as an expert witness suffered following the publication of the article.consequently,several of his longstanding clients terminated their relationships with him and,when testifying,he was subject to impeachment because of the article and his suspension from aaos membership.
as we have indicated,the jury concluded that the aaos had not made false statements in the article,but had made statements that portrayed graboff in a false light and awarded him in damages.as we also have indicated,the district court treated the jury findings as returning a verdict in favor of graboff on the claim,but in favor of the aaos on the defamation claim.
following the return of the verdict,the aaos moved for judgment as a matter of law and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.ja although the motion referred to both federal rule of civil procedure b,dealing with the renewal of motions after trial of earlier motions for a judgment as a matter of law,and rule,dealing with motions for a new trial,and the district court treated the motion as seeking both remedies,the aaos made the motion exclusively under rule b because rule does not deal with motions for entry of judgment,the relief that the aaos requested in the district court the court in an exceptionally comprehensive opinion dated march,denied the aaos motion and,in effect,sustained the damages verdict.see graboff colleran firm,civ,wl,
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship under and we have jurisdiction under.we review the district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo,acumed llc advanced surgical,cir,and ordinarily apply the same standard as a district court applies in considering a motion for judgment as a matter of law.johnson campbell,cir.that standard requires a court of appeals to assess whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict,a reasonable jury could have found for the prevailing party.see also lakeside resort,lp bd.of sup rs of palmyra,cir.of course,in this case inasmuch as we reach our result by our treatment of the verdict and the aaos does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict,we make our determination by plenary application of legal principles.
iv.discussion 
on this appeal we address the question of whether the jury finding that the article did not contain false statements precluded the district court from treating the jury answers to the interrogatories to support the entry of a judgment in favor of graboff on his claim.the aaos argues that the jury finding that th e a rticle contained no false statements about graboff is incompatible or at least inconsistent with its finding that the same a rticle portrayed graboff in a false light.appellants reply br.at the aaos,in making its contention that the verdict was internally incompatible or inconsistent,points out that the court instructions defined falsity broadly to include both false statements and true statements making a false implication.inasmuch as it is presumed that a jury applies the court instructions as given,the aaos argues that the jury necessarily found that the aaos did not make any statements in the article that included a false implication with respect to graboff therefore,in its view,the court erred by treating the findings as returning a verdict in favor of graboff for false light invasion of privacy.rather,it contends that the court should have read the answers to the interrogatories to reach a conclusion that the aaos was not liable for either defamation or false light invasion of privacy.
although we conclude that the aaos contentions do not have merit,we also conclude that the district court erred in its treatment of the jury answers for,contrary to that court view,the answers support findings that the aaos was liable for both defamation and false light invasion of privacy rather than only for the latter claim.however,for the reasons we set forth,we conclude that the court reached the correct result in denying aaos motion,and its error thus was harmless.therefore,we will affirm the denial of aaos motion and,in effect,uphold the judgment entered against the aaos 
legal framework and jury instructions on defamation and false light invasion of privacy 
in light of the aaos incompatibility or inconsistency contention with respect to the jury verdict,we discuss the elements of defamation and false light invasion of privacy under pennsylvania law as the parties agree that pennsylvania law is applicable in this case.
defamation 
a claim for defamation claim under pennsylvania law includes the following elements 
the defamatory character of the communication.
its publication by the defendant.
its application to the plaintiff.
the understanding by the recipient of its defamatory meaning.
the understanding by the recipient of it as intended to be applied to the plaintiff.
tucker fischbein,cir quoting.const.stat.ann.a west.procedurally,a trial court at the outset should decide whether a statement is capable of a defamatory meaning id.citing thomas merton ctr.rockwell int l.if the court determines that a statement can support such a meaning,the jury then must decide whether the recipient actually understood the statement to be defamatory.id.at citing corabi curtis publ g.
a statement is defamatory if it tends so to harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him.id.at quoting birl phila,internal quotation marks omitted.but the statement must do more than merely embarrass or annoy the plaintiff it must provoke the kind of harm which has grievously fractured one standing in the community of respectable society.tucke phila.daily news,quoting scott taylor,stokes.
a defendant may avoid liability for defamation if it shows that its statements were substantially true.see.const.stat.ann.b west see also dunlap phila.newspapers,the proof of truth must go to the gist or sting of the defamation.quoting sack,libel,slander,and related problems at,internal quotation marks omitted.however,a defamatory statement must be viewed in context,baker lafayette,and a defendant can not use truth as a defense where the implication of the communication as a whole was false,even if the statement is literally accura te,dunlap,at.though we are not aware of any pennsylvania supreme court case on the point,inferior pennsylvania courts applying pennsylvania law have concluded that defamation may be established where a statement,viewed in context,creates a false implication.see,id.adopting defamation by innuendo theory mzamane winfrey,d,collecting cases approving a theory.
false light invasion of privacy 
in pennsylvania there can be four separate torts when there has been an invasion of privacy,one of which,publicity placing a person in a false light,is at issue here.marks bell.pennsylvania has adopted the definition of false light invasion of privacy from the restatement second of torts,which imposes liability on a person who publishes material that is not true,is highly offensive to a reasonable person,and is publicized with knowledge or in reckless disregard of its falsity.larsen phila.newspapers,en banc citing restatement second of torts see also vogel grant,adopting restatement second definitions for all four invasion of privacy claims.although to the best of our knowledge the pennsylvania supreme court has not addressed the contours of falsity in the context,the superior court has defined falsity broadly in that context.a plaintiff can establish falsity by showing that a defendant selectively printed or broadcast true statements or pictures in a manner which created a false impression.larsen,at.thus,even where a publication is literally true,discrete presentation of information in a fashion which renders the publication susceptible to inferences casting one in a false light entitles the grievant to recompense for the wrong committed.id.at.the superior court has drawn this broad definition from defamation law,which permits recovery where a publication was true,but implied falsehoods.id.citing dunlap,at.
applying this standard in larsen,the superior court allowed the plaintiff claim to survive a motion to dismiss where he alleged that a series of articles,although literally true,conveyed a false impression that he had lied under oath.id.see also krajewski gusoff,reversing dismissal of claim where factual statements in article suggest ed a causal relationship that could not be proven,appeal dismissed,wl,santillo reedel,a false light claim can be established where true information is released if the information tends to imply falsehoods.
falsity with respect to a defendant statements thus carries the same meaning in the defamation and contexts indeed,the superior court drew its definition of falsity in the context from its corresponding definition in the defamation context.larsen,at.and pennsylvania inferior courts consistently apply the same analysis to both types of claims when the causes of action are based on the same set of underlying facts.see,krajewski,at using discussion of statements as to defamation claim in context.accordingly,publication of factually correct statements that convey a false impression can be actionable as defamation if the statements had a grievous effect on one reputation,or actionable as a false light invasion of privacy if the statements would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.clearly there is little dif
