we review the district court summary judgment ruling de novo,applying the same legal standard used by the district court.felty,cir.as the parties agree,where an erisa plan vests the administrator with discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan,as this plan does,courts review an administrator decision for abuse of discretion.firestone tire rubber bruch,d see also baker provident life accident ins,cir.under this standard,we do not search for the best interpretation of a plan or even for one we might independently adopt.rather,when reviewing a plan administrator decision,a court will not disturb any reasonable interpretation.baker,at citation omitted.where a potential conflict of interest exists,however,we employ a more searching review the deference due the plan administrator is lessened to the degree necessary to neutralize any untoward influence resulting from the conflict.doe group hospitalization med,cir citing restatement second of trusts cmt.d.here,because the plan administrator,reliastar,also acts as insurer,we review its denial under this modified abuse of discretion standard.baker,at.
when interpreting the benefits provisions of insurance plans,the plain language is paramount.id.at see also coleman nationwide life ins,cir.we begin,therefore,with the plan terms.the plan states that reliastar pays accidental death benefits if the insured dies due to an accident.
the plan defines accident as an unexpected and sudden event which the insured does not foresee,so to qualify under the plan an accident must be both unexpected and an event the insured does not foresee.reliastar plan does not,however,define unexpected or foresee able.because the plan undefined terms and indeed the term accident are not always susceptible to easy application,many federal courts have adopted the framework laid out in wickman northwestern national insurance,cir,to clarify the meaning of unexpected.initially,the court asks whether the insured subjectively expected his actions to result in injury or death.id.at.if the insured did not expect an injury,the must examine whether the suppositions which underlay that expectation were reasonable and must do so from the perspective of the insured.id.however,if the,in attempting to accurately determine the insured actual expectation,finds the evidence insufficient to accurately determine the insured subjective expectation,the should then engage in an objective analysis of the insured expectations.id.citation omitted.this objective analysis asks whether a reasonable person,with background and characteristics similar to the insured,would have viewed the injury as highly likely to occur as a result of the insured intentional conduct.id.citation omitted.
in baker provident life accident insurance,cir,this court suggested that it would apply wickman test to drunk driving collisions.here,as in wickman,there is no evidence in the administrative record from which the insured subjective expectation can be accurately determined.wickman,at.thus,again as in wickman,we proceed to the objective analysis,and consider whether a reasonable person,with background and characteristics similar to the insured,would have viewed the injury as highly likely to occur as a result of the insured intentional conduct.id.citation omitted.
reliastar denied benefits on the ground that the insured death was not unexpected because he put himself in a position in which he should have known serious injury or death could occur.plaintiff contends,however,that it was unreasonable for reliastar to conclude that the particular collision at issue here was not an accident.specifically,plaintiff maintains that she is entitled to accidental death benefits because injuries are not highly likely to occur and reliastar interpretation of accident would frustrate the purpose of ad d insurance.
plaintiff first argues that reliastar interpretation of accident was unreasonable because injuries are not highly likely to occur.we can not agree with plaintiff argument.whether the test is one of high likelihood or reasonable foreseeability federal courts have found with near universal accord that injuries and deaths are not accidental under insurance contracts governed by erisa.see,cozzie metro.life ins,cir weatherall reliastar life ins,d,mullaney aetna healthcare,d,sorrells sun life assurance,d,walker metro.life ins,d,schultz metro.life ins,nelson sun life assurance,miller int l,cates metro.life ins,d,aff,cir fowler metro.life ins.
