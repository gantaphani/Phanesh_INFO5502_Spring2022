this is an appeal from a b dismissal of a qui tam action under the false claims act brought by grubbs against his employer,memorial hermann baptist beaumont hospital,five of the hospital psychiatric doctors,and two other doctors.the action alleges the hospital and doctors billed medicare and medicaid for services not performed.the district court found that the complaint lacked sufficient detail regarding false bills actually presented to the government and dismissed for failure to plead fraud with particularity as required by.b.
the false claims act prohibits,in relevant part,the presentment of a false claim to the government,the use of a false record or statement to get a false claim paid,and conspiracies to get a false claim paid liability for violation includes a liquidated civil penalty and damages,which need not be shown to state a claim but which if shown will be doubled and may be trebled 
the act is remedial,first passed at the behest of president lincoln in to stem widespread fraud by private union army suppliers in civil war defense contracts.it is intended to protect the treasury against the hungry and unscrupulous host that encompasses it on every side.to aid the rooting out of fraud,the act provides for civil suits brought by both the attorney general and by private persons,termed relators,who serve as a posse of ad hoc deputies to uncover and prosecute frauds against the government.in qui suits brought by private persons on behalf of the government the statute entitles the relator to between ten and thirty percent of any recovery made on behalf of the government,depending on the extent of the relator contribution to the action 
according to grubbs qui tam complaint,memorial hermann baptist beaumont hospital hired him in january to work as a psychiatrist.in february,and before his first weekend shift,the complaint alleges that two defendants,groves,the chairman of the medical staff of the hospital psychiatric subsection,and kanneganti,a psychiatrist at the hospital,invited grubbs to dinner at a pappadeaux restaurant.over dinner,the doctors allegedly divulged to him their fraudulent billing scheme and instructed him on how he was to contribute to the scheme.according to grubbs recitation of the conversation,the doctors instructed him that during weekend shifts doctors meet with the nursing staff to get updates on current patients.the doctors then see the patients only as needed or when something acute going on,but bill every day as a regular hospital visit.
grubbs complaint further alleges that over his weekend,the nursing staff did indeed attempt to assist him in recording physician visits that had not occurred and that were based solely on information obtained through nursing contacts with the patients.appalled,grubbs allegedly reported the practice to a hospital administrator the next day,who to grubbs further dismay,retorted you certainly figured that out quickly.
fifteen months later,grubbs filed suit as a qui tam relator alleging violations of the false claims act presentment provision in a,the false record or statement provision in a,and the conspiracy provision in a.in addition to the described scheme,the complaint avers at least one overt act of false billing for each doctor,each similar to this paragraph 
desai billed medicaid for psychotherapy services on january,cpt code,which constituted a false claim in that the medical records indicate that no psychotherapy was provided by desai on that date.
time was given for the united states to intervene but after it did not the district court unsealed the suit.defendants then filed multiple separate motions to dismiss for failure to meet the pleading requirements of.b a magistrate judge recommended dismissal of all claims for failure to plead the circumstances of the alleged fraud with particularity.grubbs filed objections to the report and a motion seeking leave to file a third amended complaint,which he attached.the district court adopted the magistrate report in full and dismissed with prejudice,denying grubb motion for leave to amend.grubbs now appeals.we review the district court grant of defendants motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim de novo 
we have held,along with several of our sister circuits,that a complaint filed under the false claims act must meet the heightened pleading standard of rule b which provides in alleging fraud or mistake,a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.rule b is an exception to rule a simplified pleading that calls for a short and plain statement of the claim.the particularity demanded by rule b is supplemental to the supreme court recent interpretation of rule a requiring enough facts taken as true to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.the twombly standard replaces the lenient and longstanding rule that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.the new reading raises a hurdle in front of what courts had previously seen as a plaintiff nigh immediate access to in its demands but wide in its scope.
in cases of fraud,rule b has long played that screening function,standing as a gatekeeper to discovery,a tool to weed out meritless fraud claims sooner than later.we apply rule b to fraud complaints with bite and without apology,but also aware that rule b supplements but does not supplant rule a notice pleading.rule b does not reflect a subscription to fact pleading and requires only simple,concise,and direct allegations of the circumstances constituting fraud,which after twombly must make relief plausible,not merely conceivable,when taken as true.
courts have attempted to clarify rule b by articulating workable constructions.the frequently stated,standard for a sufficient fraud complaint,the applicability of which to the false claims act we will consider later,instructs a plaintiff to plead the time,place and contents of the false representation,as well as the identity of the person making the misrepresentation and what that person obtained thereby.
several circuits have considered particularity challenges to false claims act complaints,focusing largely on the act presentment requirement.a frequently cited case,and the case primarily relied on by the district court here,is united states ex rel.clausen laboratory corporation of america,in clausen,the eleventh circuit affirmed the dismissal of a complaint in which a company outsider alleged a billing scheme,conveyed to him by a friend,and conclusively stated that the scheme resulted in the defendants submitting bills to the government.the court stated that presentment of a false claim is the sin qua non of a false claims act violation without which there is simply no actionable damage to the public fisc.because of the provision focus on presentment,it held that it is insufficient for a plaintiff merely to describe a private scheme in detail without offering some indicia of reliability that an actual false claim for payment was made to the government the clausen court made plain its position that to plead a presentment claim,the minimum indicia of reliability required to satisfy the particularity standard are the specific contents of actually submitted claims,such as billing numbers,dates,and amounts.
at least two circuits have favorably cited the eleventh circuit clausen rule the first circuit considered a case in which a hospital employee alleged that the hospital was submitting medicare claims for services that were provided improperly or not at all,but could not provide details on specific bills.the first circuit upheld the dismissal because the complaint failed to meet this standard 
a relator must provide details that identify particular false claims for payment that were submitted to the government.in a case such as this,details concerning the dates of the claims,the content of the forms or bills submitted,their identification numbers,the amount of money charged to the government,the particular goods or services for which the government was billed,the individuals involved in the billing,and the length of time between the alleged fraudulent practices and the submission of claims based on those practices are the types of information that may help a relator to state his or her claims with particularity 
the complaint before the first circuit offered few details supporting an inference that bills were presented.as the court stated t he complaint never specifies the dates or content of any particular false or fraudulent claim allegedly submitted for reimbursement by medicare or medicaid.it provides no identification numbers or amounts charged in individual claims for specific tests,supplies,or services.it does not identify or describe the individuals involved in the improper billing or allege with particularity any certification of compliance with federal regulations in order to obtain payments.thus,although the first circuit cites clausen and formulates its own strict standard,the facts before it did not require the court to reach the question of whether all complaints alleging a false claims act presentment claim must include details of specific bills.
the tenth circuit,also citing clausen,and quoting the first circuit standard,has similarly held that a relator complaint against a health insurance company for submitting false claims to the health care financing authority lacked the requisite particularity because it failed to allege the specifics of any actual claims submitted.unfortunately,we can not determine from the facts in that case whether the complaint at issue set forth any indicia that claims were submitted.if so,this would make the demand for billing detail much like the strict requirement of clausen,but as it stands we can not be sure.
while the first and tenth circuits have relied,to a somewhat unclear degree,on clausen,at the same time the eleventh circuit itself has moved away from clausen most exacting language,accepting less billing detail in a case where particular allegations of a scheme offered indicia of reliability that bills were presented.in united states ex rel.walker properties of lake county,the eleventh circuit held that a false claims act complaint met the requisite particularity based on a nurse allegations that she believed the hospital submitted false or fraudulent claims by billing nurses services as if performed by a doctor the nurse did not come forward with any details of the contents of actually submitted claims,alleging only the scheme that,according to an office administrator,nurse and doctor services were billed identically.although the court did not say as much,in the face of strong evidence of a billing scheme in which it was likely,as opposed to speculative,that fraudulent bills were actually submitted,the court found relatively skimpy details about the bills to be sufficient.
while this court has also addressed the sufficiency of false claims act complaints,we are yet to confront squarely with what particularity a complaint must plead the actual details of the false claim itself.it is true that we have said statements or claims are among the circumstances constituting fraud in a false claims act suit,and these must be plead with particularity,but this statement only recited rule b requirement that the circumstances of fraud be pled with particularity it did not speak to the detail required.we now consider that question as presented by this case and do so for sections a separately and in turn.
grubbs complaint first alleges violations of a,which makes liable any person who knowingly presents,or causes to be presented a false claim to the government.this provision includes an express presentment requirement.as the eleventh circuit describes it,the provision sine qua non is the presentment of a false claim.other elements include that the claim was false or fraudulent and that the action was undertaken knowingly.notably,stating a claim under a does not require actual or specific damages,as the statute imposes a liquidated civil penalty on violators.
we have traditionally required that a fraud complaint include the time,place and contents of the false representation,as well as the identity of the person making the misrepresentation and what that person obtained thereby.however,we have acknowledged that rule b ultimate meaning is,and thus there is no single construction of rule b that applies in all contexts.depending on the claim,a plaintiff may sufficiently state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake without including all the details of any single depends on the elements of the claim at hand.
the time,place,contents,and identity standard originated in common law fraud and securities fraud cases making it no surprise that the elements of those claims match the pleading standard requirements.the elements of common law fraud are that a material representation was made the representation was false when the representation was made,the speaker knew it was false or made it recklessly without any knowledge of the truth and as a positive assertion the speaker made the representation with the intent that the other party should act upon it the party acted in reliance on the representation and the party thereby suffered injury.given the elements of reliance and damages,pleading common law fraud with particularity demands the specifics of the false the precise contents of the misrepresentation the plaintiff can not show he relied on the misrepresentation to his detriment.in other words,common law fraud elements of reliance and damages are intertwined with the misrepresentation and heighten the need for attention to the misrepresentation itself.
the false claims act,in contrast,lacks the elements of reliance and damages.rather,it protects the treasury from monetary injury.put plainly,the statute is remedial and exposes even unsuccessful false claims to liability a person that presented fraudulent claims that were never paid remains liable for the act civil penalty.it is adequate to allege that a false claim was knowingly presented regardless of its exact amount the contents of the bill are less significant because a complaint need not allege that the government relied on or was damaged by the false claim.thus,a claim under the false claims act and a claim under common law or securities fraud are not on the same plane in meeting the requirement of stat ing with particularity the contents of the fraudulent misrepresentation.
and surely a procedural rule ought not be read to insist that a plaintiff plead the level of detail required to prevail at trial the false claims act is a civil provision and under section a a plaintiff must prove presentment by a preponderance of the evidence fraudulent presentment requires proof only of the claim falsity,not of its exact contents.if at trial a qui tam plaintiff proves the existence of a billing scheme and offers particular and reliable indicia that false bills were actually submitted as a result of the as dates that services were fraudulently provided or recorded,by whom,and evidence of the department standard billing a reasonable jury could infer that more likely than not the defendant presented a false bill to the government,this despite no evidence of the particular contents of the misrepresentation.of course,the exact dollar amounts fraudulently billed will often surface through discovery and will in most cases be necessary to sufficiently prove actual damages above the act civil penalty.nevertheless,a plaintiff does not necessarily need the exact dollar amounts,billing numbers,or dates to prove to a preponderance that fraudulent bills were actually submitted.to require these details at pleading is one small step shy of requiring production of actual documentation with the complaint,a level of proof not demanded to win at trial and significantly more than any federal pleading rule contemplates 
appellees retort that because presentment is the conduct that gives rise to a liability,rule b demands that it is the contents of the presented bill itself that must be pled with particular detail and not inferred from the circumstances.we must disagree with the sweep of that assertion.stating with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud does not necessarily and always mean stating the contents of a bill.the particular circumstances constituting the fraudulent presentment are often harbored in the scheme.a hand in the cookie jar does not itself amount to fraud separate from the fib that the treat has been earned when in fact the chores remain undone.standing alone,raw with numbers,dates,and not fraud without an underlying scheme to submit the bills for unperformed or unnecessary work.it is the scheme in which particular circumstances constituting fraud may be found that make it highly likely the fraud was consummated through the presentment of false bills.
in sum,the time,place,contents,and identity standard is not a straitjacket for rule b.rather,the rule is context specific and flexible and must remain so to achieve the remedial purpose of the false claim act.we reach for a workable construction of rule b with complaints under the false claims act that is,one that effectuates rule b without stymieing legitimate efforts to expose fraud.we hold that to plead with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud for a false claims act a claim,a relator complaint,if it can not allege the details of an actually submitted false claim,may nevertheless survive by alleging particular details of a scheme to submit false claims paired with reliable indicia that lead to a strong inference that claims were actually submitted.
this standard comports with rule b objectives of ensuring the complaint provides defendants with fair notice of the plaintiffs claims,protects defendants from harm to their reputation and goodwill,reduces the number of strike suits,and prevents plaintiffs from filing baseless claims then attempting to discover unknown wrongs.ultimately,the question is what is required for a ticket to the federal discovery apparatus.
confronting false claims act defendants with both an alleged scheme to submit false claims and details leading to a strong inference that those claims were as dates and descriptions of recorded,but unprovided,services and a description of the billing system that the records were likely entered defendants adequate notice of the claims.in many cases,the defendants will be in possession of the most relevant records,such as patients charts,doctors notes,and internal billing records,with which to defend on the grounds that alleged services were not recorded,were not billed for,or were actually provided 
rule b also prevents nuisance suits and the filing of baseless claims as a pretext to gain access to a fishing expedition.a complaint that includes both particular details of a scheme to present fraudulent bills to the government and allegations making it likely bills were actually submitted limits any fishing to a small pond that is either stocked or dead.defendants either have or do not have evidence that the alleged phony services were actually provided they either have or do not have evidence that recorded,but unprovided or unnecessary,services did not result in bills to the government.discovery can be pointed and efficient,with a summary judgment following on the heels of the complaint if billing records discredit the complaint particularized allegations.that is the balance rule b attempts to strike.and it works best when access to discovery does not inevitably include all discovery powers but is tailored by the district court to the case at hand.and the detail must be sufficient to allow this tailoring.rule b should not be made to shoulder all the burden of policing abusive discovery.its balance draws upon the vigilant hand of the district court judge.
the first circuit points to the government intervention provision in the act as a reason to enhance protection against unfocused discovery it reasons that absent details in the complaint about fraudulent bills submitted by defendants,the government would have to decide whether to intervene on incomplete information.the first circuit acknowledged that the government could intervene after discovery,but argued that by then the government would have lost its opportunity to conduct a confidential investigation on its own time line.even considering the importance of the government ability to intervene,as it is the true party at interest in qui tam actions,we see this is a strained rationale for overly strict pleading.it discourages whistleblowers who may have significant information from coming forward with what they know in order to protect the government ability to intervene on perfect data.such a rule would sweep too far.while rule b stands as a hurdle preventing discovery when a complaint fails to sufficiently define its claims,it does not do away with discovery altogether by allowing access to discovery only when the complaint already contains all the information necessary to succeed at trial.
grubbs complaint satisfies rule b on its a claim as to the individual doctors.the complaint sets out the particular workings of a scheme that was communicated directly to the relator by those perpetrating the fraud.grubbs describes in detail,including the date,place,and participants,the dinner meeting at which two doctors in his section attempted to bring him into the fold of their fraudulent plot.he alleges his experience of the scheme unfolding as it related to him,describing how the weekend nursing staff attempted to assist him in recording physician visits that had not occurred.also alleged are specific dates that each doctor falsely claimed to have provided services to patients and often the type of medical service or its current procedural terminology code that would have been used in the bill.
taking the allegations of the scheme and the relator own alleged experience as true,as we must on a motion to dismiss,and considering the complaint list of dates that specified,unprovided services were recorded amounts to more than probable,nigh likely,circumstantial evidence that the doctors fraudulent records caused the hospital billing system in due course to present fraudulent claims to the government.it would stretch the imagination to infer the inverse that the defendant doctors go through the charade of meeting with newly hired doctors to describe their fraudulent practice and that they continually record unprovided services only for the scheme to deviate from the regular billing track at the last moment so that the recorded,but unprovided,services never get billed.that fraudulent bills were presented to the government is the logical conclusion of the particular allegations in grubbs complaint even though it does not include exact billing numbers or amounts.
regarding the hospital,however,the complaint fails because there is no indication that the hospital itself acted with the requisite intent.under all sections of the false claims act,the defendant must act with the purpose of getting a false claim paid by the government.grubbs did not plead,argue at the district court,or on appeal that the hospital was vicariously liable for the actions of the doctors or nurses.without an attributed liability theory,no allegations in the complaint allow a reasonable inference that the hospital had the requisite intent.the hospital may have been inadvertently and in the normal course of business processing the claims of services fraudulently exaggerated by its doctors.we have no basis for inferring otherwise.
however,in light of the survival of the a claims against the individual doctors,in fairness grubbs should be granted leave to amend his complaint regarding his a claims against the hospital 
we now turn to a,which imposes civil liability on any person who knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the government.the district court dismissed grubbs a claims for the same reason it dismissed the a claims the complaint failed to allege details of fraudulent bills actually presented to the government.this was error.as the supreme court recently settled t he concept of presentment is not mentioned in a.the inclusion of an express presentment requirement in subsection a,combined with the absence o
