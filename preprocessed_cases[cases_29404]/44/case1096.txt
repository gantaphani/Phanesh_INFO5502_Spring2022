plaintiff,iman sharif,appeals from a jury verdict in favor of northampton county prison officers on sharif excessive force claim.on appeal,sharif argues that the district court erred in admitting evidence of sharif prior plea of nolo contendere and resulting conviction for assault in connection with the incident that is at the heart of his claim.he notes that federal rule of evidence prohibits the admission of his nolo plea.he also urges that the court abused its discretion under federal rule of evidence in admitting evidence of the conviction as relevant to his credibility.
factual background 
on march,iman sharif was an inmate at the northampton county prison.he was housed in the restrictive housing unit rhu where defendant appellees corrections officers nathan picone,thomas pinto,and brian potance were all on duty.while.picone was collecting dinner trays,he claims that sharif sucker punched him.in contrast,sharif claims that.picone initiated the altercation by punching sharif first.
picone testified that once he was struck,he attempted to protect himself from additional punches and kicks.he further testified that potance,who was assigned to help picone retrieve dinner trays,entered sharif cell and attempted to restrain sharif.at this point,picone hit sharif in the head with an open hand in an effort to get him to the ground.conversely,sharif asserted that once.picone began to hit him.potance and.pinto entered his cell and joined in the attack by choking him.
following the altercation,sharif was handcuffed and moved to a suicide cell.according to appellees,this was for his own safety however,he continued to cause commotion so he was moved to a restraint chair.sharif contends that while he was in the restraint chair,he was punched repeatedly by unnamed corrections officers,all of which was observed and permitted by appellee defendant lieutenant joseph kospiah.
sharif was charged with aggravated assault pursuant to.a as a result of the altercation with picone,potance and pinto.sharif entered a plea of nolo contendere and was convicted under the statute as charged sharif excessive force claim under is based on this incident.
procedural history 
sharif brought this action alleging that picone,potance and pinto are liable for attacking him in his cell in violation of his eighth amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.further,he contends that kospiah is liable for allowing the physical abuse to proceed while sharif was restrained.sharif sought relief of nominal,compensatory,and punitive damages for appellees actions against him.
sharif filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of his nolo contendere plea under rule.the court noted that sharif planned to take the stand and deny any wrongdoing in connection with the altercation.the court stated that if that were to happen,then evidence of his plea may end up being relevant and would thus be admitted.during a hearing on the motion,the court accepted appellees counsel argument that it would be inconsistent to allow sharif to have taken the position in a prior court proceeding that he was going to contest the charges.in other words,the plea would be admitted as inconsistent with his assertion at trial that he had done nothing wrong and,therefore,as relevant to the issue of his credibility.
pursuant to the court ruling,during of sharif,appellees counsel twice referred to sharif plea of nolo contendere to suggest that the plea was inconsistent with his statement at trial that he had done nothing wrong.we quote directly from the trial transcript 
q you stand before this jury and you have testified that you did absolutely nothing wrong,correct 
q the officers just came in and struck you for no reason 
q yet,in another court at another time you had an opportunity to say the same thing,correct 
q you were criminally charged with assaulting officer picone,correct 
q and you did contest those charges 
q you pled no contest 
q sure.now,i want to get back to the first incident.it your testimony as to the first part,the incident with picone,that he came in,struck you,you had absolutely done nothing wrong,correct 
a wrong morally,like i did,i tried to get under his skin,i did talk about him.
q right,but you did nothing physical 
q you did not strike him first 
q okay.but,that what you were charged with,correct,striking him first,that what you were criminally charged with 
a that what objection 
q sure.you were charged with striking officer picone,correct 
a i was charged with assaulting him,yes.
q assaulting him.okay.but,your testimony here today is you did not assault him in any way,shape,or form 
a and that objection regarding the definition of assault under this statute,assault of an employee of the state 
a you asked me if i assaulted him 
a the same thing that i said before,i did not hit officer picone.
q but,you did not contest in the criminal case that you assaulted him,correct 
in his closing,counsel again referenced sharif nolo plea,stating 
he says he did do a darn thing that day yet when he had an opportunity in another court proceeding to contest that he did do what he was accused of doing,he did contest it yet he comes in here in another court proceeding and takes a different position.that should speak volumes about his credibility.
during trial,the district court allowed appellees to introduce evidence of sharif five prior convictions,including the conviction for assault resulting from his nolo plea,pursuant to the court denial of sharif motion in limine in which sharif urged that the minimal probative value of these convictions was outweighed by their prejudicial effect.the other convictions were for simple assault and for false reporting to a police officer.the convictions were all admitted for the purpose of assessing sharif character for truthfulness.
the court instructed the jury as to the purpose for which past convictions were admitted into evidence you may wish to consider those convictions as you weigh his credibility as a witness.the court explained that one of the convictions was the result of a nolo contendere plea which,according to the court,could be used only to evaluate sharif credibility.t hose incidents of prior convictions are admitted for the sole purpose for you,the jury,to use if you so desire to consider the credibility of the witness.the jury returned a verdict against sharif,and this timely appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to.we have jurisdiction over sharif appeal pursuant to.
a district court interpretation of the federal rules of evidence is reviewed de novo.united states furst,cir.the application of a particular rule by a district court is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.united states baiter,cir.
rule admissibility of the nolo contendere plea 
sharif urges that the district court erred in allowing evidence of his plea of nolo contendere to be admitted because rule bars such admission.rule states,in relevant part,i n a civil or criminal case,evidence of a nolo contendere plea is not admissible against the defendant who made the plea.a see also.f the admissibility or inadmissibility of a plea is governed by federal rule of evidence.plea of nolo contendere excluded from exceptions to hearsay rule.this prohibition is based on the fact that a nolo plea is not a factual admission that the pleader committed a crime.rather,it is a statement of unwillingness to contest the government charges and an acceptance of the punishment that would be meted out to a guilty person.olsen correiro,cir see also north carolina alford,d throughout its history the plea of nolo contendere has been viewed not as an express admission of guilt but as a consent by the defendant that he may be punished as if he were guilty and a prayer for leniency.an important policy consideration animating rule is that it encourages compromise in criminal cases,which,in turn,lessens the burden on courts,defendants and prosecutors,producing a more efficient criminal justice system.see olsen,at a second reason behind rule exclusion of nolo pleas is a desire to encourage compromise resolution of criminal cases.see also d criminal law a plea of nolo contendere is used by the accused in criminal cases to save face and avoid exacting an admission that could be used as an admission in other potential litigation,to avoid trial with its attendant expense and adverse publicity in the event of a conviction.thus,the use of a nolo plea as tantamount to an admission of guilt would defeat one of its primary purposes.
despite rule apparent clear command,there is caselaw supporting the admission of a defendant nolo plea in certain circumstances in walker schaeffer,cir,two african american men were threatened and harassed by a mob of several hundred white high school students in a mcdonald parking lot.id.at.as they attempted to flee the parking lot,they were arrested for disorderly conduct and reckless driving.id.at.after pleading no contest to these charges,the defendants sued the arresting police officers for false arrest and wrongful imprisonment.id.the police officers asserted a qualified immunity defense.to determine whether they were entitled to this defense,the court examined whether the officers had violated the plaintiffs clearly established rights.id.at.the court found that the plaintiffs were estopped from arguing that their rights had been violated because,by pleading nolo contendere,they had in effect,admitted facts in open court evidencing their guilt.id.at.
the walker court went beyond the issue of collateral estoppel when it stated that its decision was not barred by rule 
rule was intended to protect a criminal defendant use of the nolo contendere plea to defend himself from future civil liability.we decline to interpret the rule so as to allow the former defendants to use the plea offensively,in order to obtain damages,after having admitted facts which would indicate no civil liability on the part of the arresting police.
this language has been cited by district courts within our circuit,as well as by the tenth circuit,for the proposition that nolo contendere pleas are not always precluded by rule,particularly when a pleader attempts to bring a claim against officials for false arrest,false imprisonment or malicious prosecution see rose uniroyal goodrich tire,cir reasoning that the nolo contendere plea was not being admitted against the defendant in the civil action douglas public safety comm n,wl,at,finding walker to be instructive and persuasive domitrovich monaca,wl,at,relying on walker to hold that prior nolo plea barred claims for malicious prosecution and false arrest.
we view walker as imprecise,and in any event,distinguishable.first,walker reference to a defendant having admitted facts through a nolo plea,at,misconstrues the nature of the plea.indeed,we held in united states adedoyin,cir,that a nolo plea is not an admission.see also united states poellnitz,cir while a nolo plea is indisputably tantamount to a conviction,it is not necessarily tantamount to an admission of factual guilt.second,the logic of walker seems to flow from the supreme court decision in heck humphrey,d,where the court held that when a claim amounts to a collateral attack on a criminal conviction,the conviction or sentence must be reversed,or invalidated by other means,before a court can entertain the claim similarly,the collateral attack in walker would not be permitted,presumably,as a matter of fairness,outweighing the dictates of the federal rules of evidence.but we need not decide whether rule stands as a bar to the admission of a nolo plea when a defendant levels a collateral attack on his prior conviction.
we need not decide that question because even appellees concede that sharif claim of excessive force does not amount to a collateral attack on his aggravated assault conviction.they further concede that he did not admit any facts which would indicate no civil liability on the part of the corrections officers.walker,at.indeed,we held in nelson jashurek,that heck does not bar an excessive force claim because the claim can stand without challenging any element of the conviction,cir t here undoubtedly could be substantial force which is objectively reasonable and substantial force which is excessive and unreasonable.internal quotation marks omitted see also thomas roach,cir plaintiff claim predicated on excessive force during his arrest is not barred by his nolo contendere plea to the offense for which he was arrested.regardless of whether he engaged in assaultive conduct,sharif remains free to contend that the reaction of the corrections officers was such that it constituted excessive force in comparison to the threat he posed.thus,walker is distinguishable from this case.
district courts within the third circuit that have chosen to consider or admit past nolo pleas,have done so largely on the basis of collateral estoppel principles discussed in heck.as explained above,those principles are not applicable in this case,particularly given our holding in nelson that heck does not bar an excessive force claim because such a claim would not negate any element of the conviction.nelson,at.given these considerations,we hold that rule barred the admission of sharif plea of nolo contendere.
the admission of sharif plea of nolo contendere was not harmless error.see glass phila,cir in reviewing evidentiary rulings,if we find nonconstitutional error in a civil suit,such error is harmless only if it is highly probable that the error did not affect the outcome of the case.quoting lockhart westinghouse credit,cir.first and foremost,the district court clearly ruled that the nolo plea should be admitted,and used by the jury,to assess sharif credibility because his trial statement was inconsistent with his previous nolo plea.but this is incorrect.indeed,a significant basis for prohibiting the evidence of the plea is the fear that it could be improperly viewed as an admission,and,unfortunately,that is how the district court viewed it.this was reversible error.
in adedoyin,which was controlling authority at the time of the district court decision,we unmistakably held that,with respect to a criminal charge,a nolo plea does not admit underlying facts or guilt.at a plea of nolo contendere is not an admission of guilt and thus the fact that a defendant made such a plea can not be used to demonstrate that he was guilty of the crime in question.see also poellnitz,at while a nolo plea is indisputably tantamount to a conviction,it is not necessarily tantamount to an admission of factual guilt.consequently,sharif claim that he did nothing wrong was not inconsistent with his previous plea of nolo contendere,and,thus,would not be relevant in assessing his character for truthfulness.
moreover,insofar as it went to credibility,the appellees line of questioning was very damaging.sharif was the only witness who testified on his behalf.his credibility was of the utmost importance to his case.by admitting his prior nolo plea,in violation of rule,the district court allowed appellees to severely undermine sharif credibility.this damage was particularly acute given the method by which counsel strategically used the nolo plea to make sharif appear untruthful as to the incident at issue as sharif points out,appellees argued that sharif statements in this case should not be believed because they were contrary to his decision to plead nolo in his criminal case.appellant reply br.at.for these reasons,we can not say that the error did not affect the outcome of the case.
finally,appellees urge that it would be unfair to exclude sharif nolo plea.appellees br.at to ignore his nolo contendere plea and attempt to keep from the jury that he,in a previous legal proceeding,and under oath,took a contrary position,would be inconsistent and dishonest on the part of the plaintiff.but this argument regarding inconsistency demonstrates how appellees misconstrue the very meaning of a nolo plea and one of the purposes of excluding such pleas from evidence.a nolo plea reflects a prosecutorial choice to permit a defendant to persist in not admitting the crime for the sake of obtaining the conviction.thus,there is no inconsistency or contrary position at all.
