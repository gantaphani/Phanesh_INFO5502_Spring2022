this court previous opinion is hereby withdrawn,and the following opinion is substituted 
in this consolidated appeal of two state actions that were removed to different district courts,addie holmes appeals the denial of her motion to remand and the dismissal of her jones act and general maritime law personal injury suit against,atlantic sounding,atlantic,her nominal payroll employer,and weeks marine,weeks,for which she was actually performing services at the time in question.the dispositive an unpowered floatable structure like weeks quarterbarge the,on which holmes was working when injured,is a vessel for jones act not one of first impression in this circuit.we resolved this issue in gremillion gulf coast catering answering the question in the negative however,the supreme court recent decision in stewart dutra construction calls into question the analysis underlying our holding in gremillion.we therefore must determine what effect,if any,stewart has on this aspect of our vessel jurisprudence.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the is a vessel for purposes of the jones act.we therefore reverse the district courts judgments and orders adverse to holmes and remand these cases to those courts for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
holmes sued atlantic and weeks collectively,appellees in louisiana state court seeking damages for injuries that she allegedly sustained on her first day of work as a cook aboard the.holmes is a louisiana domiciliary.both atlantic and weeks are new jersey corporations with their principal place of business in cranford,new jersey.
the is feet long and feet wide.it is,in effect,a floating dormitory,a barge on the deck of which a,quarters package is mounted.weeks causes the to be moved from place to place to house and feed employees during dredging projects at various locations.the has sleeping quarters on both stories,as well as toilet facilities,a galley,locker rooms,freshwater deck tanks,electrical generators,and a gangway with railings.the entire crew consists of two cooks and two janitors.there is no record evidence that they are transported on the while it is moved from one site to another.
the is towed by tugs between project locations.it is sometimes towed by itself and,at times,together with other barges.weeks temporarily installs running lights on the when it is to be towed by itself.when the is not in use,it is held in a boat slip at weeks facility in houma,louisiana.at the time of holmes accident,the was moored in a private boat slip at holly beach in cameron parish while the crew of weeks dredge worked in the gulf of mexico.the arrived at holly beach in august and had not moved before holmes accident the following month.
the has never been inspected by or registered with the coast guard.it is not intended to transport personnel,equipment,passengers,or cargo,and no evidence in the record reflects that it has ever done so.it is not fitted out with winches,running lights,a radar,a compass,engines,navigational aids,global positioning system,lifeboats,or steering equipment such as rudders.it is incapable of has no captain,engineer,or deckhand has no bilge pumps or wing tanks and has never been offshore.

holmes alleges that when she attempted to place her belongings in her locker on the,both the locker and a television set that was on top of it fell on her as she opened the locker door.she alleges further that the accident caused injuries to her neck,shoulder,ears,and nose and caused dizziness as well.
holmes sued atlantic and weeks in louisiana state court,asserting claims under the jones and general maritime law.she later filed a second suit in louisiana state court against atlantic,seeking maintenance and cure.
these cases were removed to different federal district courts.in their respective removal notices,atlantic and weeks advanced that holmes fraudulently pleaded a jones act claim to prevent removal to federal court and that diversity jurisdiction existed under.holmes responded with motions to remand both suits.the magistrate judge ordered the parties to brief the issue of jones act liability.
after discovery and briefing were complete,the magistrate judge issued reports and recommendations in both suits,proposing that the district courts deny holmes motions to remand and enter judgments in favor of weeks and atlantic.the magistrate judge concluded that the is not a vessel for purposes of the jones act,holmes could not establish any possibility of recovery under the jones act,and as diversity jurisdiction existed,removal was proper.holmes timely objected to the magistrate judge report and recommendation.
in june,the district court to which holmes maintenance and cure suit against atlantic had been removed adopted the report and recommendation and issued a partial final judgment in favor of atlantic.after holmes conceded that no other viable claims remained,the district court amended the partial final judgment to reflect its finality.
one month later,the district court to which holmes jones act and general maritime law suit against weeks and atlantic had been removed adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation,denied holmes motion to remand,and dismissed her jones act claim.the court certified the partial final judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b.holmes timely filed notices of appeal in both courts.we consolidated the appeals of these two cases.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the denial of a motion to remand de novo we also review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo whether an unconventional craft is a vessel is an issue that is generally resolved as a matter of law,although we have recognized that at the margin,fact issues may be presented.
generally,jones act cases are not removable from state court a fraudulently pleaded jones act claim does not,however,bar removal a defendant may pierce the pleadings to show that the jones act claim has been fraudulently pleaded to prevent removal.the district court may use a summary procedure to determine whether a plaintiff has fraudulently pleaded a jones act claim the court may deny remand where,but only where,resolving all disputed facts and ambiguities in current substantive law in plaintiff favor,the court determines that the plaintiff has no possibility of establishing a jones act claim on the merits.
to qualify as a seaman under the jones act,an employee must first demonstrate that his duties contribute to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission.second,a seaman must have a connection to a vessel in navigation or an identifiable group of vessels that is substantial in terms of both its duration and its nature.atlantic and weeks contend only that the is not a vessel under the jones act.accordingly,if atlantic and weeks carry their burden and demonstrate that there exists no genuine issue of material fact as to the vessel status,removal was proper,as was dismissal.for the following reasons,we find that the is a vessel for jones act purposes.accordingly,we vacate the district courts denials of holmes motions to remand,and we remand to those courts for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
our vessel jurisprudence 
the existence of a vessel is a fundamental prerequisite to jones act jurisdiction and is at the core of the test for seaman status.the term vessel has,however,escaped precise definition.the exotic watercraft that have been deemed vessels and the heavy inquiry that surrounds each analysis of an unconventional craft status has led even this court to recognize that the three men in a tub would fit within our definition of a jones act seaman,and one probably could make a convincing case for jonah inside the whale.
historically,we have noted that the term vessel connotes a
