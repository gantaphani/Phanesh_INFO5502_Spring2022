defendants douglas weidner,kathleen weidner,and dmw marine,llc dmw,appeal from the order of the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania granting plaintiff deborah klein motion for summary judgment as to her claim that weidner transfer of a parcel of real estate to himself and weidner as tenants by the entirety violated the pennsylvania uniform fraudulent transfer act pufta.they also appeal from the subsequent order entering judgment pursuant to the district court decision on partial summary judgment,which specifically ordered the weidners to execute a deed transferring this parcel of real estate to weidner in fee simple.in addition,appellants challenge the district court order directing that judgment of in punitive damages be entered against weidner for his pufta violations.we will affirm.
in,klein and weidner obtained a divorce in california.as part of this divorce decree,the orange county superior court ordered weidner to make spousal and child support payments to klein.appellants acknowledge that weidner made some child support payments but had paid no spousal support as of the date of trial in this case.appellants brief at citing klein weidner,civil action,wl,at,klein iii.weidner and weidner,his current wife,were aware of klein claim that weidner owed her spousal and child support at the time they married on january.id.at citing klein iii,wl,at.on june,the orange county superior court determined that weidner owed klein in unpaid spousal and child support.a judgment in this amount was entered in the chester county court of common pleas on august.

klein alleged in the first count of her amended complaint that weidner transfer of the property violated the pufta.on january,the district court granted her motion for summary judgment as to this claim because weidner transfer of the property satisfies all three of the fraudulent transfers described by pufta.klein weidner,civil action,wl,at,klein i.according to the district court,the transfer constituted an actual fraudulent transfer under.ann.a and a constructive fraudulent transfer under.ann.a and.on january,the district court entered an order for entry of judgment pursuant to the district court partial summary judgment decision,and the weidners were ordered to execute a deed transferring the property back to weidner in fee simple by,january.
klein also attacked weidner transfer of an ownership interest in dmw and attempted to pierce dmw corporate veil.the district court denied klein motion for summary judgment as to these counts in klein following a bench trial,it entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law on february.according to the district court,the transfer of the ownership interest in dmw to the weidners as joint owners just like the transfer of the property to the couple as tenants by the entirety constituted both an actual and a constructive fraudulent transfer under sections a,a,and of the pufta.the district court also determined that weidner has improperly used the llc form to perpetrate an injustice and therefore klein may the corporate veil and treat dmw assets as weidner assets for the purpose of collecting her judgment against weidner.klein weidner,civil action,wl,at,klein ii.judgment was entered against weidner,weidner,and dmw on the second and third counts,and the parties were directed to brief the issue of whether punitive damages should be awarded and,if so,in what amount.

we exercise plenary review over a district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same standard that the district court should have applied.see,farrell planters lifesavers,cir.as the district court noted,s ummary judgment may be granted only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.klein i,wl,at quoting.c.
a.the property transfer claim 
appellants argue that the district court committed reversible error by granting summary judgment on klein claim that the transfer of the property violated the pufta.we nevertheless agree with the district court that this action constituted an actual fraudulent transfer as well as a constructive fraudulent transfer.
the district court began with the actual fraudulent transfer category.section a states that a transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor,whether the creditor claim arose before or after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred,if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation with actual intent to hinder,delay or defraud any creditor of the debtor.section b then lists a number of factors the badges of fraud that may be considered in determining whether the debtor had an actual intent to hinder,delay or defraud one or more creditors.ann.cmt.these section b factors include 
the transfer or obligation was to an insider 
the debtor retained possession or control of the property transferred after the transfer 
the transfer or obligation was disclosed or concealed 
before the transfer was made or obligation was incurred,the debtor had been sued or threatened with suit 
the transfer was of substantially all the debtor assets 
the debtor absconded 
the debtor removed or concealed assets 
the value of the consideration received by the debtor was reasonably equivalent to the value of the asset transferred or the amount of the obligation incurred 
the debtor was insolvent or became insolvent shortly after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred 
the transfer occurred shortly before or shortly after a substantial debt was incurred and 
the debtor transferred the essential assets of the business to a lienor who transferred the assets to an insider of the debtor.
proof of the existence of any one or more of the factors enumerated in subsection b may be relevant evidence as to the debtor actual intent but does not create a presumption that the debtor has made a fraudulent transfer or incurred a fraudulent obligation.ann.cmt.the court should take into account all of the relevant circumstances in applying these statutory factors.see.ann.cmt.
although appellants argue at some length that there were genuine issues of material fact as to several section b factors,we conclude that the district court did not commit any reversible error given the undisputed evidence in the record.
initially,it is undisputed that the transfer was to an insider under section b namely,weidner own spouse and that weidner retained possession or control of the property transferred after the transfer pursuant to section b.with respect to section b,both weidner as well as weidner knew at the time of their marriage that klein claimed that weidner owed both spousal and child support.appellants also acknowledge that there had been an ongoing dispute since regarding the amount of support arrearages weidner owed klein appellants brief at citing klein i,wl,at and that weidner made some child support payments but had paid no spousal support as of the date of trial in this case id.at citing klein iii,wl,at.with respect to whether the transfer was of substantially all the debtor assets under section b,appellants contend that the property did not constitute an asset because it was subject to a mortgage at the time of its transfer and the statutory definition of asset excludes property to the extent it is encumbered by a valid lien.ann.b.even with the mortgage which klein granted to his mother as part of his purchase of the property from her,it appears undisputed that there was still of equity in the property itself.while appellants contend that,among other things,weidner paid over for improvements to the property,reasonably equivalent value is measured from klein perspective,not the weidners.klein i,wl,at citing in re walter,in re erie marine.the transfer to the weidners as tenants by the entirety removed the property from klein reach,and weidner payments and any promises she made to pay for renovations therefore could not constitute reasonably equivalent value under section b.see,united states parcel of real property known as lincoln,cir noting that tenant by entirety is protected against levy upon property by creditor.weidner also indicated in his own deposition testimony that he held no assets in only his name after he transferred the property and the dmw interest to himself and weidner.weidner accordingly was insolvent or became insolvent shortly after the transfer was made pursuant to section b.
ultimately,the first,second,fourth,fifth,eighth,and ninth statutory factors indicated that the transfer at issue here was actually fraudulent.in addition to the statutory badges of fraud,the district court also looked to weidner own words and conduct as evidence of his intent.klein i,wl,at.for example,weidner stated in a to klein that he would never ever give her a red cent again and klein would never ever see a penny from him again.id.at citing.weidner california attorney likewise notified his counterpart that i have been informed by weidner that his assets that do exist have been protected in such a way that while the children will be provided for,it will be impossible for klein to recover any of the court ordered arrearages.id.citing letter.given these undisputed circumstances,the district court properly concluded that weidner transferred the property with an actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud.
under section a,a transfer or obligation is constructively fraudulent as to present and future creditors if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation 
without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation,and the debtor 
i was engaged or was about to engage in a business or transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction or 
ii intended to incur,or believed or reasonably should have believed that the debtor would incur,debts beyond the debtor ability to pay as they became due.
section states the following 
a transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor whose claim arose before the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation and the debtor was insolvent at that time or the debtor became insolvent as a result of the transfer or obligation.
in applying these constructive fraudulent transfer provisions,the district court relied on the same basic line of reasoning it applied in concluding that the transfer was actually fraudulent pursuant to section a.given our discussion of the actual fraudulent transfer category,we agree that weidner transferred the property without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange,his transfer of the property and the dmw interest rendered him insolvent,he either believed or should have believed that he would incur debts beyond his ability to pay,and klein herself was a present creditor at the time of the transfer.
appellants take issue with the district court failure to consider weidner as an alleged good faith transferee under.ann.a.this subsection states that a transfer or obligation is not fraudulent under section a relating to transfers fraudulent as to present and future creditors against a person who took in good faith and for a reasonably equivalent value or against any subsequent transferee or obligee.we have already explained that weidner did not provide reasonably equivalent value,and we accordingly reject appellants invocation of this defense 
availability of punitive damages under the pufta 
it appears undisputed that neither this court nor any pennsylvania appellate court has addressed the specific question of whether or not punitive damages are available under the pufta or the pufca.we predict that the pennsylvania supreme court would answer this question in the affirmative.
following the example set by appellants themselves,we turn to the general rules of statutory construction set forth in pennsylvania statutory construction act of.the object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the general assembly.ann.a.accordingly,e very statute shall be construed,if possible,to give effect to all its provisions.id.conversely,w hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity,the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.ann.b.when the words of the statute are not explicit,the intention of the general assembly may be ascertained by considering,inter alia,the occasion and necessity for the statute,the circumstances under which it was enacted,the mischief to be remedied,the object to be attained,the former law,and the consequences of a particular interpretation.ann.c.in short,the court should consider the nature and purpose of the statute.appellants specifically emphasize.ann,entitled statutory remedy preferred over common law.this general rule of statutory construction states that 
in all cases where a remedy is provided or a duty is enjoined or anything is directed to be done by any statute,the directions of the statute shall be strictly pursued,and no penalty shall be inflicted,or anything done agreeably to the common law,in such cases,further than shall be necessary for carrying such statute in effect.
the pennsylvania statutory construction act further provides that s tatutes uniform with those of other states shall be interpreted and construed to effect their general purpose to make uniform the laws of those states which enact them.ann.
ann.governs the remedies of creditors under the pufta 
a available remedies.in an action for relief against a transfer or obligation under this chapter,a creditor,subject to the limitations in sections relating to defenses,liability and protection of transferee and relating to extinguishment of cause of action,may obtain 
avoidance of the transfer or obligation to the extent necessary to satisfy the creditor claim.
an attachment or other provisional remedy against the asset transferred or other property of the transferee in accordance with the procedure prescribed by applicable law.
subject to applicable principles of equity and in accordance with applicable rules of civil procedure 
i an injunction against further disposition by the debtor or a transferee,or both,of the asset transferred or of other property 
ii appointment of a receiver to take charge of the asset transferred or of other property of the transferee or 
iii any other relief the circumstances may require.
b execution.if a creditor has obtained a judgment on a claim against the debtor,the creditor,if the court so orders,subject to the limitations of sections and,may levy execution on the asset transferred or its proceeds.
in turn.ann.defenses,liability and protection of transferee includes the following subsection 
b judgment for certain voidable transfers.except as otherwise provided in this section,to the extent a transfer is voidable in an action by a creditor under section a relating to remedies of creditors,the creditor may recover judgment for the value of the asset transferred,as adjusted under subsection c,or the amount necessary to satisfy the creditor claim,whichever is less.the judgment may be entered against 
the first transferee of the asset or the person for whose benefit the transfer was made or 
any subsequent transferee other than a good faith transferee who took for value or from any subsequent transferee.
if the judgment under subsection b is based upon the value of the asset transferred,the judgment must be for an amount equal to the value of the asset at the time of the transfer,subject to adjustment as the equities may require.ann.c.the pufta also includes a supplementary provisions section.pursuant to.ann,u nless displaced by the provisions of this chapter,the principles of law and equity,including the law merchant and the law relating to principal and agent,estoppel,laches,fraud,misrepresentation,duress,coercion,mistake,insolvency or other validating or invalidating cause,supplement its provisions.
in addition to the pennsylvania statutory construction act,appellants turn for support to the statutory language,nature,and purposes of the pufta as well as case law addressing the pufta,the pufca,and other allegedly similar pennsylvania statutory schemes.they additionally look to the law in other jurisdictions that have adopted the ufca and the ufta.moody,at citation omitted.with respect to pennsylvania case law,appellants place particular emphasis on the pennsylvania supreme court decision in schline kline,which discussed the pufca,and its more recent ruling in hoy angelone,which held that punitive damages are not available under the pennsylvania human relations act phra.according to appellants,the pennsylvania supreme court,in cases like hoy,has decided that punitive damages are unavailable in statutory actions unless the statute expressly provides for such damages.with respect to the pufta itself,appellants emphasize the remedial nature and purposes of this fraudulent transfer statute.they believe that the remedies are all focused upon preservation of assets and making the creditor no more.appellants brief at.the pufta accordingly does not expressly state that punitive damages may be awarded.appellants,in turn,claim that section a provides that transfers and obligations may be avoided only to the extent necessary to satisfy the creditor claim and that section b limits the monetary damages that a creditor may recover.according to appellants,punitive damages were not required to afford klein the remedies of pufta,t he common law principles of punitive damages conflict with and far exceed the remedies available under pufta because such remedies are designed to compensate plaintiffs to the extent of the value of the transferred property,while at the same time,protecting not punishing transferees,and an award of punitive damages under pufta is inappropriate because it exceeds that which is necessary to obtain the protections of the statute.id.at,citations omitted.
having considered the various contentions raised by the parties as well as the district court own reasoning,we predict that the pennsylvania supreme court would conclude that punitive damages are available under the pufta.we make this prediction based on the actual language of the statute itself especially the provision in section a iii.we also rely on the nature and purposes of this uniform statutory scheme as well as prior case law from pennsylvania and other jurisdictions.
as an initial matter,we do not believe that schline has much,if any,bearing on the present inquiry.appellants turn to a single sentence from this opinion as this act does not specify a particular course of procedure,that previously existing and any necessary modification thereof may be adopted,in order to enable the one attacking the conveyance to obtain the rights accorded by the statute.schline,at.the state supreme court actually disposed of the appeal in that case on different grounds,before briefly calling attention to the pufca because the case goes back for a trial.id.more importantly,it did not actually identify the rights accorded by the statute and therefore did not consider whether such rights could include punitive damages.if anything,the schline court seemed to be more concerned with the proper procedure to use,that previously existing and any necessary modification thereof than the actual forms of relief available under the pufca itself.
in hoy,the state supreme court did consider the availability of punitive damages under pennsylvania statute.in a rather lengthy opinion,the hoy court specifically addressed the following statutory provision 
if the court finds that the respondent has engaged in or is engaging in an unlawful discriminatory practice charged in the complaint,the court shall enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful discriminatory practice and order affirmative action which may include,but is not limited to,reinstatement or hiring of employes,granting of back pay,or any other legal or equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.back pay liability shall not accrue from a date more than three years prior to the filing of a complaint charging violations of this act.
hoy,at quoting.stat.ann.c.the pennsylvania supreme court held that,i n the absence of express statutory language or any further legislative guidance,punitive damages are not available under the phra.id.at.
the court began by noting that the pennsylvania general assembly was free to provide for punitive damages under the phra and that a cursory survey of other statutory enactments revealed that it knew how to do so in clear and unambiguous terms.id.at.thus,as a starting point,it is reasonable to infer that the general assembly use of specific language to permit the award of punitive damages in numerous statutes reflects an intention to allow such a remedy only when expressly provided for.id.at.asking the court to read this remedy into the statute,the plaintiff focused on the any other legal or equitable relief language as well as the statute liberal construction requirement.id.pursuant to the canon of ejusdem generis g eneral words shall be construed to take their meanings and be restricted by preceding particular words,id.quoting.b,the state supreme court turned to the introductory phrase affirmative action as well as the specific examples provided thereafter.id.at.indeed,to focus solely on the phrase any other legal and equitable relief and contend that any and all remedies are available under the act would be to relegate the introductory phrase affirmative action to mere surplusage,an approach which we are not at liberty to take.id.at citing.ann.thus,the seemingly limitless phrase any other legal or equitable relief must be construed in this light.id.at.the hoy court concluded that the phrase any other legal or equitable relief is clearly a subset of the affirmative action which a court may order,and it therefore considered whether punitive damages are properly awarded as affirmative action for purposes of the act.id.according to the state supreme court,the phra constitutes a remedial statute whose purpose is to protect the rights of individuals to obtain and hold a job without discrimination and to foster the employment of all individuals in accordance with their abilities,regardless of their sex or similar characteristics.id.the statutory provision thereby offers various examples of measures,reinstatement,hiring,and back pay.id.accordingly,affirmative action contemplates make whole measures and remedial action.id.on the other hand,punitive damages,which are based on the defendant culpability and are purely penal in nature,are not consistent with this goal of achieving the remedial purposes of the statute and are not a remedy.id.while punitive damages also serve to deter,simply put,we do not consider punitive damages to be consistent with the remedial nature of the act.id.instead,the pennsylvania supreme court believed that,when interpreted in the context of contemplated affirmative action,the phrase any other legal or equitable relief does not include punitive damages.id.
the hoy court reached the following conclusion in sum,we are of the view that the legislature silence on the issue of punitive damages,together with the statutory language,interpreted consistent with the laws of statutory construction and in the context of the nature and purpose of the act,requires the conclusion that the legislature did not intend to permit the award of exemplary damages.id.although not necessary to its disposition,it also addressed the other arguments advanced by the parties,including the plaintiff theory that public policy requires the remedy of exemplary damages.id.at.the court did not dispute the premise that punitive damages would deter discrimination.id.nevertheless,it believed that such a premise is insufficient to support an inference that the general assembly intended an award of punitive damages given the extraordinary nature of such relief.id.according to the pennsylvania supreme court,punitive damages are not absolutely necessary to achieve the act goals of eliminating discrimination and redressing injury because the courts already possess broad authority under the statutory scheme to fashion remedies that discourage discrimination and restore the injured party,the phra expressly permits injunctive relief,reinstatement,hiring,and an award of back pay.id.while it can be persuasively argued that punitive damages are entirely appropriate,and even necessary,we do not sit as a super legislature.id.
especially in light of our task of predicting how the pennsylvania supreme court would resolve this question of state law,its prior decision in hoy does at least provide a useful framework for considering the language,nature,and purpose of the pufta.we nevertheless believe that this uniform fraudulent transfer statute differs in a number of important and ultimately dispositive ways from the antidiscrimination statute addressed by the state supreme court in hoy.
as the district court admitted,p unitive damages are not explicitly authorized by pufta.klein iii,wl,at.in other words,the pufta like the phra does not include a specific provision stating,for example,that a creditor may obtain punitive damages.however,its remedies of creditors section does contain a critical provision section a iii expressly provides that a creditor may obtain any other relief the circumstances may require.based simply on the language of this provision,a court evidently could award punitive damages as a form of any other relief that a creditor may obtain where the circumstances may require.
according to appellants,both statutes appear to contain a phrase that may provide for unlimited remedies.however,the provision at issue in hoy,any other legal or equitable relief as the court deems appropriate,actually constitutes a subset of another statutory term or category,affirmative action.the phra itself is clear on this point,stating that the court shall order affirmative action which may include,but is not limited to,reinstatement or hiring of employes,granting of back pay,or any other legal or equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.stat.ann.c emphasis added.
in contrast,the basic language and structure of section a iii,section in general,and the pufta as a whole differ in several significant ways from the language and structure of the phra own remedial scheme.initially,the critical provision at issue here any other relief the circumstances may require is not a subset of an express statutory category,at least not in the same way in which any other legal or equitable relief as the court deems appropriate constitutes a subset of affirmative action.instead of simply authorizing the trial court to order legal or equitable relief as a form of affirmative action,the pufta provides the court with broad authority to fashion the remedy or package of remedies based on the specific circumstances of each individual case.we further note that this provision is not even phrased in terms of legal,compensatory damages or equitable,an injunction forms relief.we acknowledge that,under section a,a creditor may obtain any other relief the circumstances may require subject to the applicable principles of equity and in accordance with the applicable rules of civil procedure.section likewise provides for various forms of equitable relief,including an injunction against further disposition of the asset under section a i and the appointment of a receiver to take charge of the asset pursuant to section a ii.however,the statutory requirement that any relief be subject to,and in accordance with,applicable principles of equity and rules of civil procedure could simply mean that any relief granted must comply with the rules and procedures implicated by the specific kind of relief at issue.for example,a creditor seeking an injunction would be required to meet the otherwise generally applicable requirements for this form of equitable relief,not have unclean hands,and a creditor seeking punitive damages likewise must satisfy the prerequisites for such an award,demonstrate that the defendant engaged in outrageous conduct.at the very least,this applicable principles language can not really be compared to the affirmative action language at issue in hoy,and it thereby does not reduce the pufta otherwise expansive and provision into nothing more than a mere subset of a larger term or category.although the pennsylvania supreme court does not appear to have addressed the issue,we believe that it would hold that punitive damages are generally available in equitable actions.see,nebesho brown,indicating that attorney fees in the nature of punitive damages would be proper in equitable action to nullify deed.appellants,for their part,do not contest the general availability of punitive damages in equitable actions under pennsylvania law.furthermore,the pufta expressly allows for an award of compensatory damages,at least under certain circumstances,pursuant to section b,the creditor may recover judgment for the value of the asset transferred,as adjusted under subsection c,or the amount necessary to satisfy the creditor claim,whichever is less 
in contrast with the statutory scheme at issue in hoy,the pufta also includes an express supplementary provisions section.specifically,section states in relevant part that,u nless displaced by the provisions of this chapter,the principles of law and equity,including the law relating to fraud,and misrepresentation,supplement its provisions.the commentary to section likewise indicates that this section remedies are cumulative in nature.ann.cmt.citations omitted,and are not exclusive.ann.cmt.we have already noted that punitive damages are likely available in equitable actions under pennsylvania law.it is also uncontested that,at least in the context of common law fraud,defendants may be ordered to pay punitive damages.in fact,i t is difficult to picture a fact pattern which would support a finding of intentional fraud without providing proof of outrageous conduct to support an award of punitive damages.delahanty first.bank.as klein and the district court also point out,punitive damages have been awarded in the domestic relations context.see,hess hess,upholding jury punitive damages award in favor of on tort claim of fraud arising out of fraudulent execution of property settlement agreement.accordingly,it appears that,based on the language of section,these principles of law and equity governing the availability of punitive damages under pennsylvania law supplement the pufta or,in the words of the district court,are implicitly incorporated into this statutory scheme,klein iii,wl,at citing.
more broadly,we also believe that the underlying nature and purposes of the two statutory schemes substantially differ.the hoy court specifically addressed an statute meant to improve,in the words of its tit
