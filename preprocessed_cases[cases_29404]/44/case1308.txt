opinion of the court 
richard and margaret fabend sued rosewood hotels and resorts,caneel bay,and the united states department of interior,national park service after richard was injured while bodysurfing in the virgin islands.fabend settled the claims against the united states,but proceeded in the district court of the virgin islands against the remaining defendants.fabend claims that the defendants had a duty to warn him of a dangerous shorebreak condition at the beach,which created a forceful wave that drove him into the sand and left him a quadriplegic.the district court granted summary judgment for the appellees.
the district court had jurisdiction over this diversity action under the revised organic act,a,and a.we have jurisdiction to review the summary judgment order pursuant to,and exercise plenary review.blair scott specialty gases,cir.although we review the facts in the light most favorable to fabend,the central issue,whether appellees had a duty to warn or protect him,is a question of law.turbe gov t of the virgin islands,cir the nature of the legal duty owed by a defendant is generally a question of law.citing restatement second of torts b.we hold that the appellees did not exercise sufficient control over the beach to create a duty to warn and will affirm.
cinnamon bay beach on john,virgin islands is owned by the united states and is part of the virgin islands national park.the fabends were staying at the cinnamon bay campground,which was owned by caneel bay,and operated by rosewood hotels and resorts.rosewood and caneel had a limited and right to operate a campground and related services on national park land adjacent to cinnamon bay beach,pursuant to a series of concession agreements between caneel and the national park service.rosewood also rented cabins and operated a restaurant,beach store,and watersports center.
the relationship between rosewood and the national park service was governed by a concession contract,a concessions operational plan,and an additional operating plan.under the terms of these documents,the national park service retained full access to the area adjacent to cinnamon bay beach,including the right to enter the area at any time final authority over rosewood operations,such as the rates charged and the dates and hours of campground operation and the responsibility for providing protection services for beach visitors,including law enforcement,safety inspections,and lifeguard functions.at.the national park service has acknowledged that it maintained physical control over all beaches and waters of the virgin islands national park,including cinnamon bay beach.the national park service also produced signs and brochures to warn visitors of dangerous conditions within the park.
although the factual accounts offered by the district court and the two parties vary in some respects,none of these differences is germane to our decision.according to his deposition,fabend was heading back into the ocean from a successful bodysurf when he saw a particularly large wave coming at him.he decided it was too large to bodysurf and attempted instead to dive through it.when he tried to do this,the wave hit him and smashed him headfirst into the sand,breaking his neck.
fabend claims the accident occurred because of a dangerous shorebreak condition off of cinnamon bay beach a shorebreak exists where the water rapidly becomes shallow as it approaches the shore,resulting in waves that can break with tremendous force and drive swimmers into the sand.fabend contends that the potential danger of a shorebreak is not observable by the casual and uninformed swimmer.
the american law institute restatement of law provides the rules of decision for the virgin islands in the absence of local laws to the contrary.because there are no applicable local laws to the contrary,we apply the restatement second of torts.the general rule is that one owes no duty to protect,and thus no duty to warn,another,even if one realizes that the other is at risk of injury.restatement second of torts.there are,however,special relationships that can give rise to such a duty.the only special relationships on which fabend relies as giving rise to a duty to protect are those that exist between an innkeeper and his guests and between a possessor of land who holds it open to the public and members of the public who respond to the invitation.
section of the restatement second of torts provides in relevant part 
a common carrier is under a duty to its passengers to take reasonable action 
a to protect them against unreasonable risk of physical harm 
an innkeeper is under a similar duty to his guests.
a possessor of land who holds it open to the public is under a similar duty to members of the public who enter in response to his invitation.
id.comment c to further provides 
the rules stated in this section apply only where the relation exists between the parties,and the risk of harm,or of further harm,arises in the course of that relation.a carrier is under no duty to one who has left the vehicle and ceased to be a passenger,nor is an innkeeper under a duty to a guest who is injured or endangered while he is away from the premises.nor is a possessor of land under any such duty to one who has ceased to be an invitee.
as comment c makes clear,the duty to protect,and hence the duty to warn,exists only where the risk arises from the relationship,and it is not alone sufficient that a guest is exposed to a risk during the period he remains such.people undoubtedly come to cinnamon bay campground to engage in numerous recreational activities on john and the surrounding,sailing,deep sea fishing,snorkeling,and sunbathing,as well as body surfing.this does not mean,however,that caneel and rosewood have a duty to warn guests of all of the risks associated with these activities.a risk arises in the course of the relationship only if it occurs on the relevant premises.id.
our inquiry into whether appellees had a duty to warn fabend of the shorebreak condition begins with the question of whether cinnamon bay beach and the adjacent bay should be considered part of the premises of the campground.to answer this question,courts have applied the sphere of control concept to determine whether a duty exists in various types of innkeeper liability cases.in banks hyatt,cir,for example,the fifth circuit court of appeals applied a sphere of control test when considering whether a hotel owed a duty to protect a patron from a criminal assault by a third party when the patron was just outside the entrance doors to the hotel on a public sidewalk.id.at.the hotel security department had been made aware of reports of a number of incidents at the entrance,and the owner of the property had also received a recommendation to station a guard at the entrance.id.at.the property owner contracted with the hotel to hire men for the purpose of adopting new security measures in areas outside the hotel premises,including the area where the decedent was killed.id.at.when the decedent wife and children sued for wrongful death,the court concluded that the hotel power to take security measures put it in sufficient control of the entrance to impose a duty on it to take reasonable measures to protect its guests from harm to warn them of dangerous conditions.
although banks involves the death of a guest from the actions of a third party,it nonetheless states a principle that is relevant to the question before us,which it calls the sphere of control test.that is to say,when an innkeeper possesses or exercises sufficient control over the property adjacent to his premises,he has the power to take protective measures to reduce the risk of injury on that property.having such power,the innkeeper has a duty to exercise it to the benefit of his patrons.
the specific factual setting of a case will ultimately dictate whether a party is in the position to control or has the power to control land adjacent to his property such that a duty to protect or warn arises.see id.at.the sphere of control test requires that we look at the circumstances of the case to ascertain whether sufficient control exists over the adjacent premises.relevan
