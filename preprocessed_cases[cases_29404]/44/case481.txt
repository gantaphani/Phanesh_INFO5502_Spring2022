in this tragic case,two individuals were killed and a third badly injured in a skiing accident in new hampshire.the details are set forth in two very able opinions by the district court.thus,we confine ourselves to an abbreviated description focused on the two primary issues raised on this appeal one is an important question of statutory construction and the other a narrower issue turning upon the pleadings.
howard and eileen gwyn,their daughter margaret do,and margaret fianc√© mark goss went on a ski vacation in lincoln,new hampshire.on january,they spent the morning together skiing down easy trails at loon mountain ski area loon.shortly before lunch,howard,margaret,and very experienced eileen and rode the chairlift up to the summit lodge to ski down some more difficult trails.unbeknownst to them,loon had closed one of the trails named triple trouble the night before because of icy conditions,a closure noted on the trail board at the bottom of the mountain.
from the summit,it was possible to ski directly down a trail named big dipper from which,part way down,triple trouble branched off to the skier right.or,from the summit,one could head right on a trail called haulback,then take a left fork onto cant dog,and enter big dipper just above the point where triple trouble branched off to the right.at this branching off point from big dipper to triple trouble,loon had posted a sign warning that triple trouble was closed.it had also placed a rope across the entrance to triple trouble.
from the summit,howard led the group to the right down haulback and then took a left turn onto cant dog.at the intersection of cant dog and big above the closed triple trouble slipped on ice,slid under the rope blocking off triple trouble,and tumbled nine hundred feet down the icy slope.he suffered severe injuries resulting in his death a few days later.margaret do and mark goss saw howard gwyn fall,removed their skis,and attempted to walk down the closed trail to rescue him.both fell,sliding hundreds of feet down triple trouble trail.goss died.margaret do suffered severe injuries and frostbite but was rescued several hours later.
in this diversity suit,margaret do and eileen gwyn as executrix of howard gwyn estate and on her own behalf sued loon for breach of multiple common law and statutory duties.the district court granted loon motion to dismiss the majority of claims under new hampshire skiers,ski area,and passenger tramway safety act.ann ski statute.two claims survived the motion to dismiss,but after discovery the district court granted summary judgment to loon on both counts.plaintiffs appealed,focusing attention on one statutory claim and one claim of common law negligence.
at the crux of this appeal is new hampshire ski statute.ann.in this statute several duties are placed on ski trail boards,marking the difficulty of various slopes,making trail maps available to all operators can be sued for violations of these statutory duties.nutbrown cranmore.at the same time,the statute places the risk of injury from dangers inherent in the sport of skiing on the skiers themselves,and bars all actions against ski operators for injuries caused by these dangers nutbrown,at.new hampshire case law is slowly filling in the gaps but uncertainties remain.
here,most of the counts and theories pressed by plaintiffs at the start are no longer in issue,but two major claims remain open on this appeal.the first is that loon did not comply with a statutory duty relating to marking closed trails.under the ski statute,operators are not required to close a trail because of hazardous conditions,but if they do close a trail they must mark the beginning of,and designated access points to the closed trail with a sign,iii b,and note the closure on a permanent trail board at the base of the mountain,ii a.here,it is undisputed that loon properly noted the closure on the trail board and properly marked the beginning of triple trouble at the point that it branched off big dipper.
nevertheless,the plaintiffs say that a closed sign for triple trouble was also required by the statute at the uphill juncture where cant dog forked off point where a sign pointed the way to big dipper and triple trouble.this,they say,was itself an access point to triple trouble.their causation theory is less clear the implication is that such an early warning of a closed trail further downhill might have made howard gwyn decide to lead the group straight down haulback instead of taking cant dog so they could avoid the entire region around the closed trail.
the district court ruled as a matter of law that access points as used in the new hampshire statute referred to points of direct entry onto a trail,and did not include points above the start of the closed trail.thus,the start of cant dog might conceivably be treated as an access point to big dipper since the former merged into the latter once on cant dog,entry onto big dipper was inevitable.by contrast,nothing compelled one who took the fork to big dipper necessarily to take the fork from big dipper onto triple trouble.
we agree readily with the district court reading of the statute.true,as a matter of dictionary definition a remote fork to an intermediate trail that can lead eventually to the closed trail could be described as a way to access the later trail but on this theory the summit itself would be an access point to every connected trail on the mountain below.indeed,on plaintiffs reading,warning signs might have to be posted at a variety of different points wherever existing trail signs indicated that the closed trail could be reached somewhere downhill.conceivably,plaintiffs position could also require ski operators to construct such directional signs even if they did not already exist in order to mark every downhill closure.
it would not be literally impossible to comply with such some ski slopes do so mark their closed trails,at least where existing signs mention the it could involve fairly complex compliance measures.in fact,the loon trail map indicates that from some trails one could reach nearly different trails of them through open intermediate trails branching off into other open forks.the simplicity of the statute requirements argues against an interpretation requiring ski operators to mark every one of those possibilities,and this interpretation is unnecessary to carry out what we perceive to be the rationale of the warning requirement.
in our view,the statute aims to give the skier warning of a trail closure at any point where the skier might otherwise commit himself to traverse the closed trail.this is a complete scheme of protection giving the skier both a comprehensive overview of all closures on the base trailboard,and specific notice of each closure at any point on the mountain where the skier has a last chance to avoid the closed trail.
this reading may leave some open issues,but it forecloses plaintiffs central claim in this case.here,the plaintiffs argue that a sign should have been placed at the dog junction,since cant dog led onto big dipper which in turn led onto triple trouble.but a skier does not commit himself to taking triple trouble merely by turning left onto cant dog.big dipper was an open trail which a skier could continue down without branching off onto triple trouble,so no warning sign as to triple trouble was required by the statute at the dog fork,even though one could have been voluntarily provided.
the second claim on appeal is that the district court should not have rejected an alternative theory of the plaintiffs having nothing to do with notice.the plaintiffs said that the defendant had placed the rope across triple trouble somewhat below the entrance itself and that the placement was negligent because it could lure a skier closer to the icy entrance than one would go otherwise.admittedly,there was no duty to use any closing rope at all the statute made the signs sufficient but the plaintiffs argue that a voluntarily assumed duty negligently performed is not immunized by the statute.
there are obvious risks in penalizing efforts to provide help or care beyond an existing duty,but the common law rule sometimes permits
