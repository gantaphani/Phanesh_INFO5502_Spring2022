background 
litigation in the district court 
the facts of the case are discussed in detail in the district court thorough opinion and in our original opinion on appeal,familiarity with which will be assumed.see hamilton ii,at hamilton i,d at.we will discuss the facts only briefly here.
gail fox and her son stephen,together with other relatives of handgun victims,brought this suit against numerous handgun manufacturers after stephen was permanently disabled in a handgun shooting incident in at the age of.hamilton ii,at,hamilton i,d at.the district court dismissed plaintiffs product liability and fraud claims on defendants initial motion for summary judgment,but allowed the suit to proceed to trial on a negligent marketing theory.hamilton ii,at hamilton i,d at.
at trial,plaintiffs pursued the theory that the defendant handgun manufacturers had marketed and distributed their products in a negligent fashion that directly fostered an illegal underground market in handguns,thereby furnishing the weapons involved in the shootings that precipitated the suit.hamilton ii,at.plaintiffs contended defendants had a duty to exercise reasonable care in the marketing and distribution of handguns in light of four factors their ability to control such marketing and distribution their knowledge that large numbers of their guns entered the illegal market for ultimate criminal use new york strict firearms regulation policy and the uniquely lethal nature of the handguns.id.because only one of the handguns in question had been recovered,plaintiffs further argued that traditional common law principles of causation should be eschewed in favor of a market share theory of liability,under which defendants would be held severally liable for the resulting damages in proportion to their respective shares of the handgun market.id.
following a trial,the jury returned a verdict finding that of the defendants had failed to exercise reasonable care in the marketing or distribution of their handguns.it ultimately made an award of million in damages to stephen fox and an award of to his mother,assessed against only three defendants under a market share theory american arms percent liability,beretta percent liability,and taurus international manufacturing percent liability.hamilton ii,at hamilton i,d at.
when defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,the district court denied the motion.hamilton ii,at hamilton i,d at.the trial court thought defendants had a duty to exercise reasonable care in marketing and distributing their handguns for several reasons in light of their close relationship with distributors and retailers,common law tort principles applicable to the manufacture of dangerous products,the perceptible risk that negligent marketing and distribution would promote the criminal misuse of handguns,and the ability of the defendant manufacturers to restructure their affairs to reduce such risk and to spread the costs of risk reduction to consumers.hamilton i,d at.the trial court also found the market share theory of liability appropriate,citing the above factors as well as the asserted fungibility of the handguns,and plaintiffs practical difficulties in proving a chain of causation.id.at.it was on this reasoning that judgment was entered for plaintiffs.
certification to the new york court of appeals 
the three defendants who had been found liable for damages appealed the denial of their rule b motion to this court,challenging the district court rulings on the duty of care and market share liability as well as the sufficiency of the evidence that they breached any duty or proximately caused plaintiffs injuries.hamilton ii,at.in addition to the parties briefs,we received five helpful amicus briefs and a separate letter from the attorney general of new york state in which he requested certification of the duty question to the new york court of appeals.id.at.
of the two amici curiae supporting reversal,the chamber of commerce of the united states argued against the imposition of a duty of care,and the product liability advisory council,asserted the inapplicability of the market share theory of liability.the three remaining amicus briefs all supported affirmance.the center to prevent handgun violence and amici argued in a single brief that defendants did owe plaintiffs the asserted duty of care.a number of cities and counties,including boston,chicago,and los angeles,also argued for a duty of care but,like new york attorney general,suggested certification of this question.finally,the association of trial lawyers of america contended the case presented a suitable context for application of the market share theory.
because defendants appeal presented important and complex questions of state law for which no dispositive new york authority could be found,we certified the following two questions of law to the state highest court in an opinion filed on august,
i whether the defendants owed plaintiffs a duty to exercise reasonable care in the marketing and distribution of the handguns they manufacture 
ii whether liability may be apportioned on a market share basis,and if so,how 
hamilton ii,at.we clarified that our manner of framing these questions is in no way meant to restrict the court of appeals from considering any state law issues it might wish to resolve in connection with this appeal.id.at.at the same time,we reserve d decision on whether the jury had sufficient evidence to support its findings that defendants breached their duty,if any,and in so doing proximately caused plaintiffs injuries.id.at.
discussion 
a.the decision of the new york court of appeals 
the new york court of appeals accepted certification of both questions on september.hamilton beretta,mem.on april,that court handed down a unanimous decision answer ing both questions in the negative.hamilton iii,at,at,at.
it began by emphasizing that the foreseeability of harm,standing alone,does not define the duty of care but merely determines the scope of the duty once it is determined to exist,at,at,at.contrary to the district court reasoning,the court of appeals found that defendants relationships with their dealers and distributors did not place the defendant s in the best position to protect against the risk of harm,given the very large pool of potential plaintiffs and the remote connection between defendants,the criminal wrongdoers,and plaintiffs,at,at,at.the court dis
