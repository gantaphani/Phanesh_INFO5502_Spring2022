the events that generated this case began with a dog at large in bethel,maine and ended with the termination of the town chief of police.as a result of the investigation and prosecution of the dog at large incident,a disagreement arose between the police chief,darren tripp,and the town manager,scott cole.cole wanted tripp to intercede with the district attorney on behalf of the dog owner tripp expressed his discomfort with the request.four months later,citing various issues unrelated to the dog at large incident,cole suspended tripp for a month he later fired him.tripp then sued cole and the town of bethel,claiming that he had been retaliated against for speech protected under the first amendment and state law.the district court granted summary judgment for defendants.we affirm.
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the,tripp,and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.smith robertshaw controls,cir.
in october,chief tripp observed a dog at large and called the town animal control officer.according to witnesses including the town engineer,the animal control officer pursued the dog into the owner garage and captured it there,when,arguably,it was no longer a dog at large.a summons was issued to the dog owner,sherry thurston.
thurston repeatedly called cole to complain about the summons.eventually after checking with the town engineer,cole asked tripp to dismiss the summons.surreptitiously recorded the that the matter was now in the district attorney hands.cole then asked tripp to ask the district attorney to dump the summons,and insisted on tripp word that he would do so.tripp responded,i can ask the da what he wants to do,but when it comes this far,you know i not comfortable doing this.
at thurston arraignment in november,tripp dutifully passed along cole request to the assistant district attorney ada that same day,cole tripp to ask whether he had asked the ada to dismiss the case.tripp went to cole office and told him that he had relayed cole request,although cole testified at his deposition that he had no idea whether or not tripp had relayed the request.the record is unclear as to what ultimately happened with the summons.
at some point that winter,tripp spoke to two bethel selectmen and noted that his relationship with cole had cooled,due,in his opinion,to the thurston summons issue.the selectmen agreed,although without a particular basis for personal knowledge disclosed by the record.
in march,cole gave tripp a written notice of a suspension from duty with pay.the notice listed a variety of alleged misdeeds by tripp,some of which were two years old,most of which had never been mentioned to tripp before,and none of which had ever been noted in his personnel file.tripp conceded that some,though not all,were true.his suspension ended in april,and he returned to duty.
in january,cole gave tripp a document describing tripp failure to respond to an armed robbery call in december.the incident was investigated over the next month.in february,tripp was terminated from his job for cause.he appealed to the board of selectmen,which upheld the termination by a vote.
procedural history 
tripp sued cole and the town,alleging a claim under and three claims under state law.tripp does not appeal the disposition of two of the state law claims and we do not discuss them.the claims at issue in this appeal are that defendants retaliated against tripp for speech protected by the first amendment,in violation of count i,and for reporting a violation of maine law,in violation of the maine human rights act mhra.ann.tit,and the maine whistleblowers protection act mwpa.ann.tit,count iii the case was referred to a magistrate judge,and the parties for summary judgment.
the magistrate judge recommended summary judgment for defendants on both claims.tripp cole,wl,dist.lexis,tripp i.the magistrate judge evaluated the claim first,on the theory that w hen balancing the rights of the employee against those of the employer,an employee first amendment interest is entitled to greater weight where he is acting as a in exposing government corruption.id.at wl,at,dist.lexis,at quoting guilloty perez pierluisi,cir.the magistrate judge found that a reasonable person in tripp position would not have believed cole request was illegal,and furthermore tripp never actually reported a violation.on the first amendment claim,the magistrate judge found that the speech at issue did not address a matter of public concern.the district court reviewed the magistrate report and recommendation de novo and adopted it in full.tripp cole,wl,dist.lexis at.this appeal followed.
passing over two issues that require little discussion we discern two main arguments in tripp appeal.first,he argues that the court wrongly held that his conduct was not protected by the mwpa.tripp asserts that cole request was an unlawful obstruction of government administration which tripp reported to cole himself and to two bethel selectmen.second,tripp argues that the court wrongly held that his speech was not protected by the first amendment because it did not involve a matter of public concern.he argues that his speech involved the important public issue of the legality and propriety of town officials interceding on behalf of affluent citizens to give them more favorable treatment in court.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.smith,at.
whistleblower retaliation 
under the mwpa,n o employer may discharge or otherwise discriminate against an employee because t he employee,acting in good faith,reports orally or in writing to the employer or a public body what the employee has reasonable cause to believe is a violation of a law.ann.tit,a a prima facie case of reprisal for whistleblowing requires that the employee show that he engaged in activity protected by the statute,he was the subject of adverse employment action,and there was a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.bard bath iron works,me.
under the mwpa,the conduct need not actually be illegal,but the employee must prove that a reasonable person might have believed that it was.id.at see also higgins new balance athletic shoe,cir explaining that an employee reasonable belief that the conduct crosses the line suffices.tripp argues that it was reasonable to believe that cole request to ask the prosecutor to dump the thurston summons was a violation of.ann.tit,under which a person is guilty of obstructing government administration if the person intentionally interferes by force,violence or intimidation or by any physical act with a public servant performing an official function.in tripp view,cole attempted to interfere by intimidating tripp into seeking the termination of an ongoing criminal proceeding tripp informed cole and two selectmen that such a request was illegal and he was suspended and eventually fired as a result.
the district court found that tripp had not engaged in protected activity for two independent reasons a reasonable person would not have considered cole request to be an obstruction of government administration,and tripp never reported to anyone his alleged belief that cole request was illegal.see tripp i,wl,at,dist.lexis at.we find the first ground adequate to sustain the judgment,and do not address the second.
although the language of could theoretically apply to a broad range of conduct,maine courts have construed the provision narrowly.in particular,we have not found,and tripp has not cited,any maine case where a government official was prosecuted under for an order to a subordinate employee.to the contrary,in virtually all of the reported cases under and its predecessor common law doctrine,the defendant had attempted to prevent a law enforcement officer from effecting a search or arrest.therefore,if we accepted tripp theory,he would be the first victim of that particular form of obstructing government administration in over years of reported maine cases.to be sure,the words of the statute do not foreclose the possibility that could apply to a public official order to a subordinate.but i f we are unwilling to stretch state precedents to reach new frontiers,a litigant
