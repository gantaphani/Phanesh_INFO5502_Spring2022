in the early,cummings properties bought several roofs manufactured by hpg international.the roofs were installed on commercial buildings in woburn and burlington,massachusetts.the roofs were composed of unreinforced polyvinyl chloride membranes and were sold with ten year warranties.after the warranty period,cummings learned that such pvc roofs were subject to catastrophic failure and,in,inquired of hpg.hpg recommended the immediate replacement of all of the roofs.before cummings did so,one of the roofs shattered and had to be replaced.
although the roofs had outlasted the warranty periods,cummings sued for deceit and negligent misrepresentation,based on oral statements hpg had made at the time of sale.cummings also sued for violations of.laws ch,saying,inter alia,that hpg at least had a duty to warn,both before and after the end of the ten year warranty period.
the district court entered summary judgment for hpg on all claims.the case presents numerous issues under massachusetts commercial law.
on appeal from entry of summary judgment,we summarize the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs 
in,cummings sought to replace the roof on one of several commercial buildings in massachusetts that it owns.cummings considered a variety of roofing systems on the market,including unreinforced polyvinyl chloride pvc membrane roofs manufactured by hpg international.during several meetings between hpg and cummings,hpg representatives told cummings that their pvc roof would last years would perform better and last the same or longer than other commercial roof systems on the market and was suitable for use in the variable climate of massachusetts.in,and,cummings purchased unreinforced pvc roofs from hpg for three of their buildings.in,thomas realty fund,a cummings entity,purchased a building which had had such a hpg roof installed in.each roof carried with it a ten year warranty,which covered any condition caused by defective material supplied by hpg.
unreinforced pvc membrane roofs proved to be prone to shattering,or sudden fragmentation of the membrane.unreinforced pvc roofs are most likely to shatter in cold weather.hpg learned of the problem as early as,but it is not clear how well known the shattering phenomenon was before that time.by,hpg maintained a log of shatter occurrences documenting of its roofs that had shattered,at an average age of between eight to ten years.
in,two roofing companies elsewhere that had installed hpg unreinforced pvc membrane roofs contacted hpg about the shattering problem.one asked hpg to join it in sending a notice to owners of those roofs to warn them of the defect and to recommend remedial action to prevent possible future shattering.the other,a warranty service contractor for hpg,expressed concern about the risk of shattering and urged hpg to issue a statement.it also suggested hpg offer reduced price upgrades on roofs to prevent shattering.hpg apparently did not act on those suggestions,nor did it notify cummings of the shattering phenomenon.
also in,two roofing industry trade groups issued a joint paper documenting the shattering phenomenon occurring in unreinforced pvc roofs and recommending safety and replacement procedures.another paper,published sometime after,documented problems between and with unreinforced pvc roofs such as embrittlement,shrinkage,and impact fractures,although it was unclear whether there were any incidents of shattering during that period.
cummings learned of the shattering phenomenon around and contacted hpg,which recommended the immediate replacement of cummings unreinforced roofs.before cummings had taken any action,however,on december,the roof installed in shattered,forcing cummings to replace it on an emergency basis.cummings has since replaced two of the remaining three roofs as a precaution,and plans to replace the fourth roof soon.hpg has refused to assume financial responsibility for those replacements.
cummings instituted this action seeking compensation for the costs associated with replacing the four roofs,claiming that hpg made representations about the useful life and quality of the roofs which,in light of the shattering defect,were false and misleading.cummings says it relied on hpg false representations and,since the roofs did not last years or perform better than other roofs,the fact that the warranties have expired should not bar its claims.cummings also alleges that hpg committed unfair practices in violation of massachusetts consumer protection law.laws ch,because hpg failed to warn it of the shattering defect,which hpg allegedly knew about by,while cummings warranties were still in effect.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of hpg,concluding that hpg representations were statements of opinion,and also finding that there was no evidence hpg knew the statements were false at the time they were made.the court held that hpg had not violated chapter by failing to warn cummings about the risk of shattering,if a duty to warn existed at all.hpg was also granted summary judgment on cummings claim based on the roof owned by plaintiff thomas realty,as the court found no evidence that thomas realty predecessor was the recipient of any false representations.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.thomas eastman kodak,cir,cert.denied,d.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.id.quoting.c.massachusetts law governs.
a.the misrepresentation claims 
at first blush,it seems odd to permit an action for either deceit or negligent misrepresentation where the supposed misrepresentation is the subject of an express warranty which disclaims all other warranties by its terms and it is clear there was no breach of that warranty.in general,under massachusetts law,if the contract was fully negotiated and voluntarily signed,then plaintiffs may not raise as fraudulent any prior oral assertion inconsistent with a contract provision that specifically addresses the particular point at issue.starr fordham,quoting turner johnson johnson,cir.
but as to deceit actions,massachusetts courts,for public policy reasons,have long held that a party can not induce a contract by fraudulent misrepresentations and then use contractual devices to escape liability.see bates southgate,c ontracts or clauses attempting to protect a party against the consequences of his own fraud are against public policy and void where fraud inducing the contract is shown.here,cummings claims that it would not have bought the roofs but for hpg misrepresentations,and so its deceit claim,based on hpg allegedly fraudulent misrepresentations,is not barred by the existence of an express warranty.
as for cummings negligent misrepresentation claim,in some circumstances an express warranty will operate as a bar to recovery.where the legality of the bargaining process is not at issue,a party can not avoid its contractual obligations by seeking recovery for negligent misrepresentation.see sound techniques,hoffman,declining to ignore our general policy of upholding freedom to contract by allowing plaintiff to avoid a contractual disclaimer that it agreed to,uninfluenced by any fraud or other egregious or intentional misbehavior on defendant part.the express warranty in this case does not contain an integration clause like the one in sound techniques,which stated that the party has not been influenced to enter into this transaction nor has it relied upon any warranties or representations not set forth in this instrument.id.at we do not,however,explore whether this difference in warranty language matters under state law,as hpg has not argued this point.
opinion fact 
there is an important threshold determination for any misrepresentation claim,be it for deceit or for negligent misrepresentation only statements of fact are actionable statements of opinion can not give rise to a deceit action,mceneaney chestnut hill realty,or to a negligent misrepresentation action,logan equip.simon aerials,cummings argues that the district court erred in concluding that hpg representations about its roofs were statements of opinion.as to the first the roof would last twenty do not consider it to be a statement of opinion.the second statement,the supposed superiority of the pvc product,does fall in the opinion category,as normal commercial puffing.hpg statement that the roof was suitable for the new england climate is close to the line between the two categories,but it is at least arguably more like a statement of fact than of opinion.
to draw the difficult distinction between a statement of fact and a statement of opinion,massachusetts courts have looked to the restatement second of torts,which provides that a representation is one of opinion if it expresses only a the belief of the maker,without certainty,as to the existence of fact or b his judgment as to quality,value,authenticity,or other matters of judgment.restatement second of torts,quoted in mceneaney,at.statements touting the superlative quality of an item,such as mint condition or prime merchandise are considered mere puffing or seller talk,statements of opinion.greenery rehab.group,antaramian,see also powell rasmussen,statements of mere opinion,estimate,or judgment can not give rise to deceit action.
in contrast,statements that are susceptible of actual knowledge can give rise to a claim of deceit,if those statements are false.zimmerman kent.for example,a statement by the builder of a house that there would be no water in the cellar was deemed an actionable misrepresentation because it was susceptible of the builder actual knowledge,pietrazak mcdermott,as was a false representation by a corporate agent about a corporation net worth,gopen american supply.even a statement that in form is one of opinion may constitute a statement of fact if it may reasonably be understood by the recipient as implying that there are facts to justify the opinion or at least that there are no facts that are incompatible with it.mceneaney,at.here,hpg representation that their roofs would last twenty years was specific and verifiable,not a mere expression of opinion or estimate.that statement was susceptible of hpg actual knowledge,and,even if opinion,indicated that hpg,the manufacturer of the roofs,knew facts to justify its statement.similarly,hpg statement that the roofs were suitable for the massachusetts climate is at least arguably a statement of fact.
elements of deceit 
the borderline between what is an action for deceit and what is an action for negligent misrepresentation is unclear under massachusetts case law.in an action for deceit under massachusetts law,a plaintiff must show that the defendant made a false representation of material fact for the purpose of inducing reliance and that plaintiff relied upon the representation to his or her detriment.danca taunton sav.bank,snyder sperry and hutchinson.proof of intent to deceive is not required,so long as there is proof of a false representation of fact susceptible of the speaker knowledge.snyder,at.the uncertainty has to do with what role the speaker knowledge of the falsity plays.
many massachusetts cases say that an element of deceit is that the speaker made a false representation of a material fact with knowledge of its falsity.danca,at emphasis added see also slaney westwood auto,comparing common law fraud to chapter claim barrett aronson,kilroy barron,rood newberg,accord borden paul revere life ins,cir.but other deceit cases say plaintiffs need not prove that defendant knew his statement to be false so long as there is proof that the representation was false and susceptible of actual knowledge.nickerson matco tools,cir see also vmark software,emc,speaker need not know statement is false if fact represented is susceptible of actual knowledge zimmerman,at same acushnet fed.credit union roderick,same.
at the very least,there is a lack of clarity in massachusetts case law.see in re friedlander,noting confusion.the confusion may stem from the mixing of the concept of knowledge with the concept of intent to deceive,or from use of language without an effort to distinguish which sort of misrepresentation is alleged.the supreme judicial court has not,as best we can tell,addressed this question.but it has referred to the restatement second of torts in this area,see robertson gaston snow ely bartlett,intentional misrepresentation,cert denied,d rasmussen,at same danca,at negligent misrepresentation,so we will use those restatement definitions.
since massachusetts considers deceit to be a variety of fraud,we utilize the definition in restatement second of torts 
a misrepresentation is fraudulent if the maker a knows or believes that the matter is not as he represents it to be,b does not have the confidence in the accuracy of his representation that he states or implies,or c knows that he does not have the basis for his representation that he states or implies.
knowledge for the purpose of showing fraud is established by any of these three conditions.a claim of deceit has been categorized as an intentional tort,mohr,g b springfield.as will be discussed later,m ere negligence in discovering the falsity before making the representation is not sufficient for an action in tort for deceit,but it is enough for an action in negligence.nolan sartorio,massachusetts practice at ed.a defendant who makes a false statement may be liable for deceit if he implicitly conveyed that he had knowledge of the represented fact.see mceneaney,at restatement second of torts.
the issue is whether,at the time hpg made the statements,hpg knew that the statements were false within the restatement test.see zimmerman,at.here,cummings has failed to offer evidence that hpg had any basis for knowledge that the statements,at the time they were made,were false,a failure that is fatal to cummings deceit claim.see id.at.
the latest that hpg could have made any allegedly false representations was,assuming arguendo that cummings can maintain a claim based on the roof on a building sold to thomas realty in,see infra.cummings offers a single article,dated,reporting problems other than shattering with pvc roofs in the early,and admits that it has no basis to impute knowledge of that report to hpg at the time of the sales.the letters and the other articles cummings relies on the sale,as does the shatter log,which shows that by,hpg had tracked claims of shattered roofs.there is simply no evidence to suggest that hpg knew or should have known that its statements about its product were false,in the restatement sense,when hpg made the statements.
negligent misrepresentation 
cummings also pursues a negligent misrepresentation claim,which,under massachusetts law,requires it to prove that hpg provided it with false information and with failure to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.nota constr.keyes.
economic loss doctrine 
the district court dismissed the negligent misrepresentation claim,predicting that massachusetts courts would apply the economic loss doctrine in a new preclude claims of negligent misrepresentation about statements as to the viability of products made in a commercial setting to induce the purchase of products where the product is subject to warranties.the district court relied on the thoughtful analysis of the question contained in sebago,beazer east.
in the context of ordinary negligence claims in tort actions,the supreme judicial court has held that purely economic losses are unrecoverable in tort and strict liability actions in the absence of personal injury or property damage.fmr boston edison,rejecting claim that negligent repair of electric lines caused power outages which caused loss of profits accord garweth boston edison,rejecting claim that negligent oil spill caused damages for delay in ability to complete contract work.the sjc thus aligned itself with the majority rule as to the economic loss doctrine and cited a supreme court case which held that where a commercial product injures itself and nothing or no one else,there is no need to create a product liability cause of action independent of contr
