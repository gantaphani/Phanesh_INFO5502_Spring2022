opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on an appeal from the district court partial final judgment entered pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b in favor of four of the five defendants in this action,the institutional defendants,following the court conclusion that it lacked personal jurisdiction over two of these defendants and that the applicable statutes of limitations barred the plaintiff claim against all four institutional defendants.plaintiff,now appellant,brian elliott brought this action against the institutional defendants,the archdiocese of new york the archdiocese,the church of the nativity of our blessed lady the church,the marist brothers of the schools,the marist brothers,and michael school,and an individual defendant,brother damian galligan,seeking monetary damages for personal injuries that elliott allegedly suffered as a result of galligan sexual abuse of him beginning in,when he was eight years old,and continuing until.for the reasons that follow,we will dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
ii.factual history 
the archdiocese,a roman catholic entity and a governing organization of the catholic church,is incorporated in the state of new york with its principal place of business in new york city.the church of the nativity,a private religious organization and parish under the archdiocese,also is incorporated in the state of new york with its principal place of business in new york city.the marist brothers is a religious order.it is incorporated in the state of new york and serves mass at the church of the nativity.michael is incorporated in the state of new york as a private religious high school and is located in new york city.during the period that he allegedly abused elliott,galligan was a brother of the marist order,taught at michael,and performed services at the church.elliott was raised in the state of new jersey,lived in that state during the alleged abuse,and is still a resident and citizen of that state.
elliott grandmother,who lived in the bronx,new york,and was a parishioner of the church of the nativity,introduced elliott to galligan.galligan came to know elliott entire family but developed an especially close relationship with elliott.beginning in the fall of,when elliott was eight years old,galligan allegedly began to sexually assault elliott.elliott charges that galligan continued his abuse on a regular basis between and at various locations in new york and new jersey.elliott also asserts that galligan abused him in virginia and in delaware where he took elliott on two trips.
iii.procedural history 
elliott originally filed his complaint in the superior court of delaware,in and for new castle county,on june.elliott thereafter filed an amended complaint,in which he alleged that there was an agency relationship between galligan and the institutional defendants.in this vein,elliott contended that the institutional defendants employed galligan at all relevant times and were responsible for his supervision.elliott maintained that the institutional defendants gave galligan the power to act on their behalf,and that all of galligan actions with respect to elliott fell within the scope of that authority,were connected to galligan routine job duties,and were for the benefit of the institutional defendants.elliott asserted also that the institutional defendants ratified,or,at a minimum,did not repudiate galligan abuse of him to the extent that the abuse may have occurred outside the scope of the authority that the institutional defendants granted to galligan.in this vein,elliott alleged that the institutional defendants had actual or constructive knowledge of galligan sexual abuse of elliott.
on the basis of these and other allegations that elliott made concerning the institutional defendants awareness of ongoing sexual abuse of children in the catholic church generally,elliott contended that the institutional defendants had a duty to prevent galligan from abusing him and to establish measures to protect him against such abuse.elliott alleged that the institutional defendants,acting negligently and grossly negligently,breached those duties causing elliott mental,emotional,and physical injury.in addition to elliott claim that the institutional defendants were negligent,his complaint included a number of other theories of liability,including breach of fiduciary duty,assault and battery,fraud,breach of an implied contract,conspiracy,and aiding and abetting.
defendants removed this action to the district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship.thereafter,the archdiocese and the church of the nativity moved under federal rule of civil procedure b to dismiss all claims against them on the ground that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over them.alternatively,they sought a dismissal under rule b on the ground that new york law applied to elliott claims and the action was untimely under new york statutes of limitations such that elliott failed to state a claim.elliott responded that the court possessed personal jurisdiction over those defendants and that delaware law applied,such that his claims were timely under the delaware child victim act of the cva,ann.tit,a b supp 
on december,the district court granted the archdiocese and the church motion,finding that it could not exercise personal jurisdiction over either defendant.alternatively,the court concluded that new york law applied under delaware jurisprudence and that new york statutes of limitations barred elliott claims see elliott v.the marist of the,d.elliott subsequently moved for the court to reconsider its order on the basis of an october,bench ruling that a judge of the delaware superior court issued in a group of cases not involving elliot that included allegations of sexual abuse against catholic institutions similar to those elliott brought against the institutional defendants.elliott contended that application of the superior court interpretation of the cva in his case would have allowed the court to exercise personal jurisdiction over the institutional defendants and allowed the court to apply delaware law.the court denied elliott motion.
the marist brothers and michael answered elliott complaint without objecting to the district court exercise of jurisdiction over them.later,however,those entities moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to rule c on the basis of the portion of the court december decision regarding the application of new york law and its statutes of limitations.on september,the court granted the marist brothers and michael motion,as it followed its prior ruling that new york law applied and barred elliott claims.
galligan answered elliott complaint,and the claims against him remain pending before the district court.that court,however,has stayed those proceedings during our consideration of this appeal.
after the marist brothers and michael filed their motion for judgment on the pleadings but before the district court granted that motion,the archdiocese and the church on september,moved for entry of final judgment pursuant to rule b.then,after the court granted the marist brothers and michael motion for judgment on the pleadings,all four of the institutional defendants and elliott filed a joint stipulation requesting the entry of final judgment pursuant to rule b in accordance with the court disposition of the case against all four of the institutional defendants.on november,the court denied the archdiocese and the church prior rule b motion,stating that t he court generally does not enter judgment against parties following motions to dismiss.appellant resp.to the clerk order of july,appellant resp.tab c at.instead,the court on november,pursuant to b certified for interlocutory appeal its orders dismissing elliott claims as to all the institutional defendants.elliott,however,did not file a petition for leave to file an interlocutory appeal,and neither the parties nor the court took any further action in this case for approximately the next six months.
on may,the institutional defendants and elliott once again filed a stipulation and proposed order requesting the entry of final judgment under rule b.this time,on june,the district court adopted the parties proposed order and directed the entry of final judgment under rule b in favor of the institutional defendants.in doing so,the court recited the procedural history of the case,and stated that the parties have conferred and respectfully request the entry of final judgments pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b so that elliott appeals may proceed before the third circuit and may be resolved with finality prior to any trial going forward in this matter.it thereafter directed that final judgments be entered pursuant to rule b for the institutional defendants.appellant resp.tab a at.the court did not,however,expressly determine that there was no just reason for delay in the entry of a final judgment,an omission that,as we shall see,has dispositive consequences for this appeal,nor did it set forth a statement of reasons supporting its entry of a rule b judgment.
following elliott filing of a notice of appeal,the clerk of this court on july,ordered the parties to file briefs on the issue of whether the district court certification satisfied the requirements of rule b such that we could exercise jurisdiction over the appeal.in her order,the clerk indicated that the orders appealed from do not dismiss all claims as to all parties and do not appear to have been properly certified under.b.the parties thereafter filed briefs on this issue,all contending that the district court order of june,satisfies the provisions of rule b.on october,a motions panel of this court referred the jurisdictional question to the merits panel and instructed the parties to address the issue further in their briefs on the merits.in the time from the parties receipt of our clerk order until the day of the oral argument on this appeal none of the parties asked the district court to amend the june,order to overcome the possible jurisdictional problem the clerk identified in her july,order or moved that we remand the matter to the district court so that the parties could ask it to do so.
iv.jurisdiction 
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to and.the parties contend that we have jurisdiction pursuant to by virtue of the district court entry of a final judgment pursuant to rule b.the parties,however,can not by their consent vest this court with jurisdiction over this appeal.rather,as always,we must satisfy ourselves that we have jurisdiction.see arizonans for official english arizona,e very federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction,but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review,even though the parties are prepared to concede it.internal quotation marks and citation omitted ins.of ireland,compagnie des bauxites de guinee,n o action of the parties can confer jurisdiction upon a federal court.in re resorts int l,cir subject matter jurisdiction can not be conferred by consent of the parties.internal quotation marks and citation omitted samuel bassett kia motors,cir p arties may not confer subject matter jurisdiction by consent.

a.a district court obligations under rule b 
this court appellate jurisdiction is conferred and limited by congress grant of authority.berckeley inv,colkitt,cir berckeley i citing sheldon sill,how,courts created by statute can have no jurisdiction but such as the statute confers.under,t he courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states.generally,an order which terminates fewer than all claims pending in an action or claims against fewer than all the parties to an action does not constitute a final order for purposes of.see sears,roebuck mackey,carter city of,cir.under rule b,however,a district court may convert an order adjudicating less than an entire action to the end that it becomes a final decision over which a court of appeals may exercise jurisdiction under.
in a case such as this one that is before a court of appeals pursuant to rule b,the court jurisdiction thus depends upon whether the district court properly granted b certification.allis chalmers phila,cir.rule b emphasis added provides 
judgment on multiple claims or involving multiple parties.when an action presents more than one claim for relief whether as a claim,counterclaim,crossclaim,or claim or when multiple parties are involved,the court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more,but fewer than all,claims or parties only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.otherwise,any order or other decision,however designated,that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties does not end the action as to any of the claims or parties and may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims and all the parties rights and liabilities.
by allowing a district court to enter a final judgment on an order adjudicating only a portion of the matters pending before it in or litigation and thus allowing an immediate appeal,rule b attempts to strike a balance between the undesirability of piecemeal appeals and the need for making review available at a time that best serves the needs of the parties.allis chalmers,at 
certification of a judgment as final under rule b is the exception,not the rule,to the usual course of proceedings in a district court.not all final judgments on individual claims should be immediately appealable,even if they are in some sense separable from the remaining unresolved claims.the function of the district court under the rule is to act as a dispatcher.curtiss wright,internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also panichella,cir rule b orders should not be entered routinely or as a courtesy or accommodation to counsel.the power which this rule confers upon the trial judge should be used only in the infrequent harsh case as an instrument for the improved administration of justice and the more satisfactory disposition of litigation in the light of the public policy indicated by statute and rule.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.rule b thus requires that a district court first determine whether there has been an ultimate disposition on a cognizable claim for relief as to a claim or party such that there is a final judgment.curtiss wright,at.at if it determines that there has been such a disposition,the district court must go on to determine whether there is any just reason for delay,taking into account judicial administrative interests as well as the equities involved.id.at.at.
this latter requirement,that a district court must go on to determine whether there is any just reason for delay,is not merely formalistic.rule b makes clear that a district court may direct entry of a final judgment under the rule only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.see also curtiss wright,at.at rule b allows a district court dealing with multiple claims or multiple parties to direct the entry of final judgment as to fewer than all of the claims or parties to do so,the court must make an express determination that there is no just reason for delay.emphasis added.otherwise,if the court does not make that determination,any order or other decision,however designated that does not dispose of all claims against all parties is not final under rule b.
consequently,where an order purports to certify a judgment as final under rule b but lacks the express determination that the rule requires,a court of appeals lacks jurisdiction over the order because it is not a final judgment under either rule b or under the traditional standards of.thus,rule b express determination is a jurisdictional prerequisite.see berckeley inv,colkitt,cir berckeley ii we concluded in berckeley i that an express determination that there is no just reason for delay i s a jurisdictional prerequisite required by rule b see also bhatla capital,cir in the absence of an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and an express direction for the entry of judgment under rule b,the order is not final and no appeal is possible.
in allis chalmers,we faced the question of whether a district court formulaic recitation of the no just reason for delay determination sufficed under rule b.see at.we determined that mechanical adherence to the rule was inadequate and held that rule b requires the district court to do more than just recite the b formula of no just reason for delay.id.at.we concluded that a district court granting judgment under rule b should clearly articulate the reasons and factors underlying its decision to grant b certification.id.in this connection,we adopted the court of appeals for the second circuit approach in requiring that a district court instead of merely incorporating in the certificate the conclusory language of rule b,make a brief reasoned statement in support of its determination that,there is no just reason for delay.id.quoting gumer shearson,hammill,cir.thus,after allis chalmers,w e consistently require that district courts provide a statement of reasons when entering final judgment under rule b.carter,at citations omitted see also waldorf shuta,cir we consistently have required district courts to provide a reasoned opinion as a prerequisite for appellate review of a judgment certified as final.
in carter,however,we determined that,unlike the need for an express determination that there is no just reason for delay,our requirement under allis chalmers that a district court set forth a statement of reasons for its certification stands not as a jurisdictional prerequisite but as a prophylactic means of enabling the appellate court to ensure that immediate appeal will advance the purposes of the rule.at.accordingly,the absence of an explanation by the district court does not pose a jurisdictional bar when the propriety of the appeal may be discerned from the record.id.at.
b.the district court rule b certification lacks an express determination and a statement of reasons.
elliott contends that the portion of the district court rule b order stating that the parties requested the entry of a rule b judgment so that elliott appeals may proceed before the third circuit and may be resolved with finality prior to any trial going forward in this matter,appellant resp.tab a at,satisfies rule b express determination requirement.arguably,though we could infer from the court order that it agreed with the parties statement,we will not impute to the court its summary of the parties justification for seeking a rule b judgment.moreover,even if we regarded that recitation as the language of the court,it does not incorporate an express determination that there is no just reason for delay.
at oral argument,elliott focused on the portion of the rule b order that states that it would be most efficient to hold a single trial.id.yet elliott does not derive that quotation from the district court findings but rather he takes it from the court summary of an october teleconference that the court held prior to denying rule b certification the first time the parties moved for it.see id.on october,this court held a teleconference to discuss the parties joint stipulation and order.during that teleconference,the court and all parties agreed that it would be most efficient to hold a single trial after the resolution of the appeals.in any event,the court statement would not reflect the court determination that there is no just reason for delay in entry of a final judgment it simply would be an observation of one of the advantages of rule b certification.after all,even if we assume that disposition of this case in a single trial might advance efficiency and that the outcome of this appeal,if we exercised jurisdiction,would lead to the court on remand resolving the case with only one trial,it is still possible that there might be a just reason for a delay in entry of a final judgment.in any event,the court did not expressly determine that there is no just reason for delay,nor did it employ similar language that could have been intended to convey a finding that it had reached such a conclusion.
the district court also did not set forth a statement of reasons as to why there was no just reason for delay in entry of a final judgment as allis chalmers required it to do when entering a rule b final judgment.the parties argue that the court june,order certifying the entry of a rule b judgment and its earlier november,order denying entry of such a judgment and instead certifying this matter for interlocutory appeal together set forth an adequate rationale for the court entry of the rule b judgment.we note first that we find surprising the parties reliance on the court earlier order denying a rule b judgment.it is not logical to contend that the court reasoning in denying certification under rule b six months prior to its ultimate certification of the rule b judgment constitutes a statement of reasons for that later certification.in point of fact,the actual rule b order does not contain any statement of reasons justifying the court decision to certify the entry of final judgment under rule b 
in addressing the consequence of the omissions in the district court june,order,we first consider the effect of the district court failure to make the express finding of no just reason for delay because,while in carter we concluded that a district court failure to set forth a statement of reasons is not a jurisdictional defect so long as a court of appeals may ascertain the rationale from the record,see at,a district court failure to include the express determination that there is no just reason for delay poses a jurisdictional hurdle,see berckeley ii,at.in this vein,we reject the parties contention that carter somehow obviates a district court obligation to make the express determination of no just reason for delay or that under carter we may overlook the district court failure to do so.we rejected this interpretation of carter in berckeley i,noting that carter was concerned with whether the court failure to articulate the factors discussed in allis chalmers divested us of appellate jurisdiction,not whether the express determination of no just cause for delay was required for certification under rule b.see berckeley i,at.
rule b express determination requirement 
from the time of our decision in berckeley i,it has been quite clear that a district court when entering a final judgment pursuant to rule b must make an express finding that there is no just reason for delay in entry of the judgment and that its failure to do so deprives us of jurisdiction over an appeal from the judgment.the exact contours of the district court obligation,and,more precisely,the question of whether a district court must employ the talismanic phrase no just reason for delay to satisfy rule b are,however,open questions in this court.we came close to settling the matter in berckeley i,and we thus begin our discussion of this issue with that case.
in berckeley i,the district court order directed the entry of final judgment in favor of the plaintiff against one of the defendants but the order contained neither an express determination that there is no just reason for delay,nor a clear indication from the district court rulings that it was considering all the questions relevant to a rule b determination.id.at quoting.b.we observed that nowhere in the district court orders resolving th e case did it use the words no just cause for delay or make any statement of an indisputably similar effect.id.at.the parties argued that we could overlook the district court failure in this regard because we could glean the court intent from language it used to praise expedition in the resolution of the proceedings,but w e decline d to adopt the position that general references to the necessity of expedition can substitute for the express determination required by the rule.id.
in rejecting the berckeley i parties contention that carter eliminated the express determination requirement,we noted that only one court,the court of appeals for the fifth circuit in kelly lee old fashioned hamburgers,cir en banc per curiam,has held that,notwithstanding a district court failure to state expressly in a rule b order that there was no just cause for delay,a court of appeals could exercise jurisdiction over an appeal from the order.berckeley i,at.in kelly,a closely divided en banc panel held that i f the language in the order appealed from,either independently or together with related portions of the record referred to in the order,reflects the district court unmistakable intent to enter a partial final judgment under rule b,nothing else is required to make the order appealable.at.notably,while the kelly majority stated its holding in terms of a rejection of the notion that a district court is required to mechanically recite the words no just reason for delay,the majority unmistakable intent standard releases a district court not only from the obligation to state that talismanic phrase but also to indicate with any similar language that it has made the express determination that rule b requires.thus,in kelly the majority found that the district court order,which was captioned b judgment and directed that there be final judgment entered pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,satisfied rule b although it contained no other statements indicating that the district court had considered whether there was cause for delay.see id.at.in contrast,the dissent in kelly interpreted rule b to require that a district court either recite the talismanic phrase there is no just reason for delay or some paraphrase thereof to satisfy the express determination requirement.see id.at.
we found kelly distinguishable in berckeley i because the district court rulings in berckeley i did not make clear its intent to enter a judgment pursuant to rule b whereas the district court in kelly plainly intended to enter a rule b judgment.see berckeley i,at.on this ground,we found the rule b order in berckeley i invalid and dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.see id.at.in berckeley i,we thus noted that t he manner in which we dispose of this case does not require us to address,head on,the issue presented in kelly.thus,we leave for another day deciding whether the words no just cause for delay are required in haec verba to confer appellate jurisdiction under rule b.id.at.we accordingly abstain ed from considering the merits of the court of appeals for the fifth circuit position in kelly until an analogous case,one in which there is an unmistakable intent to enter judgment under rule b but no express determination of no just cause for delay,presents itself.id.at.that case now has arrived.
here,the district court intent to enter judgment under rule b is unmistakable.the court june,order directs that f inal judgment be entered pursuant to.b in favor of the institutional defendants and against elliott on all claims.appellant resp.tab a at.nevertheless,in berckeley i we strongly hinted at our inclination to side with the dissenters in kelly.we noted that the touch the bases approach taken by the kelly dissenters,see kelly,at,has merit both because it is consistent with the plain meaning of rule b and because it would result in a predictable process by which appeals are taken under that rule.berckeley i,at.for these same reasons,today we conclude that the dissent in kelly offered the correct reading of rule b.
we hold that even in a case such as this one,in which a district court clearly intends to enter judgment pursuant to rule b,it must state expressly that it has determined that there is no just reason for delay.if it fails to do so,that judgment is not a final judgment under rule b,and we do not have jurisdiction over an appeal from that judgment.we note that although we part ways with the court of appeals for the fifth circuit on this issue,our decision in this case aligns us with the positions of the courts of appeals for the second,ninth,tenth,and district of columbia circuits.see blackman dist.of columbia,stockman water,llc vaca partners,cir of home builders norton,cir ltv steel united mine workers in re chateaugay,cir per curiam 
we also are persuaded,however,that rule b does not require that a district court use the talismanic phrase there is no just reason for delay.the district court may state that it has determined expressly that there is no just reason for delay using those precise words,or it may paraphrase or use language of an indisputably similar effect,berckeley i,at,so long as the district court order clearly contains the express determination rule b requires.
in ascertaining the meaning of rule b express determination requirement,we begin,as with any interpretive exercise,with the text of the rule.the supreme court and this court have repeatedly held that the federal rules of civil procedure,like any other statute,should be given their plain meaning.berckeley i,at citing bus.guides,chromatic commc ns,united states nahodil,cir some citations omitted see also hagan rogers,cir same.as with a statute,our inquiry is complete if we find the text of the rule to be clear and unambiguous.business guides,at.at.
the text of rule b is quite plain it provides that the court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more,but fewer than all,claims or parties only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.emphasis added.rule b use of the word expressly to modify determines makes clear that the district court is required to determine and to articulate the fact that it has determined that there is no just reason for delay.the plain meaning of express compels this conclusion.see black law dictionary ed defining express as c learly and unmistakably communicated directly stated webster third new international dictionary merriam webster defining express as directly and distinctly stated or expressed rather than implied or left to reference.as we stated in berckeley i,
under the dictionary definition of express,express determination that there is no just reason for delay can mean only one thing the judge very words must state specifically that he or she has decided that there is no just reason for delay.kelly,at.thus,the argument proceeds,it is that the first sentence of rule b requires an explicit manifestation that the district court has determined there is no just cause for delay and directing the entry of final judgment.
at some internal quotation marks omitted.on this same ground,the dissent in kelly determined that rule b requirement of an express determination precludes the possibility that a district court order may satisfy rule b where a determination of no just reason for delay is implied but is not expressed in the order.see kelly,at.in light of the straightforward definition of express,we agree with that conclusion.
the second sentence of rule b reinforces our understanding of the rule.it provides that o therwise,any order or other decision,however designated,that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties is not a final judgment under rule b.emphasis added.this sentence anticipates the precise circumstance in this case,in which the district court designates or titles an order to be a rule b final judgment but fails to make the express determination that the rule requires.the effect of the omission is clear it renders any purported rule b judgment in which the district court fails to make the express determination.the inclusion of this clarifying statement thus serves to underscore the importance of the express determination requirement.kelly,at.
the kelly majority entirely failed to address the text of rule b and in the absence of a convincing alt
