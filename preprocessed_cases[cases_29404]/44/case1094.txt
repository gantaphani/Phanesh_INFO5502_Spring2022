factual background and procedural history 
on july,michael son aaron shot andrea arrington eight times,killing her.it was the tragic culmination of an abusive relationship.aaron used his father smith wesson handgun in the murder.
arrington and aaron had lived together in an apartment with their infant son from to july,when arrington petitioned for and obtained a temporary protection from abuse order the pfa against aaron.the order described aaron history of violence against arrington,including incidents of choking,slapping,and,on one occasion two years prior to the pfa issuance,giving arrington a black eye.those assaults were not the only illegality in aaron past.he had a criminal history that included check fraud for which he was serving probation at the time he murdered arrington,intimidation of another woman with whom he had a child,and shoplifting as a juvenile.he had also been charged with indecent but was eventually found not guilty.app.at.michael was aware of his son several encounters with the law although aaron was a legal adult,he continued to have a room in his father home,to drive his father truck,and to receive mail at his father address.
after the temporary pfa was issued,michael met with aaron to discuss the pfa.aaron considered the order to be inaccurate and told michael that he would go to court on july,as required,to contest it in person.michael advised aaron that,in the meantime,he should not try to retrieve his personal belongings from arrington apartment unless escorted by police officers.on july,a final pfa was entered in the delaware county court of common pleas,which extended the terms of the temporary pfa by six months.pursuant to the final pfa,aaron was evicted from the apartment and forbidden from possessing firearms.
on july,five days after the final pfa was issued and less than a week before the murder aaron violated the pfa by returning to arrington apartment and threatening to cut her up if she reported the violation.appellee br.at app.at.despite that threat,arrington promptly called the police.chester police officer william swanson was on patrol and responded to the call,which became the subject of a criminal complaint that swanson filed against aaron the next day.an arrest warrant for aaron issued several days later,on july.
soon after aaron left arrington apartment on july,michael received a phone call from one of aaron friends,stating that aaron had violated the pfa.michael subsequently contacted captain anita amaro,the chief of the chester police department,to find out w hat was going on.app.at.the captain confirmed that aaron had violated the pfa and that a warrant would soon be issued for his arrest she also provided michael a copy of officer swanson complaint.although michael then attempted to call his son several times,he was unable to reach him.
with a planned vacation to florida only days away and his son still out of contact,michael resorted to writing aaron two notes on july.he left the notes for aaron on his dining room table,alongside aaron mail,hoping that aaron would see them when he came over to pick up the mail.the notes reveal michael pleading with aaron to turn himself in.in the first note,michael said that aaron violation was not that serious and that,if aaron cooperated with the police,michael would not only pay him a bonus of but also post his bail.id.at.at the same time,he asked aaron to return his truck or else he would report it missing.id.at.in the second note,michael noted that,in the worse scenario,aaron would have to go to jail but that plenty of other people have been locked up.id.at.michael also claimed that,because he was a police officer,aaron would get a courtesy break.id.in fact,he said,he had already spoken to people about aaron situation.id.at.fatefully,michael also left the copy of officer swanson criminal complaint for aaron to read,which described arrington report to the police,including that aaron had threatened to cut her up if she reported the pfa violation.
the day after michael wrote his letters to aaron,aaron left a on michael home answering machine,saying that he was okay and would turn himself in when the arrest warrant was issued.id.at.at that point,aaron had not yet returned to his father home and read the notes or the complaint.michael heard the message that same day but did not remove the notes or the criminal complaint.the papers remained undisturbed on the dining room table when michael departed for florida on july.
in preparing to leave on vacation,michael brought his service weapon home with him and locked it in his bedroom,as he customarily did when away.he had a wooden bedroom door that he locked with a lock,keeping one key on his key chain and the other hidden in the kitchen.id.at.inside the bedroom,michael locked the gun itself with a police gun lock.he hid one key to the gun lock in a dresser drawer and the other he kept in his possession.he stored the magazine and the ammunition separately in a duffle bag,which he kept in a corner of the bedroom.
michael maintains that he complied with standard police policy in storing his weapon.according to a chester police department directive,it was optional,though preferred,for officers to take their weapons home.id.at.captain james chubb,a firearms instructor for the department,stated in his deposition that,while nothing is as safe as no weapon at home id.at,keeping a weapon at home is preferable to keeping it at the police station.captain chubb said,it is a safety issue if an officer is done with work,puts his weapon in the locker,and then decides to walk out to his vehicle in full uniform with no gun.id.
at some point on july,while michael was in florida,aaron went to his father home and,after finishing a bottle of proof alcohol,read the notes and police complaint that his father had left for him,moving them from the dining room table to the bedroom he customarily slept in while at his father home.he then broke down his father bedroom door and ransacked the room.he found the gun lock key in his father drawer and the ammunition in the duffle bag.he next turned to a methodical search of the internet to learn how to load the weapon,disengage the safety,and otherwise operate the gun.after that,he tracked arrington down and shot her to death.
following the murder,aaron telephoned two of his friends and confessed to the crime including a description of breaking into his father bedroom and learning online how to operate the weapon.shortly thereafter,chester police officers shot and killed aaron while he stood outside his father home,brandishing the pistol.
arrington estate the estate,by and through its administratrix,brought this action against michael for civil damages pursuant to for the deprivation of arrington substantive due process right to bodily integrity.the district court denied michael motion for summary judgment asserting qualified immunity and statutory immunity.the court found that m aterial disputes exist about the factual predicates necessary to apply the doctrine of qualified immunity to shield officer michael from suit.id.at.with respect to the statutory immunity claim under the child safety lock act of csla,which grants immunity when a handgun is made inoperable by the use of a safety lock,the court held the statute to be ambiguous and similarly determined that material factual disputes exist on this record about whether the statute immunizes officer michael from civil liability in these circumstances.id.this timely appeal followed.
