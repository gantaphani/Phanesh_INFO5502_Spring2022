defendant nicolas carranza appeals a jury verdict awarding compensatory and punitive damages to victims of torture,extrajudicial killing,and crimes against humanity in violation of the alien tort statute ats,also called the alien tort claims act atca and the torture victims protection act tvpa.carranza argues that the district court abused its discretion by holding that extraordinary circumstances justified equitable tolling of the statute of limitations,not granting comity to the salvadoran amnesty law,and making various evidentiary rulings.he also contends that the district court erred in its instruction to the jury on command responsibility.we affirm.
background 
from the to the,el salvador was governed by a military dictatorship.by the,opposition to the military dominance increased.in response,militant organizations,such as the salvadoran security forces,carried out systematic repression and human rights abuses against political dissenters.civil unrest in the country resulted in a war which lasted from to.
on january,the government of el salvador and the salvadoran guerilla forces signed a peace accord sponsored by the united nations.in march,the salvadoran legislature adopted an amnesty law precluding criminal or civil liability for political or common crimes committed prior to january.in march,the first national elections were held after the end of the civil war.
carranza spent nearly thirty years as an officer in the armed forces of el salvador.he served as el salvador of defense and public security from about october until january.while in this position,he exercised operational control over the salvadoran security of the national guard,the national police,and the treasury police.he also served as director of the treasury police from june until may.in,he became a resident of the united states.he moved to memphis,tennessee,in and has been a naturalized citizen since.
plaintiff cecilia santos was tortured and assaulted while in custody at the national police headquarters in san salvador.on september,she was arrested and accused of planting a bomb.she was taken to the headquarters of the national police where she was electrocuted,physically tortured with acid,and had an object forced into her vagina.she spent months in confinement.
on september,members of the national police entered plaintiff jose calderon home,forced him to the ground,and murdered calderon father.
plaintiff erlinda franco husband,manuel,was abducted,tortured,and killed in.he was a professor at the national university and was a prominent leader of the democratic revolutionary front fdr.on november,he attended a meeting of fdr leadership in san salvador.while at the meeting,members of the security forces abducted franco and five other leaders of the fdr.later that day,the bodies of franco and the other five men were found.each had visible signs of torture.
on august,plaintiff daniel alvarado was abducted by members of the treasury police while attending a soccer game.he was accused of killing albert schaufelberger,a united states military advisor in el salvador.after four days of torture,alvarado confessed to killing schaufelberger.carranza presided over the ensuing press conference.after being held in custody for several weeks,alvarado was questioned by members of the united states navy and federal bureau of investigation about the assassination of schaufelberger.alvarado was unable to provide accurate information about the assassination and subsequently explained that his confession was coerced through torture.after imprisonment for over two years,alvarado fled to sweden.
plaintiffs filed suit against carranza on december.using a command responsibility theory,they claim that carranza is liable for the acts of torture,extrajudicial killing,and crimes against humanity.
carranza filed several motions during the course of the litigation,raising the same issues he argues on appeal the district court should not equitably toll the statute of limitations,and the salvadoran amnesty law bars plaintiffs claims.
after trial,the jury found carranza liable and awarded in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages to each plaintiff.however,the jury could not reach a unanimous verdict as to claims made by plaintiff ana chavez.the district court declared a mistrial as to her claims,and those claims were later voluntarily dismissed.
discussion 
equitable tolling of the statute of limitationsa.
under the tvpa,plaintiffs have ten years from the date the cause of action arose to bring suit.however,the ats does not specify a statute of limitations.when faced with this situation,courts should apply the limitations period provided by the local jurisdiction unless a rule from elsewhere in federal law clearly provides a closer analogy than available state statutes,and when federal policies at stake and the practicalities of litigation make that rule a significantly more appropriate vehicle for interstitial lawmaking.star steel thomas,d quoting delcostello teamsters,d.
like all courts that have decided this issue since the passage of the tvpa,we conclude that the limitations period applicable to claims under the tvpa likewise applies to claims made under the ats.see jean dorelien,cir papa united states,cir doe islamic salvation front,d.
the tvpa and the ats share a common purpose in protecting human rights internationally.the tvpa grants relief to victims of torture,and the ats grants access to federal courts for aliens seeking redress from torts committed in violation of the law of nations.both statutes use civil suits as the mechanism to advance their shared purpose and both can be found in the same location within the united states code.see arce garcia,cir papa,at.
likewise,the justifications for the application of the doctrine of equitable tolling under the tvpa apply equally to claims brought under the ats.congress provided explicit guidance regarding the application of equitable tolling under the tvpa.the tvpa calls for consideration of all equitable tolling principles in calculating this statute of limitations period with a view towards giving justice to plaintiff rights,at.
we have identified five factors a district court should consider when determining whether to equitably toll the statute of limitations lack of notice of the filing requirement,lack of constructive knowledge of the filing requirement,diligence in pursuing one rights,absence of prejudice to the defendant,and the plaintiff reasonableness in remaining ignorant of the particular legal requirement.see memphis brooks museum of art,cir.however,the propriety of equitable tolling must necessarily be determined on a basis.id.quoting truitt county of wayne,cir.
again,congress has provided explicit guidance as to when to apply the equitable tolling doctrine in tvpa cases 
illustrative,but not exhaustive,of the types of tolling principles which may be applicable include the following.the statute of limitations should be tolled during the time the defendant was absent from the united states or from any jurisdiction in which the same or similar action arising from the same facts may be maintained by the plaintiff,provided that the remedy in that jurisdiction is adequate and available.excluded also from calculation of the statute of limitations would be the period when a defendant has immunity from suit.the statute of limitations should also be tolled for the period of time in which the plaintiff is imprisoned or otherwise incapacitated.it should also be tolled where the defendant has concealed his or her whereabouts or the plaintiff has been unable to discover the identity of the offender.
at emphasis added.
courts that have addressed equitable tolling in the context of claims brought under the tvpa and ats have determined that the existence of extraordinary circumstances justifies application of the equitable tolling doctrine.see arce,at,tolling the statute of limitations under the tvpa and ats until the signing of the peace accord in because the fear of reprisals against plaintiffs relatives orchestrated by people aligned with the defendants excused the plaintiffs delay cabello,cir tolling the statute of limitations under the tvpa and ats u ntil the first civilian president was elected in for claims brought against a chilean military officer hilao estate of marcos,cir tolling the statute of limitations for tvpa and ats claims against former philippine dictator ferdinand marcos until the marcos regime was overthrown forti,holding that the plaintiff raised an issue of fact as to whether the ats statute of limitations should be tolled for claims against an argentine military officer until a government was in place.
when the situation in a given country precludes the administration of justice,fairness may require equitable tolling.in such limited circumstances,where plaintiffs legitimately fear reprisals against themselves or family members from the regime in power,justice may require tolling.these circumstances,outside plaintiffs control,make it impossible for plaintiffs to assert their tvpa and ats claims in a timely manner.in such extraordinary circumstances,equitable tolling of tvpa and ats claims is appropriate.
in sum,we conclude that the limitations period applicable to tvpa claims also governs claims under the ats,equitable tolling principles apply,and the existence of extraordinary circumstances provides a justification for the application of the equitable tolling doctrine.
we review a decision on the application of equitable tolling de novo where the facts underlying the equitable tolling are undisputed.cook com r of soc,cir.when the facts are in dispute,we apply an abuse of discretion standard.id.here,carranza disputes plaintiffs contention that facts and circumstances in el salvador justify equitable tolling.accordingly,we review the district court decision for an abuse of discretion.
each of the acts for which carranza was held liable occurred more than ten years before plaintiffs filed suit.however,the district court determined that the pervasive violence that consumed el salvador until march when el salvador held its first national elections following the signing of the peace accord justified equitable tolling of the statute of limitations.these findings of fact are supported by the record.
the evidence established that widespread human rights abuses were carried out by the salvadoran military against civilians during the country civil war and that plaintiffs feared reprisals against themselves or their family members.carranza held a position of power within the salvadoran military regime.
in addition,the violence associated with the civil war continued after the signing of the peace accord in until at least march,when the first national elections were held after the civil war.plaintiffs submitted affidavits stating that even after they arrived in the united states,they were afraid that their families in el salvador would be subject to repression or violence by the salvadoran military.they also stated that they did not feel that it was safe for their families in el salvador to bring suit until many years after the end of the civil war.given this evidence,it was within the district court discretion to toll the statute of limitations until march.
carranza argues that the district court abused its discretion in tolling the statute of limitations because plaintiffs did not introduce evidence at trial proving they feared reprisals for bringing this lawsuit,and the plaintiffs were not aware of their right to bring a legal action during the period in which they feared reprisals by the salvadoran military.carranza arguments fail.
first,the decision to invoke equitable tolling is a question of law.rose dole,cir.the district court addressed and decided the equitable tolling issue in denying carranza motions to dismiss and for summary judgment.as such,the issue had been resolved prior to trial and no additional proof was required.
second,equitable tolling was justified by extraordinary circumstances outside of plaintiffs control,which made it impossible for plaintiffs to assert their claims in a timely manner.whether the plaintiffs knew they had an actionable claim under united states law does not change the fact that at least until march,the circumstances in el salvador were not sufficiently safe for plaintiffs to seek redress in court.
the district court appropriately considered the documentary evidence and witness declarations in addressing the issue of equitable tolling when it considered and denied carranza motions to dismiss and for summary judgment.the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding extraordinary circumstances existed justifying the equitable tolling of the statute of limitations.
ii.salvadoran amnesty law 
the salvadoran amnesty law was passed by the salvadoran legislature in order to provide amnesty to all those who participated in political or common crimes during the civil war in el salvador before.see decreto legislativo de aprueba la ley sobre la amnistía general para la consolidación de la paz legislative decree of approving the general amnesty law for consolidation of the peace,diario oficial,de marzo de.the purpose of the salvadoran amnesty law is to reconcile and reunite the salvadoran family by promulgating,and immediately implementing,legal provisions that protect the right of the entire salvadoran population to fully conduct its activities in harmony,and a climate of trust and respect for all social sectors.
carranza claims that he is entitled to amnesty pursuant to the salvadoran amnesty law he argues that the district court erred when it declined to apply the salvadoran amnesty law to plaintiffs claims.we review the district court decision not to grant comity to the salvadoran amnesty law for an abuse of discretion.see,bigio,cir stonington partners,lernout hauspie speech prods,cir taveras taveraz,cir t he theory of comity can serve as a discretionary basis for a court to determine whether a foreign country court judgment should be given preclusive effect.
international comity is the recognition which one nation allows within its territory to the legislative,executive or judicial acts of another nation,having due regard both to international duty and convenience,and to the rights of its own citizens or other persons who are under the protection of its laws.hilton guyot.in order for an issue of comity to arise,there must be an actual conflict between the domestic and foreign law.hartford fire ins,d.there is no conflict for comity purposes where a person subject to regulation by two states can comply with the laws of both.id.at quoting restatement third foreign relations law cmt.e.
there is no conflict between domestic and foreign law because the salvadoran amnesty law can not be interpreted to apply extraterritorially.a statute must not be interpreted as having extraterritorial effect without a clear indication that it was intended to apply outside the country enacting it.bmw stores,peugeot motors of,cir.there is nothing in the salvadoran amnesty law to suggest that it should apply or was intended to apply outside of el salvador.
moreover,compliance with both domestic law and the salvadoran amnesty law is possible.plaintiffs may be barred from filing suit in el salvador,but they are not barred from filing suit in the united states.likewise,if carranza were living in el salvador,he would likely be immune from suit.however,he is a citizen and resident of the united states and is therefore subject to civil liability for his violations of the ats and tvpa.in addition,the republic of el salvador,as amicus,argues that this case would be rejected if it were brought in el salvador further demonstrating that salvadoran courts can apply the salvadoran amnesty law domestically without undermining the jurisdiction of united states courts.
carranza reliance on empagran,d,is misplaced.in empagran,the supreme court interpreted an antitrust statute,the foreign trade antitrust improvements act of ftai,which expressly places extraterritorial limits on the application of the sherman act.with some exceptions,the ftai provides that the sherman act shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce with foreign nations.id.at.quoting.in reaching its conclusion,the supreme court did not address the ats or tvpa,nor did it discuss international comity.therefore,empagran is of little relevance to the law at issue in this case.
iii.evidence at trial 
a.the truth commission report 
carranza contends that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the truth commission report into evidence.specifically,carranza argues that the report is not timely and,therefore,is not trustworthy.
the truth commission report was prepared by the commission on the truth for el salvador,an entity established under the united peace agreements between the government of el salvador and the frente farabundo marti para la liberación nacional.the truth commission report sets forth the factual findings that the truth commission discovered through its investigation of el investigation mandated by the peace agreements sponsored by the.the district court admitted the truth commission report into evidence under the public records and reports exception to the hearsay rule.
under the public records and reports exception to the hearsay rule,reports of public offices or agencies setting forth factual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law are admissible unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.fed.evid.c.to determine whether a report is trustworthy,courts consider the following four factors the timeliness of the investigation upon which the report is based,the special skill or experience of the investigators,whether the agency held a hearing,and possible motivational problems.bank of lexington trust,cir.
carranza claims that the report is not timely because the investigation on which it was based did not begin until at least eight years after carranza association with the el salvador military was over,and ended seven years after he moved to the united states.however,the timeliness factor focuses on how much time passed between the events being investigated and the beginning of the investigation.see id.at.here,the peace accord was signed on january,and the truth commission began its investigation on july,seven months later.therefore,the timeliness of the investigation suggests the report is trustworthy.
carranza also contends that the truth commission report is untrustworthy because the commission did not hold a hearing.however,a formal hearing is not necessary when other indicia of trustworthiness are present.id.even though the truth commission did not conduct a formal hearing,it interviewed numerous witnesses,victims,and relatives associated with the events described in the report.in addition,the truth commission reviewed thousands of complaints of acts of violence,examined documents,interviewed members of the military,and visited locations of acts of violence.
for the foregoing reasons,the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the truth commission report into evidence.
testimony of ambassador white and professor karl 
carranza argues that the district court abused its discretion in allowing two of plaintiffs expert witnesses,robert white,former ambassador to el salvador,and professor terry karl,the former director of the center of latin american studies at stanford university,to testify.carranza objects to several statements made by both experts as highly inflammatory and based on inadmissible hearsay.
experts may base their testimony on inadmissible facts of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field.fed.evid.ambassador white testimony was based on intelligence gathered by himself,his staff,and other government agents.furthermore,ambassador white was listed,without objection by carranza,in the joint pretrial order as an expert witness.professor karl testified as to the levels of violence in el salvador during the period of military control.professor karl relied upon interviews,commission reports including the truth commission report,documentary research,and field research to form her opinions.see,katt city of new york,d,noting that interviews,commission reports,research articles,scholarly journals,books,and newspaper articles are the types of data reasonably relied upon by social science experts.
carranza also contends that the district court improperly admitted testimony by professor karl.carranza claims that professor karl should not have been permitted to testify about military procedures and command responsibility because she has never served in a military organization and she was never identified as a military expert.
professor karl report contains a lengthy discussion of her opinions about salvadoran military structure and carranza command responsibility.in her report,professor karl discusses her credentials as an expert in the politics of latin america including the military strategies of both the salvadoran military and security forces and the armed opposition,the command structure of the salvadoran military,the corruption of the salvadoran military and security forces,and the practice of death squads.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the jury to determine the weight to be given to the testimony of professor karl and ambassador white.
embassy cables 
carranza contends that trial exhibit was improperly admitted into evidence because its purported author has disavowed authorship.
trial exhibit is a united states government document describing a conversation in between a official and salvadoran military officers in which carranza supported a line of thinking that assassinations of political opponents should be accomplished whenever possible.ambassador white testified that the author of this document was colonel brian bosch,a military representative at the embassy in san salvador.ambassador white used the contents of this document to support his testimony regarding the salvadoran military responsibility for the six fdr murders,the basis for franco claim.in a affidavit,colonel bosch claims he is not the author of this cable and that he has no personal knowledge of the statements attributed to carranza.
trial exhibit was admissible under rule of the federal rules of evidence.through the testimony of ambassador white,the plaintiffs established a foundation that certain cables,including trial exhibit,were transmitted from united states governmental agents describing or recording events made at or near the time the acts took place by someone with personal knowledge of the acts.ambassador white also testified that the cables were kept in the course of regularly conducted business of the united states governmental agency,and it was the regular practice of the agencies to make those records.colonel bosch affidavit disputes that he is the author of trial exhibit but it does not dispute its authenticity.
however,even if trial exhibit was improperly admitted,it did not unfairly prejudice carranza.the gravamen of the cable is the knowledge and approval of the assassination of the fdr leaders by members of the salvadoran military,including carranza.this was corroborated by several witnesses and exhibits at trial,including the testimony of ambassador white and professor karl,as well as the truth commission report and several other cables.
carranza also argues that the copy of trial exhibit he was provided with during discovery is illegible and highly redacted.therefore,carranza characterizes the cleaner copy of trial exhibit,provided to the jury by plaintiffs,as previously undisclosed.this contention is without merit and is belied by the fact that plaintiffs provided carranza with a copy of trial exhibit during his deposition and carranza was asked a number of questions about it.
photographs 
carranza argues that the district court abused its discretion when it admitted into evidence photographs depicting dead bodies and victims of military atrocities.carranza contends that the photographs were unfairly prejudicial.
the photographs are relevant to prove crimes against humanity and to establish liability under a theory of command responsibility.they are relevant proof that the salvadoran military was engaged in a systemic attack against civilians.the photographs also demonstrate that carranza had notice of the human rights violations
