the surviving wife and sons of claude taylor taylor brought suit against various companies in the polyvinyl chloride pvc industry and an industry trade association,alleging that their failure to warn,fraud,and civil conspiracy caused taylor wrongful death.after discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment on all counts.the district court granted summary judgment,holding that taylor employer,monsanto company monsanto,was a sophisticated user of defendants products and the defendants owed taylor no duty to warn about the dangers of their products.the district court dismissed the fraud and conspiracy claims as well,finding no evidence in the record that the defendants were responsible for the warnings in question,or that they had any knowledge of or control over monsanto activities at the plant where taylor worked.plaintiffs appealed.
after examining the record,we agree with the district court conclusion that monsanto was a sophisticated user of the defendants products,and that,on this record,a reasonable jury could not find for the plaintiffs on the fraud and conspiracy claims.we therefore affirm.
because this is an appeal from a grant of summary judgment,we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the,here the appellants.levesque doocy,cir.in light of the district court exhaustive account below,see taylor airco,d,we confine ourselves to the facts necessary for our decision.
taylor worked for monsanto from to,at the indian orchard plant in springfield,massachusetts.for much of this period,taylor was employed in the plant pvc polymerization department.pvc was manufactured at indian orchard by combining vinyl chloride monomer vc,water,a suspending agent or emulsifier,and a catalyst in a large tank,or kettle.at various stages of the manufacturing process,small amounts of vc were released into the ambient air of the workspace,thereby exposing taylor to the chemical.in august,monsanto closed down its pvc operations at indian orchard,and taylor took a new position in which he was not exposed to vc.
monsanto acquired the vc it used at indian orchard from a variety of sources.in,monsanto began manufacturing vc at its plant in texas city,texas.monsanto shipped vc manufactured in texas city by pressurized railcar to indian orchard,where it was stored in outdoor tanks until it was processed.between and,the texas city plant supplied most of the vc used at indian orchard.however,monsanto also obtained some amounts of vc from other suppliers as backup.included among these suppliers was appellee the dow chemical company dow.in,monsanto texas city plant shut down,and dow became the principal supplier of vc to indian orchard.other vc suppliers included appellees goodrich corporation goodrich and union carbide corporation union carbide.
many of the dangers associated with vc have long been understood.by the,the plastics industry knew that vc was highly flammable and that it had anaesthetic effects when inhaled in high concentrations.early safety warnings issued by the industry reflect this knowledge.the warning principally at issue in this case,chemical safety data sheet,was published by an industry trade association,appellee american chemistry council acc,and provided to pvc manufacturers the first version of,published in,was sixteen pages in length,and contained information about the scientific properties of vc,as well as proper methods for shipping,unloading,storing,and handling vc.the document also identified fire and explosion as the principal health hazards associated with vc,and stated that other than these hazards,vc present ed no very serious risk in general handling.also recommended that workplace concentration s of vinyl chloride be kept below the upper safe limit of ppm parts per million at all times.the same limit had been adopted in by the american conference of governmental industrial hygienists acgih as the threshold limit value tlv monsanto incorporated a ppm exposure limit as well as other language from into the indian orchard standard procedure manual for pvc polymerization.
in the late and,companies in the pvc industry began to learn that exposure to vc was more dangerous than previously believed.we describe these developments in greater detail below,but,broadly speaking,three discoveries were made.first,in,scientists at dow discovered that chronic exposure to vc in concentrations as low as ppm caused liver injury in laboratory animals.second,in appellee goodrich discovered that a significant number of its pvc kettle cleaners had developed a degenerative hand condition,now known as acroosteolysis.third,in late or early,italian doctor viola discovered cancerous tumors in rats exposed to ppm of vc for four hours a day,five days a week,for twelve months.
despite the discoveries during this period,acc did not revise until.the revised version of warned that c hronic overexposure to vc may produce liver injury,and noted the discovery of acroosteolysis among pvc workers.the revised version also stated,r ecent research studies reported from italy indicate that repeated,high level exposures of rats to vinyl chloride monomer vapor can cause the development of malignant tumors.however,many years of industrial experience have not demonstrated any carcinogenicity to humans.the maintained a recommended exposure limit of ppm,which it characterized as well below a level producing any signs or symptoms of toxicity.
in contrast,in acgih revised the tlv from ppm to ppm in february,dow mailed its customers a copy of the with a sticker affixed to the front.the sticker noted acgih reduction of the tlv to ppm,and stated that dow maintained an average exposure limit in its own facilities of ppm.in an attached cover letter,dow recommended that its customers adopt the ppm limit and offered to assist them in reaching it.
on january,appellee goodrich issued a press release disclosing that three of its pvc workers had died of angiosarcoma,a rare form of liver cancer.the press release stated that goodrich was investigating whether the deaths were related to occupational causes.monsanto immediately informed employees at the indian orchard plant.prior to this time,supervisors at indian orchard did not know that vc presented a cancer risk to humans on april,the united states occupational safety and health administration osha established an emergency temporary vc exposure limit of ppm as a ceiling value.on october,osha established a permissible exposure limit pel of ppm as an average,and ppm as a ceiling averaged over any period exceeding minutes.
on march,claude taylor was diagnosed with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma,a form of liver cancer.he died seven months later,on october.
on january,taylor surviving wife and sons brought suit against monsanto,acc,dow,goodrich,union carbide,and other vc suppliers and pvc manufacturers,alleging their liability for failure to warn,fraud,and civil conspiracy.subsequently,on february,plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint the complaint against eighteen defendants the complaint contains ten counts.counts and count x allege failure to warn under various theories against the defendants,dow,goodrich,and union carbide.count v alleges fraud and fraudulent concealment against the defendants.counts allege failure to warn against monsanto.finally,count ix alleges civil conspiracy against the conspiring defendants,which include acc,dow,gencorp gencorp,goodrich,the goodyear tire and rubber company goodyear,union carbide,and other named parties.
after various dismissals by the district court,ten defendants remained in the case acc borden,conoco,dow gencorp goodrich goodyear honeywell international,olin corporation and union carbide.the defendants moved for summary judgment on all remaining counts,arguing,inter alia,that monsanto was a sophisticated user of their products that the plaintiffs could not establish that defendants failure to warn caused taylor injury that taylor had not relied on their warnings as a matter of law and that they had no control over,or knowledge of,the conditions in monsanto indian orchard plant.plaintiffs opposed the motions.
the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants.after laying out the evidence at length,the court held that there could be no liability for failure to warn because monsanto was knowledgeable of the risks of vc in light of monsanto size and expertise,defendants reasonably relied on it to provide adequate warnings to taylor.the court rejected the fraud claim because the record revealed that taylor had not relied on,and the record contained no evidence that the defendants were responsible for the particular representations at issue.finally,the court held that the conspiracy claim failed as a matter of law for lack of an underlying tort,and because the record contained no evidence that the conspiring defendants had any control over the conditions at indian orchard or knowledge of the information monsanto provided to its workers.
plaintiffs timely appealed.they argue that the district court erred in its determination that the defendants reasonably relied on monsanto to provide taylor with warnings taylor indirectly relied on,which the defendants collectively authored as members of the acc and the record contains evidence that the conspiring defendants substantially assisted monsanto in providing it with,which they knew was widely relied upon in the industry and which monsanto in fact incorporated into its own safety measures.appellees dispute these contentions and advance several arguments as alternative grounds for affirming the order of the district court.

failure to warn 
legal principles 
under massachusetts law,a supplier has a duty to warn foreseeable users of dangers in the use of its product of which the supplier knows or should have known.bavuso caterpillar.however,according to the sophisticated user defense,there is no duty to warn an end user of a product latent characteristics or dangers when the user knows or reasonably should know of those dangers carrel cord braid.the sophisticated user defense is a corollary of the open and obvious doctrine,under which there is no duty to warn where a danger presented by a product is obvious,bavuso,at.these doctrines apply where the user appreciates the danger to the same extent as a warning would provide.knowlton deseret,cir applying law.warning those who already appreciate a danger is superfluous and is unlikely to have a deterrent effect.carrel,at hoffman houghton chem.
the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc has distinguished the sophisticated user defense from a similar defense known as the bulk supplier defense.hoffman,at describing them as separate,conceptually discrete affirmative defenses see also donahue phillips petroleum,cir applying law similar.the bulk supplier defense says that a supplier may,in some circumstances,discharge its duty to warn foreseeable users of the dangers in the use of its products by reasonably relying on an intermediary.hoffman,at.as the sjc observed,there are several key differences between the bulk supplier and sophisticated user defenses.the bulk supplier defense allows a supplier defendant to satisfy its duty to warn,while the sophisticated user defense relieves the supplier from such a duty.id.at see also gray badger mining.the bulk supplier defense presupposes the existence of an intermediary between the supplier and the foreseeable user the sophisticated user defense requires no intermediating relationship,although it permits one.hoffman,at see carrel,at upholding sophisticated user defense instruction in case with two intermediate parties.
these differences reflect the distinct rationales of the bulk supplier and sophisticated user defenses.as explained above,the latter is premised on the idea that certain dangers are obvious to a sophisticated user,making a warning superfluous.see carrel,at.in contrast,the bulk supplier defense is premised on the special difficulties that bulk suppliers face in directly warning foreseeable end users of the dangers of their products.hoffman,at.for example,bulk supplies are often transported in tank trucks,box cars,or large industrial drums,stored in bulk,and then repackage d or reformulate d.id.at.this process makes it unlikely that warnings provided by a supplier will reach all foreseeable users.even if warnings could reach all foreseeable users,the multitudinous commercial uses to which bulk supplies are often put would make it crushingly burdensome to require the supplier to provide direct warnings.id.at.massachusetts has therefore chosen to allow suppliers of bulk supplies to satisfy their duty to warn by warning intermediaries where reliance on the intermediaries to transmit the warnings to end users is reasonable.
appellants argue that reasonable reliance is also an element of the sophisticated user defense,at least in cases where an employer acts as an intermediary between the supplier and an employee.they point to language in carrel stating that the sophisticated user defense is derived from the restatement second of torts,and suggest that comment n of section requires,in this case,an analysis of whether it was reasonable for dow,goodrich,and union carbide to rely on monsanto to warn taylor.carrel,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in support of their position,appellants cite both the district court below and courts in other jurisdictions that have considered reasonable reliance when determining whether the sophisticated user defense applies.see,smith walter best,cir applying ohio law willis raymark,cir applying law goodbar whitehead,applying law.in response,appellees argue that under massachusetts law,reasonable reliance is not an element of the sophisticated user defense,and that the supreme judicial court rejected this approach when it distinguished the sophisticated user and bulk supplier defenses in hoffman.
we agree with appellees that reasonable reliance is not an element of the sophisticated user defense as it exists under massachusetts law.in hoffman,the sjc compared the defenses side by side,and described only the bulk supplier defense as involving a determination that the supplier reasonably relied on an intermediary to transmit warnings.see hoffman,at.subsequently,when the court formally adopted the sophisticated user defense in carrel,it did not mention a reasonable reliance element.see carrel,at.nor is reasonable reliance discussed in massachusetts pattern civil jury instructions.see patrick brady et,massachusetts superior court civil practice jury instructions f when considering the extent and nature of the manufacturer duty to warn,the jury should take into account knowledge that the manufacturer had,or could be expected to have,regarding the use of the product as compared to the knowledge and skills of the user.
moreover,because the sophisticated user defense may apply even where there is no intermediary between the supplier and the injured party,hoffman,at,there may be no reliance on an intermediary for a court or to evaluate.even where an intermediary exists,as in this case,the rationale of the sophisticated user defense is distinct.the question for purposes of applying the sophisticated user defense is whether the end user appreciated the particular danger because of its sophistication,whatever the source of that sophistication.whether it would be reasonable for a supplier to rely on that user to transmit a warning is a different question,and the answer to that question may reveal little about what dangers the end user already appreciated because of its sophistication.
furthermore,the sjc has made clear its view that comment n to section of the restatement,from which the factors for assessing reasonable reliance derive,relates specifically to the bulk supplier defense.hoffman,at the bulk supplier doctrine originates in the restatement second of torts comment n.the sophisticated user defense also derives from section,but from comment k,not comment gray,at.comment k discusses clause b of section,which restricts a supplier duty to warn to cases where it has no reason to believe that those for whose use the chattel is supplied will realize its dangerous condition.restatement second torts b emphasis added.clause b thus specifically concerns cases where the product user appreciates the danger posed by the rationale behind the sophisticated user and open and obvious doctrines.see carrel,at.elaborating on clause b,comment k provides it is not necessary for the supplier to inform those for whose use the chattel is supplied of a condition which a mere casual looking over will disclose t he condition,although readily observable,may be one which only persons of special experience would realize to be dangerous.id.emphasis added.this language provides that there is no duty to warn where a person of special experience appreciates the danger posed by the supplier basis of the sophisticated user defense.gray,at slate bethlehem steel,citing comment k in support of the closely related open and obvious defense maldonado thomson nat.press,same.
the sophisticated user defense has been developed in different ways by different jurisdictions.some jurisdictions have indeed incorporated a reasonable reliance analysis into the sophisticated user defense.however,under massachusetts law,the sophisticated user defense does not incorporate a reasonable reliance determination,even in cases where an intermediate party exists between the supplier and the plaintiff.instead,the existence of the defense turns on whether the end user either the intermediate party,such as an employer,or the plaintiff knows,or reasonably should know,of the particular danger to be guarded against in using the supplier product.see carrel,at kenneth willner,failures to warn and the sophisticated user defense,concluding that the duty approach to the sophisticated user defense focuses,in a case,on the intermediary knowledge to the exclusion of any consideration of the reasonableness of defendants conduct.
application to this case 
a.the district court reasonable reliance finding 
appellants principal argument on appeal is that a reasonable jury could conclude that appellees dow,goodrich,and union carbide did not reasonably rely on monsanto to provide taylor with adequate warnings about the dangers of vc.they suggest that appellees participation in secrecy agreements to obtain preliminary results from european cancer studies shows that they knew monsanto was not providing accurate safety information to its employees.appellants also point to record evidence that shows that indian orchard employees did not know that vc could cause cancer in humans until early,and that controls at indian orchard were not designed to protect against the dangers of liver injury or cancer.
as we have explained,reasonable reliance is not an element of the sophisticated user defense as it exists in massachusetts.the district court therefore erred when it stated given that monsanto was the end user for purposes of the sophisticated user defense,the next question is whether the supplier defendants were reasonable in relying on monsanto to provide adequate warnings to claude taylor.even if the appellees did not reasonably rely on monsanto to provide warnings to taylor,they are not liable for failure to warn if monsanto was a sophisticated user of vc.therefore,appellees were still entitled to summary judgment on the appellants failure to warn claim if a reasonable jury could only conclude that monsanto knew,or reasonably should have known,of the dangers posed by appellees product,vc.see carrel,at supporting this formulation.we now examine that question in doing so,we cite much of the same evidence cited by the district court in establishing that appellees reasonably relied on monsanto to provide taylor with warnings.that evidence is also relevant to monsanto knowledge of the dangers posed by vc.
end user knowledge of the danger 
the sophisticated user defense applies where the end user knows or reasonably should know of the particular danger to be guarded against.see id.at see also koken black veatch constr,cir gillespie sears,roebuck,cir.here,appellants focus on two particular dangers the danger that chronic exposure to vc at levels of ppm may cause liver injury,and the danger that exposure to vc may cause cancer.these dangers are distinct.as we will see,the discovery that exposure to vc can cause injury to the liver occurred earlier than the discovery that vc can cause cancer,including liver cancer.
liver injury from vc exposure at ppm 
appellee dow first learned of the danger of liver injury sometime in,during a study conducted by its scientists ted torkelson,oyen,and rowe.the torkelson study exposed rats and rabbits to vc at concentrations of ppm and lower,up to seven hours a day for a period of several months.in may,rowe wrote mccormick of goodrich about the study,which was still ongoing,and suggested that ppm is going to produce a rather appreciable injury when inhaled hours a day,five days a week for an extended period.the torkelson study was published in october,in the journal of the american industrial hygiene association aiha.appellants expert,james jones,formerly an industrial hygienist at the national institute of occupational safety and health niosh,described the publication of the torkelson study as a seminal event,and stated that all pvc manufacturers would have been aware of it certainly.jones explained that monsanto probably knew of the torkelson study,even before it was published,because i think the information was actually shared with the industry a year or two before it was able to be published in print.indeed,monsanto had personal contacts with torkelson.maurice johnson,then a monsanto physician,testified that torkelson personally informed him in of updated information regarding the hepatic toxicity of vinyl chloride 
as the district court noted,monsanto possessed a considerable amount of medical expertise during this period.it maintained an occupational medicine department,whose staff included toxicologists,physicians,and industrial hygienists.the department conducted medical exams and epidemiological studies of the health of monsanto employees,and cooperated with outside medical researchers from universities and government agencies who were investigating vc toxicity.several of the individuals who worked in the department held leadership positions in professional associations for example,elmer wheeler,monsanto assistant director for industrial hygiene and toxicology,served as president of the aiha from,the period the torkelson study was being conducted and possibly disseminated to members of the pvc industry.emmet kelly,director of the occupational medicine department,served as chairman of acc medical advisory committee from to,the year the torkelson study was published.members of the department had access to,in the district court words,monsanto own library of materials on the potential health effects of vc,which it had maintained since the.bruce eley,an industrial hygienist who worked at monsanto,testified that the library contained a wide variety of medical and scientific journals,including publications that addressed the health hazards,toxicology,and safe handling practices of a wide array of compounds,including vinyl chloride.
in light of monsanto leading position in the pvc industry,the early communication between industry members about torkelson results,the prompt publication of torkelson results in a major journal,the personal contacts between monsanto and torkelson,monsanto maintenance of a library of medical literature on vinyl chloride,and its staff of industrial hygienists,physicians,and toxicologists,a reasonable jury could only conclude that monsanto either did perceive or reasonably should have perceived the danger that vc was toxic to the liver.there is no basis in the record from which a reasonable jury could conclude that a warning from dow,union carbide,or goodrich would have enabled monsanto to better perceive the danger,see knowlton,at,or that such a warning would have further deterred monsanto,and caused it to establish a lower vc exposure limit at indian orchard,see hoffman,at the sophisticated user doctrine applies where a warning will have little deterrent effect.
ii.cancer from vc exposure 
the understanding that vc was carcinogenic first began to emerge among members of the pvc industry roughly a decade after the discovery of vc toxicity to the liver.sometime in late or early,viola discovered that rats exposed to high levels of vc over a period developed cancers of the skin,lungs,and bones.viola first presented his findings in may,at the tenth international cancer congress in houston,texas.the results were subsequently published in cancer research in may.
members of the pvc industry took immediate notice of viola work.viola was invited to meet with acc occupational health committee in washington on may,so members of the committee could gather more information on his studies.monsanto representative on the committee,johnson,was absent,but the record establishes that monsanto would have received the minutes from the meeting because it was a committee member.those minutes describe viola methods,the results of his research,and his ongoing studies.the minutes also detail industry research proposals,including both an animal cancer study and an epidemiological study of workers in the pvc industry.on november,viola work and industry research proposals were again discussed by the acc,at the vinyl chloride industry conference.this time,monsanto johnson was present.acc also formed special committees to address different aspects of the cancer issue.johnson became a member of the ad hoc planning group for vinyl chloride research,and monsanto elmer wheeler became a member of the technical task group on toxicology of vinyl chloride monomer carcinogenicity,as well as other groups 
as the understanding of the cancer risk grew in the early,acc played a central role in communicating current research results and in coordinating industry response efforts.for example,in late,acc became aware that additional animal studies at lower exposure levels were being conducted in europe by professor cesare maltoni of the university of bologna.in his affidavit,bruce eley stated that monsanto and the other members of the acc desire d to learn the results and the study designs of the european animal studies.members of the acc were able to secure release of the maltoni study data by signing a secrecy agreement,which companies executed individually.monsanto signed such an agreement on december,promising not to disclose study results outside the company.subsequently,monsanto received minutes from a january,meeting between maltoni and acc representatives,as well as minutes from a january,acc meeting of the vinyl chloride research coordinators regarding the maltoni cancer research.on january,monsanto learned that maltoni team had discovered tumors in rats exposed to vc concentrations as low as ppm,and that johnson,now employed by goodrich,had discovered liver cancer in two pvc workers.
read in the light most favorable to the appellants,the record shows that monsanto became aware,at roughly the same time as appellees dow,goodrich and union carbide,of the carcinogenicity of vc.principally,monsanto representation on the acc committees that responded to the research of viola and professor maltoni ensured that it received current information,sometimes before that information became public.monsanto occupational medicine department was fully equipped to understand and to act on that information.in the words of the district court,monsanto was fully as knowledgeable as any of its subsidiary suppliers,of the risks of vc.therefore,on this record,a reasonable jury could only conclude that monsanto knew,or reasonably should have known,of the risk of cancer posed by exposure to vc.see carrel,at.for dow,goodrich,and union carbide to have provided monsanto with all four companies were discovering these risks have been plainly superfluous.see id.at.nor could it be reasonably concluded that such a warning would have reduced the likelihood of injury to taylor,since monsanto also knew that exposure to vc could cause cancer.see bavuso,at appellees dow,goodrich and union carbide are therefore entitled to summary judgment on counts and count x of the complaint 
to establish a claim for fraud under massachusetts law,a plaintiff must prove that the defendant made a false representation of material fact with knowledge of its falsity for the purpose of inducing the plaintiff to act thereon,and that the plaintiff reasonably relied upon the representation as true and acted upon it to his damage.russell cooley dickinson,quoting danca taunton sav.bank,restatement second of torts.
in contrast to misrepresentation,nondisclosure generally does not give rise to liability in tort.wolf securities,nondisclosure does not amount to fraud and is not a conventional tort of any kind.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.liability for nondisclosure exists under massachusetts law only where there is a duty to disclose.knapp neptune towers,see in re neurontin,sales practices and prods,d.restatement second of torts.such a duty exists where i there is a fiduciary or other similar relation of trust and confidence,ii there are matters known to the speaker that he knows to be necessary to prevent his partial or ambiguous statement of the facts from being misleading,or iii the nondisclosed fact is basic to,or goes to the essence of,the transaction.knapp,at quoting stolzoff waste.int l,see also restatement second of torts listing five sources of a duty to disclose.where nondisclosure constitutes a tort,it is also sometimes called fraudulent concealment,and,following the district court,we will use this terminology here 
here,appellants have advanced claims of both fraud and fraudulent concealment.after significant discovery and development of the parties claims,the district court characterized the fraud count as i n essence alleging that the defendants were responsible for the misleading contents of the mca chemical safety data sheet,which understated the risks of vc.appellants do not challenge this characterization,but argue that the court was mistaken in its analysis of whether could support a claim for fraud or fraudulent concealment.we therefore confine our attention to.see united states politano,cir noting that arguments not made on appeal are waived notably,we do not reach the question of whether the representations in are false or misleading,as appellants allege.
the district court dismissed the fraud count based on because the record contained no evidence that any of the defendants were responsible for the allegedly misleading contents of,and the record contained no evidence that taylor ever saw,heard,or read that document,and thus,no evidence that he relied on it.appellants argue that the district court erred on both accounts.they observe that was drafted and approved by acc subcommittees on which dow,goodrich,and union carbide were members,and point out that a ppellee acc published both the and versions of.appellants also argue that the record contains evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that taylor relied on,since the document was transcribed into the indian orchard vinyl chloride polymerization standard procedure manual,which was used to train taylor.appellees counter that the district court was correct to conclude that taylor did not rely on.even if he did rely,appellees say,his reliance on did not proximately cause his injuries.
we agree with the district court that the record contains no evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that appellees were responsible for the allegedly false or misleading representations in.in massachusetts,a person is generally liable in fraud only for fraudulent representations for which he himself is responsible.see,metro.life ins.ditmore,cir defendant filled out insurance claim form.laborers health welfare fund philip morris,d,defendants issued statements in mass media sebago,d at,defendant published brochure and mailed it to plaintiffs kozdras,defendant submitted petition for confirmation and registration of title reisman kpmg peat marwick llp,defendant prepared audit opinion evans lorillard tobacco,wl,at,defendants published advertisements.a few exceptions do exist a person may also be liable for fraud if his agent makes a fraudulent misrepresentation,or if he is part of a partnership that jointly defrauds someone.madigan mccann,partnership reisman,at agent neither exception has been raised here 
the record shows that both the and versions of were published and copyrighted by acc,not by dow,goodrich,or union carbide.however,appellants did not name acc as a defendant in the fraud count of the complaint.thus,the question is whether a reasonable jury could conclude that dow,goodrich,or union were named in the also responsible for the safety representations contained in.as we explain below,we see no basis in the record from which a reasonable jury could come to this conclusion.
turning first to the,evidence in the record shows that it was drafted by one or more members of acc general safety committee.an october,memorandum written by wuertz,secretary of the general safety committee,suggests that members of the committee,along with dow,firestone,goodrich,and goodyear tire rubber company,were able to suggest revisions to a preliminary draft of,and that at least some of these suggested revisions were incorporated.an october,memorandum written by cranch suggests that union carbide was also provided an opportunity to comment on a draft.
the record contains similar evidence regarding the authorship of the version of.minutes from september and december,meetings of the acc safety and fire protection committee indicate that a draft of the updated was then being circulated for review.representatives from dow,goodrich,and union carbide attended the meetings.at the september meeting,the committee discussed problems in finalizing the medical management sections of since additional research is to be carried out on the chronic effects of the material,but resolved to proceed with publication and to include only that medical information which is currently available.the final version,which was printed in march,states that it was p ublished as an activity of the acc safety and fire protection committee,and lists several other acc committees which have cooperated in its preparation.
a reasonable jury could conclude on the basis of this evidence that dow,goodrich,and union carbide suggested revisions to a draft version of the,and that dow,goodrich,and union carbide were members of the committee that drafted the.however,it would be speculative to conclude that these appellees were responsible for the allegedly false or misleading statements in.for example,the record does not reveal who is responsible for the statements t h e ppm level provides a considerable margin of safety for industrial exposures in the,and aside from the risk of fire or explosion,vinyl chloride presents no other very serious problem in general handling in the.as the district court explained the problem,t he individual contributions the appellees made in collecting,organizing,and compiling the contents of remain unknown.appellants have cited no massachusetts authority,and we know of none,which supports extending fraud liability to defendants whose contribution to allegedly false or misleading statements is essentially unknown.
we recognize,of course,that the acc committees that wrote included representatives from dow,goodrich,and union carbide,and that it is possible that someone from one or more of these companies authored portions of.however,to hold a specific supplier liable,as opposed to acc itself under whose auspices was written and published,the record must contain some evidence that connects that supplier to the allegedly fraudulent statements in,which is a sizable document,containing many representations about vc,its proper handling,and the health hazards it poses.without such evidence,appellees dow,goodrich,and union carbide are entitled to summary judgment on count 
civil conspiracy 
massachusetts recognizes two types of civil conspiracy,true conspiracy and conspiracy based on section of the restatement second of torts.kurker hill,see also grant john hancock mut.life ins,d.the second type of conspiracy,based on section of the restatement,is a form of vicarious liability for the tortious conduct of others see.laborers,d at restatement second of torts.because it is vicarious liability,this type of civil conspiracy requires an underlying tort.laborers,d at.the conspiracy consists in agreeing to,or assisting in,this underlying tort.massachusetts courts have recognized two theories of liability under section concert of action,and substantial assistance or aiding and abetting.see maruho,miles,cir payton abbott labs.
here,appellants advance a substantial assistance theory.under the substantial assistance theory,a defendant is liable for the conduct of another if he knows that the other conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the other so to conduct himself.restatement second of torts b,quoted in kurker,at.to recover under this theory,the plaintiff must establish two elements.first,the defendant must give substantial assistance or encouragement to a party engaging in tortious conduct.payton.at haemonetics dupre.only assistance or encouragement that is a substantial factor in causing the resulting tort exposes the actor to liability.restatement second of torts cmt.d see also wilson dicaprio.to determine whether this threshold is met,courts should consider the nature of the act encouraged,the amount of assistance given by the defendant,his presence or absence at the time of the tort,his relation to the other and his state of mind.restatement second of torts cmt.d,quoted in payton.at.second,the defendant must possess an unlawful intent.payton.at.unlawful intent comprises two distinct mental states knowledge that the other conduct is tortious,and an intent to substantially assist or encourage that conduct lucas allen,wl.div,smith egan,wl,at.lexis,at.may,see kyte,at citing halberstam welch,kurker,at.unlawful intent does not require an agreement between the defendant and the tortfeasor.payton.at citing brown,wl,allen at.
the underlying tort on which appellants base their substantial assistance claim is fraud by monsanto.appellants argue that monsanto defrauded taylor by providing him with the allegedly fraudulent safety information in.they allege that the conspiring defendants substantially assisted monsanto in committing this fraud,by,for example,entering into secrecy agreements not to divulge the results of the maltoni cancer study.see supra discussion in section iii b b ii.the district court rejected this argument because it concluded,among other things,that there was no evidence that the conspiring defendants knew what information monsanto disseminated to its employees.appellants argue that the district court erred,and that the record establishes that the conspiring defendants knew that monsanto provided its employees with the safety information in.appellees disagree.
we agree with the district court that,on this record,a reasonable jury could not conclude that the conspiring defendants substantially assisted monsanto in defrauding taylor.while the record contains evidence that the conspiring defendants actions did in fact assist monsanto it contains no evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the appellees had the unlawful intent necessary for substantial assistance liability.an actor has unlawful intent when he knows that another conduct is tortious and intends to substantially assist or encourage that conduct.payton.at.while it is clear from the record that was widely used in the pvc industry,there is no support for the conclusion that appellees knew monsanto was incorporating represent
