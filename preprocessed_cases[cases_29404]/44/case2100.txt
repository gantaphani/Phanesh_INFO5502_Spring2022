in this simple negligence case,stores,appeals the district court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law following a jury verdict in favor of billie dixon.she had brought suit against after she tripped on a strip of plastic that was lying on the floor near a register at a store in texas.concluding that dixon has not established a sufficient evidentiary basis on which a reasonable jury could find in her favor,we reverse the district court order and remand for entry of judgment as a matter of law in favor of.
facts and proceedings 
in july,dixon tripped and fell at approximately on a sunday while leaving a store in longview,texas.after checking out at one of the registers,she fell when her feet becoming entangled in a piece of plastic similar to the plastic strips that are typically used to bind newspapers or magazines into stacks.the injuries resulting from her fall were relatively severe,requiring dixon to obtain immediate medical treatment at a nearby hospital.thereafter,she continued to receive regular medical treatment for maladies related to this incident.
in july,dixon filed suit against in texas state court,alleging injuries resulting from negligence in failing to maintain reasonably safe premises at its longview store.removed the case to federal court under our diversity jurisdiction.at a trial in october,dixon claimed that failed to remove an unreasonable risk of harm to its customers at its longview store,the plastic binder on the floor near the registers.she did not claim actual knowledge by,instead proffering two evidentiary bases for constructive knowledge of this unreasonable risk of harm the close physical proximity of the plastic binder to employees,the location of the plastic binder only several feet away from the employees staffing the registers,and the sufficiently long time that the plastic binder had remained on the floor,the implication that the plastic binder had been dropped at the location of her fall by the magazine and newspaper suppliers who restocked the store between and that day,more than eight hours prior to her accident.countered with uncontroverted testimony that all employees are trained to pick up any debris or trash in the store,managers and employees frequently perform safety inspections of the store,and the particular area in which dixon fell had been inspected most recently approximately five minutes before her accident.the jury returned a verdict for dixon,but also found her at fault for the accident.thus,the jury awarded dixon of the total damages of.
pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,moved for judgment as a matter of law both at the close of dixon and prior to submission of the case to the jury.the district court denied both of these motions.following the return of the jury verdict,renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law,which was again denied.timely filed a notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
standard of review.
we review de novo rulings on motions for judgment as a matter of law,applying the same standards as the district court under rule,judgment as a matter of law should be granted if a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonably jury to find for that party on that issue.accordingly,rule mandates that we adopt a sufficiency of the evidence standard in our de novo review 
this standard requires that we consider all evidence in the light most favorable to the opposing party and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the opposing party we may not make credibility determinations or weigh any evidence,which are judgments to be made by the jury,not by the court nonetheless,i f the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelmingly in favor of the moving party that the reviewing court believes that reasonable jurors could not have arrived at a contrary verdict,then we will conclude that the motion should have been granted.
sufficiency of the evidence of negligence.
texas law on liability.
as this case was removed to federal court under our diversity jurisdiction,we look to texas law for the substantive standards defining duty of care to its customers.in texas,a customer,such as dixon,is an invitee.as such,business owners like owe a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect her from dangerous conditions in the store known or discoverable to it.notably,this is a duty requiring only reasonable care by the business owner texas courts have repeatedly stated that businesses are not insurers of an invitee safety therefore,to prove premises liability on the part of a business owner,a plaintiff must show 
actual or constructive knowledge of some condition on the premises by the 
the condition posed an unreasonable risk of harm 
the did not exercise reasonable care to reduce or eliminate the risk and 
the failure to use such care proximately caused the plaintiff injuries 
in this case,did not contest that the plastic binder on the floor constituted an unreasonable risk of harm or that dixon was in fact injured in a trip and fall caused by this binder.disputes only dixon allegation that it had constructive knowledge of the presence of the plastic binder on the floor.therefore,the sole issue on appeal is whether dixon established a sufficient evidentiary basis on which a reasonable jury could find that had constructive knowledge of the plastic binder presence on the floor.
constructive knowledge.
on appeal,dixon reiterates her trial contention that had constructive knowledge of the plastic binder presence,given its proximity to employees and the length of least eight inferentially it had been at that spot on the floor.she maintains that either of these propositions establishes a sufficient evidentiary basis for presenting this issue to a jury.we shall deal with each of these claims in order.
evidence of proximity of object to employees.
the argument that constructive knowledge can be inferred from the close physical proximity of an unreasonable risk to the employees of a premises owner was recently rejected by the texas supreme court in stores,reece in that case,a employee walked directly past a puddle of liquid on the floor,but did not notice the liquid until after the plaintiff had slipped on it and fallen.the plaintiff maintained that had constructive knowledge by virtue of the employee propinquity to the puddle,despite the employee undisputed lack of actual knowledge of the liquid presence.argued that,as none of its employees knew of the spill,the plaintiff failed to bear her burden of proving knowledge,constructive or actual,on the part of a premises owner.the plaintiff in reece did not adduce any evidence of what caused the spill long prior to her slip and fall the spill had occurred.the jury found in the plaintiff favor,and the texas appellate court affirmed the verdict based solely on the proposition that the employee proximity to the puddle satisfied the element of constructive knowledge of the puddle existence.
in the texas supreme court,insisted that alone an employee proximity to a hazard can not establish constructive knowledge.argued that such a rule would require omniscience of a premises owner,not a provide premises owner with a fair opportunity to inspect,correct,or warn invitees of the risk,and impose constructive knowledge instantly,at the moment a hazard is created,and thus make a premises owner a de facto insurer of invitees safety the texas supreme court agreed with all of arguments,reversed the trial court and the intermediate appellate court,and rendered a judgment against the plaintiff in so doing,the reece court announced the rule that proximity evidence alone is insufficient to establish constructive notice absent some indication that the hazard existed long enough to give the premises owner a reasonable opportunity to discover it.
reece further establishes that physical proximity evidence is relevant only in determinations of constructive knowledge based on the length of time that the risk has been present.a plaintiff might be able to show,for instance,that a shorter presence is required to establish constructive knowledge for a conspicuous hazard that is near a premises owner employees than for an inconspicuous hazard that is remote from such employees still,the rule in texas is that temporal evidence,not proximity evidence,is the sine qua non of a premises owner constructive knowledge 
dixon argued before the district court that motion for judgment as a matter of law should be rejected because the accident happened two feet from a cashier.she did not argue that this is only an additional factor for determining the reasonableness of constructive knowledge based on her temporal evidence.neither did she adduce any evidence at trial of the conspicuousness of the plastic binder on the floor.she argued only that the plastic binder proximity to employees serves as an independent basis for finding that had constructive knowledge of the plastic binder presence on the floor.yet,reece mandates the conclusion that the accident occurrence just two feet from a cashier is,by itself,nondeterminative of constructive knowledge.thus,dixon proximity argument and her reliance on proximity evidence fails the legal standard under texas law for determining a premises owner constructive knowledge.
temporal evidence of the plastic binder presence.
dixon asked the jury to infer that the plastic binder was on the floor constantly for more than eight hours until her late afternoon accident,presumably having been dropped there in the early morning by the magazine or newspaper suppliers.this is simply unreasonable,given the totality of the evidence proffered at trial.our standard of review mandates that we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of dixon,and the applicable substantive law in this case requires a premises owner to exercise reasonable care an invitee under texas law,a premises owner constructive knowledge is predicated on temporal evidence because a premises owner is not an insurer of an invitee safety,and therefore a premises owner must have the exercise reasonable care to reduce or eliminate the risk.
most often,the reasonableness of constructive knowledge of a premises owner is defined in terms of the minimum time required for a risk to exist before it can constitute constructive knowledge to establish a premises owner constructive knowledge of the presence of an unreasonable risk of harm,a plaintiff generally must prove that the risk existed for a time sufficiently long to permit the premises owner or his employees to discover it and correct it.for this reason,defendant premises owners often respond,as did in the instant case,that the risk existed for such a brief period of time that,as premises owner,it had insufficient time for the peril to be recognized and corrected fealty to her pleading burden and to the only evidence she was able to adduce motivated dixon to imply at trial that the source of the plastic binder was the magazine and newspaper suppliers who visited the store more than eight hours prior to her accident,and the plastic binder lay there the entire eight hours,just steps from the cash register,without being seen.
for the jury to make this inference,however,was logically unreasonable,particularly in light of the evidence submitted by,which was undisputed by dixon.manager,jean chatham,testified that it is part of our job constantly to survey the area in which dixon fell and to pick up any trash.chatham job description required her to patrol this particular area approximately once every five minutes,specifically looking for any trash,debris,puddles,or merchandise that should be removed from the area.she further testified that the cashiers go through the same training regimen as do the managers,and that every employee is responsible for making sure that foreign objects are picked up and that any potential risk is promptly eliminated.this testimony was confirmed by the assistant store manager,luther fairley,who noted that picking stuff up off the floor is just one person responsibility but belongs to all the employees at.
in addition,the store director,greg smith,explained that all employees are trained according to company policy t o be on the at all times for merchandise on the floor,including such items as a plastic binder and other type trash.he confirmed chatham testimony that the managers are responsible for patrolling the area around the registers,making rounds approximately every five minutes or so.t hey do make the rounds,he said,just like myself even,my assistant managers,all of us make the rounds.we obviously try to keep everything as much as possible a hundred percent free of trash,debris and any type of safety hazard.
smith noted further that,in addition to giving responsibility for cleaning activities to cashiers,managers,assistant managers and himself,employs a safety team,which patrols the entire store and constantly trains the employees.smith explained 
what they look for is specific hazards and basically what their job duty cover it every day.it constant training.we have morning and evening meetings with our associates and the safety team does demonstrations.we do spill demonstrations.we do demonstrations on picking up trash,and we have a specific safety team,but it everybody duty to maintain the sales floor,including myself i t just part of my job and my duties to keep the floor clean.
also,a maintenance crew,comprising a minimum of two employees,is on duty during the busy times of the day,between say in the morning and eight at night.their singular job function is to walk around with a broom,dust pan and a mop and clean the floors.
the result of policies,its training programs,and the cleaning responsibilities of all employees is palpable.smith testified that approximately five million customers use the longview store each year,averaging about customers each day,but that only some accidents occur per year.none of this of the testimony of chatham,fairley or challenged or contradicted by dixon.
given this extensive evidence of constant searches for hazards by myriad employees,and the dearth of temporal evidence by dixon of the presence of the hazard any closer to her fall in time than eight hours,the conclusion is inescapable that any plastic binder dropped by the vendors that morning could not possibly have remained at the location of her fall for those many hours without being discovered.and,absent evidence of some other,believable period of the plastic binder presence prior to the fall,no reasonable jury could find negligence by based on constructive knowledge of the risk.when the sole source of the hazard advanced by dixon is eliminated as being a virtual impossibility,her burden of proof of constructive knowledge fails.
during argument before the district court on renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,dixon attorney explained that must have had constructive knowledge of the presence of the plastic binder because 
it might be something from the magazines.they stock the magazines at eight.if it was left from eight that morning to five that afternoon,that certainly not prudent emphasis added 
it strains credulity,let alone the bounds of logic and reason,that a plastic binder large enough to entangle dixon feet and cause her to fall could have lain on the floor in such a area of the store for at least eight hours.this area was traversed by thousands of customers that day,and was under the constant surveillance of numerous employees as well.yet,dixon would have the believe that the plastic binder lay there for more than eight hours without a single person noticing it,let alone picking it up and removing it.she adduced no evidence that a customer nor an the plastic binder lying on the floor for over eight hours during the busiest portion of the business day in one of the most heavily trafficked areas of the store.
that is simply not credible.when the only source of the binder on which dixon presented evidence is eliminated as constituting an impossibility,she is left without proof of a source,and thus without proof that the binder had been in place long enough for knowledge of its presence to be imputed to,but not so long as to defy reason.
in fact,dixon proximity argument works in favor of on this point,not against it.we have shown that it is a logical impossibility that this plastic binder remained on the floor for at least eight hours when it was only feet away from the cashiers,other employees,and a legion of customers.had the binder been dropped no later than,then in light of the evidence submitted by,the plastic binder simply could not have lain there all that time without having been seen and removed.the obvious flaw in dixon theory is the premise that the only way the binder could have gotten to the place of the accident was to have been dropped there that morning by a vendor.yet dixon offered no evidence of any other source or of any time closer to the accident to place the plastic binder on the floor at the site of her trip and fall.the result is that dixon has not met her burden to plead and prove credible facts to support even an inference of constructive knowledge of this risk on the part of.
in a similar case,stores gonzalez,the texas supreme court rejected a plaintiff logic that the presence of dirt on spilled macaroni salad justified the inference that the macaroni had been on the floor long enough to impute constructive knowledge to of this risk to its customers.the court explained that 
d irt in macaroni salad lying on a aisle is no evidence of the length of time the macaroni had been on the floor.that evidence can no more support the inference that it accumulated dirt over a long period than it can support the opposite inference that the macaroni had just been dropped on the floor and was quickly contaminated by customers and carts traversing the aisle 
the result of the gonzalez court rejection of this evidentiary basis for the plaintiff implying that the risk existed for a long time was that there was no evidence that the macaroni had been on the floor long enough to charge with constructive notice of this condition.concluding that the plaintiff thus failed to meet her evidentiary burden in pleading notice,the supreme court reversed the trial verdict in her favor 
the instant case presents the logical converse of gonzalez.simply because most cases focus on the minimum time requirement for constructive knowledge does not mean that there is not a maximum temporal proximity as well.put another way,a plaintiff asserting liability is not free to assert that a risk continued to exist unabated for some illogically long period,regardless of the factual context.if it were otherwise,plaintiffs could assert constructive knowledge of risks that were proved to have existed days or even weeks earlier.without any reasonable limit on such temporal arguments,premises owners would indeed become de facto insurers of invitees safety 
in this case,dixon would infer constructive knowledge from evidence of a span of time that is simply too long to be credible.moreover,her inference is not supported by the totality of the evidence presented at trial on the contrary,the inference that she was able to sell to the jury is totally refuted by that very evidence.she simply asks too much of a jury to believe that the only source of the plastic binder on which dixon magazine last present more than eight hours before her fall,and that the plastic binder lay there undetected all that time.dixon inability to show a credible source of the hazard within a reasonable time between the instant before her fall and an hour so remote from her fall that the plastic binder could not help but have been her case.once the early morning vendors are eliminated as even a remotely possible source,dixon can point to no believable proximate explanation for the plastic binder having come to rest at the point of the accident.we are thus left with a plaintiff who has failed to meet her burden of establishing constructive knowledge on the basis of plausible temporal evidence.
iii.conclusion 
the basic standard of tort liability is reasonableness,determined in the discrete factual context of each case.accordingly,a plaintiff is not free to make just any temporal argument in attempt to meet her burden of demonstrating constructive knowledge.there has to be a reasonable minimum time limit for constructive knowledge to be implied,but,conversely,there has to be a reasonable maximum time limit as outside time beyond which there can be no nexus.as with virtually every aspect of tort law,there is no absolute,rule that establishes these temporal boundaries unique facts and circumstances control in each case.just as proximity evidence serves as a plus factor for temporal arguments,the minimum and maximum limits on the spectrum of the reasonable time within which constructive knowledge can be imputed is determined by the particular facts of each case.
although all cases to date have turned on the minimum time required to establish a premises owner constructive knowledge,this case presents the novel question of the reasonable maximum time limit,given the totality of evidence presented at trial it defies common sense,and is against all logic,to infer that the plastic binder on which dixon tripped could possibly have lain on the floor,just two feet away from the registers,for over eight hours,without being noticed by at least one of the thousands of individuals traversing that spot,including the many employees who were actively patrolling and surveying it for the very purpose of detecting and eliminating any risk to customer safety.the conclusion is inescapable the source of the plastic binder could not have been the magazine or newspaper vendors who last visited the store early on the morning of dixon afternoon accident and dixon has proffered no other,believable source.whatever or whoever the true source might have been,dixon failed to adduce any evidence of how the plastic binder could have come to rest in that area,much less when.it follows inescapably that she has not established a sufficient evidentiary basis for proving constructive knowledge of the presence of an unreasonable risk of harm to its invitees.accordingly,the district court denial of motion for judgment as a matter of law is reversed,and the case is remanded to that court for entry of a judgment against dixon and in favor of.
reversed and remanded with instructions.

the facts in this slip and fall diversity tort suit are straightforward.on sunday,july,at about,billie jo dixon,a homemaker,tripped and fell while shopping at a store in longview,texas.the accident occurred when dixon,after paying for pizza and milk at one of the checkout stands,walked away from the cash register and turned left,intending to exit the store.approximately two feet from the register,dixon feet became entangled in a piece of plastic lying loose on the floor.as a result of the entanglement,dixon fell face forward to the floor.the fall rendered her unconscious and caused bleeding from her left eye and knee.paramedics took dixon to a local hospital emergency room where she received treatment.after the fall dixon remained dazed,and continued to experience dizzy spells,weakness,and tingling in her right arm and hand.the piece of plastic that caused dixon fall appeared to be a plastic binder commonly used to hold together stacks of magazines or newspapers,or merchandise.
dixon filed suit against in texas state court seeking recovery for damages she suffered because of the accident.removed the case to federal court under our diversity jurisdiction.a full jury trial followed,with the jury finding dixon and each responsible for the accident.finding total damages of,the jury awarded dixon.the district judge denied federal rule of civil procedure motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol,and appealed.
