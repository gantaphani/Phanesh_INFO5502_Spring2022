plaintiff misty simms brought this wrongful birth action against the united states under the federal tort claims act ftca after her prenatal care provider a health center failed to timely inform her that her child would be born with severe congenital abnormalities.following a bench trial,the district court found in favor of simms and awarded her over million in economic and noneconomic damages.
the government appeals the award of damages for past and future medical expenses and the district court decision not to order the creation of a reversionary trust for future medical expenses.after careful review,we conclude that the district court properly awarded simms damages attributable to her child past medical expenses.we further conclude that the district court correctly measured simms damages using the amount medical providers billed for her child care,rather than the amount the west virginia medicaid program paid those providers.but the district court erred in failing to hold a,prejudgment collateral source hearing.accordingly,we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
simms received prenatal care at valley health systems,valley health,a health care center located in west virginia.on february,when simms was eighteen weeks pregnant,her valley health physician detected potential fetal abnormalities during a routine ultrasound.but due to errors on its part,valley health did not inform simms of the abnormalities until may,three months later.in a series of appointments,simms learned that the fetus brain was extremely underdeveloped,and,if not stillborn,her child would never walk or talk and would be severely mentally disabled.because at that point simms was well into her third trimester,the laws of west virginia and nearby states barred simms from terminating her pregnancy.
on june,simms gave birth to her son,survived birth but,as expected,suffered severe brain malformation and multiple other related developmental and muscular conditions.as a result,lives in what his physicians refer to as a vegetative state.and although is able to live at home with simms,he requires care and monitoring.to date,the extraordinary medical bills resulting from the requisite care provided for have been paid by west virginia medicaid and medicaid waiver programs 
on november,simms filed this wrongful birth action individually,and on behalf of her son,in the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia.because valley health is a health center,simms sought relief under the ftca.see g.
because this case arises under the ftca,the law of west virginia the state where valley health negligent act took place governs.see b starns united states,cir.see also providing that t he united states shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.we therefore apply the law of west virginia in evaluating the government claims.see myrick united states,cir.to the extent we are faced with an unsettled issue of west virginia law,our task is to predict how the state highest court would rule if presented with the issue.ellis,cir.internal quotation omitted see midwest knitting mills,united states,cir.
in west virginia,t he failure of a healthcare provider to discover a birth defect and to advise the parents of its consequences will give rise to a cause of action for wrongful birth.james caserta.the theory underlying a wrongful birth action is that the provider failure to advise of the birth defect caused the parents to lose the opportunity make an informed decision as to whether to terminate the pregnancy.id.at.
after a bench trial,the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order finding the government liable.simms united states,supp.the court held that valley health failure to provide care after the february,ultrasound proximately caused simms to be deprived of essential information regarding the fetus condition and thereby prevent ed simms from exercising her right to terminate the pregnancy.id.at.the court entered judgment in favor of simms individually and dismissed the claim brought by simms on behalf,holding that did not have a cause of action for wrongful birth under west virginia law.id.at.
the district court awarded simms a total of in damages,distributed as follows for past billed medical expenses,for future medical expenses the present value of the projected future medical costs for care over a life expectancy,for lost income,and in noneconomic damages the government timely appealed.
on appeal to this court,the government does not challenge the district court liability determination.rather,the government disputes the district court award of damages attributable to past and future medical expenses 
we review the district court conclusions of law,including those regarding the availability and calculation of damages,de novo.see rice cmty.health ass n,cir.we review factual findings relating to the calculation of damages for clear error.united states ex rel.maddux supply paul fire marine ins,cir.per curiam.
in its appeal,the government challenges the district court award of damages for past and future medical expenses on a number of grounds,each relating to the west virginia medicaid program payment of medical expenses.the government first contends that simms does not have a right to recover past medical expenses because,in light of medicaid coverage,simms has not,to date,paid for medical care.according to the government,awarding simms damages related to medical care costs she did not incur would contravene the basic tort principle that damages must compensate only for actual loss.we disagree.
under west virginia law,a parent who successfully brings a wrongful birth suit against a healthcare provider is entitled to recover the extraordinary costs for rearing a child with birth defects.caserta,at see id.at t he rule is that the costs of extraordinary child care arising from the defects are recoverable in a wrongful birth action.these damages include the medical or educational costs attributable to the birth defect during the child minority as well as medical and support costs after the child reaches the age of majority if the child is unable to support himself.id.at.the entitlement to such recovery stems from parents legal duty to support their children.see state ex rel.packard perry,p arents ha ve a duty to support their child,and in turn are therefore obligated to pay for their child medical expenses.see also parent and child each parent has a duty to support his or her minor children.
here,the fact that simms has not had to pay for past medical care does not obviate her injury.simms has a legal obligation to support her child and the weight of that obligation increased as a result of valley health negligence.and the fact that medicaid has,to date,paid medical costs does not change this analysis.
west virginia has long recognized the common law collateral source rule,which is an exception to the general rule that in a tort action,the measure of damages is that that will compensate and make the plaintiff whole.damages see kenney liston.the collateral source rule protects payments made to or benefits conferred upon an injured party from sources other than the tortfeasor by denying the tortfeasor any corresponding offset or credit against the injured party damages.kenney,at.the rationale underlying the collateral source rule is that it is better for injured plaintiffs to receive the benefit of collateral sources in addition to actual damages than for defendants to be able to limit their liability for damages merely by the fortuitous presence of these sources.id.at citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted see also ilosky michelin tire,the purpose of the collateral source doctrine is to prevent reduction in the damage liability of defendants simply because the victim had the good fortune to be insured or have other means of compensation.
the collateral source rule protects medicaid payments.kenney,at.accordingly,under the collateral source rule,the government is not entitled to a credit or offset against simms damages based on medica
