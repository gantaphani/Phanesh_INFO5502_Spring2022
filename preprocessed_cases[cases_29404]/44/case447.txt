on august,michael desrosiers,a postal inspector for the united states postal service,learned that the usps had received a complaint concerning vincent santoni,the postmaster of solon,maine.the complaint alleged that santoni had exposed himself to heather,a girl who resided in solon.on august,desrosiers supervisor instructed him to conduct an immediate investigation.
on august,desrosiers interviewed heather,who said that around on july,she was riding her bicycle across a bridge near the post office in solon when she heard someone call her name.she turned around and recognized santoni,whom she knew,standing by the edge of the water with his pants down to his knees and both of his hands holding his exposed penis.heather told desrosiers that for several years santoni had been making inappropriate sexual comments and gestures to her during her visits to the solon post office.heather mother,who attended the interview,said that santoni had also made inappropriate comments to her and to other women.desrosiers prepared a statement based on the interview,which heather reviewed and signed.over the next few weeks,desrosiers interviewed other female customers of the solon post office who reported that santoni had touched them or made inappropriate comments while he was at work at the post office.
on september,desrosiers discussed the results of his investigation with andrew benson,an assistant district attorney ada for somerset county,maine.at benson request,desrosiers arranged for a fellow postal inspector,who was also a polygraph examiner,to administer a polygraph examination of heather.after receiving the results of the test,which heather passed,desrosiers again discussed the case with ada benson.at the conclusion of that discussion,the da office authorized the prosecution of santoni on the criminal charge of indecent conduct,a class e misdemeanor under.ann.
on october,desrosiers appeared before the clerk of the state district court in skowhegan,maine,to present a request for a criminal complaint and a warrant for santoni arrest.he also submitted a supporting affidavit identifying desrosiers as a postal inspector and stating that he had probable cause to believe that santoni had committed the state law offense of indecent conduct,in violation of.ann.the affidavit provided details about desrosiers interview with heather and stated that she had passed a polygraph examination.the court clerk issued a criminal complaint against santoni for violating the indecent conduct statute and a corresponding warrant for his arrest.at desrosiers request,randy wing,a deputy sheriff for somerset county,accompanied desrosiers to santoni home,where santoni was arrested.on april,santoni was tried in the skowhegan district court and was acquitted after the court determined that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction for indecent conduct 
on january,santoni filed an complaint in the united states district court for the district of maine against the usps,desrosiers,wing,and somerset county sheriff barry delong.he sued the usps pursuant to the ftca,et,claiming that it was liable to him for unlawful arrest,abuse of process,malicious prosecution,false imprisonment,intentional negligent infliction of emotional distress,assault,battery,invasion of privacy,and negligent supervision and training.he sued desrosiers in his individual capacity,seeking damages for violations of the first,fourth,and fifth amendments of the united states constitution pursuant to bivens,at.santoni brought analogous fourth amendment claims against wing and delong pursuant to.he further claimed that all four defendants had engaged in a civil conspiracy to violate his federal and state civil rights.
on april,desrosiers and the usps,the federal defendants,moved to dismiss or for summary judgment on all of santoni federal claims.the district court determined that no constitutional rights had been violated and that,in any event,desrosiers was protected from liability on santoni fourth amendment claim by the doctrine of qualified immunity.although it found that santoni ftca claims against the usps did not fall within the ftca discretionary function exception,it held that the claims failed on their merits.therefore,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of desrosiers and the usps and dismissed santoni claims against them.after the district court granted summary judgment for the federal defendants,the lawsuit proceeded against delong and wing.following discovery,the state defendants filed a motion for summary judgment,which was granted.santoni filed this appeal against all of the original defendants but has chosen not to prosecute his claims against the state defendants.
on appeal,santoni challenges the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of desrosiers on santoni bivens claim.he argues that because desrosiers lacked authority under state or federal law to make an arrest for a class e state law crime,the arrest of santoni constituted an unreasonable seizure in violation of the fourth amendment.he further claims that desrosiers is not entitled to qualified immunity.in addition,santoni argues that because the district court improperly determined that the arrest was lawful,it erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the usps on santoni ftca claims.we address each of these arguments in turn.

bivens claim against desrosiers 
santoni arrest 
under bivens,a person may sue a federal official in his or her individual capacity for damages arising out of a constitutional violation committed under color of federal law.see bivens,at.aversa united states,cir.relying on bivens,santoni claims that because desrosiers had no legal authority to make an arrest for a state law misdemeanor,his arrest of santoni constituted an unreasonable seizure in violation of the fourth amendment 
we have not resolved whether an arresting officer lack of authority under state or federal law to conduct an otherwise constitutionally valid arrest constitutes an unreasonable seizure under the fourth amendment.the circuits are divided on this issue.compare malone county of suffolk,cir whether officers have valid authority to arrest pursuant to state law affects constitutionality of the arrest ross neff,cir arrest executed outside of the officer jurisdiction violates the fourth amendment and gives rise to a potential action and united states trigg,cir custodial arrest is constitutional if arresting officer had probable cause and authority under state or municipal law to effect a custodial arrest for the particular offense with united states bell,cir w e do not think fourth amendment analysis requires reference to an arrest legality under state law.fields city of south houston,cir holding that there is no cause of action for false arrest unless the arresting officer lacked probable cause and street surdyka,cir same.we do not reach this constitutional question because we conclude that desrosiers was authorized to swear out the criminal complaint and receive the complaint and warrant for santoni arrest,and that the warrant was executed under the lawful authority of deputy sheriff wing.
under federal law,the united states postal service has authority to investigate postal offenses and civil matters relating to the postal service.a.this authority is primarily exercised through the postal inspection service,which is charged with e nforcing laws related to the postal service,the mails,other postal offenses and other laws of the united states.b.
the federal arrest powers of postal inspectors,however,are limited and specifically defined,including the authority to serve warrants and subpoenas issued under the authority of the united states and to make certain warrantless arrests for offenses against the united states.a see also a.postal inspectors are not authorized under federal law to execute a warrant or make an arrest for a state law offense.see united states unverzagt,cir postal inspectors under are given power to make arrests for postal offenses upon probable cause but are given no power to make arrests for state offenses by either state or federal statute.similarly,while maine law permits some specifically designated federal officers to make arrests to enforce state law in certain situations,postal inspectors are not among these officers.ann.thus,desrosiers did not have authority under state or federal law to make an arrest for a violation of state law.
nonetheless,the district court concluded that although maine law did not confer upon desrosiers authority to arrest santoni,it did authorize him to swear out a warrant for santoni arrest,either in his capacity as a law enforcement official or as a private citizen acting with the approval of the district attorney office.it further held that the execution of the warrant was lawful because desrosiers participated in the arrest as a private citizen and was assisted by deputy sheriff wing,who had an affirmative duty to arrest santoni.santoni challenges both of these determinations.
swearing out the criminal complaint 
in accordance with maine law,a maine district court clerk may,in the absence or unavailability of a justice of the peace or a prosecuting attorney or any of his assistants,prepare and draft a misdemeanor criminal complaint upon the request of any law enforcement officer.ann.while the statute does not define the phrase law enforcement officer,the district court interpreted it to include postal inspectors.we agree.
when interpreting a statute under maine law,words and phrases are to be construed in accordance with the plain meaning of the enactment.ann.applying this rule of statutory construction to.ann,we find that any law enforcement officer includes every kind of law enforcement officer,regardless of whether or not the officer is statutorily authorized to enforce state law.moreover,we have regularly recognized postal inspectors as law enforcement officers.see,united states,cir for sentence enhancement purposes,defendant should have known that postal inspector was a law enforcement officer see also cosme henderson,cir plaintiff applied for a position as a postal inspector,a highly competitive law enforcement position.stout potter,cir the postal inspection service is the law enforcement branch of the united states postal service.
santoni argues that the phrase law enforcement officers as used in.ann.does not include postal inspectors because postal inspectors are not among those federal law enforcement officials vested with the power to enforce state law under.ann.however.ann.does not limit authority to swear out a criminal complaint to state law enforcement officers and federal officers who are specifically empowered to enforce state law.nor does.ann.place any limitations on the kinds of officers who may swear out complaints.therefore,we agree with the district court that the phrase any law enforcement officer does not preclude postal officials from swearing out criminal complaints 
executing the arrest warrant 
santoni also argues,however,that even if desrosiers was authorized to swear out and receive the complaint,he had no authority to carry out the arrest of santoni.once an arrest warrant is issued,only an officer authorized by law may execute that warrant.me.c.as noted,postal inspectors are not among those officers authorized under maine law to execute arrest warrants.ann.santoni argues that desrosiers also had no authority to execute the arrest in his capacity as a private citizen.therefore,he claims that the district court conclusion that desrosiers was authorized as a private person to arrest santoni was clearly erroneous and should be reversed.
santoni is correct that maine law does not authorize private citizens to make an arrest for a class e crime not committed in their presence.see.ann.unverzagt,at postal inspector arrest of individual for carrying a concealed weapon was valid under nebraska law that authorized private citizens to make an arrest for a felony committed in their presence.however,the district court held that santoni arrest was lawful,not because desrosiers had state law authority to execute the warrant,but because deputy sheriff wing participated in the arrest.in light of wing knowing participation in the arrest,the court explained that it would be elevating form over substance to conclude that the validity of the arrest depended on which of the two men uttered the words you are under arrest,or placed the plaintiff in handcuffs.
we agree with the district court conclusion that santoni arrest was lawful because it was carried out under wing lawful authority.under maine law,an arrest warrant shall be executed by any officer authorized by law.me.c.deputy sheriff wing was clearly indeed,law to arrest santoni under.ann,which provides that i t is the responsibility of all police and sheriff departments and their officers to use all reasonable efforts to execute the outstanding arrest warrants of which they are aware.see also kane anderson,me concluding that the execution of an arrest warrant is a ministerial rather than a discretionary function carroll city of portland,me a ministerial act is mandatory and requires no personal judgment or choice.emphasis in original.it is undisputed that wing accompanied desrosiers at desrosiers request to santoni residence where santoni was arrested and then transported by wing and desrosiers to the somerset county sheriff department.based on these facts,the district court appropriately concluded that wing was aware of the outstanding arrest warrant and had a legal duty to execute it.desrosiers presence at the arrest,for the purpose of assisting wing in the execution of the warrant,did not render that arrest unlawful under state law or constitutionally infirm.wilson layne,d holding that it is a violation of the fourth amendment for police to bring members of the media or other third parties into a home during the execution of a warrant when the presence of third parties in the home was not in aid of the execution of the warrant.
for the first time on appeal,santoni argues that summary judgment was inappropriate because it is reasonable to infer that wing was not aware of the warrant and therefore had no obligation to execute it.this argument relies on statements made by wing in a deposition taken on january,five months after the entry of summary judgment in favor of the federal defendants.as santoni acknowledges,however,this transcript was not available to the district court and therefore is not part of the recor
