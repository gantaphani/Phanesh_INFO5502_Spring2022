background 
appellants were managers,claim adjusters,and claims processors in allstate jackson,mississippi office.allstate requires that its claims personnel document their activities with regard to adjusting claims in the claim file,including all communications with insureds and claimants,interviews of witnesses,and negotiations with claimants and their attorneys.among other things,accurate claim file records enable allstate to confirm it has complied with state law and regulations.
in,allstate adopted a software system called the claim development system cds.claims personnel used the system to document their activities and manually enter the dates on which those activities took place.in,allstate implemented an enhanced version of cds that reflected a computer generated date in a footnote,in addition to the manually entered headnote date.while the headnote date would reflect the date the activity took place,the footnote date would indicate the date the activity was recorded.upon completion of an entry,the employee would press enter,at which point the computer automatically inserts the current date at the bottom of the screen.
allstate first learned that the footnote date could be altered while it was preparing its defense in another lawsuit in mississippi in spring.during discovery,allstate learned that a jackson office employee,joan vines,had learned of a way to alter the footnote by manually entering a footnote date and then prematurely turning off the computer before pressing the enter key.the manually entered footnote date would appear on the screen when rebooting the computer this process allowed employees to backdate entries.
after learning that the footnote could be altered,allstate put together a multidisciplinary team to conduct a national audit to determine if other employees were backdating the entries and to identify these employees and the affected files.during the investigation,which spanned from september to february,the team determined that the problem centered in the jackson,mississippi office 
in april and may,allstate conducted interviews with those employees whom it determined had made the alterations.cheatham,gilbert,kitch,ladd,mccoy,peoples,parham,and stegall admitted to making alterations.anthony denied making the alterations,but could not offer an alternative explanation.johnston admitted he had conversations with some jackson office employees regarding the altering of electronic documents.wells admitted that she had been shown the process for altering the date by vines.allstate concluded that wells and johnston,in their positions as managers,had knowledge that their employees were altering the footnote date and took no action to stop it.
allstate counsel judith gaston recommended terminating appellants for altering company documents,in violation of the allstate code of ethics,the code of ethics,and the allstate human resources policy guide.these manuals forbid employees from altering company documents,including electronic documents,and threaten immediate termination of employees found to have falsified company documents.allstate terminated appellants on june and.those employees who were at work met individually with a local human resources representative at a hotel conference room,outside of which an armed security guard was present.each appellant was informed that they were being terminated for a violation of company policies,and each was not permitted to return to the office to collect their personal belongings at that time.
appellants each filed charges of employment discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,pursuant to d.appealing from the district court grant of summary judgment to allstate,appellants claim that allstate wrongfully terminated them based on their age,they are entitled to overtime compensation benefits and damages due to allstate failure to pay those benefits,and they are entitled to damages for intentional infliction of emotional distress iied as a result of the manner in which allstate terminated them.
ii.discussion 
we review the grant of a summary judgment motion de novo,and apply the same standard as the district court.duffy leading edge prods,cir fed.civ.we resolve any factual inferences in favor of appellants,the nonmovants,and ask whether allstate,the movant,is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see degan ford motor,cir.we consider each claim in turn.
age discrimination in employment act 
appellants challenge allstate reason for terminating them as pretext,and alternatively argue that age was a motivating factor behind their terminations.the burden shifting standard for claims of adea violations in the fifth circuit is.see,meinecke block of houston,cir.first,appellants must state a prima facie case of age discrimination.id.if they succeed,the burden shifts to allstate to provide a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for terminating appellants.id.if allstate satisfies this burden,the burden again shifts to appellants to prove that allstate proffered reason was pretextual.id.appellants may also prove that age was a motivating factor for their terminations.keelan majesco software,cir.the plaintiff retains the ultimate burden of persuasion throughout the case.faruki parsons,citing.dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d.
allstate terminated appellants after a multidisciplinary team composed of lawyers,corporation security personnel,and claims employees completed a nationwide investigation that revealed that the employees engaged in the practice of altering the footnote date when they entered their activities in the cds,or,in the case of wells and johnston,they knew of the practice but did nothing to stop it.allstate undertook the investigation because it considered the practice to be a serious threat to the integrity of its claims files 
assuming arguendo that appellants have established a prima facie case they have failed to show that allstate legitimate reason for their terminations is pretextual or that age was a motivating factor for their terminations.appellants arguments that allstate sanctioned the practice fail.first,appellants argument that employees regularly backdated handwritten entries prior to the implementation of the cds is irrelevant,as the computer system was designed to capture the date on which entries were actually entered.second,appellants argument that allstate failed to provide written or verbal instructions that altering the date was against company policy is counterintuitive,as allstate did not learn of the practice until vines described the procedure in an earlier lawsuit.third,appellants argument that allstate allowed the practice to continue for months after learning of it is misplaced,as allstate promptly initiated its several months long investigation to determine the prevalence of the problem and what actions it would take in response.finally,appellants are inaccurate in stating that allstate did not prosecute appellants nor report to the mississippi insurance commissioner or attorney general that the reason for appellants termination was the falsification of documents,as allstate has discretion to determine whether it will seek prosecution in a given situation,and it did report the transgressions to the insurance commissioner and th
