donald rickard led police officers on a car chase that came to a temporary halt when rickard spun out into a parking lot.rickard resumed maneuvering his car,and as he continued to use the accelerator even though his bumper was flush against a patrol car,an officer fired three shots into rickard car.rickard managed to drive away,almost hitting an officer in the process.officers fired more shots as rickard sped away,striking him and his passenger,both of whom died from some combination of gunshot wounds and injuries suffered when the car eventually crashed.
respondent,rickard minor daughter,filed a action,alleging that the officers used excessive force in violation of the fourth and fourteenth amendments.the district court denied the officers motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity,holding that their conduct violated the fourth amendment and was contrary to clearly established law at the time in question.after finding that it had appellate jurisdiction,the sixth circuit held that the officers conduct violated the fourth amendment.it affirmed the district court order,suggesting that it agreed that the officers violated clearly established law.
the sixth circuit properly exercised jurisdiction under,which gives courts of appeals jurisdiction to hear appeals from final decisions of the district courts.the general rule that an order denying a summary judgment motion is not a final decision n,and thus not immediately appealable,does not apply when it is based on a qualified immunity claim.johnson jones.respondent argues that johnson forecloses appellate jurisdiction here,but the order in johnson was not immediately appealable because it merely decided a question of evidence sufficiency,at,while here,petitioners qualified immunity claims raise legal issues quite different from any purely factual issues that might be confronted at trial.deciding such legal issues is a core responsibility of appellate courts and does not create an undue burden for them.see,scott harris.
the officers conduct did not violate the fourth amendment.
a addressing this question first will be beneficial in develop ing constitutional precedent in an area that courts typically consider in cases in which the defendant asserts a qualified immunity defense,pearson callahan.
b respondent argument requires analyzing the totality of the circumstances from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene.graham connor.respondent contends that the fourth amendment did not allow the officers to use deadly force to terminate the chase,and that,even if they were permitted to fire their weapons,they went too far when they fired as many rounds as they did.
the officers acted reasonably in using deadly force.a police officer attempt to terminate a dangerous car chase that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the fourth amendment,even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.scott,supra,at.rickard outrageously reckless driving which lasted more than five minutes,exceeded miles per hour,and included the passing of more than two dozen other motorists posed a grave public safety risk,and the record conclusively disproves that the chase was over when rickard car came to a temporary standstill and officers began shooting.under the circumstances when the shots were fired,all that a reasonable officer could have concluded from rickard conduct was that he was intent on resuming his flight,which would again pose a threat to others on the road.
petitioners did not fire more shots than necessary to end the public safety risk.it makes sense that,if officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety,they need not stop shooting until the threat has ended.here,during the span when all the shots were fired,rickard never abandoned his attempt to flee and eventually managed to drive away.a passenger presence does not bear on whether officers violated rickard fourth amendment rights,which are personal rights that may not be vicariously asserted.alderman united states.
even if the officers conduct had violated the fourth amendment,petitioners would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity.an official sued under is entitled to qualified immunity unless it is shown that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.ashcroft.brosseau haugen,where an officer shot at a fleeing vehicle to prevent possible harm,makes plain that no clearly established law precluded the officer conduct there.thus,to prevail,respondent must meaningfully distinguish brosseau or point to any controlling authority or robust consensus of cases of persuasive authority,supra,at,that emerged between the events there and those here that would alter the analysis.respondent has made neither showing.if anything,the facts here are more favorable to the officers than the facts in brosseau and respondent points to no cases that could be said to have clearly established the unconstitutionality of using lethal force to end a car chase.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
justice alito delivered the opinion of the court.
the courts below denied qualified immunity for police officers who shot the driver of a fleeing vehicle to put an end to a dangerous car chase.we reverse and hold that the officers did not violate the fourth amendment.in the alternative,we conclude that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity because they violated no clearly established law.
because this case arises from the denial of the officers motion for summary judgment,we view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,the daughter of the driver who attempted to flee.wilkie robbins.near midnight on july,lieutenant joseph forthman of the west memphis,arkansas,police department pulled over a white honda accord because the car had only one operating headlight.donald rickard was the driver of the accord,and kelly allen was in the passenger seat.forthman noticed an indentation,roughly the size of a head or a basketball in the windshield of the car.estate of allen west memphis,wl,wd.he asked rickard if he had been drinking,and rickard responded that he had not.because rickard failed to produce his driver license upon request and appeared nervous,forthman asked him to step out of the car.rather than comply with forthman request,rickard sped away.
forthman gave chase and was soon joined by five other police cruisers driven by sergeant vance plumhoff and officers jimmy evans,lance ellis,troy galtelli,and john gardner.the officers pursued rickard east on interstate toward memphis,tennessee.while on,they attempted to stop rickard using a rolling roadblock,at,but they were unsuccessful.the district court described the vehicles as swerving through traffic at high speeds,at,and respondent does not dispute that the cars attained speeds over miles per hour see memorandum of law in response to defendants motion for summary judgment in wd,see also tr.of oral arg.during the chase,rickard and the officers passed more than two dozen vehicles.
rickard eventually exited in memphis,and shortly afterward he made a quick right turn,causing contact to occu r between his car and evans cruiser.wl.as a result of that contact,rickard car spun out into a parking lot and collided with plumhoff cruiser.now in danger of being cornered,rickard put his car into reverse in an attempt to escape.ibid.as he did so,evans and plumhoff got out of their cruisers and approached rickard car,and evans,gun in hand,pounded on the window.at that point,rickard car made contact with yet another police cruiser.ibid.rickard tires started spinning,and his car was rocking back and forth,indicating that rickard was using the accelerator even though his bumper was flush against a police cruiser.at that point,plumhoff fired three shots into rickard car.rickard then reversed in a degree arc and maneuvered onto another street,forcing ellis to step to his right to avoid the vehicle.ibid.as rickard continued fleeing down that street,gardner and galtelli fired shots toward rickard car,bringing the total number of shots fired during this incident to.rickard then lost control of the car and crashed into a building.ibid.rickard and allen both died from some combination of gunshot wounds and injuries suffered in the crash that ended the chase.see app.
respondent,rickard surviving daughter,filed this action under stat,against the six individual police officers and the mayor and chief of police of west memphis.she alleged that the officers used excessive force in violation of the fourth and fourteenth amendments.
the officers moved for summary judgment based on qualified immunity,but the district court denied that motion,holding that the officers conduct violated the fourth amendment and was contrary to law that was clearly established at the time in question.the officers appealed,but a sixth circuit motions panel initially dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction based on this court decision in johnson jones.later,however,that panel granted rehearing,vacated its dismissal order,and left the jurisdictional issue to be decided by a merits panel.
the merits panel then affirmed the district court decision on the merits.estate of allen west memphis,fed.appx.on the issue of appellate jurisdiction,the merits panel began by stating that a motion for qualified immunity denied on the basis of a district court determination that there exists a triable issue of fact generally can not be appealed on an interlocutory basis.at.but the panel then noted that the sixth circuit had previously interpreted our decision in scott harris,as creating an exception to this rule under which an immediate appeal may be taken to challenge blatantly and demonstrably false factual determinations.fed,at quoting moldowan warren.concluding that none of the district court factual determinations ran afoul of that high standard,and distinguishing the facts of this case from those in scott,the panel held that the officers conduct violated the fourth amendment.fed,at,and.the panel said nothing about whether the officers violated clearly established law,but since the panel affirmed the order denying the officers summary judgment motion the panel must have decided that issue in respondent favor.
we granted certiorari.
we start with the question whether the court of appeals properly exercised jurisdiction under,which gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction to hear appeals from final decisions of the district courts.
an order denying a motion for summary judgment is generally not a final decision within the meaning of and is thus generally not immediately appealable.johnson,at.but that general rule does not apply when the summary judgment motion is based on a claim of qualified immunity,at mitchell forsyth.q ualified immunity is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability.pearson callahan,quoting mitchell,supra,at.as a result,pretrial orders denying qualified immunity generally fall within the collateral order doctrine.see ashcroft iqbal.this is so because such orders conclusively determine whether the defendant is entitled to immunity from suit this immunity issue is both important and completely separate from the merits of the action,and this question could not be effectively reviewed on appeal from a final judgment because by that time the immunity from standing trial will have been irretrievably lost.see ibid johnson,supra,at citing mitchell,supra,at.
respondent argues that our decision in johnson,forecloses appellate jurisdiction under the circumstances here,but the order from which the appeal was taken in johnson was quite different from the order in the present case.in johnson,the plaintiff brought suit against certain police officers who,he alleged,had beaten him,at.these officers moved for summary judgment,asserting that they were not present at the time of the alleged beating and had nothing to do with it,at.the district court determined,however,that the evidence in the summary judgment record was sufficient to support a contrary finding,and the court therefore denied the officers motion for summary judgment,at.the officers then appealed,arguing that the district court had not correctly analyzed the relevant evidence.ibid.
this court held that the johnson order was not immediately appealable because it merely decided a question of evidence sufficiency,which facts a party may,or may not,be able to prove at trial.at.the court noted that an order denying summary judgment based on a determination of evidence sufficiency does not present a legal question in the sense in which the term was used in mitchell,the decision that first held that a pretrial order rejecting a claim of qualified immunity is immediately appealable.johnson,at.in addition,the court observed that a determination of evidence sufficiency is closely related to other determinations that the trial court may be required to make at later stages of the case,at.the court also noted that appellate courts have no comparative expertise over trial courts in making such determinations and that forcing appellate courts to entertain appeals from such orders would impose an undue burden,at.
the district court order in this case is nothing like the order in johnson.petitioners do not claim that other officers were responsible for shooting rickard rather,they contend that their conduct did not violate the fourth amendment and,in any event,did not violate clearly established law.thus,they raise legal issues these issues are quite different from any purely factual issues that the trial court might confront if the case were tried deciding legal issues of this sort is a core responsibility of appellate courts,and requiring appellate courts to decide such issues is not an undue burden.
the district court order here is not materially distinguishable from the district court order in scott harris,and in that case we expressed no doubts about the jurisdiction of the court of appeals under.accordingly,here,as in scott,we hold that the court of appeals properly exercised jurisdiction,and we therefore turn to the merits.
petitioners contend that the decision of the court of appeals is wrong for two separate reasons.they maintain that they did not violate rickard fourth amendment rights and that,in any event,their conduct did not violate any fourth amendment rule that was clearly established at the time of the events in question.when confronted with such arguments,we held in saucier katz,that the first inquiry must be whether a constitutional right would have been violated on the facts alleged.only after deciding that question,we concluded,may an appellate court turn to the question whether the right at issue was clearly established at the relevant time.ibid.
we subsequently altered this rigid framework in pearson,declaring that saucier procedure should not be regarded as an inflexible requirement.at.at the same time,however,we noted that the saucier procedure is often beneficial because it promotes the development of constitutional precedent and is especially valuable with respect to questions that do not frequently arise in cases in which a qualified immunity defense is unavailable.at.pearson concluded that courts have the discretion to decide whether that sau cier procedure is worthwhile in particular cases.at.
heeding our guidance in pearson,we beg
