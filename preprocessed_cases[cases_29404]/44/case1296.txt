ii.factual and procedural background 
factual background 
in the spring of,bostic was fifteen years old,a sophomore at smyrna high school,and a member of the school track team,which was coached by smith.a sexual relationship developed between bostic and smith.the relationship included numerous sexual encounters during and after the school day,both on and off campus,and continued for approximately one year.
the relationship became a topic of discussion among students and generated reports that reached principal clarence lloyd and associate principal anthony soligo.bostic parents became concerned about the close relationship that they observed between bostic and smith,including an incident when bostic and smith were found alone together in a car at night.
in september,bostic met with lloyd and expressed his concerns.lloyd told bostic that he would speak with smith and get back to him.lloyd subsequently called smith into his office and,in the presence of soligo and james kiger,the school athletic director,discussed with smith the allegations made by bostic.at the meeting,smith stated that he was sitting in the car discussing his marital problems with bostic.lloyd warned smith that being alone with a student at night in a parked car was inappropriate and told smith to avoid improper conduct.soligo also told smith that he should minimize contact with bostic.smith responded that he had it covered.lloyd subsequently called bostic and left a message describing what he had done and asking bostic to call him back if he had any further concerns.bostic did not call back.
michael feldman,a teacher at the school,subsequently saw smith and bostic standing together in the hallway on two occasions.feldman stated that they were so close together that they appeared to be two students,rather than a teacher and a student.feldman discussed the incidents with an assistant principal,who conveyed the information to lloyd.
after learning of the hallway incidents,lloyd summoned smith for another meeting with him and soligo.at that meeting,lloyd reprimanded smith and told him to cease contact with bostic.lloyd stated that he felt that he gave him a very strong reprimand,that this was not going to be tolerated.lloyd then spoke with bostic,who told him that there was nothing going on.
lloyd told ron eby,assistant superintendent for the school district,about the concerns regarding bostic and smith and what he had done.lloyd also asked whether he should do anything else.eby told him to keep an eye on the situation and relayed the information to debbie wicks,the superintendent of the district.
a few months later,smith wife,also a teacher at smyrna high school,told lloyd that she had caught smith and bostic alone in her room at school.the next day,bostic told lloyd that she had purchased a clone pager,was monitoring bostic pages,and had hired a private investigator to monitor the situation.lloyd spoke with smith again and expressed his concerns.smith admitted calling bostic,but he told lloyd it was about track practice and again denied any illicit interaction with bostic.
in early february,bostic asked lloyd to allow a private investigator she had hired onto the school campus and to install cameras to monitor bostic and smith.eby advised lloyd not to allow the investigator on campus,but eby stated that he would contact the district attorney office regarding the cameras.
wicks set up a meeting with eby and smith,at which smith again denied any improper relationship with bostic.because smith seemed credible at the meeting,the administrators took no further action.
bostic then spoke with barry meekins,a member of the smyrna board of education,about her concerns.on the same day,meekins called wicks,asked why he had not been informed of the situation,and stated that,based on what bostic had said,he was going to call the police.although her reasons for doing so are unclear,wicks tried to dissuade meekins from calling the police.on february,two police officers spoke with wicks and told her that they were investigating a possible relationship between smith and a different student.wicks suspended smith that day.smith subsequently was arrested and pled guilty to crimes involving both students.
procedural background 
bostic complaint alleged that the smyrna defendants were liable under title ix,and that all defendants were liable under,and state common law.the smyrna defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims against them.the motion was granted as to certain state common law claims and the title ix claims against lloyd and soligo.the district court,however,let stand the and title ix claims.it concluded that there were material issues of fact with regard to whether the relevant officials had actual knowledge of the relationship and whether their response was deliberately indifferent.
the case went to trial and the jury found for the smyrna defendants on all remaining claims.the jury did,however,find smith liable and assessed damages against him in the amount of.
bostic moved for a new trial on the grounds that the verdict was against the great weight of the evidence,and the district court jury instructions with regard to actual notice,appropriate official,supervisory liability,and lack of training were erroneous.the district court denied the motion,and bostic timely appealed.
iii.analysis 
bostic sole contention on appeal is that the district court instructions on actual notice and appropriate official under title ix misstate the law and were contrary to the teachings of the third circuit and the united states supreme court 
objection raised below 
the smyrna defendants contend that bostic failed to object to the title ix jury instructions below.in order to preserve an objection to an instruction or the failure to give an instruction,a party must timely object on the record,stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.c.generally,a party who does not clearly and specifically object to a charge he believes to be erroneous waives the issue on appeal.alexander riga,cir see also.d.however,we may consider a plain error in the instructions affecting substantial rights that has not been preserved as required by rule d a or b.d.
during a charge conference held in chambers,the court asked the parties to review the jury instructions he had formulated,advising them to pay particular attention to title ix.after a short recess,the judge returned and inquired whether there was anything in the substance of the instructions thus far that we ought to raise.bostic counsel stated,i still request our instructions on title ix.but i do have any objections at this point as to the instruction.although bostic counsel subsequently reiterated his request for the court to give his proposed instruction,he did not stat e distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection,as required by rule c.to the contrary,he specifically stated that he did not have any objections to the title ix instruction.we therefore review for plain error.under such circumstances,we will overturn a verdict only w
