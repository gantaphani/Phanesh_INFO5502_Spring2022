northlake christian school ncs attempted to forestall strife with its principal pamela prescott by entering into an employment contract for mediation or arbitration under the auspices of the institute for christian conciliation,these methods being prescribed as the sole remedy for any controversy.when the school relationship with prescott deteriorated,however,prescott filed suit.the district court ordered adr.mediation occurred,then arbitration ncs appealed a highly adverse and somewhat dubious award back to the court ncs appealed to this court and we are forced to remand for further proceedings.so much for saving money and relationships through alternative dispute resolution.perfect justice is not always found in this world.
background 
ncs hired prescott as its principal for the school year.in a written employment contract,the parties agreed in conformity with the biblical injunctions of corinthians,matthew,and matthew that any claim or dispute arising out of,or related to,this agreement or to any aspect of the employment relationship would be referred to mediation and,if unsuccessful,binding arbitration.the agreement specified that the arbitration process shall be conducted in accordance with the current rules of procedure for christian conciliation of the institute for christian conciliation.moreover,the parties waived their respective rights to file a lawsuit against one another in any civil court for such disputes,except to enforce a legally binding arbitration decision.
in the spring of,ncs told prescott her contract would not be renewed for the following year and instructed her to vacate the premises of the school by march.she was placed on administrative leave for the duration of the school year contract and was paid her full salary and benefits throughout the contract term.
in february,prescott filed suit against ncs,its board of directors,and its chief administrator in federal court.she asserted claims for title vii gender discrimination,sexual harassment,and retaliation,violation of the louisiana whistleblower protection act,and breach of contract.ncs moved to compel arbitration.the court granted ncs motion,stayed prescott suit,and administratively closed the case 
to submit their dispute to arbitration,following the failure of mediation,the parties executed a form agreement furnished by the icc.they agreed to be governed by icc rules,which included conducting the arbitration pursuant to the montana uniform arbitration act muaa.most important,the parties interlineated the agreement in two places.first,the agreement originally provided that all communications,written or oral,between the parties during the mediation arbitration process shall be inadmissible in a court of law or for legal discovery.the parties crossed out the arbitration language,presumably making such communications admissible in a court of law.second,on prescott initiative,the parties added and initialed a provision,which stated no party waives appeal rights,if any,by signing this agreement.
after an unsuccessful attempt at mediation,the parties proceeded before a single icc arbitrator.over a period,the arbitrator heard testimony from a multitude of witnesses and reviewed the evidence and affidavits submitted by the parties.on june,the arbitrator determined that ncs had failed to resolve its conflict with prescott in accordance with matthew,and other biblical scriptures,which he held were incorporated into the terms of prescott employment contract the arbitrator rendered judgment in favor of prescott on her breach of contract claim and awarded her for damage to her reputation and for future loss of income the arbitrator also awarded ncs for past due cobra payments.ncs filed a motion to reconsider with the icc administrator the arbitrator denied the motion.
ncs next moved to vacate the arbitration award in federal court,and argued,inter alia,that the handwritten amendments to the arbitration agreement expanded the federal court scope of review.under this expanded scope of review,ncs urged the district court to vacate the arbitration award,as a matter of law,because prescott was not wrongfully terminated,and she was not entitled to damages.the district court disagreed and concluded that the if any language merely preserves whatever appeal rights are statutorily granted under the muaa.the district court rejected ncs substantive claims under the muaa narrow scope of review.ncs now appeals that decision to this court.
ii.standard of review 
on a motion to vacate an arbitration award,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo.harris parker college of chiropractic,cir.normally,the district court review of an arbitration award,under the federal arbitration act faa,is extraordinarily narrow.antwine prudential bache securities,cir stating that,under the faa,courts should defer to the arbitrator decision when possible citations omitted the scope of judicial review is equally narrow under the muaa the muaa also permits modification of an arbitration award under limited circumstances 
in the instant case,we are called upon to determine whether the parties arbitration agreement expanded the scope of judicial review beyond that provided in the muaa.the district court interpretation of a contract,including the initial determination whether the contract is ambiguous,is a conclusion of law.american totalisator,fair grounds,cir thrift hubbard,cir.if the contract is ambiguous,then the determination of the parties intent through the extrinsic evidence is a question of fact.watkins,cir.
iii.discussion 
ncs offers several arguments on appeal the arbitration agreement expanded the scope of judicial review the arbitrator erred,as a matter of law,in ruling that ncs breached its contract with prescott and that prescott was entitled to damages and the arbitrator violated several provisions of the muaa because we are uncertain whether,and if so,to what extent,the arbitration agreement expanded the scope of judicial review,we vacate the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings.
in a broad sense,this dispute is subject to the faa.see volt info.sciences,board of trustees of leland stanford junior university,d finding that the faa applies to a written agreement to arbitrate in any contract involving interstate commerce.thus,the faa,and the body of federal substantive law interpreting it,would typically govern the resolution of this dispute.moses cone memorial hosp.mercury constr,d recognizing that the faa create s a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability,applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the act.
the faa,however,does not bar parties from structuring an arbitration by means of their contractual agreements,nor does it preempt all state laws regarding arbitration.see harris,at permitting contractual modification concerning standard of review specialty healthcare,mary parish,cir recognizing that the faa does not preempt all state law related to arbitration agreements.we held in gateway technologies,mci telecommunications,cir,that a contractual modification is acceptable because,as the supreme court has emphasized,arbitration is a creature of contract and the faa policy does not operate without regard to the wishes of the contracting parties.
a threshold issue is which state law governs the interpretation of the arbitration contract.prescott employment agreement provided that the arbitration was subject to the montana arbitration act,title,montana code annotated.the district court viewed this as a provision concerning the standards for arbitration.ncs contends,correctly,that the reference to the muaa is not a provision,and that louisiana law controls the interpretation of the arbitration agreement as an addendum to the employment contract.in valero refining,lauberhorn,cir,this circuit determined that contractual language authorizing arbitration in new york city did not constitute a new york provision.instead,the provision merely requires that the procedures that the arbitrators use be in accordance with the laws applicable to new york city.id.at emphasis in original.accordingly,the muaa controls the procedures attendant to the arbitration,but not the interpretation of the underlying contract.
louisiana law applies to this dispute between a louisiana resident and a louisiana school concerning the proper interpretation of a louisiana contract the employment contract contained a valid provision requiring all disputes to be adjudicated under the laws of louisiana.in louisiana,w here parties stipulate the state law governing the contract,louisiana conflict of laws principles require that the stipulation be given effect,unless there is statutory or jurisprudential law to the contrary or strong public policy considerations justifying the refusal to honor the contract as written.delhomme industries,houston beechcraft,cir quoting associated press toledo,so d.the parties additional agreement in no way detracts from that choice alternatively,it is independently subject to louisiana law.
the inquiry thus becomes whether the parties arbitration agreement contemplated expanded judicial review.contrary to the district court determination,this matter can not be resolved on the face of the agreement and requires further factual development.under louisiana law,interpretation of a contract is the determination of the common intent of the parties.ann.however,w hen the words of a contract are clear and explicit and lead to no absurd consequences,no further interpretation may be made in search of the parties intent.ann.only if the contract is ambiguous may the court look beyond the four corners of the document.taita chemical,westlake styrene,cir.
in a handwritten additional paragraph,ncs and prescott agreed that n o party waives appeal rights,if any,by signing this arbitration agreement.the district court concluded that this language merely preserved whatever appeal rights the muaa already granted to the parties.this conclusion is far from.in gateway,the arbitration agreement provided that t he arbitration decision shall be final and binding to both parties,except that errors of law shall be subject to appeal.at.the court concluded that this language expanded review of the arbitration award by the federal courts.id.this court reached the same result in harris,where the agreement provided that t he award of the arbitrator shall be binding on the parties hereto,although each party shall retain his right to appeal any questions of law,and judgment may be entered thereon in any court having jurisdiction.at.while the language in harris and gateway is more straightforward,it can certainly be argued that by adding this language to a form contract that otherwise contained no provision concerning appeal of an arbitration award,the parties here intended to expand the scope of judicial review.such an interpretation heeds the principle that a provision susceptible of different meanings must be interpreted with the meaning that renders it effective and not one that renders it ineffective.the district court interpretation would seem to render the handwritten modification surplusage,and therefore meaningless 
even if the parties intended to affect the scope of judicial review with this language,however,their precise intentions concerning expanded review are ambiguous.we reach this conclusion mindful that e ach provision in a contract must be interpreted in light of the other provisions so that each is given the meaning suggested by the contract as a whole.thus,it is also significant that the parties decided to permit a court of law to review written and oral communications,the record evidence from the arbitration this modification of the contract form language amplifies their apparent intent to expand the scope of judicial review.reinforcing prescott apparent intention to preserve expanded appeal rights it was her attorney who insisted upon these special conditions,prescott had a court reporter transcribe the arbitration proceedings.
these contractual tidbits strongly suggest that the parties intended judicial review to be available beyond the normal narrow range of the faa or muaa.because they can not compel a firm decision on the face of the contract,however,we find it ambiguous and must remand for the district court to take evidence on and contractually interpret the circumstances surrounding the making of the provision.the court will then be required to under the appropriate standard ncs challenges to the arbitration award.
iv.conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,we vacate the district court order confirming the arbitration award and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
vacated and remanded.
i respectfully dissent from the panel majority conclusion that a clause that provides no party waives appeal rights,if any,by signing this arbitration agreement,when considered on its face or when read in harmony with the other provisions of the parties agreement,is ambiguous regarding the parties intent to contract for a more expansive scope of review than that otherwise available pursuant to the faa or the muaa.the majority accurately sets forth the facts and procedural history of this case,so i will not repeat them here.
the majority concludes that this clause,which speaks only in terms of appeal rights and contemplates that none may exist,at least arguably evidences the parties intent to expand the scope of judicial review.the majority reaches this conclusion even though the clause neither identifies a question for our consideration that would not otherwise be reviewable under the faa or muaa nor refers to any particular level of scrutiny pursuant to which such review should be conducted.the majority further finds that certain contractual tidbits strongly suggest that the parties intended judicial review to be available beyond the normal narrow range of the faa or muaa.finally,notwithstanding its uncertainty regarding whether and to what extent the parties agreement expanded the scope of judicial review,the majority concludes that this ambiguity requires that we remand the case to the district court to adduce evidence of the parties intentions and interpret the circumstances surrounding the making of this provision.because i find the majority determinations irreconcilable with the terms,context,and purpose of the parties arbitration agreement and our recent clarification in action industries,united states fidelity guaranty,cir,regarding the level of exactitude required to of the narrow scope of review available under the governing arbitration statute,i must disagree with all three conclusions.
the majority begins its analysis by rejecting the district court determination that the reference to the montana uniform arbitration act contained in the parties submission agreement constituted a provision governing the scope of judicial review of the arbitration award in the instant case.this provision provided that this agreement is subject to arbitration pursuant to the montana arbitration act,title,montana code annotated.the district court reasoned that the muaa,like the faa,sets forth only limited grounds for vacatur or modification of an arbitration award,and that to expand the scope of judicial review beyond that allowed by the law governing the arbitration process,the arbitration agreement must expressly and unambiguously evidence the parties intent to do so.finding no such express and unambiguous statement in the submission agreement additional,handwritten provision that no party waives appeal rights,if any,by signing this arbitration agreement,the district court concluded that the clause simply retained the few grounds for disturbing an arbitration award available under the muaa.
according to the majority,our opinion in valero refining,at,compels the conclusion that the muaa clause controls the procedures attendant to the arbitration,but not the interpretation of the underlying contract.the latter question,the majority reasons,must be determined under louisiana law,in accordance with the general provision contained in the parties employment agreement.while i agree that we must resort to state rules of construction to resolve any conflict between purportedly competing contractual provisions,the majority reliance on valero refining is misplaced,and injects ambiguity into an agreement which,when properly considered as a whole,has none.and,even if i were to agree that the parties intention regarding the applicable scope of judicial review is ambiguous,our opinion in action industries,at,establishing that a clause must be clear and unambiguous to expand the statutory scope of review,makes it patently apparent that the clause at issue here fails to overcome the governing arbitration statute and its attendant narrow grounds for vacatur.i will address each of these points in turn.
in valero refining,we rejected the assertion that a clause stipulating that the laws of the city of new york would govern the arbitration proceeding invoked the law of the second circuit,of which new york is a part,that rico claims were not subject to arbitration.id.at.we reasoned that the agreement reference to new york law was not a clause requiring application of the second circuit rule regarding arbitrability,but rather merely require d that the procedures that the arbitrators use be in accordance with the laws applicable to new york city.id.emphasis added.the clause at issue in valero refining,however,is not comparable to the specific reference to the muaa in the submission agreement before us.in ford nylcare health plans of the gulf coast,cir,relied upon by the district court,we held that a virtually identical reference to state that case,to the texas general arbitration act unambiguously governed nothing less than every aspect of the arbitration under the agreement at issue,rejecting the assertion that the clause could be read to make the tgaa applicable only to the procedural aspects of arbitration.id.at concluding that the reference to the tgaa unambiguously expressed the parties intent to supercede the faa rules with texas arbitration law.
it is clear under ford that the muaa clause sufficed to supercede the faa scope of review,and at least provisionally set forth the grounds for vacatur or modification of the arbitration award in the instant case.see action industries,at recognizing that an agreement specific reference to a state arbitration statute would suffice to of the faa standards for vacatur.the question thus becomes whether other language in the parties agreement sufficed to overcome the muaa clause.see ford,at.in this case the parties rights and duties with respect to arbitration are set forth in two separate agreements the employment contract,which contains an arbitration clause and incorporates the icc arbitration rules by reference,and a submission agreement,which supplements the parties more general commitment to resolve their disputes through arbitration by defining the issues to be submitted to the arbitrator.
like the muaa clause,the clause at the core of this dispute,no party waives appeal rights,if any,by signing this agreement,appears in the submission agreement.on its face,this no waiver clause indicates that the parties intended only to retain whatever appeal rights they had at the time they added that clause.the majority,rejecting this view as not,finds that ncs argument that such an interpretation renders the no waiver clause surplusage is sufficiently compelling to create an ambiguity in the parties agreement.the majority is further persuaded by the purported absence of any other provision concerning an appeal of an award in the parties agreement.i disagree with both aspects of the majority rationale and its ultimate conclusion that such an ambiguity exists.
first,the majority the clause does not simply retain the muaa the language if any surplusage,and it is the very inclusion of the phrase if any that evidences the parties express contemplation that the entire clause may be redundant.as the majority acknowledges,under louisiana law,an interpretation of a contract that has the effect of rendering a provision superfluous or meaningless must be avoided.see.thus,we can not,as the majority has done,leave out terms of a contract or render them surplusage and then declare that there is an ambiguity,itself a result of refusing to give effect to the contract express provisions.
second,contrary to the majority conclusion,the arbitration agreement at issue contains numerous provisions concerning appeal rights,all of which reaffirm the parties intent that any arbitration award would be final and binding and not subject to appeal except as provided by law.in particular,the parties employment agreement provided that the parties waive their respective rights to file a lawsuit against one another in any civil courts for such disputes,except to enforce a legally binding arbitration decision.emphasis added.the employment agreement also incorporated by reference the icc rules,which in turn provided that t he arbitrator decision is final and shall be legally binding on the parties,except as provided by law,and,more specifically,can not be considered or appealed except as provided by rule request for reconsideration by the arbitrator civil law.icc rules.e,clause of the submission agreement similarly provided that the arbitration would be legally binding.in clause,the submission agreement reiterated that the parties agreed to abide by and perform any decision rendered by the arbitrator and that the parties realize that arbitration will be the exclusive remedy for this dispute and that they may not later litigate these matters in civil court.in short,these provisions establish the agreement primary emphasis on the exclusivity and finality of arbitration as a means of resolving the instant dispute between the parties.all of these provisions support the conclusion that the parties handwritten no waiver clause merely sought to preserve whatever narrow grounds for challenging an arbitration award that were available to them.
nor do the contractual tidbits cited by the majority compel the contrary conclusion that the parties added language intended to expand the scope of judicial review.that the parties agreement authorized a court of law to review written and oral communications might,as the majority concludes,support the notion that they contemplated an expanded review.however,it is also wholly consistent with an intent to allow consideration of the arbitration award only under the narrow grounds available under the faa,or,in this case,the muaa,which,for example,permit vacatur where an arbitrator failure to consider relevant evidence has substantially prejudiced a party.see a d.in the absence of record evidence,or the authorization to review written and oral communications,the reviewing court would encounter great difficulty in assessing an alleged error by the arbitrator based on this ground.
similarly,prescott insistence that the arbitral proceedings be transcribed do not persuade me to lean in favor of finding an intent to expand the scope of judicial review.the application of a narrow scope of review limiting the grounds open for our consideration or a deferential standard of review setting forth how hard we must look at such grounds does not obviate the need for a record.see,prestige ford ford dealer computer,cir stating that,g iven the limited record available to this court,absent further documentation in the record suggesting a willful inattentiveness to the governing law,it would be difficult to find that the arbitration panel acted with manifest disregard for an applicable legal principle without undermining our stated deference for the arbitration process.in fact,the icc rules pursuant to which the parties arbitration was conducted specifically allow such transcription,yet,as noted above,also expressly state that any resultant award shall be legally binding on the parties and can not be considered or appealed except as provided by rule request for reconsideration by the arbitrator civil law.icc rules.e,admittedly,the grounds available for disturbing an arbitration award pursuant to the faa or muaa are narrow however,when they apply they do not provide for no review at all.
finally,even if i were to agree with the majority that the no waiver clause at issue is ambiguous regarding the parties intent to expand judicial review,the very existence of ambiguity means that at best this cl
