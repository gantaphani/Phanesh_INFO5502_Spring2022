calvin slade,a pretrial detainee at the hampton roads regional jail the jail in virginia appeals the dismissal of his west complaint.on appeal,slade asserts that the jail policy of charging a pretrial detainee one dollar per day to help defray his cost of housing violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,as well as the takings clause of the fifth amendment as incorporated by the fourteenth amendment.because the charge does not amount to punishment,however,we hold that it does not violate slade due process liberty right to be free from punishment before conviction.we also conclude that slade failed to plead violations of either the procedural due process clause or the takings clause.
slade was a pretrial detainee being held at the jail when,on january,he filed a pro se motion in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia challenging the jail practice of charging him one dollar per day from his inmate account during his detention.the jail practice,which began in november,is authorized by,which provides,in full 
any sheriff or jail superintendent may establish a program to charge inmates a reasonable fee,not to exceed per day,to defray the costs associated with the prisoners keep.the board of corrections shall develop a model plan and adopt regulations for such program,and shall provide assistance,if requested,to the sheriff or jail superintendent in the implementation of such program.such funds shall be retained in the locality where the funds were collected and shall be used for general jail purposes.
ann.michie supp.
pursuant to this statutory authority,the board of corrections developed a model plan to implement and assess the one dollar per day charge,and the jail adopted the model plan as its official policy for collecting the fee.under the jail policy,an inmate is informed of the charge upon his arrival at the jail and asked to sign a form indicating that the charge was explained to him.the charge is then assessed daily from an inmates account.an inmate account is an account that the jail permits inmates to maintain in order to purchase commissary items and pay for medical.if an inmate has no funds in his account,the account is debited until funds become available.if an inmate is released,transferred,or paroled with a negative account balance,that balance will be applied to the inmate new account if he is incarcerated at the jail in the future but will not result in a judgment lien against the inmate.
the fees that are collected from the one dollar charge are held in a separate revenue account to be used for general jail purposes.the jail policy also provides that inmates who are adjudicated not guilty on all charges are entitled to a refund of the fee if,within days,they make such a request in writing.refunds are not eligible to those detainees who are found guilty,or whose charges are nolle prossed or dismissed.
slade pro se complaint alleged that the fee violat ed inmates sic amendment constitutional rights to be treated equally,equal treatment,and equal protection of the law.at.slade also complained that those inmates awaiting to go to trial like him should not be punished amendment or treated differently than other state of virginia inmates.at.slade concluded his complaint by noting that t he law must not be arbitrary,capricious,or contradictory.at.slade requested injunctive relief,and also requested that the district court reimburse slade and the other inmates who were paying the charge.
on february,the district court,sua sponte,dismissed slade complaint under west supp see slade hampton roads regional jail,d.the district court construed slade complaint as raising two claims one under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and one under the substantive due process clause of the fourteenth amendment the district court dismissed the equal protection claim,reasoning the virginia statute does not violate equal protection because it applies to all inmates in local and regional jails.the mere fact that not all jails have,as yet,implemented the prisoner keep provision,does not create an equal protection violation with respect to plaintiff.at.the district court also dismissed the due process claim,because a a day fee for the purpose of defraying jail costs is not punishment within the meaning of the fourteenth amendment.at.slade filed a timely pro se appeal,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to west.
we apply de novo review a dismissal for failure to state a claim.see veney wyche,cir.courts should not dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim unless after accepting all allegations in the plaintiff complaint as true and drawing all reasonable factual inferences from those facts in the plaintiff favor,it appears certain that the plaintiff can not prove any set of facts in support of his claim entitling him to relief.edwards city of goldsboro,cir.moreover,when such a dismissal involves a civil rights complaint,we must be especially solicitous of the wrongs alleged and must not dismiss the complaint unless it appears to a certainty that the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief under any legal theory which might plausibly be suggested by the facts alleged.veney,at quoting harrison united states postal,cir.
on appeal,slade has abandoned his equal protection claim.instead,slade now contends that the charge is unconstitutional because it amounts to the punishment of pretrial detainees that the charge is unconstitutional because there are no procedures given before the charge is imposed and that the charge is an impermissible taking of property without just compensation.before we turn to the merits,however,we briefly must address whether slade claim is moot.
iii.mootness 
a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.powell mccormack,d.by way of supplemental authority,the jail informed the panel that slade was released from pretrial detention in july.accordingly,it urges us to hold that his claim is no longer a live controversy.slade complaint,however,requested both injunctive and monetary relief.the request for monetary relief is not moot even though slade has been released from jail because slade retains a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of the case,the return of money the jail deducted from his inmate account.mellen bunting,cir holding that students claim for damages was not moot even though students had graduated during the pendency of the appeal.
slade claim for injunctive relief,however,is moot because he is no longer in pretrial detention.slade seeks to avoid this conclusion by urging that his case is one that is capable of repetition yet evading review.the supreme court has explained that,in the absence of a class action,the capable of repetition,yet evading review doctrine is limited to the situation where two elements combined the challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration,and there was a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again.weinstein bradford,d per curiam.in cases involving pretrial detention,the first inquiry is easily answered in slade favor.pretrial detention is by nature temporary,and it is most unlikely that any given individual could have his constitutional claim decided on appeal before he is either released or convicted.gerstein pugh,d.slade claim therefore evades review.
thus,our mootness inquiry into slade injunctive relief claim hinges on whether there is a reasonable expectation that slade will be subject to the same action in the future.this standard is not mathematically precise and requires only a reasonable likelihood of repetition.oliver scott,cir quoting honig doe,d.in spencer kemna,d,the supreme court held that a challenge to parole revocation proceedings was moot because the plaintiff was no longer on parole.id.at.in so finding,the court rejected the possible risk of future apprehension and conviction as meeting the capable of repetition prong.the court noted,we are unable to conclude that the requirement is satisfied by general assertions or inferences that in the course of their activities respondents will be prosecuted for violating valid criminal laws.we assume that respondents will conduct their activities within the law.id.at.see also mitchell dupnik,cir finding injunctive relief request against jail that housed a pretrial detainee was moot once pretrial detainee was convicted and relief was denied.
likewise,slade will only find himself in pretrial detention at the jail in the future if he is arrested for violating virginia criminal laws because we presume that slade will abide by the criminal laws of virginia in the future,we do not believe there is a reasonable probability that he will return to the jail as a pretrial detainee.accordingly,slade claim for injunctive relief is moot.
iv.substantive due process 
turning to the merits of the case,slade first argument is that the charge is punitive in nature and,as such,can not be imposed against pretrial detainees.as the district court correctly recognized,because slade is a pretrial detainee,not a prisoner,the protections afforded by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,and not those afforded by the eighth amendment,apply.city of revere.general,d see also robles prince george county,cir as a pretrial detainee,robles treatment and the conditions of his restraint are evaluated under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.although several states have laws permitting the recoupment of some of the cost of housing and several courts have had occasion to rule upon,and uphold,the constitutionality of room and board fees for convicted prisoners slade case appears to be the first case challenging the constitutionality of such practices as applied to pretrial detainees.
as a starting point,slade does not challenge virginia right to subject him to pretrial detention.instead,slade contends that the charge for prisoners keep amounts to punishment before conviction.t he government concededly may detain a criminal defendant to ensure his presence at trial and may subject him to the restrictions and conditions of the detention facility,so long as those conditions and restrictions do not amount to punishment bell wolfish,d.the due process rights of a pretrial detainee are at least as great as the eighth amendment protections available to the convicted prisoner while the convicted prisoner is entitled to protection only against punishment that is cruel and unusual,the pretrial detainee,who has yet to be adjudicated guilty of any crime,may not be subjected to any form of punishment.martin gentile,cir emphasis in original.although detainees have a right to be free from punishment,clearly not every inconvenience encountered during pretrial detention amounts to punishment in the constitutional sense.id.at.this conclusion is axiomatic because pretrial detention itself may imperil the suspect job,interrupt his source of income,and impair his family relationships.gerstein,at.
in determining whether the one dollar charge amounts to punishment,slade and the jail disagree over our relevant legal standard.slade contends that under the supreme court decision in austin united states,d,to find the charge unconstitutional we need only find that the its purpose is serving in part to punish.id.at.the jail contends that the proper standard is that announced in bell and adopted by our circuit in martin and hill nicodemus,cir.under this standard,the detainee first must show the imposition of a particular disability.bell,at.assuming that a disability or harm is shown,then 
t o establish that a particular condition or restriction of his confinement is constitutionally impermissible punishment,the pretrial detainee must show either that it was imposed with an expressed intent to punish or not reasonably related to a legitimate nonpunitive governmental objective,in which case an intent to punish may be inferred.
if there is no express intent to punish,our inquiry hinges on whether an alternative purpose to which the act may rationally be connected is assignable for it and the action does not appear excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned.robles,at quoting bell,at.alteration in original.
we believe that slade argument is misplaced and that continues to guide our inquiry.austin addressed the question of whether the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment could apply to in rem civil forfeiture proceedings,at,and does not contain a single citation to bell or any case involving the due process rights of pretrial detainees.in addition,recent case law reviewing conditions of pretrial detention and confinement still rely exclusively on bell.see,demery,at applying bell inquiry in finding that practice of placing in pretrial detainees cells and holding area violated due process right to be free from punishment broussard parish of orleans,cir collecting cases.
accordingly,absent an explicit indication to the contrary from the supreme court,we will continue to apply bell and to claims by pretrial detainees that certain conditions of confinement amount to punishment.thus,we must determine if the fee is a disability.if we answer that question in the affirmative,we must ask whether the fee express purpose is to punish,or whether an alternative purpose to which the act may rationally be connected is assignable for it and the action does not appear excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned.robles,at quoting bell,at.alteration in original.in conducting this inquiry,we must be mindful that these inquiries spring from constitutional requirements and that judicial answers to them must reflect that fact rather than a court idea of how best to operate a detention facility.bell,at.
although t here is,of course,a de minimis level of imposition with which the constitution is not concerned,ingraham wright,d,we need not decide whether the one dollar per day charge is a disability because,regardless,we hold that the charge is not punishment.slade has not shown that the express purpose of the one dollar per day charge is to punish or that it is not rationally related to an alternative legitimate governmental interest.in fact,states that the purpose of the charge is to defray the costs associated with the prisoners keep,not to punish pretrial detainees.moreover,while the statute expresses no intent to punish on its face,it asserts an alternative,legitimate governmental purpose for the charge.to that end,funds generated by the charge are to be used for general jail purposes.ann.under the jail policy,these funds are placed into a separate revenue account for general jail purposes.the court has recognized that the effective management of the detention facility is a valid objective.bell,at.see also broussard,at holding that providing funds to administer system was a legitimate government purpose.the charge has a rational relationship to this legitimate government interest,and it is not excessive in relation to that purpose.rather,it is an effort to offset the cost of housing pretrial detainees,as well as convicted prisoners,by requiring such individuals to aid in the cost of their housing.a charge of one dollar per day is not excessive for that goal.
we therefore conclude that the one dollar per day charge for prisoners keep does not amount to the unconstitutional punishment of pretrial detainees.
procedural due process 
slade second argument is that,because no predeprivation procedures are afforded before the charge is deducted from a detainee inmate account,his procedural due process rights were violated.the district court did not review this claim,because the complaint makes no reference to procedural due process.
federal rule of civil procedure a provides that a viable complaint must contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.this requirement is by no means onerous instead,it is designed to ensure that the complaint will give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.conley gibson,d.the liberal notice pleading of rule a is the starting point of a simplified pleading system,which was adopted to focus litigation o
