james freeman recently lost an arbitration dispute.soon thereafter,he discovered that the arbitrator had received contributions for a judicial campaign from ppg industries,the defendants minority owner.freeman filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award,but he conveniently failed to mention that the law firm representing him had contributed a far greater amount to the same campaign.the district court denied the motion,and we will affirm.
freeman was a director of operations at ppg auto glass until his firing in.at the time of freeman firing,ppg auto glass was a division of ppg industries.since then,pgw auto glass and pittsburgh glass works collectively known as pgw have assumed ppg auto glass liabilities.significantly,ppg industries maintains a percent interest in pgw.
after losing his job,freeman sued pgw in the district court for the western district of pennsylvania.freeman was sixty years old at the time of his firing,and he brought a claim under the age discrimination in employment act,et.the case was assigned to district judge arthur schwab.at the close of discovery,judge schwab held a settlement conference at which the parties entered a binding arbitration agreement.the court directed the clerk to mark the case closed.see.t his case shall be marked closed.
as part of the agreement,both sides listed three potential arbitrators,and maureen lally green appeared at the top of both lists.lally green is an experienced jurist who served as a judge on the pennsylvania superior court for over a decade.two years before her retirement in,she made an unsuccessful bid for a seat on the pennsylvania supreme court.she now works in private practice and teaches at duquesne university school of law.
on august,the parties spoke with lally green for the first time.she reminded them,you all know that it a small legal community here,and she acknowledged that she knew some people at ppg industries,the minority owner of pgw.app.to.she also told the parties that she taught a seminar on labor law.according to pgw,she explained that she taught the seminar with joseph mack,ppg industries senior employment attorney.see.app.but freeman maintains that she did not mention mack or reveal anything else about her relationship with ppg industries.see app.to.undeterred,the parties proceeded with lally green as their arbitrator.
lally green conducted a hearing near the end of.each side had a day to present evidence.by all accounts,the proceeding was fair and thorough neither party raises any issue concerning the arbitration hearing itself.one month later,lally green issued a lengthy opinion that rejected freeman discrimination claim.she concluded that freeman lost his job because he had limited recent sales experience and received average performance ratings in a poorly performing region.
three months later,freeman filed a motion in the district court to vacate lally green arbitration decision.whether born of sour grapes or a desire for justice,this motion claimed that lally green had failed to disclose campaign contributions that she had received from ppg industries and its employees during her supreme court bid.these contributions totaled to put this in perspective,lally green raised over million during her unsuccessful campaign.see.the motion also claimed that lally green had failed to disclose her teaching relationship with mack.in light of these nondisclosures,freeman urged the district court to vacate the arbitration.he argued that lally green was evidently partial in violation of a and that she had fraudulently induced the arbitration agreement 
freeman motion omitted an important fact.as pgw soon pointed out,lally green had received more than five times as much money roughly from the law firm that represented freeman during the arbitration this firm continues to represent freeman on appeal.to prove lally green impartiality,pgw cited the nature of the contributions as well her equanimity during the proceedings.pgw also argued that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion because it had closed the original case.
the district court saw no reason why the challenge could not occur in the same case as the original proceeding.app.as for freeman partiality and fraud claims,the court concluded that lally green nondisclosures were immaterial and insubstantial.the court thus denied freeman motion,and freeman filed a timely notice of appeal.
freeman now maintains that lally green was evidently partial and that she fraudulently induced the arbitration agreement.for its part,pgw denies these allegations and raises two threshold arguments namely,that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider freeman motion and that freeman waived his partiality objection.we turn to these arguments.
we must first decide whether the district court had jurisdiction to consider freeman motion to vacate.the court indisputably had jurisdiction to consider his initial complaint.but in pgw view,the court lost jurisdiction once it closed the case and sent the parties to arbitration.if so,the court would need a separate jurisdictional basis to consider freeman motion to vacate absent a separate basis,the court lacked jurisdiction and we must remand for dismissal.see packard provident bank,cir.the problem with this argument is that it relies on a faulty premise.as will soon be clear,the district court never lost jurisdiction because it administratively closed the case.
federal courts have long distinguished dismissals from administrative closings.the two procedures have different practical and jurisdictional effects.the supreme court discussed the effects of a dismissal in green tree financial randolph,d.there,the district court had dismissed the plaintiff claims with prejudice after referring the parties to arbitration.the supreme court considered whether that dismissal was an appealable final order under the federal arbitration act.it noted that the order plainly disposed of the entire case on the merits and left no part of it pending before the court.id.at.it then stated that the federal arbitration act permit s parties to arbitration agreements to bring a separate proceeding in a district court to enter judgment on an arbitration award once it is made or to vacate or modify it.id.
our cases have extended the supreme court analysis.two years after green tree,we held that any order that dismisses a case for arbitration is final even when the district court dismisses the case without prejudice.see blair scott specialty gases,cir.we noted that t he green tree decision draws a distinction between dismissals and stays,but does not draw any distinctions within the universe of dismissals.see morton int l staley,cir.as a result,anyone who wishes to challenge an arbitration after a dismissal must bring a separate action.see green tree,at.
by contrast,administrative closings are not final orders.see wrs,plaza entm t,cir.we first discussed administrative closings in penn west associates cohen,cir.in that case,the parties had reached a tentative settlement agreement.the district court then ordered the clerk to mark the case closed.id.at.we concluded that the district court had administratively closed the case.for that reason,the court should have reopened the case after the agreement fell apart.
district courts often use administrative closings to prune their overgrown dockets.id.at.the practical effect is to remove a case from the court active docket and permit the transfer of records associated with the case to an appropriate storage repository.lehman revolution portfolio,cir.administrative closings are particularly useful in circumstances in which a case,though not dead,is likely to remain moribund for an appreciable period of time.id.
most importantly,administrative closings have no effect on the district court jurisdiction.penn west,at.as the first circuit explained,a dministrative closings comprise a familiar,albeit essentially ad hoc,way in which courts remove cases from their active files without making any final adjudication.lehman,at.this means that a court may reopen a closed case either on its own or at the request of either party even if it lacks an independent jurisdictional basis for doing so.see.ass for retarded citizens,bush,cir designating a case closed does not prevent the court from reactivating a case either of its own accord or at the request of the parties.there is substantial unanimity on this issue.see dees billy,cir t hose circuits that have confronted the issue have unanimously agreed that an administrative closing has no jurisdictional effect.penn am.ins.mapp,cir green tree,at.concluding that if the district court had entered a stay instead of a dismissal,its order would not have been final.
it is clear that the district court administratively closed freeman case.on august,the parties agreed to arbitrate their dispute.the court ordered that the case be marked closed.after losing at arbitration,freeman filed a motion to vacate the decision.the district court denied that motion on april,and stated that the case shall remain closed.the court never mentioned a dismissal either with or without prejudice.indeed,the order used language that closely matches the language in our prior closing cases.compare penn west,at it is hereby ordered that the clerk of the court mark the above captioned matter closed,and wrs,at the clerk shall accordingly mark the case as closed,with.t his case shall be marked closed.
pgw nevertheless urges us to construe the district court order as a final order in effect,a dismissal because it end ed the litigation on the merits and le ft nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.catlin united states.in short,pgw wants us to ignore the text of the order and divine a contrary judicial intent.that we will not do.
words matter.the judicial process works best when orders mean what they say.surprising interpretations of simple language perhaps on the basis of a judicial intent not revealed in the words unnecessarily create complex questions and can cause persons to forfeit their rights unintentionally.adams lever,cir.consistent with this principle,we have rejected previous attempts to characterize an administrative closing as a final order in disguise,see penn west,at,as have other circuits,see,penn am,at 
nor can we say that the closing somehow matured into a final order.to be sure,a district court can provide,in the text of its order,a timetable under which the administrative closing may automatically expire,or,alternatively,mature into a final decision.penn west,at noting that an administrative closing did not become a final order despite the passing of three years.but the court order in this case contained no such timetable.and even if it had,such orders are not entirely self executing.they must still be entered into the docket before they can be considered final orders of dismissal.wrs,at citing united states indrelunas,d per curiam.
moreover,pgw misinterprets the district court order.contrary to pgw suggestion,the order left more for the court to do than execute the judgment.catlin,at.indeed,by closing the case rather than dismissing it the court maintained an implicit supervisory role over the arbitration.this allowed the parties to return to the same courtroom if problems arose during the arbitration for example,if the proposed arbitrators were unavailable,one of the parties failed to show up for arbitration,or even,as freeman alleges,the arbitrator violated a.to put it another way,the court order required it to act as a judicial backstop in the event that the arbitration fell apart.this practice is not only permissible but also laudable.when problems arise during arbitration,it often makes sense for the parties to return to a judge who is already familiar with the case.see lehman,at we endorse the judicious use of administrative closings by district courts.
we conclude that the district court order which closed the case and sent the parties to arbitration did not deprive the court of jurisdiction.because the district court retained jurisdiction,it correctly entered a final order when it denied freeman motion to vacate.in turn,we have jurisdiction to consider freeman appeal under a an appeal may be taken from a final decision with respect to an arbitration that is subject to this title.
we must also decide whether freeman waived his evident partiality claim under a.both sides agree that he failed to raise any concerns during the arbitration proceeding.this suggests that he waived his claim.in his defense,freeman contends that lally green deceived him and left him unaware of her true relationship with ppg industries.he argues that he could not bring forth information that had been withheld from him.whatever the merits of this contention,we will not apply the doctrine of waiver to freeman claim because ironically enough pgw failed to invoke it in the district court.
we generally refuse to consider issues that the parties have not raised below.singleton wulff,d it is the general rule,of course,that a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below.in a recent case,we noted that the appellant did not raise its claim in the bankruptcy court,and we refused to consider new claims for the first time on appeal.in re reliant energy channelview lp,cir.as the supreme court has pointed out,the doctrine of appellate waiver is essential in order that parties may have the opportunity to offer all the evidence they believe relevant to the issues.hormel helvering.
despite this general rule,it is within our discretion to consider an issue that the parties did not raise below.see,bagot ashcroft,cir this court has discretionary power to address issues that have been waived.the supreme court has explained that doing so is left primarily to the discretion of the courts of appeals,to be exercised on the facts of individual cases.singleton,at.see also chertkova.life,cir.for example,we might consider a waived issue when the proper resolution is beyond any doubt or when injustice might otherwise result.singleton,at.citations and quotation marks omitted see also kramer gates.
our court has yet to explain how waiver applies in the arbitration context.pgw asserts that a party waives any partiality claim under the federal arbitration act if the party failed to raise its concerns during arbitration.other circuits would generally agree.see,fid.fed.bank,fsb durga ma,cir applying waiver to claims under a jci comm ns int l of workers,local,cir same.
that said,most circuits have recognized that a blanket waiver rule is inappropriate.the sixth circuit concluded that waiver applies only if the party knew of the facts suggesting bias during the proceeding.see apperson fleet carrier,cir applying waiver only if a ll the facts now argued as to the alleged bias were known at the time the arbitrator heard their grievances quoting early transfer,cir united steelworkers of am.local union,cir applying a similar rule to a private labor board acting under.the ninth circuit extended this rule to situations where the party has constructive knowledge of a potential conflict but fails to timely object.fid.fed.bank,at citing jci comm ns,at.the court viewed this as a better approach in light of its policy favoring the finality of arbitration awards.id.
the ninth circuit approach has considerable merit a party waives later challenges only if it either knew or should have known of the facts indicating partiality.id.this approach allows a party to challenge an arbitration when it had no way of discovering the arbitrator bias beforehand.at the same time,it encourages investigation by making the parties accountable for information they should have known.moreover,it prevents the losing party from receiving a second bite at the apple.see early,at w e can not accept that parties have a right to keep two strings to their bow to seek victory before the tribunal and then,having lost,seek to overturn it for bias never before claimed.
but we need not adopt any approach today.the doctrine of appellate waiver is not somehow exempt from itself.see,united states gibbs,cir.this means that a party can waive a waiver argument by not making the argument below or in its briefs.a case from the seventh circuit is instructive.united states leichtnam,cir.there,the district court had improperly admitted two guns into evidence.id.at.the defendant did not object to the admission of guns at the time,but he later objected on appeal.the seventh circuit noted that the defendant likely waived his objection.yet the court concluded that the government waived any waiver argument by failing to raise the issue in its brief or at oral argument.id.at t he government has now waived waiver as a defense.the court thus considered the defendant objection.
that is similar to the situation here.pgw never presented its waiver argument to the district court for that reason,the district court never decided whether freeman had waived his challenge to lally green impartiality.nor did the court invite the parties to develop the record on the issue.pgw silence is particularly vexing because,as outlined above,whether freeman waived his objection likely depends on whether he knew or should have known of the campaign contributions during the arbitration.see bagot,at explaining that the applicability of waiver depends on whether additional is necessary.we are in no position to analyze pgw waiver argument on appeal.
we now turn to the merits of freeman claims.our review of the district court decision not to vacate the arbitration proceed s like our review of any other district court decision we review its legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.first options of,kaplan,d century indem.certain underwriters at lloyd,london,cir.

freeman claims that lally green was evidently partial in violation of a.this provision of the federal arbitration act allows courts to vacate an arbitration award upon the application of any party to the arbitration where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,or either of them.according to freeman,lally green violated this standard because she failed to disclose two facts the campaign funds from ppg industries and her teaching relationship with mack.we disagree.
the first order of business is to define evident partiality under the federal arbitration act,a.freeman argues that the act condemns even the appearance of bias.this would mean that the standard for arbitrators is the same as the disqualification standard for federal judges.see a.under that standard,what matters is not the reality of bias or prejudice but its appearance.liteky united states,d interpreting a.in response,pgw contends that the evident partiality standard is less restrictive.
the confusion over this issue stems from commonwealth coatings continental casualty,d.in that alliterative case,justice hugo black wrote a plurality opinion stating that w e can perceive no way in which the effectiveness of the arbitration process will be hampered by the simple requirement that arbitrators disclose to the parties any dealings that might create an impression of possible bias.id.at.plurality.he also remarked that any tribunal permitted by law to try cases and controversies not only must be unbiased but also must avoid even the appearance of bias.id.plurality emphasis added.that language is clear,but only three other justices joined the opinion.two justices concurred in an opinion by justice byron white,and three justices dissented.
when interpreting fractured opinions,we look to the narrowest grounds for judgment.see marks united states,d when a fragmented court decides a case the holding of the court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.citation and quotation marks omitted.justice white concurrence refused to define evident partiality generally.the court does not decide today that arbitrators are to be held to the standards of judicial decorum of article iii judges.commonwealth coatings,at.white,concurring.he instead enunciated a much narrower rule arbitrators must tell the parties about any substantial interest they have in a firm that does business with one of the parties.id.at.white,concurring.justice white concurrence is the narrowest grounds for judgment,which means that it is the holding of the court it also means that the plurality discussion of appearances is nonbinding.
and that is how other courts have interpreted commonwealth coatings.nearly two decades after the decision,the second circuit interpreted the phrase evident partiality and declared that it was facing a relatively clean slate.morelite constr.new york city dist.council carpenters ben.funds,cir.it rejected the appearance standard and held that evident partiality within the meaning of will be found where a reasonable person would have to conclude that an arbitrator was partial to one party to the arbitration.id.at.
other courts soon followed the second circuit lead.see,apperson,at we agree with the morelite court analysis.jci comm ns,at anr coal cogentrix of,cir see also positive software solutions new century mortg,cir en banc interpreting evident partiality practically rather than with utmost rigor.under this standard,t he alleged partiality must be direct,definite,and capable of demonstration.andersons,horton farms,cir.the party asserting bias must establish specific facts that indicate improper motives on the part of an arbitrator.peoples sec.life ins.monumental life,cir.
we embraced this standard in a footnote.see kaplan first options of,cir.t o show evident partiality,we explained,the challenging party must show a reasonable person would have to conclude that the arbitrator was partial to the other party to the arbitration.id.quoting apperson,at quotation marks omitted.although our discussion was abbreviated,we noted that e vident partiality is strong language and requires proof of circumstances powerfully suggestive of bias.id.quotation marks and citations omitted.we have yet to revisit this standard in a precedential opinion,nor have we explained whether it applies in all cases under the federal arbitration act.
in response to the parties confusion,we take this opportunity to reaffirm what we said in kaplan.an arbitrator is evidently partial only if a reasonable person would have to conclude that she was partial to one side.id.the conclusion of bias must be ineluctable,the favorable treatment unilateral.see andersons,at the alleged partiality must be direct,definite,and capable of demonstration.
this standard requires a stronger showing namely,partiality that is evident than does the appearance standard,and for good reason.most importantly,the relevant statutory language indicates that the two standards should be different.see zimmerman norfolk,cir statutory interpretation requires that we begin with a careful reading of the text.the federal arbitration act requires a party to show evident partiality.a.the word evident suggests that the statute requires more than a vague appearance of bias.rather,the arbitrator bias must be sufficiently obvious that a reasonable person would easily recognize it.by contrast,the judicial standard requires recusal if a judge impartiality might reasonably be questioned.a.this language suggests that the judicial inquiry focuses on appearances not on whether the judge actually harbored subjective bias.in re antar,cir.
in addition,parties often select arbitrators precisely because they are industry insiders.parties want someone who understands their business even if that person already has some familiarity with the parties and issues.see commonwealth coatings,at.white,concurring it is often because they are people of affairs,not apart from but of the marketplace,that they are effe
