background 
philip frank worked for delta airlines,as an aircraft mechanic in dallas,texas.upon being selected for a random drug test performed by labone,in february,frank produced a urine sample that contained traces of pyridine,a agent.delta interpreted frank adulterated sample as a refusal to test,fired him,and reported his refusal to test to the federal aviation administration faa.frank sued under three theories negligence,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and defamation.the district court denied delta rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,but the district court and this court approved an interlocutory appeal pursuant to b.
the issue on appeal is whether frank tort claims are preempted by of the omnibus transportation employee testing act of oteta and faa regulations we hold that frank tort claims are expressly preempted by federal law and reverse the district court judgment.
discussion 
this court reviews a b ruling de novo.shipp mcmahon,cir.when ruling on a b motion,the court must liberally construe the complaint in favor of the plaintiff and assume the truth of all pleaded facts.oliver scott,cir.the court may dismiss a claim when it is clear that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.jones greninger,cir.preemption by federal law of a common law cause of action is a question of law reviewed de novo.see meredith louisiana fed of teachers,cir.
federal law will override state law under the supremacy clause when congress expressly preempts state law congressional intent to preempt may be inferred from the existence of a pervasive federal regulatory scheme or state law conflicts with federal law or its purposes.english general,d.this case involves express preemption t he purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in every case.medtronic,lohr,d.
provisions preempting state law are abundant in this area,while corresponding clauses saving state law are modest.beginning in,the faa prescribed an program for personnel engaged in specified aviation activities,for which it issued comprehensive regulations covering,inter alia,the types of required drug testing,the selection of employees to be tested,qualifications for testing laboratories,the release of test results on individuals,administrative procedures to challenge the results,and the reporting of test results and other information to faa.see,pt,app.i pt.the regulations stated their preemptive savings intent as follows 
xi.preemption 
a.the issuance of these regulations by the faa preempts any state or local law,rule,regulation,order,or standard covering the subject matter of this rule,including but not limited to,drug testing of aviation personnel performing sensitive safety or functions.
b.the issuance of these regulations does not preempt provisions of state criminal law that impose sanctions for reckless conduct of an individual that leads to actual loss of life,injury,or damage to property whether such provisions apply specifically to aviation employees or generally to the public.
pt,app.i and b.the faa regulations have remained for all practical purposes identical since that time.
congress reinforced and confirmed faa authority when,in,it enacted oteta to combat drug and alcohol abuse by individuals employed in the airline industry and,among other things,authorized random drug testing of employees in positions see oteta,stat,codified as amended at.one provision permitted the faa to continu e in effect drug testing regulations further,after minor intervening linguistic amendments,the preemptive section of oteta currently provides 
effect on state and local government laws,regulations,standards,or orders.a state or local government may not prescribe,issue,or continue in effect a law,regulation,standard,or order that is inconsistent with regulations prescribed under this chapter.however,a regulation prescribed under this chapter does not preempt a state criminal law that imposes sanctions for reckless conduct leading to loss of life,injury,or damage to property.a.
together,the statute and regulations confirm the preeminence of faa responsibility over any applicable state regulation.by overriding any state law,regulation,standard,or order that is inconsistent with faa regulations,see a,supra,congress accomplished three things.first,it supported the preemption,where necessary,of state common law negligence claims.see csx,easterwood,d,law,rule,regulation,order,or standard included negligence claims.second,it approved faa authority to issue regulations both before and after oteta was passed,with the sole limitation against preempting certain state criminal laws.further,the narrow savings language implied a broad scope for federal preemption,since an exception for state criminal laws would hardly have seemed necessary if state law were only narrowly preempted.see forsyth barr,cir preemption provisions and savings clauses should be read together without rendering either superfluous 
notwithstanding these indicia of a broad preemptive intent,frank contends that his claims can not have been preempted.he asserts that the statutory language mandates narrower preemption than faa regulations that covering the subject matter,as contained in the regulations,represents a narrow basis for preemption and that his claims are not covered by the faa drug testing regime.we address each of these arguments in turn.
frank statutory argument is simply incorrect.focusing on the provision that preempts any state law found inconsistent with faa regulations,he argues that his claims are not inconsistent with faa drug testing regulations indeed,only a competing regime of drug testing regulations would,in his view,be preempted.what frank misses,however,is that in c,supra,congress expressly included the agency preemption regulations among those that could be continued in effect.this point has been demonstrated above.it is to those regulations that one must turn in order to analyze the scope of preemption.
frank moves to stronger ground when he attributes a narrow preemptive purpose to the covering the subject matter preemption in faa regulations.see pt,app.i,supra.analogous language in the federal railroad safety act of frsa has been held to require a fairly close correspondence between the federal regulations and the preempted state claim.frank relies on two frsa cases from this circuit to support his argument that oteta and faa regulations do not preempt his state law claims.see united transp.union foster,cir rushing kansas city ry,cir.the frsa provision,like that of the faa,prescribes preemption of state law covering the subject matter of federal regulations in foster and rushing,this court applied the supreme court interpretation of that term as requiring federal regulations to substantially subsume the subject matter of the relevant state law for preemption to lie.foster,at quoting csx,easterwood,d,rushing,at same.in applying frsa preemption,this court followed the supreme court in eschew ing broad categories such as railroad safety,focusing instead on the specific subject matter contained in the federal regulation.foster,at citing csx,at.at,d at see also rushing,at same.
this court concluded in both rushing and foster that an frsa regulation covering the sound capacity of audible signaling devices,does not cover or substantially subsume the subject matter of when such devices are sounded.in rushing,this court held that the frsa regulation did not as a matter of law preempt a nuisance claim based on the blowing of train whistles at night,rushing,at and we held in foster that the same frsa regulation did not preempt a louisiana state statute requiring the sounding of an audible signal by train operators at specified locations,foster,at.nevertheless,foster determined that another aspect of the regulations preempted a state statute requiring locomotive engines to be equipped with a signaling device that could be heard at a distance of not less than mile,id.at,and that frsa regulations governing the use of information on event recorders preempted a state statute requiring railroad employees to notify officers investigating train
