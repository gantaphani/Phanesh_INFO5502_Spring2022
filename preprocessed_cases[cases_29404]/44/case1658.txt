plaintiff nelson robles claims that police officers antonio debarros and james rozar violated his state and federal constitutional rights by tying him to a metal pole in a deserted parking lot and abandoning him there for approximately minutes.he seeks damages from the officers and from prince george county,maryland pgc pursuant to,as well as under the maryland constitution and state law for the intentional infliction of emotional distress.the district court granted summary judgment to the officers on the federal claims on the basis of qualified immunity and on the emotional distress claim as a matter of law.a jury found for robles on the state due process claim and awarded compensatory and punitive damages in the amount of.the district court granted a remittitur of the damage awards to,or in the alternative a new trial.robles opted for a new trial limited to the amount of damages and was awarded.
on appeal,defendants contend that the brief restraint of plaintiff was nothing more than a prank that,however misdirected,did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.plaintiff contends in turn that the damages he suffered for this indignity merited far more than the monies he received.the district court and the jury in its final award correctly perceived that the justice of the case lay somewhere in between.for the reasons that follow,we affirm in large part and remand with directions to modify the judgment only to the extent of reversing the award of punitive damages against the county because such damages are impermissible under maryland law.
at approximately on august,pgc police officers antonio debarros,kevin hodge,and james rozar responded to a disorderly conduct noise complaint at an apartment complex in langley park.upon obtaining identification from three men found drinking beer on the premises,the officers arrested nelson robles on an outstanding traffic warrant issued by neighboring montgomery county.
after taking robles into custody,the officers attempted to arrange a prisoner exchange with montgomery county police department.formal custody transfers generally require that the arrested individual be taken to a commissioner in the county where arrested and then transferred by the sheriff department to the county that issued the warrant.because this procedure is time consuming,officers sometimes arrange informal transfers of arrestees at the county line.rozar and debarros requested several times that the montgomery county dispatcher send someone to meet them for such an exchange,but these requests were denied.the officers were told that the montgomery county police department was too busy that evening to spare officers for a transfer.
skeptical of this explanation,rozar and debarros drove robles to the deserted hillandale shopping center parking lot in montgomery county.there they tied robles to a metal pole using three pairs of and left a note at his feet explaining that there were outstanding warrants for him in montgomery county.the officers then drove out of sight of robles and placed a call to the number of the montgomery police department reporting the situation.they did not identify themselves to the operator or disclose the fact that pgc officers had tied robles to the pole.officers from montgomery county arrived approximately to minutes later to untie robles and take him into custody.
on october,robles filed a complaint against rozar,debarros,and pgc alleging violation of his civil rights under both the maryland and constitutions,as well as intentional infliction of emotional distress under state law.the case was removed to federal court in january.the district court then granted defendant motion to bifurcate and stay discovery as to count ix which alleged direct liability against the county for the unlawful seizure pursuant to monell department of social services,d.
defendants filed a motion for summary judgment as to counts i through viii,which the court granted in part and denied in part.specifically,the court held that defendants possessed qualified immunity as to counts,which asserted liability under,but that counts,alleging violation of robles rights under the maryland constitution,survived because maryland law provides no official immunity for state constitutional violations.the court also granted summary judgment to defendants on count i,the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim,because robles could not establish the elements of the tort as a matter of law.
counts were tried to a jury,which returned a verdict in robles favor on the state constitutional due process claim.the jury awarded robles in compensatory and punitive damages.robles filed a motion to alter judgment,or alternatively for a new trial,arguing that the jury verdict was contrary to law because it failed to find,in addition to the state due process violation,that he had been subject to an unconstitutional seizure under maryland law.the court denied the motion following a hearing.robles also filed a motion for reconsideration of the court order granting defendants motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity with regard to the claims.the court denied that motion as well.
the district court subsequently granted defendants motion for remittitur,or in the alternative a new trial,based on excessiveness of the verdict.robles rejected the court remittitur of the award to.the second trial was limited to the issue of damages for the violation of robles state constitutional right to due process.the jury awarded robles in compensatory damages against rozar,debarros,and pgc.it awarded in punitive damages against rozar and in punitive damages against pgc.on may,the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal of the monell claim against pgc.
robles filed a motion to recover his attorneys fees and expenses under.he argued that in view of the jury award in his favor,he was the prevailing party.defendants responded that robles was not the prevailing party for purposes of because he had not succeeded on any of his federal claims.the court agreed with defendants and denied robles motion to award attorney fees.robles appeals.
we begin by considering robles federal constitutional claims.in order to make out a valid claim under,robles must show that the actions of the police officers deprived him of an actual constitutional right and that the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.wilson layne,d.only if both parts of this inquiry are satisfied can robles overcome the defendants assertion of qualified immunity.id.
robles contends that the pgc officers violated his constitutional right to be free from unreasonable seizures.he asserts that b ecause there was no legitimate reason to handcuff him to a pole and abandon him,the manner of his seizure was unreasonable.
the fourth amendment governs claims of excessive force during the course of an arrest,investigatory stop,or other seizure of a person.riley dorton,cir en banc.however,this court has rejected any concept of a continuing seizure rule,noting that the fourth amendment applies to the initial decision to detain an accused,not to the conditions of confinement after that decision has been made.id.at internal citations and punctuation omitted.once the single act of detaining an individual has been accomplished,the amendment ceases to apply.id.
robles acknowledges that the police had probable cause for his arrest.the officers were acting on the basis of an outstanding warrant issued by montgomery county which contained five charges against robles stemming from a vehicular hit and run accident the previous year.robles also admits that rozar and debarros did not use excessive force when they took custody of him.the officers made clear the reason for his arrest,handcuffed him,and placed him in the back of a police cruiser without incident.
thus,by the time robles was brought to montgomery county,his arrest had been completed and the circumstances of that arrest comported with fourth amendment safeguards.robles status at the time of this incident was that of a pretrial detainee,and the fourth amendment does not extend to such situations such a detainee may assert oth
