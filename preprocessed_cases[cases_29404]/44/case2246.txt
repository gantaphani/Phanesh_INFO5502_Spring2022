in this diversity suit,plaintiffs,who are past and present employees and their spouses,allege injuries caused by exposure to carbon monoxide gas in the enclosed freezer section of a distribution center during a period in november and december.one group of original suit within one year of the date of last exposure to the gas,while the other group of new not.in this appeal,the new plaintiffs challenge the district court dismissal of their claims as under the statute of limitations period in kentucky revised statutes annotated.they argue that the district court erred in holding that their claims did not relate back to the filing date of the original plaintiffs claims under rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure,and the discovery rule did not toll the limitations period.we disagree and affirm.
in its appealed order granting summary judgment to defendants unarco material handling,unarco,and atlas material handling,atlas,the district court accurately set forth the relevant facts 
this action arises out of an alleged discharge of carbon monoxide gas in the enclosed freezer section of the distribution center the distribution center in london,kentucky,between november and december.the plaintiffs contend that the work performed in the evenings by atlas and unarco caused the discharge,resulting in the plaintiffs injuries.more specifically,the plaintiffs assert that atlas and unarco acted negligently in operating welders inside the distribution center,resulting in their exposure to carbon monoxide gas.the plaintiffs are all either past or present employees of the distribution center and their spouses.
the plaintiffs initially filed their complaint on november,in the laurel circuit court alleging claims for negligence and loss of consortium.
the defendants then removed the action to this court based upon diversity of citizenship jurisdiction.thereafter,on march,the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint to add plaintiffs to the action.the court granted the motion on july.
subsequently,in november and january,eleven of the plaintiffs filed notices stipulations of voluntary dismissal of their claims.additionally,the court granted atlas and unarco motion for summary judgment as to plaintiff jamie rhodes claim for loss of consortium on may.as a result,only plaintiffs who first asserted their claims in the amended complaint currently remain in this action.they are stephen king,anna mcclure,ricky trent,kathy trent,james helton,jamey hill,chrystal hill,clifford sage,kimberly sage,billy rhodes,danny pittman,gary patterson,bennie swift,sarah swift,david spurlock,elaine spurlock,sean shupe,glenna shupe,stephen bush,lora bush,and dora keley collectively,the new plaintiffs.
in their motions for summary judgment against the new plaintiffs,atlas and unarco contend that any claims asserted for the first time in the amended complaint are barred by kentucky one year statute of limitations,krs.according to atlas and unarco,the new plaintiffs learned of their injuries and had reason to know that any injuries could have been caused by the exposure to carbon monoxide gas in december.therefore,atlas and unarco contend that the statute of limitations expired on their claims in december,and the claims asserted for the first time in the amended complaint in march are.
in response,the new plaintiffs assert that the amended complaint should relate back to the original complaint under federal rule of civil procedure.further,the new plaintiffs contend that,even if the amended complaint does not relate back,the time for filing any claims against atlas and unarco is governed by kentucky discovery rule because the new plaintiffs did not discover the permanent nature and cause of their injuries until.
in granting summary judgment to unarco and atlas,the district court held that the new plaintiffs claims were barred by the statute of limitations period in kentucky revised statutes annotated.in so ruling,the district court rejected the new plaintiffs contentions that their claims related back to the filing date of the original complaint under rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure,and the discovery rule tolled the limitations period.in addition,the district court held that the consortium claims asserted by the new plaintiffs spouses were likewise untimely because they were derivative of the underlying bodily injury claims.
unarco and atlas reached settlements with the original plaintiffs,and the district court dismissed the original plaintiffs claims with prejudice pursuant to the parties january stipulations of dismissal.the new plaintiffs requested reconsideration of the district court previous grant of summary judgment against them,relying upon a more fully developed record,including testimony given at trial,and the transfer of the case to a different district judge.the district court denied the motion for reconsideration.
the new plaintiffs timely appeal the district court amended final judgment in favor of unarco and atlas under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.
the issue presented in this appeal is whether the new plaintiffs claims are barred by kentucky statute of limitations period for personal injury actions.ann.a.the new plaintiffs acknowledge that their motion seeking leave to amend the original complaint to add their claims to the lawsuit and the district court grant of their motion occurred more than one year after the onset of their injuries from carbon monoxide exposure.however,the new plaintiffs attempt to overcome the statute of limitations hurdle in two ways by application of the provisions of rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure and kentucky discovery rule.we give de novo review to the district court grant of summary judgment.longaberger kolt,cir.
the new plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in holding that their claims did not relate back to the original plaintiffs claims under rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.rule c provides,in relevant part 
c relation back of amendments.
when an amendment relates back.an amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when 
a the law that provides the applicable statute of limitations allows relation back 
b the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set attempted to be set the original pleading or 
c the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted,if rule c b is satisfied and if,within the period provided by rule m for serving the summons and complaint,the party to be brought in by amendment 
i received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits and 
ii knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it,but for a mistake concerning the proper party identity.
the parties agree that the question of whether rule c permits relation back of an amendment adding otherwise untimely plaintiffs and their claims to a complaint is an issue of first impression for our circuit.nevertheless,in urging rule c applicability to their claims,the new plaintiffs concede significant ground.they acknowledge that this court has on several occasions made blanket statements to the effect that amendments which add a party to the original suit can not relate back for limitation purposes.undeterred,the new plaintiffs seek to limit that rule to a plaintiff attempt to add a defendant to the action after the statute of limitations has expired,noting that this court prior decisions have addressed only that scenario.the new plaintiffs contend that the considerations are very different when plaintiffs seek to add additional plaintiffs to an existing suit when all of the plaintiffs claims arise out of the same occurrence of which the defendant is already well aware due to the pending lawsuit against it.emphasis added.in that situation,the new plaintiffs maintain,the defendant is not prejudiced by the addition of plaintiffs to the pending action because the lawsuit provided notice that additional plaintiffs might sue,and the defendant is already defending itself from their claims.applie
