this case arises out of a traffic accident involving a vehicle driven by angela dortch and a transportation services,driven by loren fowler.the accident left fowler unhurt,but dortch suffered permanently disabling injuries that caused her to lose all memory of the collision.
dortch alleges that fowler was in her lane when the accident occurred,and that had continued to employ fowler despite his poor driving record.she brought suit against both fowler and,alleging negligent causation on the part of fowler attributable to under the doctrine of respondeat superior and negligent supervision and retention on the part of.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of on the claim,and a jury found for fowler and thus on the underlying negligence claim regarding the cause of the accident.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
the accident occurred on the curve of a narrow highway in louisville,kentucky.rain that day had caused the road to be slick.dortch was driving her sport utility vehicle suv,heading east.fowler was driving a,heading west.the two vehicles collided head on.jolted by the collision,fowler tractor trailer swung sharply to the left,where it crashed into a rock wall on the south side of the highway.dortch suv spun around and came to a stop in the middle of the road,its front left side shattered.
emergency personnel arrived shortly after the accident,followed roughly minutes later by a team of police officers that included louisville policeman clarence beauford,a trained accident reconstructionist.officer beauford and his team interviewed fowler and examined the scene of the accident,taking pictures and inspecting the road,the surrounding area,and the vehicles.beauford did not attempt a full accident reconstruction and did not personally take any measurements.
according to his testimony at trial,officer beauford found a deep gouge in the pavement that ran from the left front wheel of dortch wrecked suv.this large gouge the first gouge traced backward and ended in the lane.mainly relying on this first gouge,office beauford concluded that dortch suv crossed into fowler lane,causing the accident.
some time after the accident,an expert hired by michigan state police officer thomas the highway and the vehicles.he determined that the accident occurred when fowler crossed into dortch lane.bereza based this determination on his discovery of a different gouge in the highway surface,slightly east of the crash site,which was entirely in dortch lane.according to bereza,this gouge the second gouge was created by the accident and marked the actual point where the vehicles first collided.
employed its own experts,including william cloyd iii,to investigate the accident.relying on the photographs of the accident and the highway which had subsequently been repaved,and on his inspection of the vehicles,cloyd concluded that the second gouge was not caused by the collision between fowler and dortch vehicles,opining that the first and second gouges differed in size,depth,color,and direction.at trial,both officer beauford and cloyd testified that the accident happened in fowler lane,as did an additional expert witness,frank entwisle,as well as fowler himself.bereza was the lone occurrence witness called by dortch,and his conclusion that the accident began in dortch lane,based in large part on the second gouge,was criticized by cloyd and entwisle.the jury returned a verdict in favor of both fowler and.
procedural history 
dortch filed suit in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky,and the parties consented to have magistrate judge james moyer preside over the case.jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship pursuant to.
during discovery,dortch learned that fowler had seven prior traffic accidents while driving for.this caused her to request further information about these prior accidents.when refused to comply with the request,dortch filed a motion to compel.the district court ruled that could withhold information about those accidents that did not involve bodily injury or occur on public roadways.as a result,dortch received information on only two of fowler seven prior accidents.
subsequently moved for summary judgment on dortch claim,arguing that dortch lacked enough evidence to proceed,and characterizing fowler undisclosed accidents as involving nothing more than the loading and unloading of cargo.in response,dortch cited the two accidents that had revealed,as well as internal rating of fowler driver safety as marginal,the lowest rating given by the company.gave fowler this rating four months before the accident with dortch.dortch again requested discovery of fowler undisclosed prior accidents.after rejecting this request,the court granted summary judgment to on dortch claim.
before trial,in an effort to disprove bereza assertion that the second gouge was created by the accident between dortch and fowler,researched the history of all reported accidents in the area of the collision,hoping to find evidence of a previous crash that had caused the second gouge.discovered reports on a number of accidents in the area,but could find no conclusive evidence that the second gouge predated the accident.as a result,filed a motion in limine to exclude its failure to find evidence that the second gouge was there before the accident,arguing that the negative result of its research was irrelevant.over dortch objection,the district court granted the motion,preventing dortch from witnesses about its research.
the district court,on the other hand,denied a motion in limine filed by dortch that sought to prevent the introduction of officer beauford accident report.dortch argued that other evidence in the case showed that the facts as set forth in the report were untrustworthy and that its conclusions were unreliable.this report was admitted into evidence at trial.
the jury returned a verdict in favor of fowler and on dortch claim of negligent causation.this appeal followed.

evidentiary rulings 
admissibility of research on the origin of the second gouge 
the trial boiled down to whether the accident occurred in dortch or fowler lane of travel.central to that inquiry is whether either of the two gouges one in each lane was caused by the underlying accident.presented persuasive evidence that the first gouge in fowler lane of travel was caused by the accident,and therefore dortch was at fault for crossing over the dividing line and causing the accident.dortch countered with her own expert who testified that the second gouge in her lane was caused by the underlying accident.in an effort to discredit dortch expert,undertook an extensive search of past accident records in the hopes of finding some evidence of a past accident that might have caused the second gouge.it failed to find any such evidence to corroborate its theory.
dortch now challenges the district court evidentiary ruling precluding her from witnesses about the absence of record evidence corroborating its theory that a previous accident caused the second gouge.we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in preventing dortch from pursuing this line of questioning because it was relevant to a central issue at trial.nonetheless,we find that the error was harmless.
the standard for relevancy is extremely liberal under the federal rules of evidence.see united states whittington,cir.evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.just as positive evidence of a past accident that could have created the second gouge would have been admissible as tending to support had such evidence been found,the absence of any such evidence in the accident records makes it less likely that the second gouge predated the underlying accident in this case.put another way,the absence of any past accident record is exactly what you would expect to find if dortch theory that the gouge was caused by this accident is correct.although it may not be very strong evidence,it is certainly some evidence in dortch favor.she therefore should have been permitted to inquire about it under rule.
counters that e vidence of this type could hardly establish that it was more probable than not that the second gouge preexisted the dortch accident or who crossed the center line first.this argument,however,mistakenly conflates the standard for evidentiary sufficiency with the rule standard for relevance.there is no doubt that fruitless records search,standing alone,does not make it more probable than not that either party crossed the center line first.but a piece of evidence does not need to carry a party evidentiary burden in order to be relevant it simply has to advance the ball.as one leading commentator has explained 
it is enough if the item could reasonably show that a fact is slightly more probable than it would appear without that evidence.even after the probative force of the evidence is spent,the proposition for which it is offered still can seem quite improbable.thus,the common objection that the inference for which the fact is offered does not necessarily follow is untenable.it poses a standard of conclusiveness that very few single items of circumstantial evidence could ever meet.a brick is not a wall.
edward cleary et,mccormick on evidence,at.
as this court has previously noted,the mosaic of evidence that comprises the record before a jury includes both the evidence and the lack of evidence on material matters.united states poindexter,cir emphasis in original.in poindexter,a criminal defendant wanted to tell the jury that a government fingerprint expert dusted a drug container for prints but did not find any of defendant prints.the government objected that the absence of the defendant fingerprints on the drug container was not conclusive either way,and the trial court sustained the objection,commenting it did prove that your client did handle them.id.at.this court concluded that the trial court had abused its discretion in excluding this line of inquiry 
the legitimacy of the inference defendant counsel wished to bring to the jury absence of evidence of defendant fingerprints on an article containing contraband that had been dusted for fingerprints and which defendant was charged with not depend upon the conclusiveness of the inference.neither did it depend upon the necessity that it prove anything,merely that it had the tendency to do so.
we note the importance of distinguishing the present searched the accident records and found nothing to corroborate its preexisting a hypothetical case where nobody searched the accident records.if there had been no investigation and we knew nothing about the records of past accidents,then that fact would support neither party.it would be irrelevant under rule.here,we do know something about the accident records.we know they are extensive and document numerous past accidents on the roadway in question,yet reveal no evidence of a past accident that caused the second gouge.because they do not corroborate theory that the gouge was preexisting,the records provide some evidence for dortch conclusion that the gouge was not preexisting.
although we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in precluding dortch from inquiring about the absence of record evidence supporting theory by ruling that the evidence was irrelevant,we find that the error was harmless.we will reverse the district court only if we find that the abuse of discretion caused more than harmless error.tompkin philip morris usa,cir.even if a mistake has been made regarding the admission or exclusion of evidence,a new trial will not be granted unless the evidence would have caused a different outcome at trial.morales am.honda motor,cir.
in the present case,the fact that could find no record of an incident creating the second gouge is of little probative value.the part of the highway where the accident occurred runs through the city of louisville,a major metropolitan area,and is undoubtedly used by hundreds of thousands of vehicles a year,including large vehicles like,snow plows,and construction equipment.many,if not most,incidents that damage such roadways likely go unreported.
also,there was absolutely nothing preventing dortch from presenting her own witness to speak to the record evidence.if the record evidence was really all that probative,dortch could have put her own investigator on the stand to explain the lack of records supporting theory that the gouge was preexisting.that dortch did not feel compelled or even think to take this approach speaks volumes about how unimportant she really believed this evidence to be.this was a trial with numerous experts and extensive testimony regarding the physical evidence.the absence of a record documenting a previous accident,while marginally relevant,has too little weight to raise any likelihood that it would have affected the jury verdict.we therefore will not reverse the district court on this basis.
admissibility of officer beauford police report 
dortch next contends that the district court erred by admitting officer beauford police report into evidence pursuant to the hearsay exception in rule b of the federal rules of evidence.rule allows for the admission of public records and reports,including matters observed pursuant to duty imposed by law as to which matters there was a duty to report unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.
dortch claims that the police report was untrustworthy because officer beauford could have gone further in analyzing the scene of the accident,because the report mainly relies on fowler version of the events,and because both parties agree that some of the facts to which officer beauford testified contradict the report conclusions.she also contends that the district court erred by allowing officer beauford to testify as an expert witness.
fowler and characterize the officer report quite differently.although both admit that the report is inconsistent with one part of officer beauford testimony,they argue that the overall report is trustworthy and its facts and conclusions are accurate.
in analyzing whether officer beauford report lacked trustworthiness,the district court turned to the nonexhaustive list of factors provided in the advisory committee notes to rule.these factors include the timeliness of the investigation,the special skill or experience of the official,whether a hearing was held and the level at which it was conducted,and possible motivation problems.advisory committee notes internal citations omitted see also miller field,cir applying these factors to affirm the admission of police reports regarding an alleged rape baker elcona homes,cir applying these factors to affirm the admission of a police report regarding a traffic accident.the district court concluded that three of these four factors all but whether a hearing was held weighed in favor of the report trustworthiness,and that any discrepancies could be addressed through the of officer beauford.
we find no error in the district court analysis of this issue.to begin with,rule b is directly applicable to this case.officer beauford clearly had a legal duty,as a police officer investigating the accident,to issue a report.the issue then becomes whether his report lacked trustworthiness.and the factors listed in the advisory committee notes and used in miller and baker indicate that the report was trustworthy.see ba
