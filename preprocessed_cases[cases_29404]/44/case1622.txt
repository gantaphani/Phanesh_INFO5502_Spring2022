this appeal concerns insurers liability for bodily injuries.the intervenors appeal from the district court decision adopting what is called the rule of mayor city council of baltimore utica mutual insurance,and holding that the intervenors claims are subject to an aggregate limit by reason of the completed operations provisions of the insurance policies.we affirm.
the intervenors in this case are four former employees or personal representatives of former employees of the bethlehem steel plant located in baltimore,maryland.the intervenors claim that they were injured by asbestos that was installed by wallace gale company.wallace gale was an insulation contractor that installed products for different businesses including bethlehem steel.in the early,wallace gale halted its use of products due to safety and health concerns.wallace gale filed for bankruptcy in,and numerous claimants,including the intervenors,have filed proofs of claim against wallace gale for injuries.
during the time it installed products,wallace gale purchased comprehensive general liability insurance policies and excess liability insurance policies from the following insurers,aetna casualty surety company,now known as travelers casualty surety company travelers hartford accident and indemnity company hartford paul fire and marine insurance company granite state insurance company granite continental casualty company continental riunione adriatica di sicurta riunione and new hampshire insurance company new hampshire ja,under the plan adopted by the bankruptcy court,the proceeds from the insurance policies will be used to fund a trust to handle asbestos injury claims filed against wallace gale.the amount that the insurers will be required to contribute to the trust depends on the interpretation of the insurance contracts and the outcome of this litigation.
in,travelers filed a declaratory judgment action,by way of an adversary proceeding within the chapter bankruptcy case of wallace gale against wallace gale,the mayor and city council of baltimore,and wallace gale other insurers.travelers sought a judicial determination of the applicability and extent of coverage of insurance policies issued by wallace gale insurers.through this action,travelers sought to determine the extent of its liability,and the liability of other wallace gale insurers,in a lawsuit brought against wallace gale by the mayor and city council of baltimore.
in march of,the intervenors moved to intervene in the declaratory judgment action.the district court granted the motion.before disposition of the claims of the intervenors,the claims brought by the mayor and city council of baltimore settled.the intervenors first amended complaint of december,raised two issues that are the subject of this appeal.in their first amended complaint,the plaintiffs raised the first issue by seeking a declaration 
t hat each policy triggered has an obligation to defend and indemnify wallace gale for the full value of each individual claimant damages subject only to the per person and per occurrence limits of those policies.
by seeking this declaration,the intervenors contended that the insurers are liable for all sums that are payable on asbestos claims for which wallace gale is liable.second,the intervenors asserted that their claims are not subject to the aggregate limit of the policies under the general liability,negligence or other claims provisions in the policies.we may refer to these two issues as the all sums or allocation issue and the completed operations issue in this opinion.
in response,the wallace gale insurers argued that they are only liable under the comprehensive general liability insurance policies to pay for bodily injury that occurs during the policy period.under this pro rata argument,the wallace gale insurers would be liable only for a pro rata portion of the bodily injury that occurred during the time each insurer policy was in place.for any bodily injury occurring during a time when the insured was or when the insured policy contained,for example,an exclusion for the type of injury suffered by the intervenors,the insured would bear the risk of liability.on the completed operations issue,the wallace gale insurers asserted that any injuries that occurred after wallace gale completed its installation work with asbestos were subject to the aggregate limits of the policies under the completed operations hazard clauses in the policies.
in march of,the intervenors filed a motion for summary judgment,and the wallace gale insurers countered with a cross motion for summary judgment in april of.the district court held a hearing on the motions for summary judgment on june.by their summary judgment motions,the parties sought a judicial determination of whether,as a matter of law,the wallace gale insurers exposure to the claims of the intervenors was limited by either the pro rata allocation of liability or the aggregate limits of liability triggered by the completed operations clauses in the insurance contracts.the district court took the motions under advisement at the conclusion of the hearing.
in february of,the district court issued its opinion on the motions for summary judgment.see aetna cas.sur.wallace gale in re wallace gale.the district court noted that maryland had yet to speak definitively to the question of allocation and,accepting for argument that,in its opinion,both the wallace gale insurers and the plaintiffs presented reasonable readings to the language of the policies,determined that the tie must go in favor of the insured,meaning the intervenors.the district court held 
that if a claimant was initially exposed to asbestos while wallace gale was on the job,the insurer whose policy was in place at that time and each insurer thereafter will be obliged to pay all sums wallace gale becomes legally obligated to pay that claimant as damages.consequently,there will be no pro rata allocation nor any allocation to wallace gale for any period of the progressive damage during which it may have lacked insurance.
turning to the completed operations issue,the district court agreed with the wallace gale insurers that the claims of bethlehem steel workers who were exposed initially to asbestos after wallace gale completed asbestos installation would be subject to the aggregate liability limits of the insurance policies.
if a claimant initial exposure occurred while wallace gale was still conducting operations,policies in effect at that time will not be subject to any aggregate limit.if,however,initial exposure is shown to have occurred after operations were concluded or if exposure that began during operations continued after operations were complete,then the aggregate limits of any policy that came into effect after operations were complete will apply.where a given claimant falls within this framework will have to be considered on a basis.
as a result,the insurers who issued general liability policies to wallace gale for time periods wholly after wallace gale completed its asbestos installation work will only be liable to the extent of the aggregate limit contained in the policy.at.policies issued to wallace gale for time periods in which wallace gale was installing asbestos will not be subject to the aggregate limit of liability contained in the policies.in sum,the district court granted the intervenors motion for summary judgment as to the allocation issue and granted travelers motion for summary judgment as to the completed operations issue.at.
the district court filed its decision on february.in its ruling,the district court also denied a motion for summary judgment filed by travelers in which travelers argued that insufficient evidence existed as a matter of law to prove that travelers did issue comprehensive general liability insurance policies to wallace gale for the years to.see in re wallace gale,at.the case proceeded to a bench trial on this issue of the lost policies for the years to.after a bench trial,the district court decided that there was sufficient evidence to enforce the travelers policies for the years.
based on the district court decision that the policies for the years to were enforceable,travelers filed a motion for leave to file a or,in the alternative,a complaint against liberty mutual insurance company on june.the theory behind travelers motion was that the district court had previously decided that there was insufficient evidence to enforce policies issued to wallace gale by liberty mutual for the years to which had been lost over the years.travelers argued that the evidence which supported the district court conclusion that travelers to policies could be enforced was essentially equivalent to evidence which should support the conclusion that the to liberty mutual policies should be enforced.travelers contended that even if it might be liable for defense costs and indemnity costs for bodily injuries for the years,liberty mutual should contribute its share to the defense and indemnity costs incurred by the other insurers.
during the time this case was awaiting a resolution on travelers motion,the maryland court of special appeals on july,issued its ruling in mayor city council of baltimore utica mutual insurance.in utica mutual,the court of special appeals adopted as the law of maryland the pro rata allocation theory advanced by travelers.see at.the utica mutual court held 
that the obligation to indemnify the insured under the circumstances of this case,which involves continuing asbestos product property damage,is to be prorated among all carriers based on their time on the risk,the joint and several or all sums allocation method is incompatible with the trigger that is applicable to the case at bar,an insured who elects not to carry liability insurance for a period of time,either by electing to be,or by purchasing a policy which withholds coverage pursuant to a particular exclusion,as in the case of the products hazard exclusions found in this case,will be liable for the prorated share that corresponds to periods of or no coverage 
at.travelers asked the district court to reconsider its february,ruling adopting the all sums allocation approach in light of the decision of the maryland court of special appeals in utica mutual.
on september,the district court granted travelers motion to reconsider the district court ruling on the allocation issue.see aetna cas.sur.wallace gale,in re wallace gale.the district court concluded that the court of special appeals opinion in utica mutual governed the dispute over allocation between the plaintiffs and travelers and determined that no persuasive data had been offered to demonstrate that the maryland court of appeals would reach a decision contrary to the utica mutual opinion.at.applying utica mutual,the district court adopted the pro rata allocation approach and concluded that wallace gale will be responsible for a prorated share for any period in which it may have been uninsured.at.other than the allocation issue,the district court did not reconsider any other issues covered in the february,opinion.at.
also on september,the district court determined that travelers motion for leave to file a or,in the alternative,a complaint against liberty mutual was moot.under the allocation method,travelers would not be liable for any bodily injuries that occurred during a period of time when it did not provide comprehensive general liability insurance to wallace gale.
the district court issued its final order of judgment on october.the district court denied the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment.the district court granted travelers motion for summary judgment on the allocation issue and adopted the pro rata allocation analysis embraced by the maryland court of special appeals in utica mutual.the district court also ordered that insurance policies in effect in whole or part while wallace gale was engaged in the asbestos installation operation during which the claimant was exposed shall not be subject to aggregate limits as set forth in the policies.bodily injury claims brought by claimants exposed to asbestos after wallace gale completed its asbestos installation operations shall be subject to the aggregate limits of insurance policies in effect wholly after wallace gale halted asbestos installation operations.
the intervenors appeal from the district court final order denying their motion for summary judgment,granting travelers motion for summary judgment,and granting travelers motion for reconsideration.we have jurisdiction to entertain the appeal of the intervenors from denial of their motion for summary judgment under monahan county of chesterfield,virginia,cir.
we review de novo the district court order awarding summary judgment.see state auto prop.cas.ins.travelers indem.of,cir.we construe the facts of the case in the light most favorable to the party.at.summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c.we should uphold an award of summary judgment if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.celotex catrett,d.
the remainder of this opinion must be set against the maryland requirement for causation of damages in such asbestos personal injury cases,as is set forth in the opinion of the district court 
maryland courts have held that injury begins with exposure,carries forward while the asbestos fibers are in residence and continues through to manifestation of the disease.the parties,moreover,have stipulated that it can not be said with certainty when injury actually occurs or to what degree.quite possibly,therefore,actual injury could occur in whole or part during any one or more policy periods,including those coming after wallace gale completed its operations.
in re wallace gale.it is at once apparent that the definition employed by the district court included the stipulation of the parties,a part of which follows 
bodily injury and disease caused by asbestos,including cancers and diseases,are the cause of a cumulative process that begins immediately upon initial inhalation of asbestos fibers,continues while the asbestos fibers remain in residence inside the body and continues through the manifestation of the disease.
turning first to the allocation or all sums issue,however the same may be called,the parties agree on the policy language from the general comprehensive liability policies that applies to the question of allocation.the language of the standard form general comprehensive liability insurance policies purchased by wallace gale from until is similar 
the company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of 
bodily injury or 
property damage 
to which this insurance applies,caused by an occurrence 
in their brief,the intervenors use the travelers policy from as the model for the remaining policies.
the travelers policy language is cited above.under the policy,bodily injury is defined as 
bodily injury,sickness or disease sustained by any person which occurs during the policy period,including death at any time resulting therefrom.
occurrence is defined as 
an accident,including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions,which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.
under this policy language,the intervenors contend that 
the insuring agreement and the definitions show that for those claims against wallace gale that trigger insurance coverage because at least some portion of the claimant bodily injury happened during the policy period,the p olicies insuring agreements promise insurance coverage for wallace gale total liability all sums whether or not some portion of the bodily injury continues past the policy period.
because this case is an adversary proceeding brought under the bankruptcy jurisdiction,as a case arising out of or related to the chapter bankruptcy of wallace gale,the rule which we apply in ascertainment of the law to be applied with respect to the various positions of the parties to this appeal is that expressed in butner united states,d in which the court,in a bankruptcy case with respect to the determination of property rights concerning a north carolina mortgage,reasoned that 
apart from these provisions none applicable here,however,congress has generally left the determination of property rights in the assets of a bankrupt estate to state law.at.
the court continued 
property interests are created and defined by state law.unless some federal interest requires some different result,there is no reason why such interests should be analyzed differently simply because an interested party is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding.at.
to quote a little out of context,but with the meaning of the court intact the basic federal rule is that state law governs.at.
the property interests involved here are the rights of the insurance companies to have their obligations for payment ascertained and,as well,the rights of the intervenors to have their claims against the bankrupt estate considered for payment and satisfaction.the intervenors right to collect for bodily injuries from the insurance companies is regulated under maryland statute,and,as well,we safely assume at least some,even if not all,of their claims for personal injury arise under state law,as illustrated by the fact the ascertainment of causation of asbestos injuries is admittedly under maryland law.
while butner was decided under the provisions of the bankruptcy act,which has been superceded by the bankruptcy code,butner holding has also been applied to cases decided under the bankruptcy code.and the cases following butner are quite on point with the fact situation present in the case at hand.cases in this circuit on point with a determination of property interest by application of state law follow in re merritt dredging,cir interest of the bankrupt in the charter party of a barge gray snyder,cir bankrupt obligation to support under north carolina law of america pappas,cir claims under virginia law of a chapter bankrupt corporation in re ballard,cir entireties interest in realty of surviving spouses american bankers ins.of florida maness,cir debtors homeowners insurance policy in re dameron,cir interest of a debtor trustee in the corpus of his trust in re shearin,cir interest of a debtor in a law firm in re moffett,cir interest of a chapter debtor in a repossessed used honda auto.
no federal interest has been suggested to us or has come to our attention which requires some different result.butner,at.so the law of maryland is the applicable law we apply in this case.
as noted,on february,the district court filed its opinion adopting the all sums theory of the case sought by the intervenors,in re wallace gale.on july,however,the maryland court of special appeals,in mayor and city council of baltimore utica mutual insurance company,an asbestos case,adopted the theory of a pro rata allocation by time on the risk,as advocated here by travelers,and rejected the all sums theory advocated by the intervenors.on september,the district court corrected its february,decision,and followed utica mutual in in re wallace gale.it is from those decisions that the intervenors appeal,the principal ground of their appeal being the correctness of that decision adopting the theory by time on the risk as the law of maryland.other than the question of allocation,the decision of february,was not changed.
the intervenors object to the adoption of utica mutual on a number of grounds.
the first objection is that the maryland court of appeals had granted a petition for certiorari in the utica mutual case itself,but the petition for certiorari was not acted upon because the parties settled the case prior to decision.that same reason for not following a decision of the maryland court of special appeals was considered by this court in assicurazioni generali,neil,cir,when the question on appeal was the same as here,whether to follow a decision of the maryland court of special appeals.this court,in that case,followed the court of special appeals,quoting west v.at t.deciding that 
w here an intermediate appellate state court rests its considered judgment upon the rule of law which it announces,that is a datum for ascertaining state law which is not to be disregarded by a federal court unless it is convinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.at 
assicurazioni decided that the grant of certiorari by the maryland court of appeals under the same circumstances present here did not constitute persuasive data that the maryland court of appeals would choose not to follow the decision of the intermediate appellate court.the district court,in assicurazioni,had also relied on what it called common sense or what ought to be the law.we held that those reasons also did not constitute persuasive data permitting us to ignore the holding of the maryland court of special appeals.we equate those last reasons as there phrased by the district court to the argument made here by intervenors,that a majority of the states have adopted the rule of all sums rather than the pro rata rule.the opposite claim as to a majority is made by the insurers.which view is the numerical majority is a matter we need not decide.
assicurazioni held that a federal court can depart from an intermediate court fully reasoned holding as to state law only if convinced that the state highest court would not follow that holding.assicurazioni,at.in that respect,the intervenors also argue that the case of mitchell maryland casualty,is contrary to utica mutual and indicates that the court of appeals would not follow the pro rata rule of utica mutual.mitchell was an asbestos bodily injury case with respect to the triggering of insurance coverage under a comprehensive general liability policy similar to those involved here.the trial court in that case held that insurance coverage was provided only after an injury had become manifest,which holding was reversed,the court stating that defense and indemnification of the insured is triggered upon exposure to the insured asbestos products during the policy period by a person who suffers bodily injury and that the insurance company should indemnify the asbestos contractor for any judgment rendered against it,or which it may have become legally obligated to pay,in connection with the claims.we do not read the triggering requirement of exposure during the policy period or an obligation to indemnify on account of legal obligation to pay as inconsistent with utica mutual.indeed,in the case of bausch lomb utica mutual,the court construed a liability policy in which the insurance company was obligated to pay on behalf of bausch lomb all sums which bausch lomb might become legally obligated to pay as damages on account of property damage.bausch lomb had a waste disposal system consisting of settling tanks,an unlined earthen lagoon,a holding tank,three large drywells and a network of pipe.this waste disposal system,acceptable in industrial practices at the time of its installation,nevertheless leaked contaminants which contained certain heavy metals.this leaking and the damage to other property owners took place at least until,and at issue in the case were four insurance policies for the years through which contained an endorsement substantially limiting any liability for those years.bausch lomb claimed that the policies merely required it to show that some property damage took place during the policy periods at issue.the trial court concluded that technology was not available to ascertain the damage to bausch lomb own property during the applicable period and so awarded damages for the entire period of years to bausch lomb.the court of appeals,however,held that the trial court decision,that technology was not available,was not supported by the evidence.it therefore remanded the case to the trial court for the parties to introduce evidence as to the amount of property damage which fell within the period of policy coverage.while the question presented in that case was not exactly the same as the issue here,it is similar and is an indication to us that the time on the risk decision of the court of special ap
