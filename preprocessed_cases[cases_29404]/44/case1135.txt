after appellant james mccutchen suffered a serious automobile accident,a benefit plan administered by airways paid for his medical expenses.mccutchen then recovered from third parties,with the assistance of counsel.then airways,which had not sought to enforce its subrogation rights,demanded reimbursement of the entire it had paid without allowance for mccutchen legal costs,which had reduced his net recovery to less than the amount it demanded.us airways filed this suit against mccutchen for appropriate equitable relief pursuant to a of the employee retirement income security act of,as amended erisa,a b.the issue before us is whether mccutchen may assert certain equitable limitations,such as unjust enrichment,on airways equitable claim.we conclude that he may.we therefore vacate the district court order requiring mccutchen to pay airways the entire and remand the case for that court to fashion appropriate equitable relief.
this case stems from a tragic car accident in which a young driver lost control of her car,crossed the median of the road,and struck a car driven by year old james mccutchen.then the truck traveling behind mccutchen also slammed into his car.the accident killed one person and left two others with severe brain injuries.mccutchen himself was grievously injured and survived only after emergency surgery.he spent several months in physical therapy and ultimately underwent a complete hip replacement.since the accident,mccutchen,who had a history of back surgeries and associated chronic pain,has also become unable to effectively treat that pain with medication.the accident has rendered him functionally disabled.mccutchen health benefit plan the plan,administered and by airways,paid medical expenses in the amount of on his behalf.
after the accident,mccutchen,through his attorneys at rosen louik perry,filed an action against the driver of the car that caused the accident.because she had limited insurance coverage,and because three other people were seriously injured or killed,mccutchen settled with the other driver for only.however,with his lawyers assistance,he and his wife received another in underinsured motorist coverage for a total recovery of.after paying a contingency attorneys fee and expenses,his net recovery was less than.us airways demanded reimbursement for the entire that it had paid for mccutchen medical bills.soon after,rosen louik perry placed in a trust account,reasoning that any lien found to be valid would have to be reduced by a proportional amount of legal costs.the record on appeal does not establish what amount was disbursed to mccutchen.
when mccutchen did not pay,airways,in its capacity as administrator of the erisa benefits plan,filed suit in the district court under a of erisa,seeking appropriate equitable relief in the form of a constructive trust or an equitable lien on the held in trust and the remaining personally from mccutchen.the summary plan description describing the airways benefits plan covering mccutchen contained the following paragraph,entitled subrogation and right of reimbursement 
the purpose of the plan is to provide coverage for qualified expenses that are not covered by a third party.if the plan pays benefits for any claim you incur as the result of negligence,willful misconduct,or other actions of a third party,the plan will be subrogated to all your rights of recovery.you will be required to reimburse the plan for amounts paid for claims out of any monies recovered from a third party,including,but not limited to,your own insurance company as the result of judgment,settlement,or otherwise.in addition you will be required to assist the administrator of the plan in enforcing these rights and may not negotiate any agreements with a third party that would undermine the subrogation rights of the plan.
app emphasis added.thus,under the plan description,a beneficiary is required to reimburse the plan for any amounts it has paid out of any monies the beneficiary recovers from a third party.

mccutchen says that it would be unfair and inequitable to reimburse airways in full when he has not been fully compensated for his injuries,including pain and suffering.he argues that airways,which made no contribution to his attorneys fees and expenses,would be unjustly enriched if it were now permitted to recover from him without any allowance for those costs,in essence to reap what mccutchen has sown.indeed,if legal costs are not taken into account,airways will effectively be reaching into its beneficiary pocket,putting him in a worse position than if he had not pursued a recovery at all.
citing the plan use of the language any monies recovered,as well as our previous decisions,the district court rejected mccutchen arguments and granted summary judgment to airways.the court required mccutchen to sign over the held in trust and to pay from his own funds.mccutchen appeals
