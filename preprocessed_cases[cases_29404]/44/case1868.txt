appellants heath knight and thomas ingerman appeal the district court summary judgment ruling for appellees kirby inland marine and related companies.for the following reasons,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
heath knight began working for kirby inland marine kirby in.knight worked as a tankerman between and.during his time as a tankerman with kirby,he was exposed to various toxic chemicals,including benzene.knight learned that he had hodgkins lymphoma in.he underwent chemotherapy and made a full recovery.his cancer has been in remission since,and his primary physician opined that it is unlikely to recur.
thomas ingerman began working for one of the defendants,hollywood marine,kirby,in.ingerman worked as a tankerman for hollywood marine during the years.during his time as a tankerman for hollywood marine,ingerman was exposed to various toxic chemicals,including benzene.during this time,ingerman underwent routine benzene physicals.the tests never revealed an abnormal buildup of benzene.in,ingerman was diagnosed with bladder cancer following a persistent bladder infection.
knight and ingerman appellants filed a toxic tort suit in in federal district court under the jones act.pursuant to their suit,appellants hired barry levy,a highly qualified epidemiologist and physician.in,the district court held a daubert hearing to determine whether levy testimony was admissible on the issue of whether appellants exposure to chemicals while working as tankermen for defendants caused knight hodgkin lymphoma and ingerman bladder cancer.
levy testified that benzene was the cause of knight and ingerman cancers,and he relied on over fifty studies for this conclusion.for various reasons,the district court excluded all of the studies offered by levy.the court found that most of the studies relied on by levy failed to isolate benzene as a cause of cancer.the court found other studies statistically insignificant,concluding that levy testimony failed to satisfy daubert.later,the court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants.
subsequently,appellants filed a motion for cost reimbursement under fed.civ.b a and c,which allows a party to recover discovery costs relating to expert witnesses.the district court refused to grant all of appellants requested costs.the district court also denied appellants request that defendants pay for all expenses they incurred in securing levy testimony at the daubert hearing,totaling,holding that no right to reimbursement for daubert costs existed under b c.
appellants appeal the district court summary judgment ruling,which resulted from the exclusion of levy testimony,as well as its determinations regarding discovery and daubert costs.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court determination of admissibility of expert evidence under daubert for abuse of discretion.pipitone biomatrix,cir citing kumho tire carmichael,d.a trial court abuses its discretion when its ruling is based on an erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.bocanegra vicmar,cir.if this court finds an abuse of discretion in admitting or excluding evidence,we review the error under the harmless error doctrine,affirming the judgment,unless the ruling affected substantial rights of the complaining party.id.
in daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,the supreme court delineated certain factors to assist courts in evaluating the foundation of a given expert testimony,though the court carefully emphasized the nonexhaustive nature of the listing.daubert,at.daubert suggested that a trial judge consider whether the theory or technique the expert employs is generally accepted whether the theory has been subjected to peer review and publication whether the theory can and has been tested whether the known or potential rate of error is acceptable and whether there are standards controlling the technique operation.id.
the district court based its exclusion of levy testimony on several findings.the district court acknowledged that levy methodology was unassailable,but found deficiencies in the underlying data,namely the various studies and articles levy relied upon for his research conclusions.
iii.discussion 
general causation is whether a substance is capable of causing a particular injury or condition in the general population,while specific causation is whether a substance caused a particular individual injury.merrell dow,havner.evidence concerning specific causation in toxic tort cases is admissible only as a to admissible evidence.see raynor merrell.thus,there is a process in examining the admissibility of causation evidence in toxic tort cases.first,the district court must determine whether there is general causation.second,if it concludes that there is admissible evidence,the district court must determine whether there is admissible evidence.see cano everest minerals,d.
appellants hired levy to provide testimony as to both general causation and specific causation.finding that levy testimony regarding general causation lacked the necessary foundation to withstand daubert scrutiny,the district court concluded it was unnecessary to determine whether his specific causation testimony was admissible.appellants challenge and we review the district court determination regarding general causation for abuse of discretion.
therefore,the fundamental question underlying levy testimony and our assessment of the district court determination is whether the chemicals knight and ingerman were exposed to and the type of exposures they experienced cause hodgkin lymphoma and bladder cancer general causation.if the district court properly determined that levy testimony regarding general causation was inadmissible under daubert and fed.evid,then there would be no need to consider whether knight and ingerman exposures actually caused their respective illnesses specific causation.see miller pfizer,cir.
appellants argue that the district court set too high a bar for their general causation evidence.specifically,appellants take issue with the district court exclusion of all the cohort and nonspecific studies relied on by levy.
appellants point to the olsson study,which concluded that exposure to organic solvents may constitute an occupational risk with regard to hodgkins as an example of reliable and admissible evidence for general causation.see hakan olsson and lars brandt,occupational exposure and hodgkin disease in men,scand.environ.healthh.
the daubert standard ensures that the proffered evidence is both reliable and relevant.daubert,at.reliability is determined by assessing whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid.id.at.relevance depends upon whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.id.at.here,appellants focus on the district court determination regarding the relevant prong.
studies are not per se inadmissible evidence on general causation.see mcneil wyeth,cir.nonetheless,we can not say that it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to conclude that the reasoning and methodology of the studies relied on for levy general causation testimony could not be applied to the facts at issue here.for example,the olsson study,which levy relied on for his testimony on hodgkin lymphoma,measured exposure to organic solvents among men diagnosed with the disease.the men were employed in over ten different occupations,including painting,photography,and.additionally,the study contained a control group of patients,which was composed of referents selected from the swedish census.although the control group did include three shipyard workers,those three workers were exposed,on average,for ten years to a variety of organic solvents,including many knight was not exposed to,and none of the three developed hodgkin lymphoma.knight,who worked as a tankerman for only one year,does not allege the type of exposure,either in terms of the chemicals involved or the length of exposure,experienced by shipyard workers in the olsson study.thus,the olsson study does not appear to be very relevant to knight claim.we can not say that the district court evaluation of the evidenc
