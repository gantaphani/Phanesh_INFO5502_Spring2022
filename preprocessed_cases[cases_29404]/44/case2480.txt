sergeants in the memphis police department brought suit against the city of memphis for engaging in discriminatory promotions in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of.the district court found that the city written,the test against candidates.in the remedy phase,the court promoted the sergeants to lieutenant and awarded back pay.the court also awarded attorney fees and stayed enforcement of its judgment pending this appeal.the city appeals the district court finding of discrimination,choice of remedy,and award of attorney fees the sergeants,on,contest the stay.
in july of,one hundred twenty sergeants competed for promotion to lieutenant.of those,were black and were white.the city informed the candidates that the promotional process would consist of four components a written test,a practical exercise test,performance evaluations for the previous two years,and seniority points.these four components would account for twenty percent,fifty percent,twenty percent,and ten percent,respectively,of each candidate total score.those who passed the written test would proceed to the next three components those who did not pass would not be invited to continue in the process.the city also informed the candidates that it would create a list,in descending order,of the candidates total scores,and would make promotions based on the ranking of the total scores.
the written test was developed by a private consultant and managed by an industrial psychologist,mark jones,who also developed the city written test for the promotions.in developing the test,jones relied on the assistance of memphis police officers who were identified as having expertise in their profession.jones provided the officers with training on how to construct a good test item,and the officers drafted items for questions by identifying what knowledge is necessary to performing an identified set of tasks as a lieutenant.jones then created the questions and had the group of officers critique them for plausibility and reliability.together,they estimated the percentage of minimally qualified candidates who could answer the questions correctly in order to impose a cutoff score.
this case arises from the city use of the cutoff score,which has some relevant history.long before the written test was developed,the city entered into a memorandum of understanding with the police department,in which it was agreed that in order to be eligible for promotion to lieutenant,a candidate must achieve a passing score of seventy on a written job knowledge test.despite this agreement,jones did not use or recommend using a cutoff score in the written test.consequently,after the exam was administered,the police officers union filed a grievance against jones,alleging that he violated the memorandum of understanding.based on his experience in,jones used the cutoff score in and failed all candidates who scored below seventy on the written test.
as a result,not enough minority candidates in proportion to nonminority candidates passed the test.this result violated the equal employment opportunity commission rule.the rule,found at d,provides 
a selection rate for any race,sex,or ethnic group which is less than or eighty percent of the rate for the group with the highest rate will generally be regarded by the federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact,while a greater than rate will generally not be regarded by federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact.
the passing rate of was less than of the passing rate of nonminorities.to avoid such adverse impact,jones lowered the cutoff score by four points,to.jones also eliminated nine of the test questions because he deemed them faulty he gave all candidates credit for answering the questions correctly so that scores would remain on a one scale.
under the new cutoff score,candidates passed the test.of those,were white and were black.
all parties agree that this result did not violate the commission rule however,other statistical the and the show an adverse impact.under the,which measures the difference in mean scores between minority and nonminority candidates,minority candidates mean score was while the white candidates mean score was the difference,was described by plaintiffs expert,richard deshon,as large.under the,which measures statistical success across groups,white candidates passed at a rate of while minority candidates passed at a rate of.deshon testified that the difference is statistically significant.thus,even though the written test did not violate the commission rule,alternative analyses showed that the success differential between minority and nonminority candidates was statistically significant.
after the written test results were tallied and the candidates were ranked,the top candidates were invited to continue in the promotional process.the ranking order created by the written test scores served as the initial de facto order in which passing candidates were promoted to lieutenant.
problems resulted from ranking candidates based on their written test scores.these problems concerned the accuracy of the test in approximating job performance and are illustrated by two examples presented by plaintiffs at trial.in one example,a candidate who received the same initial score on the written test as two of the plaintiffs,and presumably would not have been eligible to proceed to the next rounds of the promotion process,was determined to be eligible for promotion after the city imposed the cutoff score of and gave full credit for the nine faulty questions.once all the components of the promotional process were tallied,this candidate was ranked as the second most qualified for promotion.this candidate was only barely eligible based on the written test scores to proceed in the promotion process,yet she received the second highest total score and ranking in the pool of candidates.
in another example,thirteen candidates who placed very low in the ranking order had to be retroactively promoted and issued back pay because the candidates performances on the practical video component which was administered late in the the city to drastically adjust the rankings.the city granted those thirteen candidates back pay and seniority points retroactive as of july,the date that the first pool of candidates was promoted to lieutenant.
the four plaintiffs failed the written test.they each received scores below,isabel,williams,and parker,were ranked,and,respectively thus,they were not allowed to proceed to the subsequent promotional assessments.subsequently,plaintiffs filed discrimination charges against the city.
incidentally,this is not the first time that the city has faced challenges to the july promotion process.during the administration of the july test,the city was informed that the practical exercise component of the test for promotion to sergeant had been compromised due to the advance release of unauthorized study materials.the city denied that the test component had been compromised and continued to administer the test to its completion.when members of the news media produced copies of the test while it was still being administered,the city admitted that the practical exercise component had been compromised.the city eliminated that component from the july promotional process and increased the weight of the written test and the performance evaluations.
subsequently,and police officers who were vying for promotion to sergeant filed claims of discrimination,alleging that the city intentionally discriminated against them by eliminating the practical exercise component and by increasing the weight of the written test after the promotional process had been completed.they requested that the sergeants who were awarded promotions based on the july tests be required to compete in a new promotional process,and that any sergeant shown to have received,used,and benefitted from unauthorized study materials be disqualified from competing in the new promotional process.they succeeded and were provided the requested relief.see johnson city of memphis,cir.
the district court made similar findings in the instant case.based primarily on the statistical analyses of the t and,the court found that the written test,as applied,unlawfully discriminated against minority candidates.the district court also relied on deshon testimony that the cutoff score was incapable of distinguishing between candidates who can and can not perform the job of lieutenant.the district court was impressed by the evidence,provided in the two examples described above,that the test contents were not valid and the related ranking order was unreliable.
following the bench trial,the court held an evidentiary hearing on remedies.the court found that the sergeants were entitled to promotion to lieutenant as of july,the date that the first pool of candidates was promoted,and compensation for back pay and overtime in the amount of the difference between the salaries of sergeant and lieutenant from that date to the date that the court order was entered.the court noted that it can not say which of the plaintiffs,if any,would have been promoted but for the illegal discrimination,and,err ing on the side of the plaintiffs,promoted all of them.
subsequently,the court considered plaintiffs request for attorney fees.the city argued that the award should be reduced because the sergeants did not succeed on three of their four claims.the court found that its rejection of some of plaintiffs legal theories on a common set of facts did not affect the monetary judgment or equitable remedies requested.because the sergeants gained excellent results,the court awarded all requested fees and expenses.
finally,the district court stayed execution of its order pending appeal to this court.the sergeants filed an emergency motion appealing the stay.this court denied the motion on september,citing the traditional factors considered in stay appeals and determining that the stay was not an abuse of discretion.
this court standard of review in a title vii discrimination case is narrow.under federal rule of civil procedure a,a district court findings of fact should not be reversed unless clearly erroneous.zamlen city of cleveland,cir,cert.denied,d.clear error will lie only when the reviewing court is left with the definite,firm conviction that a mistake has been made.anderson city of bessemer city,d citing united states united states gypsum.the issue is not whether the district court reached the best conclusion,but whether the evidence before the court supports the district court findings.heights cmty.congress hilltop realty,cir,cert.denied,d.also,the district court findings based on the credibility of the witnesses before it are entitled to great deference on appeal.wooldridge marlene indus,cir.
title vii proscribes employment practices that are fair in form but discriminatory in operation.griggs duke power,d.discrimination occurs when an employer uses a particular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race,color,religion,sex,or national origin and fails to demonstrate that the challenged practice is job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity k a i.
the supreme court has devised a test to determine whether an unlawful disparate impact exists in any particular case.albemarle paper moody,d.first,the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of,the plaintiff must establish that an adverse impact has occurred.if the plaintiff succeeds,the employer must show that the protocol in question has a manifest relationship to the employment the business justification.griggs,at.if the employer succeeds,the plaintiff must then show that other tests or selection protocols would serve the employer interest without creating the undesirable discriminatory effect.albemarle,at.
prima facie case 
a prima face case is established when plaintiff identifies a specific employment practice to be challenged and through relevant statistical analysis proves that the challenged practice has an adverse impact on a protected group.johnson of health and human,cir citing scales bradford,cir.the city argues that plaintiffs failed to establish a prima facie case because they failed to show that the use of the cutoff score resulted in an adverse impact on minorities under the equal employment opportunity commission rule.the city contends that we should only consider the rule,and no other measure,to determine whether an adverse impact has occurred.thus,the determinative question in this case is whether we may look to alternative statistical t and find an adverse impact.
the city contends that caselaw in our circuit forbids reliance on alternative statistical analyses in title vii cases.to the contrary,we require only that the statistical analyses be relevant.johnson,at.also,the supreme court has approved the use of a approach,recognizing that statistics come in infinite variety and their usefulness depends upon all of the surrounding facts and circumstances.teamsters united states,d.moreover,commentary to the commission regulations allows for exceptions to the rule smaller differences in selection rate may nonetheless constitute adverse impact,where they are significant in both statistical and practical terms or where a user actions have discouraged applicants disproportionately on grounds of race,sex,and ethnic origin.d.
the city also argues that the district court erred because the test complied with the rule,and a test compliance with the rule definitively establishes the absence of adverse impact.this is also incorrect.the commission regulations make explicit that compliance with the rule establishes only that the statistical analysis will not serve as evidence of an adverse impact.the rule states a greater than rate will generally not be regarded by federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact.d.thus,notwithstanding a test compliance with the rule,other analyses may still reveal an adverse impact.
indeed,when the supreme court stated that a plaintiff may rely solely on statistical evidence to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact,wards cove packing atonio,d,it did not say what kind of statistical evidence should be relied on.neither the supreme court nor this court has ever limited a plaintiff choices in title vii cases involving statistical analysis in any way moreover,we are grateful for statistics beyond the rule analysis because we prefer to look to the sum of statistical evidence to make a decision in these kinds of cases.see city of mansfield,cir approving finding of district court that the sum of plaintiffs statistical evidence demonstrated a marginally statistically significant disproportionate impact on blacks.
ii.business justification 
the supreme court has established that once a plaintiff has presented a prima facie case,a burden of production lies with the employer to demonstrate a business justification for the challenged employment practice.wards cove,at.the equal employment opportunity commission has developed uniform guidelines,for establishing the validity of these tests and procedures.according to the guidelines,employers may use three types of studies to validate an employee selection procedure content,construct,or validity studies.a see also zamlen city of cleveland,cir.
the city attempts to justify the written test by validity.a test will have content validity if there is a direct relationship between the test contents and the job contents.williams ford motor,cir.to establish whether contents of an employment test are,the employer must show that the contents are predictive of or significantly correlated with important elements of work behavior which comprise or are relevant to the job or jobs for which candidates are being evaluated.williams,at internal citations omitted.to validate a cutoff score,the inference must be drawn that the cutoff score measures minimal qualifications.the guidelines provide that where cutoff scores are used,they should normally be set so as to be reasonable and consistent with normal expectations of acceptable proficiency within the work force.h.the district court found that the cutoff score was nothing more than an arbitrary decision and did not measure minimal qualifications.here,the district court emphasized that the cutoff score was never validated by any of the methods suggested in the uniform guidelines.
jones was asked whether the cutoff score was validated in the following passage 
q you did attempt to,quote,validate the cut score,did you 
jones also testified that he did not want to use a cutoff score and saw no value in implementing one he explained that the only reason he used one was because the union forced him to.
the court also faulted the test for measuring only one component job knowledge and failing to test the entire job domain.this fact was confirmed by jones,who testified that he designed the written test only to test job knowledge,and sought to measure the other major elements of the job in the remaining components of the promotion process.the district court found that in effect,the ranking orders based on the written test had no value because they could not be trusted to be related to actual job performance.
the district court was particularly impressed by the two examples illustrated by plaintiffs at trial.referring to the nonminority candidate who failed the written test but was ultimately ranked second highest in line for promotion,the court stated that t his piece of evidence clearly dispels any inference that the written test approximated job performance.
we agree that there is clear evidence that the scores from the written test did not approximate a candidate potential job performance.the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the test had no business justification.
because the city fails to meet its burden of production,we conclude the title vii analysis in this case.the district court correctly ruled that the city written test violated title vii.
promotion and back pay 
if a district court finds that an employer has engaged in an unlawful employment practice,title vii authorizes an award of back pay and other retroactive relief.see g see also loeffler frank,d.as the supreme court explained in loeffler,the back pay award authorized by title vii is a manifestation of congress intent to make persons whole for injuries suffered through past discrimination.id.quoting albemarle,at.
where racial discrimination is found,the district court has not merely the power but the duty to render a decree which will so far as possible eliminate the discriminatory effects of the past as well as bar like discrimination in the future.louisiana united states,d.the general rule is,that when a wrong has been done,and the law gives a remedy,the compensation shall be equal to the injury.the latter is the standard by which the former is to be measured.the injured party is to be placed as near as may be,in the situation he would have occupied if the wrong had not been committed.wicker hoppock,wall.the congressional record,cong.rec,makes clear 
the remedy provisions of title vii are intended to give the courts wide discretion exercising their equitable powers to fashion the most complete relief possible.in dealing with the present section g the courts have stressed that the scope of relief under that section of the act is intended to make the victims of unlawful discrimination whole,and that the attainment of this objective rests not only upon the elimination of the particular unlawful employment practice complained of,but also requires that persons aggrieved by the consequences and effects of the unlawful employment practice be,so far as possible,restored to a position where they would have been were it not for the unlawful discrimination.
congress purpose in vesting a variety of discretionary powers in the courts was to make possible the fashion ing of the most complete relief possible.albemarle,at.citing cong.rec.
the district court found that the most complete relief possible includes both an award of back pay and promotion retroactive as of july,because plaintiffs would have been promoted and received lieutenants salaries but for the unlawful discrimination.we agree with the district court,despite the city arguments to the contrary.the city argues that plaintiffs are not entitled to promotion or back pay because there is no assurance,even had the sergeants passed the promotional process,that they would have been promoted to lieutenant because the police department often operates below budget and may not have hired all passing candidates.however,the city does not present any evidence to support this contention,and,thus failing to meet its burden,see wooldridge,at holding that defendant bears burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that factors other than the condemned discrimination caused the decision of which claimant complains,we dismiss its argument.
the city also contends that none of the plaintiffs would have ranked high enough on its eligibility list even if no cutoff score had been used.however,as the district court correctly stated,the ranking was invalid because only job knowledge had been tested in the written test,not the entire job domain,the rank orderings were indeed unreliable and should not have been used in the promotion considerations.relying on that same rank ordered list at this juncture would be inconsistent with the court judgment in the liability phase.
third,the city contends that the statistical analyses relied on by the district court showed that only two of the four plaintiffs ranked within the group eligible for a promotion.because the district court reasonably concluded earlier that the test could not approximate job performance and had no business justification,the city can not now successfully argue that only two of four plaintiffs could be eligible based on the tests results.
attorney fees 
title vii provides that the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party in litigation under title vii a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.k.the sergeants requested an award of attorney fees,costs,and expenses pursuant to k.the district court awarded the amount requested fees of and costs of.the court accepted the plaintiffs lawyer hourly rate,per hour,and his contribution,hours,as reasonable.the city argues on appeal that the award was unreasonable and should be reduced.
we review a district court award of attorney fees for abuse of discretion.cramblit fikse,cir.we affirm unless the court ruling is based on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the record.id.because the same standards are generally applicable in all cases in which congress has authorized an award of fees to a prevailing party,hensley eckerhart,d,we rely on precedents involving attorney fees without regard to whether they involved title vii or some other federal statute.
the trial court initial point of departure,when calculating reasonable attorney fees,is the determination of the fee applicant lodestar,which is the proven number of hours reasonably expended on the case by an attorney,multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.hensley,at.the reasonableness of the,rate per determined by considering twelve factors time and labor required the novelty and difficulty of the questions presented the skill needed to perform the legal service properly the preclusion of employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case the customary fee whether the fee is fixed or contingent time and limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances the amount involved and the results obtained the experience,reputation,and ability of the attorneys the undesirability of the case the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client and awards in similar cases.reed,at citing johnson georgia highway express,cir.
the city argues that the rate should be adjusted downward based on numerous listed tasks which could have been performed at a lower hourly rate.plaintiffs lawyer,however,is a solo practitioner who does not operate with the assistance of paralegals or support staff.the city also argues that their counsel average hourly rate of is more reasonable than plaintiffs counsel rate.however,the city lead counsel hourly rate was the city can make no argument that is based on comparison.
t he most critical factor in determining the reasonableness of a fee award is the degree of success obtained.farrar hobby,d q
