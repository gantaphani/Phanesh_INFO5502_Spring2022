ii.discussion 
statement of facts relevant to the question certified 
michele vitanza vitanza,or simply vitanza brought this suit individually and as executrix of the estate of her husband,timothy vitanza vitanza,against the upjohn company upjohn,a delaware corporation transacting business in the state of connecticut.upjohn manufactured and marketed a prescription drug under the name ansaid.that name is an acronym for a drug.ansaid is indicated for the acute or treatment of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis,as well as for less serious conditions.
sometime in early,an upjohn sales representative provided samples of ansaid to vitanza gary besser.the samples came in a box,which contained nine blister cards with four ansaid tablets per card.the labeling on the back of each blister card stated 
complimentary package 
not for sale 
ansaid mg.tablets 
flurbiprofen 
each tablet contains flurbiprofen mg.
information for use and insert.
store at controlled room temperature c f 
caution federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription.
each box of ansaid samples also contained an explanatory insert eight columns long,setting forth information on clinical pharmacology,indications and usage,contraindications,warnings,precautions,drug interactions,adverse reactions,drug abuse and dependence,overdosage,dosage and administration.the insert referred to the possibility of allergic reactions to ansaid,stating that,ansaid should not be given to patients in whom ansaid,aspirin,or other nonsteroidal drugs induce asthma,urticaria,or other reactions.fatal asthmatic reactions have been reported in such patients receiving this type of drug.although there were nine blister cards in each package,there was only one insert per package.the blister cards did not themselves contain any warning.the information contained in the insert was also included in the supplement to the physicians desk reference.
in june,vitanza visited besser for a examination.when vitanza complained that she felt stiffness in her neck,besser recommended that she take ansaid to relieve her symptoms,and gave her several sample blister cards containing ansaid tablets.besser did not,however,provide vitanza with a copy of the insert.vitanza took the ansaid tablets,and they relieved her symptoms.
in october,over two years after besser had given the tablets to vitanza,vitanza complained of a stiff neck.searching through the family medicine cabinet,he found some ansaid tablets in a blister card that besser had given to vitanza but which she had not used.vitanza had been informed by his doctors that he had a potentially lethal allergy to aspirin and nonsteroidal medications.accordingly,he checked the back of the ansaid blister card,quoted above,to determine whether there were any warnings.vitanza also checked two medical reference works,the time life medical reference library prescription drugs and the new lexicon illustrated medical encyclopedia.vitanza did not find any express statement that ansaid was a nonsteroidal drug or that persons with his sensitivities should avoid ansaid.vitanza took one ansaid pill.
shortly after taking the ansaid pill,vitanza experienced great difficulty breathing.he drove himself to the stamford hospital emergency room in stamford,connecticut.ten minutes after his arrival,he suffered respiratory and cardiac arrest.vitanza died between one and two hours later.the cause of death was determined to be a severe anaphylactic reaction to ansaid.vitanza was years old at the time of his death.
vitanza originally filed this suit in october in the connecticut superior court for the judicial district of,stating a claim under the cpla.vitanza alleged that vitanza death was caused by upjohn failure to provide adequate warnings of possible adverse effects on its sample packs.upjohn subsequently removed this case to federal court,based on diversity.in july,vitanza moved to certify the question presented in this case to the connecticut supreme court.judge squatrito denied that motion,as well as vitanza motion for reconsideration of that decision.in an opinion issued in march,judge squatrito granted upjohn motion for summary judgment on the ground that the learned intermediary doctrine barred vitanza claim.this appeal followed.
b.the nature of the controversy in which the question arose 
the legal issues involved 
the ultimate question of law on this appeal is whether,as the district court concluded,under connecticut law the learned intermediary doctrine bars the present suit as a matter of law.this court ruled over three decades ago that under that doctrine,connecticut law exempted a pharmaceutical company from strict liability so long as it warned prescribing physicians of the risks of prescription drugs.see basko sterling drug,cir.upjohn claims that the connecticut supreme court adopted the logic of basko in tomer american home prods.according to upjohn,these decisions bar the present action.vitanza responds that tomer did not adopt the learned intermediary doctrine.instead,vitanza argues,tomer merely agreed with basko that a manufacturer had a duty to warn even where the drug might only affect a few hypersensitive users.
since the decisions in basko and tomer,however,there have been a number of legal developments in connecticut that potentially bear upon the application and vitality of the learned intermediary doctrine.in,the state legislature passed the cpla,which states that a warning is inadequate unless it is devised to communicate with the person best able to take or recommend precautions against the potential harm.d.vitanza argues that under the cpla,the learned intermediary doctrine is not an absolute defense as a matter of law,but a defense for the finder of fact to consider.upjohn responds,relying on this court decision in lamontagne du pont de nemours,cir,that the cpla merely streamlined pleading requirements,and did not change the existing connecticut common law on product liability.the lamontagne court,however,rejected a much broader argument than the one vitanza makes.the plaintiff in lamontagne argued that under the cpla,it was a jury question as to whether a manufacturer of a component of jaw implants had a duty to warn potential users of the end product even though the manufacturer had no knowledge of any hazards that the end product might cause.see id.at.the lamontagne court ruled that the cpla did not abrogate the principle that a duty to warn does not arise unless the seller knew or had reason to know
