the,william buster fisher,filed a complaint on december,in which,pursuant to,he charged the,sheriff tom harden,deputy stephen alexander,deputy molly alexander,and deputy mark leary collectively the defendants,with having violated his right against an unreasonable seizure as guaranteed by the fourth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution.on may,the defendants filed a joint motion for summary judgment.the district court subsequently issued an opinion and order on august,in which it granted the defendants request for a summary judgment on the grounds that they had a reasonable suspicion that fisher was suicidal,and,as a consequence,their actions in affecting a seizure of fisher were protected by the doctrine of qualified immunity,and there was no genuine issue of material fact on fisher claim that the county failed to adequately train and supervise the deputies.in this appeal,fisher asserts that the officers who seized him did not have probable cause to justify a mental health seizure,and that harden failed to adequately train and supervise his deputies for the reasons set forth below,we reverse,in part,and affirm,in part,the judgment of the district court.
factual background 
the facts relevant to this cause occurred on the afternoon of july,in a rural farming area of morrow county,ohio.the area consists of wide open farming land,with heightened visibility in all directions.on that day,fisher,a retired farmer,had gone out to shoot groundhogs,an activity in which he routinely engaged in an effort to help protect his neighbors crops.dressed in bib overalls,fisher had taken with him a folding chair,his rifle,and a tripod that he used to help him aim his rifle and hold it steady.he positioned himself,sitting in the folding chair,upon an elevated railroad grade on one of his neighbor property.
fisher sat at a distance of approximately yards from county road,a rural road that runs through this area of morrow county.a passerby noticed fisher off in the distance sitting on railroad tracks and found his presence there quite unusual.upon gathering that this was possibly a suicidal person,the passerby telephoned the morrow county sheriff department and reported,incorrectly,that a man had his feet tied to the railroad tracks.the sheriff department subsequently dispatched a code,which indicates a possible suicide.
two of the defendants,deputies stephen alexander and molly alexander,who are husband and wife,responded to the dispatch.upon their arrival on the scene,the officers located fisher,who was still seated in his folding chair approximately yards away.alexander used the cruiser microphone and speaker system to arouse fisher attention and instruct him to come toward the officers.fisher stood up,gathered his belongings,and began walking along the railroad tracks toward the officers.as fisher proceeded toward them,the officers noticed he was carrying a rifle slung over his shoulder.they drew their firearms,crouched behind their open cruiser doors,and ordered fisher to lay down the rifle before coming any closer.the officers acknowledged that initially fisher appeared unable to hear their first command,and they responded with additional instructions for him to lay down his rifle.upon hearing their command at a distance of nearly yards away,fisher readily complied with their request.the officers instructed fisher further to lay down his folding chair and tripod.again,once fisher could hear their request,he readily complied 
for the next couple of minutes,the officers observed fisher walk toward the road,with nothing in his hands.as he walked deliberately toward them,it became apparent to alexander that fisher was an older gentlemen.the officers conceded that he approached them in a normal fashion,and did not act out or say or do anything out of the ordinary.nonetheless,they kept their weapons drawn and trained upon him.as fisher arrived at the road,alexander directed him to walk backwards toward alexander.after he finally reached them,the officers commanded fisher,still at gunpoint,to lay face down on the roadway,and handcuffed him behind his back.
fisher immediately went into cardiac arrest.after unsuccessfully attempting to stand fisher on his feet,the officers left him handcuffed and lying on the ground.presumably unaware of the seriousness of fisher condition,alexander immediately went to retrieve the objects that fisher had placed on the ground.shortly thereafter,a woman who lived nearby and another defendant,deputy mark leary,separately arrived at the scene.the woman,who had been unable to attain sufficient attention from the alexanders,informed leary that fisher suffered from a heart condition.leary,observing fisher distressed state,uncuffed him,turned him on his back and called for medical assistance.fisher was to riverside hospital in columbus,ohio,for emergency care.although fisher survived,he is permanently disabled as a result of the incident.
approximately five months later,to wit,december,fisher filed a complaint against the defendants in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio.in the complaint,fisher charges,among other things,that the officers violated his right,as guaranteed by the fourth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution,to be free from unreasonable seizure without probable cause,and that sheriff tom harden failed to adequately train and supervise his deputies.on august,the district court granted the defendants motion for a summary judgment.in doing so,the district court determined that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity because fisher had failed to establish a constitutional violation,and that there was no genuine issue of a material fact to support his claim against harden for a failure to train and supervise his deputies.this appeal followed.
discussion 
this court conducts a de novo review of a district court grant of summary judgment.holloway brush,cir.summary judgment is proper only where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering such a motion,the court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment,an adverse party must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.e.
fisher raises two issues on appeal.first,he claims that because he pleaded facts sufficient to establish a constitutional violation,the district court erred in granting qualified immunity to the defendants.second,fisher asserts that a genuine issue of material fact exists on his claim that harden failed to properly train and supervise his deputies.we address each of these issues in turn.
in his first point of error,fisher contends that he has established a constitutional violation because the facts,as asserted by him,establish that the officers arrested him without the probable cause that is required to support a mental health seizure.the district court concluded that the officers did not need probable cause to justify their seizure of fisher,but only needed reasonable suspicion that he was suicidal.since the officers could point to articulable facts to support a reasonable suspicion that fisher was suicidal,the district court determined that fisher had failed to establish a constitutional violation,and as a result the officers were entitled to qualified immunity.
whether qualified immunity applies to an official actions is a question of law that this court reviews de novo.virgili gilbert,cir.qualified immunity is conceptually distinct from the merits of the plaintiff claim.mitchell forsyth,d.it is an entitlement not to be forced to litigate the consequences of official conduct.id.the entitlement is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability and like an absolute immunity,it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.id.at.
in defining this entitlement,the supreme court has held that government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.in,the court established a test for determining whether qualified immunity applies.saucier katz,d.in the initial inquiry,we must consider this threshold question taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,do the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right id.if the facts,as alleged by the claimant,fail to establish a violation,then immunity applies.on the other hand,if the alleged facts sufficiently demonstrate a constitutional violation,we must determine whether the right was clearly established.id.
we address the threshold question of whether the facts alleged show the officers conduct violated a constitutional right.fisher argues that the officers violated his fourth amendment rights when they arrested him without the probable cause that is required to justify a mental health seizure.the district court,however,determined that the officers did not arrest fisher but rather restrained him as a part of a terry stop.see terry ohio,d.in awarding qualified immunity to the officers,the district court analogized a mental health seizure to a criminal seizure,determining that the same fourth amendment standards applicable to investigative stops and arrests for criminal activity apply as well to police investigations of persons who are reportedly mentally ill.at.as such,the district court determined that even where probable cause is lacking,a police officer,pursuant to the guidelines applicable to a terry stop,may investigate a report of a possibly suicidal individual where articulable facts indicate that the individual may present a danger to himself or to others.at.inasmuch as the district court also believed that the officers had an articulable and reasonable suspicion that fisher might harm himself or others,it held that the investigative stop did not violate the constitution.we disagree.
this case involves a seizure on the basis of an attempted suicide report.the defendants do not contest that fisher was seized,but rather advocate that his seizure was valid as part of an investigative terry stop.the defendants,however,concede that they were not responding to a report of criminal conduct and that they never suspected that fisher was engaged in or about to be engaged in a crime.absent suspected criminal activity,in this circuit a law enforcement official may not physically restrain an individual merely to assess his mental health.rather,we have established that in the context of a mental health seizure an officer must have probable cause to believe that the person seized poses a danger to himself or others.we analyze cases such as this under the probable cause standard announced by this court in monday oullette,cir.under that standard,officers detaining an individual believed to be suicidal must have probable cause to believe that the person is dangerous to himself or others.id.
in monday,an officer responded to a radio dispatch that the plaintiff had telephoned a mental health worker and stated that he was upset over a divorce,had ingested some pills,and was drinking alcohol in an effort to commit suicide.when the officer entered the home,the plaintiff in fact was drinking alcohol and appeared intoxicated and depressed.the officer count of the plaintiff xanax pills revealed that at least twenty were missing.under those circumstances,we held that the officer had probable cause to believe that the plaintiff was attempting to commit suicide,or at least might injure himself.id.
a showing of probable cause in the mental health seizure context requires only a probability or substantial chance of dangerous behavior,not an actual showing of such behavior.id.citing illinois gates,d.just as actual innocence will not render invalid an arrest that is properly based upon probable cause that criminal activity was occurring,a mental health seizure can rest upon probable cause even when the person seized does not actually suffer from a dangerous mental condition.id.courts evaluate the existence of probable cause from the perspective of a reasonable and objective person in the position of the seizing official.id.if the circumstances,viewed objectively,support a finding of probable cause,then the arresting officer actual motives are irrelevant.criss city of kent,cir.
in this case,unlike in monday,the defendants are unable to demonstrate that they had probable cause to believe that fisher was a danger to himself or others.the officers were responding to a dispatch that a man,who had tied himself to railroad tracks,might be attempting to commit suicide.when they arrived,they ordered fisher to come to the road.his doing so immediately revealed that he was not tied to the railroad tracks as had been reported.this alone would have caused a reasonable officer to question the veracity of the attempted suicide report.when the officers noticed that fisher had a rifle slung over his shoulder,they ordered him to put it down,and he complied.he proceeded towards them in a normal manner for an individual of his age.unlike the officers in monday,the alexanders never questioned fisher to determine if he might be depressed and attempting to commit suicide.even after fisher arrived at the road and it became apparent that he was a man of his later years and dressed in hunting attire,the officers still did not make any inquiry of him,his purpose for being there,or the activity in which he was seemingly engaged at the time of their arrival.instead,with their firearms continually trained upon him,they ordered fisher to get on the roadway and handcuffed him behind his back.
in addition,fisher did not do anything that the officers considered to be suspicious or threatening.he did not carry his rifle in a ready position in his hands.he did not point it at the officers,himself,or anyone else.he put the rifle down when asked to do so and walked away from it,never turning back toward the gun.at the time he was handcuffed,the rifle lay on the ground roughly yards away.the officers never saw fisher in possession of any other weapon.fisher was never verbally threatening,abusive,or irrational he did not make any statements about hurting himself or anyone else and he never attempted to avoid the officers or flee the area.both officers admitted that fisher did not do anything that made them afraid.in light of these circumstances,there are simply no facts from which a reasonable officer could have found a probability or substantial chance that fisher posed a danger to himself or others at the time he was seized.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to him,we find that fisher has established a violation of his fourth amendment rights.
the defendants urge us to adopt a rule that would apply the law of terry ohio to mental health seizures.based on our precedent,we decline to do so,but such a rule would not apply to this case in any event.even assuming,arguendo,that as part of an investigatory detention officers were permitted to physically restrain a detainee in order to assess his mental state and all in the absence of a reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct,this rule would not apply in the instant case because the force used by the alexanders elevated their seizure of fisher from a mere investigatory stop to an arrest.although an officer may have reasonable suspicion to detain a person or his possessions for investigation,the officer investigative detention can mature into an arrest or seizure if it occurs over an unreasonable period of time or under unreasonable circumstances.united states heath,cir quoting united states avery,cir.see also weaver shadoan,cir an investigative terry stop may ripen into a de facto arrest through the passage of time or the use of force.feathers aey,cir determining whether an investigatory stop escalated into an arrest.if,through the passage of time or use of force,an investigative detention ripens into an arrest,a suspect continued detention must be based upon probable cause.weaver,at emphasis added.in determining whether a confrontation that began as a terry stop has matured into an arrest,we assess whether the use of force was reasonably related in scope to the situation at hand,feathers,at,or,likewise,whether the length and manner of the investigative stop was reasonably related to the basis for the initial intrusion,weaver,at.t he investigative methods employed should be the least intrusive means reasonably available to verify or dispel the officer suspicion in a short period of time.florida royer,d.
assuming that these principles are applicable to the present case,we would agree that the encounter here began as an investigatory stop incident to a suicide report.nevertheless,in light of fisher compliance and because he did not take any sudden,unpredictable,or threatening action toward the officers,it is abundantly apparent that the seizure of fisher quickly elevated into a full arrest.in assessing the use of force in this case,we conclude that the manner in which the deputies seized fisher was not reasonably related to the basis of their initial intrusion.the alexanders confronted fisher on the basis of a report that he was suicidal.alexander testified that his purpose in seizing fisher was to determine whether he was suicidal to find out why he would have been depressed or what have you,at,and t o see if he was suicidal or see if he needed medical attention,id.at.indeed,the district court similarly found that it is true that when the deputies made contact with fisher,they did so solely to investigate a possible suicide.id.at emphasis added.
in his deposition,alexander testified that he was familiar with the area and knew it to be an unincorporated rural area,where hunting routinely occurred and it is lawful for a citizen to be in public with a rifle.fisher was wearing bib overalls with a small,homemade pouch for ammunition on the front.he had been holding a hunting rifle,seated in a folding chair,with a tripod to help steady and aim the rifle.he presented the appearance of an elderly man hunting in a location where hunters are commonly found.everything about fisher appearance,in that setting,suggested a benign encounter rather than a dangerous one.
moreover,alexander admitted that fisher did not do anything that caused the officers concern subsequent to laying down his rifle.when asked,other than the normal caution that all police officers should exercise,you did see fisher do anything that caused you to be fearful of him once he laid the gun down,did you id.at,alexander responded,i do recall him doing anything,no,id.at.
despite this acknowledgment that fisher took no action that caused them to fear for their safety,the alexanders forced fisher on the ground,at gun point,and handcuffed him.the deputies employed this force without any suspicion that fisher was involved in criminal activity,without frisking him for other weaponry,and without asking him a single question.based on our review of the record,we do not find that this use of force represented the least intrusive means reasonably available to verify or dispel the alexanders suspicion that fisher was suicidal.we conclude that the use of force exceeded what was required for an investigative stop and that the manner in which the deputies seized fisher constituted an arrest.in the absence of probable cause,such action violates the constitution.
in holding that fisher has set forth a constitutional violation,we also conclude that the facts only support a violation by the alexanders.we do not find that leary committed any such violation.indeed,all of the evidence indicates that leary essentially came to fisher rescue by removing his handcuffs and calling for emergency medical assistance.hence,as to leary,we agree with the district court that fisher has not shown a constitutional violation.
next,we must determine whether the right was clearly established.saucier,at.this second inquiry,must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case,not as a broad general proposition.id.the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.id.at.citation omitted.the relevant,dispositive inquiry is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.id.
this is not to say that an official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful but it is to say that in the light of law the unlawfulness must be apparent.anderson,at.citation omitted.a n action unlawfulness can be apparent from direct holdings,from specific examples described as prohibited,or from the general reasoning that a court employs.feathers,at cir citing hope pelzer,d.in determining whether a right is clearly established,we have concluded that in the ordinary instance,a district court must find binding precedent by the supreme court,its court of appeals or itself.ohio civil serv.employees seiter,cir.a mere handful of decisions of other circuit and district courts,which are admittedly novel,can not form the basis for a clearly established constitutional right in this circuit.id.at.we,however,also noted that in certain cases it may be possible for the decisions of other courts to clearly establish a principle of law.id.at.in these exceptional cases,the decisions of other courts may provide clearly established law if the decisions both point unmistakably to the unconstitutionality of the conduct complained of and are so clearly foreshadowed by applicable direct authority as to leave no doubt in the mind of a reasonable officer that his conduct,if challenged on constitutional grounds,would be found wanting.id.
applying these principles to the present case,we conclude that the right was clearly established.the specific question at issue is whether it was clearly established at the time of fisher arrest that a law enforcement officer may not affect a mental health seizure without probable cause.as we have already noted,in this court specifically held that t he fourth amendment requires an official seizing and detaining a person for a psychiatric evaluation to have probable cause to believe that the person is dangerous to himself or others.monday,at.the seizure in this case was not specifically for purposes of a professional psychiatric evaluation.this difference,however,is of no effect viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to fisher,we must reject the sentiments of the dissent that the deputies were merely securing the scene.dissent at.first,we reiterate that the district court found that it is true that when the deputies made contact with fisher,they did so solely to investigate a possible suicide.at.in addition,alexander claimed that i f fisher was a suicide risk and if he felt fisher was in a mind set where he could be of risk to himself or others,he had the right under ohio statute to take fisher into protective custody.moreover,fisher did not do anything that caused the officers to fear for their safety.see id.at.this record evidence reveals that the officers seized and detained fisher,not merely to secure the scene,but for purposes of a mental health evaluation.under our fourth amendment jurisprudence,that action requires probable cause 
we have not found any case in which this court has stated that officers may restrain an individual liberty on the sole basis that they have a reasonable suspicion that the individual suffers from a mental illness.in addition,the other circuits that have examined this issue have similarly held that probable cause is the correct standard.see,sullivan county of hunt,wl cir.july,citing anthony city of new york,cir,a mental health seizure case in which the second circuit granted qualified immunity under the probable cause standard bailey kennedy,cir officers must have probable cause to seize for emergency mental evaluation glass mayas,cir requiring probable cause for involuntary hospitalization sherman four county counseling,cir requiring probable cause to detain for psychiatric evaluation gooden howard county,cir finding that it is clearly established that officers need probable cause for mental health seizure harris pirch,cir requiring good faith and probable cause for emergency commitment in re barnard,requiring probable cause to detain person believed to be mentally ill and dangerous.
to support its position that the mere possession of a firearm by fisher distinguishes the present case,the dissent cites bell irwin,cir,and united states wallace,cir.both of these cases are inapposite.in bell,douglas bell wife telephoned the police seeking protection after he threatened her.although the couple quickly reconciled and asked the responding police officer to leave them alone,forty minutes later one of their neighbors called the police and reported that the wife was knocking on doors in search of safety.returning to the scene,the same officer located bell wife down the street.bell refused to allow the officer into his home,who initiated a background check and bell wife informed the police that her husband had attempted suicide.
through a window,the police observed bell holding several knives,one of which he drove into a wall near the front door and several of which he threw into the yard in the direction of the police.bell specifically told the police chief that he would kill any officer who entered and then kill himself,id.at,and threatened to blow up his home using propane and kerosene in tanks immediately outside,id.at.the local police then sought assistance from the state police and even from bell father.none of these negotiations were prevailing.following all of these activities,an officer fired rounds at bell because he observed bell lean toward one of the tanks with what appeared to be a cigarette lighter.as a result,bell was injured and filed suit against certain individual officers asserting that they used excessive force.
bell was not a case about unreasonable seizure instead it was a case about the use of excessive force,where the plaintiff threatened that he would kill any officer who entered and then kill himself.at.every alleged case of attempted suicide does not include threats to others.indeed,there were no threats in the present case.the facts in bell are completely at odds with the facts presently before this court.certainly bell does not support the proposition that fisher lawful possession of a firearm,standing alone,constitutes a sufficient basis upon which to justify the seizure in this case.
the other case upon which the dissent relies,wallace,involved circumstances in which the police responded to a disturbance.at.upon arriving at an apartment complex where the disturbance was reported,the officers heard loud voices emanating from the apartment.the officers knocked on the apartment door and the door was opened by a woman who was and crying.id.wallace also came to the door.when the police asked whether everything was okay,wallace responded affirmatively,but the woman quickly said no and informed the officers that wallace had a gun and was threatening to kill himself,id.the officers then restrained wallace hands and removed his gun in upholding the district court denial of wallace motion to suppress the gun,the fifth circuit determined that the removal of wallace gun was nothing more than a stop and frisk,pursuant to terry ohio because a fter learning from the obviously distressed companion that wallace had a gun and was threatening suicide,i t would have been poor police work indeed for the police to have left the scene,wallace,at emphasis added citation omitted second bracket in original.
wallace is also readily distinguishable from the present case.in wallace,the officers were responding to a report of a disturbance,not a suicide report,and received confirmation through verbal and visual signs that wallace could be a danger to himself and others.they acted only after wallace and his wife could not agree on whether everything was okay,and after she told them that wallace had a gun and was threatening suicide.in the present case,the information presented to the officers was much more vague.the alexanders were investigating an unconfirmed report that an individual was suicidal.fisher was not in the company of an obviously distressed companion.and,the deputies failed to question him.rather,they drew their guns,ordered fisher to the ground,and handcuffed him 
fisher has alleged facts sufficient to establish a violation of his constitutional rights.it is clearly established that an officer may not affect a mental health seizure without probable cause.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to fisher,we conclude that the alexanders engaged in conduct that violated a clearly established constitutional right.accordingly,we find that qualified immunity does not shield them from civil liability.
fisher also charges tom harden,in his official capacity as sheriff of morrow county,ohio,with a failure to train and supervise his deputies.o suits generally represent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent.monell dep t of soc.serv.of city of new york,d.to succeed on his monell claim,fisher must prove that the morrow county sheriff department was deliberately indifferent to the rights of citizens who came into contact with deputies.stemler city of florence,cir.fisher must show prior instances of unconstitutional conduct demonstrating that the county has ignored a history of abuse and was clearly on notice that the training in this particular area was deficient and likely to cause injury.see berry city of detroit,cir citing city of canton harris,d.deliberate indifference is a stringent standard of fault,requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his action.stemler,at citation omitted.
in this case,the evidence indicates that the officers received police training from the ohio peace officers training academy.alexander also trained for two months under the supervision of two sergeants.despite his arguments to the contrary,fisher has failed to produce sufficient evidence that the officers training programs were inadequate.in addition,fisher has not shown that the county knew of prior unconstitutional actions by its employees and failed to respond.accordingly,the district court did not err in granting summary judgment for harden on the failure to train and supervise claim.
for the foregoing reasons,we find that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for the alexanders on fisher constitutional claim,but not with respect to its summary judgments for leary or harden.the district court order of summary judgment is reversed,in part,affirmed,in part,and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
in my view,deputies stephen and molly alexander did not violate fisher constitutional rights,and they were thus entitled to qualified immunity.i therefore dissent.
initially,i note significant facts in the record that are not emphasized in the majority opinion.first,while it eventually came to light that fisher was perched on the railroad tracks in order to shoot groundhogs,the defendants testified that they were not familiar with fisher prior to the incident and were not aware of his penchant for hunting groundhogs.stephen alexander was,however,aware that individuals sometimes committed suicide by sitting on the railroad tracks.this fact was known to stephen both because his father had been a railroad employee who told stephen of people that had committed suicide by sitting on the tracks and because he was aware that,approximately one year prior,another individual committed suicide in morrow county in such a manner.while the area in which fisher was located was a rural area that hunters sometimes used,it is at a minimum questionable whether,as the majority asserts,fisher presented the appearance of an elderly man hunting.see op.at.at the time of the incident,the deputies thought fisher was a suicidal threat to himself and others,not a hunter 
second,fisher did not comply with the deputies initial requests that he place the firearm and other items he was carrying on the ground.although it is unclear at what point fisher was able to hear the deputies requests,it is also unclear whether,as the majority asserts,fisher readily complied with the requests once he heard them.see id.at.stephen alexander stated in his deposition that fisher eventually obeyed the officers requests,but he certainly did not portray fisher compliance as ready and willing.for example,after it appeared that fisher heard the officers,it still took two or three more requests for fisher to comply with the request to put his chair down on the ground,according to both the incident report and alexander deposition testimony.
third,as fisher reached the road,at the point when stephen told fisher to walk backwards toward him and molly,stephen noticed several firearm ammunition shells in fisher overalls.stephen could not tell at that time for what type of gun the shells were intended.because he believed that the firearm fisher placed on the ground was a shotgun and was unsure what type of shells fisher had on his person,he feared that fisher possessed another firearm.while it may not have been out of the ordinary for fisher to have numerous ammunition shells on his person,it is certainly an important fact to note in assessing whether his constitutional rights were violated.see id.at.also,in her supplemental statement in the police record and in her deposition,molly alexander noted that it appeared to her that fisher had knelt down and picked something up after dropping his firearm,chair,and tripod.
the majority accurately lays out the test for whether qualified immunity applies to an official actions.the first step in any qualified immunity inquiry is to determine whether the conduct of the officer in question violated the plaintiff constitutional rights.saucier katz,d.if no constitutional violation occurred,then the officer is entitled to qualified immunity.see vakilian shaw,cir mattox city of forest park,cir.an examination of the facts of this case reveals that no constitutional violation occurred and that the majority thus errs in reaching the second step of the the right was clearly established.see saucier,at.
the fourth amendment grants citizens the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures by government officials.const.amend.iv gardenhire schubert,cir.fisher claims that the deputies violated this right when they detained him.the first issue to resolve is the precise point at which the deputies seized fisher for fourth amendment purposes.
not every encounter between a law enforcement officer and a citizen constitutes a seizure under the fourth amendment.for instance,a consensual encounter between an officer and a citizen during which the officer seeks voluntary cooperation from the citizen is not a seizure,and the officer need not possess any suspicion that the citizen is engaging in criminal activity to initiate such an encounter.united states chapman,cir.a seizure occurs for the purpose of the fourth amendment only when,taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding the encounter,the police conduct would have communicated to a reasonable person that he was not at liberty to ignore the police presence and go about his business.florida bostick,d quoting michigan chesternut,d.an example of a seizure is when an officer draws his weapon on a citizen.see united states mendenhall,d.
in this case,no seizure of fisher occurred until the alexanders drew their guns on him,which occurred when the deputies noticed he was carrying a gun across his shoulder.until that point,the deputies did not signal to fisher that his liberty was limited in any way.fisher began approaching the deputies without being asked to do so and of his own accord.only when the deputies drew their firearms did the encounter transform from a purely consensual one into a seizure for the purposes of the fourth amendment.
of course,considering that a seizure did occur when the deputies displayed their weapons,the next question is whether the seizure and the deputies related actions were appropriate.under traditional fourth amendment jurisprudence,a police officer may temporarily detain an individual for investigation when he has a reasonable suspicion that the individual is or is about to be engaged in criminal activity.see terry ohio,d united states patterson,cir.the majority interprets this test to mean that a police jurisdictions in which suicide is not a crime,as is the case here,state sage,ohio,may not conduct an investigatory stop of an individual when he has a reasonable suspicion only that the individual is about to commit suicide but not engage in an actual criminal activity.applying this interpretation of terry to the present case,the majority holds that the deputies needed probable cause to detain fisher.i disagree.
the majority relies on cases from this and other circuits indicating that,before detaining an individual suspected of having mental illness for an emergency medical evaluation or for involuntarily hospitalization,a police officer must have probable cause to believe that the individual is a threat to himself or others.see,monday oullette,cir the fourth amendment requires an official seizing and detaining a person for a psychiatric evaluation to have probable cause to believe that the person is dangerous to himself or others.these cases are inapposite here.first,there is no indication that the deputies seized fisher to detain him until he received a psychiatric evaluation.rather,the record shows that the deputies momentarily detained fisher to ensure that he was not a threat to them and then to question him.as stephen alexander explained,he was trying 
to lie the suspect down,handcuff the suspect for officer safety,stand fisher up,get him off the railroad track and over to the cruiser where i could pat fisher down for weapons and ascertain what was going on.if fisher was a suicide risk and if i felt he was in a mind set where he could be of risk to himself or others,i had the right under ohio statute to take fisher into protective custody.
emphasis added.in other words,the deputies detained fisher temporarily in order to determine whether probable cause existed to detain him further or hospitalize him pending a psychiatric evaluation.the majority concedes that t he seizure in this case was not specifically for purposes of a professional psychiatric evaluation,but states that this difference from monday is of no effect.see op.at.i disagree.as stephen alexander explained,only if fisher was a suicide risk,and if he could be a risk to himself or others,would the ohio statute giving alexander the right to hospitalize fisher involuntarily apply such that probable cause would be necessary.as it happened,the whole episode lasted only five minutes,and by the time of fisher medical emergency,the deputies had not yet decided to detain him for a psychiatric evaluation.they were merely securing the scene and beginning to investigate whether such a detention would have been warranted,but the investigation was never completed because of fisher unfortunate medical incident.probable cause was not required to conduct this temporary investigation and detention.
in monday,this court analogized a dangerous mental condition to the role of criminal activity in traditional fourth amendment analysis.at.the majority reads monday as requiring that officers detaining an individual believed to be suicidal must have probable cause to believe that the person is dangerous to himself or others.see op.at quoting monday,at.this is not a precise reading of monday,where the court set out probable cause as the standard for officials seizing and detaining a person for a psychiatric evaluation,but,contrary to the majority intimations,did not hold that officers must have probable cause to detain every individual believed to be suicidal.at.crucially,the allegedly suicidal plaintiff in monday did not have a weapon and posed a threat only to himself,not to others.id.at.in contrast,many of those individuals who are about to commit suicide certainly have a dangerous mental condition,one that poses a threat to both themselves and anyone else in their vicinity.see,bell irwin,cir noting that a person who had made suicidal threats while wielding knives was a danger to both himself and others present.the same logic that fo
