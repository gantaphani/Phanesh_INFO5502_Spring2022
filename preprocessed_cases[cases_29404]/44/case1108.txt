opinion of the court 
as is so often the case,the issues in this appeal arise from unsettling facts presented by sympathetic plaintiffs we are asked to decide whether public schools have a constitutional duty to protect students from abuse inflicted by fellow students under the circumstances alleged here.
appellants,brittany and emily morrow,and their parents,bradley and diedre morrow,brought this action against blackhawk school district and blackhawk high school assistant principal,barry balaski the morrows claim that brittany and her sister emily were subjected to bullying in the form of a series of threats,assaults,and acts of racial intimidation at the hands of a fellow student and her accomplice.unable to obtain help from school officials,the morrows were ultimately compelled to remove their children from their school.thereafter,the morrows brought suit alleging that school officials denied them substantive due process under the fourteenth amendment by not protecting brittany and emily.the third amended complaint the complaint asserted a cause of action under and a supplemental state law claim for negligence gross or willful misconduct.
the district court dismissed the complaint based on our decision in middle bucks area vocational technical school,cir en banc.there,we concluded that the school did not have a special relationship with students that would give rise to a constitutional duty to protect them from harm from other students given the alleged facts.see id.at finding that no special relationship based upon a restraint of liberty exists here.the district court also held that the injury the morrows complained of was not the result of any affirmative action by the defendants.accordingly,the court held that the defendants are not liable under the danger doctrine.the district court therefore dismissed the morrows complaint,and this appeal followed.the appeal was initially argued before a panel of this court.thereafter,we granted en banc review to reexamine the very important questions raised by the allegations in the complaint.
we now affirm the judgment of the district court and hold that the allegations do not establish the special relationship or the danger that must exist before a constitutional duty to protect arises under the fourteenth amendment.
factual and procedural background 
factual background 
brittany and emily morrow attended blackhawk high school in beaver county,pennsylvania beginning in january,they were subjected to a series of threats and physical assaults by shaquana anderson,a fellow student.specifically,on january,anderson threatened brittany by phone and on a myspace blog two days later,anderson physically attacked brittany in the school lunch room.pursuant to its no tolerance policy,the school suspended both girls for three days.brittany mother also reported anderson to the local police at the recommendation of assistant principal balaski.as a result,anderson was charged with simple assault,terroristic threats,and harassment.nevertheless,anderson continued to bully brittany and emily.in fact,shortly after she returned to school,anderson again attacked brittany by attempting to throw her down a set of stairs.during that incident,anderson allegedly called brittany a cracker,told her that she was retarded and had better learn to fight back,and asked why do you learn to talk right 
on april,anderson was placed on probation by the court of common pleas of beaver county,juvenile division,and ordered to have no contact with brittany.five months later,anderson was adjudicated delinquent by a juvenile master of that court,and was again ordered to have no contact with brittany.copies of both of these orders were provided to the school and to assistant principal balaski.
despite the court intervention,on september,anderson boarded brittany school bus,even though that bus did not service anderson home route.anderson threatened brittany,and she elbowed brittany in the throat at a school football game that evening.a few days later,abbey harris,anderson friend,struck emily in the throat.these incidents were reported to school officials.
the morrows subsequently met with school officials,but they responded by telling the morrows that they could not guarantee brittany and emily safety.instead,rather than removing anderson and her confederate from the school,school officials advised the morrows to consider another school for their children.in october,the morrows enrolled their daughters in a different school.
procedural history 
the morrows thereafter filed this suit pursuant to,alleging a violation of their fourteenth amendment substantive due process rights they also included a supplemental state law claim against assistant principal balaski for negligence gross and willful misconduct.the morrows acknowledge that the fourteenth amendment due process clause does not generally impose an affirmative duty on the state to protect individuals from harm caused by private citizens.however,they argue that the general rule is not applicable because the defendants had a special relationship with brittany and emily.they also argue that the defendants are liable because they created the dangerous situation in which brittany and emily found themselves,and that circumstance gave rise to a duty to protect the morrow sisters from that danger.
the district court dismissed the morrows complaint with prejudice,and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claim in its written opinion,the district court explained that we have held that there is no special relationship between public school authorities and students.the court also concluded that the morrows had identified no action of the defendants that utilized their authority in a way that rendered minor plaintiffs more vulnerable than they would have been otherwise.morrow balaski,cv,wl,at.although the district court noted that it was sympathetic to plaintiffs plight,it nevertheless concluded that the morrows have not stated a cause of action under current third circuit case law.id.

iii.discussion 
to state a claim under,a plaintiff must allege a person acting under color of state law engaged in conduct that violated a right protected by the constitution or laws of the united states.nicini morra,cir en banc.accordingly,t he first step in evaluating a section claim is to identify the exact contours of the underlying right said to have been violated and to then determine whether the plaintiff has alleged a deprivation of a constitutional right at all.id.quoting cnty.of sacramento lewis,d.
as we noted at the outset,the morrows claim rests on the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.the due process clause provides that a state shall not deprive any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.const.amend.xiv.the morrows invoke the substantive component of due process,which protects individual liberty against certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.collins city of harker heights,d quoting daniels williams,d.specifically,the morrows allege that school officials violated a liberty interest by failing to protect emily and brittany from the threats and assaults inflicted by fellow students.
like the district court,we are sympathetic to the morrows plight.brittany and emily were verbally,physically and no doubt emotionally tormented by a fellow student who was adjudicated delinquent based on her actions against the morrow sisters.when the morrows requested that the defendants do something to protect brittany and emily from the persistent harassment and bullying,school officials responded by suggesting that the morrows consider moving to a different school rather than removing the bully from the school.
we therefore certainly understand why the morrows would conclude that the school response to the abuse inflicted on their daughters was unfair and unjust.nevertheless,our adjudication of the morrows claims must be governed by supreme court precedent.as we shall explain,it is also guided by authoritative supreme court dicta.
the supreme court has long established that a s a general matter,a state failure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the due process clause.deshaney winnebago cnty.dep t of social,d.the due process clause forbids the state itself from depriving individuals of life,liberty,or property without due process of law,but its language can not fairly be extended to impose an affirmative obligation on the state to ensure that those interests do not come to harm through other means.id.at.
in deshaney,the winnebago county department of social services received ongoing reports from family friends and medical personnel that a old boy joshua was suffering physical abuse at the hands of his father.at one point,the state obtained a court order placing joshua in the temporary custody of the local hospital,but later returned him to the custody of his abusive father.following joshua return,the county social worker assigned to the case continued to document multiple incidents of suspected abuse.despite these reports,the county failed to remove joshua from his father custody.eventually,the father beat joshua so badly that the boy suffered permanent brain damage.joshua and his mother sought redress by suing the county under.they argued that the county had denied them substantive due process under the fourteenth amendment by not protecting joshua from his father.id.at.
despite these undeniably tragic facts,id.at,the supreme court held that the county failure to provide joshua with adequate protection against his father violence did not amount to a substantive due process violation.the court explained that the due process clause limits state governments but does not generally impose an affirmative obligation upon states to protect individuals from private citizens.id.at.however,the court carved out a very narrow exception to that general rule wherein the constitution does impose upon the state affirmative duties of care and protection with respect to particular individuals.id.at.that exception has come to be known as the special relationship exception.it applies when a special relationship has been established because the state takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will.id.at.
in addition to the special relationship exception,we have recognized that the due process clause can impose an affirmative duty to protect if the state own actions create the very danger that causes the plaintiff injury.see kneipp tedder,cir.in kneipp,police officers stopped kneipp and her husband for causing a disturbance on a highway while they were walking home from a bar,but they thereafter allowed kneipp husband to continue to their home to tend to their son.kneipp husband later testified that because his wife was drunk,he assumed the officers would take her to the hospital or to the police station.however,the officers abandoned her despite her obvious intoxication,thereby forcing her to walk home alone in the cold.she subsequently fell down an embankment and suffered hypothermia resulting in permanent brain damage.id.at.in the subsequent suit against the state under,we held that the officers conduct denied kneipp her fourtheenth amendment right to substantive due process because the actions of the police created the danger that caused her injury.id.at.
accordingly,the morrows can state a claim under if they have adequately alleged circumstances giving rise to a special relationship between their daughters and the defendants pursuant to deshaney,or if their complaint adequately alleges affirmative conduct on the part of the defendants to support the danger exception that we adopted in kneipp.
special relationship 
as the court instructed in deshaney,an affirmative duty to protect may arise out of certain special relationships between the state and particular individuals.see deshaney,at.the supreme court has found that the relationship between the state and its incarcerated or involuntarily committed citizens is the kind of special relationship that creates an affirmative duty upon the state to provide adequate medical care to incarcerated prisoners,see estelle gamble,d,and to ensure the reasonable safety of involuntarily committed mental patients,youngberg romeo,d.estelle and youngberg,t aken together stand for the proposition that when the state takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will,the constitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety and general.deshaney,at.
it is clear from the decision in deshaney that the state constitutional duty to protect arises not from the state knowledge of the individual predicament or from its expressions of intent to help him,but from the limitation which it has imposed on his freedom to act on his own behalf.id.at.in other words,it is the state affirmative act of restraining the individual freedom to act on his own behalf through incarceration,institutionalization,or other similar restraint of personal liberty which is the deprivation of liberty triggering the protections of the due process clause,not its failure to act to protect his liberty interests against harms inflicted by other means.id.emphasis added.
a minor child attending public school most certainly does not have the freedom of action or independence of an adult nevertheless,the supreme court has not had occasion to specifically decide whether that is sufficient to create a special relationship between public schools and their students under the due process clause.we have,however,previously considered the application of the special relationship doctrine in the public school context.in middle bucks area vocational technical school,cir,a hearing and student and a classmate alleged that several male students physically,verbally,and sexually assaulted them during a graphic arts class during the school day over a period of several months.the male students forced them into the classroom unisex bathroom or darkroom and physically abused and sexually molested the plaintiffs multiple times per week.a student teacher was present in the classroom when the abuses occurred.although did not claim to have informed her of the situation,alleged that the teacher either heard the assaults or should have heard them.alleged that she complained to the school assistant director about the boys conduct,but he took no action.middle bucks,at.
although we recognized the horrific nature of the allegations,we nevertheless held that the school defendants authority over during the school day can not be said to create the type of physical custody necessary to bring it within the special relationship noted in deshaney.id.at.we rejected the plaintiffs argument that pennsylvania compulsory school attendance laws and the school exercise of in loco parentis authority over its students so restrain the students liberty that they can be considered to have been in state custody during school hours for fourteenth amendment purposes.id.at.our conclusion was largely informed by the fact that parents remain the primary caretakers,despite their children presence in school.id.at.we explained that t he estelle youngberg type custody referred to by the court in deshaney is to be sharply contrasted with situation.id.although the doctrine of in loco parentis certainly cloaks public schools with some authority over school children,see,morse frederick,d reviewing legal doctrine of in loco parentis,that control,without more,is not analogous to the state authority over an incarcerated prisoner or an individual who has been involuntarily committed to a mental facility.
nonetheless,when we decided middle bucks,the supreme court jurisprudence allowed room to debate this issue because the court had not enumerated the parameters of the control or custody required for the creation of a special relationship under the fourteenth amendment.accordingly,in a compelling dissent to the middle bucks majority,judge sloviter argued for a functional approach to custody 
i believe that we are free to decide that the state compulsion that students attend school,the status of most students as minors whose judgment is not fully mature,the discretion extended by the state to schools to control student behavior,and the pervasive control exercised by the schools over their students during the period of time they are in school,combine to create the type of special relationship which imposes a constitutional duty on the schools to protect the liberty interests of students while they are in the state functional custody.
middle bucks,at sloviter,dissenting,joined by mannsmann,scirica and nygaard,jj.see also maldonado josey,cir seymour,concurring i would hold that a child legally required to attend school and thereby forced into the temporary custody of the state agents is constitutionally entitled to some level of protection from harm and care for basic safety.
however,after our decision in middle bucks,the supreme court decided vernonia school district acton,d.there,the court clarified the applicability of deshaney special relationship exception in the context of public schools.the specific issue in vernonia was whether a public school policy requiring student athletes to submit to random drug testing violates the fourth amendment.id.at.in holding that such a policy does not violate the fourth amendment,the court noted central,in our view,to the present case is the fact that the subjects of the policy are children,who have been committed to the temporary custody of the state as schoolmaster.id.at.the court then stated w e do not,of course,suggest that public schools as a general matter have such a degree of control over children as to give rise to a constitutional duty to protect.id.at citing deshaney,at.
although that statement is technically dictum,we have previously explained that we can not lightly ignore the force of supreme court dicta.see in re mcdonald,cir moreover,although the statement was made in the context of the court analysis of a student athlete reasonable expectation of privacy in public schools,the citation to deshaney is no less pertinent to our inquiry because it provides insight into the court interpretation of deshaney application to public schools.indeed,short of an actual holding on the precise issue here,it is difficult to imagine a clearer or more forceful indicator of the court own interpretation of deshaney and the special relationship exception recognized there as applied to public schools.see id.the supreme court uses dicta to help control and influence the many issues it can not decide because of its limited docket.
in addition,every other circuit court of appeals that has considered this issue in a precedential opinion has rejected the argument that a special relationship generally exists between public schools and their students.see,hasenfus lajeunesse,cir doe covington cnty.sch,cir en banc doe claiborne,cir alton cmty.unit sch.dist,cir dorothy little rock sch,cir patel kent sch,cir maldonado josey,cir wyke polk cnty.sch,cir 
accordingly,the supreme court dictum in vernonia as well as the consensus from our sister circuit courts of appeals both reinforce our conclusion that public schools,as a general matter,do not have a constitutional duty to protect students from private actors.we know of nothing that has occurred in the twenty years since we decided middle bucks that would undermine this conclusion.we therefore find the dissent assertion here that factual developments since middle bucks have further undercut its rationale,fuentes dissent,unpersuasive.the first two examples our dissenting colleagues offer of schools exercising greater control over students include the use of technology tracking student movement to ensure they are in and the monitoring of social media activity by students id.such examples merely illustrate new precautionary measures some schools have undertaken in response to emerging technology.it is difficult to see how such measures constitute limitations on a student freedom to act on his own behalf,see deshaney,at,that are so severely restrictive as to equate public school students with prisoners or those who are involuntarily committed to secure mental institutions.
similarly,a school exercise of authority to lock classrooms in the wake of tragedies such as those that have occurred in newtown,connecticut and colombine,colorado,see fuentes dissent,may be a relevant factor in determining whether a special relationship or a danger exists in those specific cases.however,the fact that certain schools may resort to such restrictions does not advance our inquiry here or allow us to conclude that the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to give rise to a special relationship or a state created danger.
in arguing that we should find a special relationship here,judge fuentes cites to judge becker statement in dissent in middle bucks that a special relationship between a public school and its students may exist under certain narrow circumstances.fuentes dissent.we do not disagree.in holding that public schools do not generally have a constitutional duty to protect students from private actors and that the allegations here are not sufficient to establish a special relationship,we do not foreclose the possibility of a special relationship arising between a particular school and particular students under certain unique and narrow circumstances.however,any such circumstances must be so significant as to forge a different kind of relationship between a student and a school than that which is inherent in the discretion afforded school administrators as part of the school traditional in loco parentis authority or compulsory attendance laws.
the circumstances that our dissenting colleagues rely upon to insist that a special relationship exists under the facts alleged here are not certain narrow circumstances at all.instead,they are endemic in the relationship between public schools and their students.the dissent would hold that a special relationship exists such that blackhawk undertook a limited obligation to keep the morrows safe because blackhawk compelled school attendance,exercised extensive control over not only the student victims but also the specific threat at issue in the case a violent bully subject to two restraining orders and enforced school policies that prevented the morrows from being fully able to protect themselves.fuentes dissent.however,those factors do not distinguish the circumstances here from those that arise in the general relationship between public schools and their students.
as discussed above,we can not hold that a special relationship arose from compulsory school attendance laws and the concomitant in loco parentis authority and discretion that schools necessarily exercise over students,or the school failure to do more to protect brittany and emily,without ignoring the analysis in deshaney,and the considered dicta in vernonia school district.in arguing to the contrary,our dissenting colleagues exaggerate the extent of a school control over its students.judge fuentes insists that t he state authority over children while they are in school extends beyond their and is nearly absolute.fuentes dissent emphasis added.however,the mere fact that a school can require uniforms.stat.ann,or prescribe certain behavior while students are in school,does not suggest a special relationship at all.rather,such commonly accepted authority over student conduct is inherent in the nature of the relationship of public schools and their pupils they do not suggest that a concomitant constitutional duty to protect students necessarily arises from that authority.
significantly,our dissenting colleagues do not purport to argue that compulsory attendance laws and the school authority over students are themselves sufficient to satisfy the limited exception carved out in deshaney.thus,the dissent attempts to characterize the specific circumstances of this case as so extraordinary and compelling that a constitutional duty to protect arose under deshaney.we are not persuaded.
the fact that the specific threat at issue in this case was a violent bully subject to two restraining orders,fuentes dissent,does not necessarily give rise to a special relationship.the restraining orders to which the dissent refers were addressed to anderson,not the defendants,and the orders themselves do not impose any affirmative duties on the defendants.indeed,we very much doubt that any defendant was a party to the proceedings that resulted in the orders,and no such involvement has been alleged.although the defendants,and other third parties,are prohibited from making contact with the morrow children on anderson behalf,the orders can not reasonably be interpreted as imposing any obligation on the defendants to ensure anderson compliance with the orders or to otherwise enforce them.town of castle rock gonzales,d holding that police department failure to enforce restraining order did not constitute a violation of due process under the fourteenth amendment.
moreover,whether our dissenting colleagues are referencing the school no tolerance policy,or the policy that allegedly required anderson expulsion from school,in arguing that the defendants enforced school policies that prevented the morrows from being fully able to protect themselves,fuentes dissent,neither the mere existence of such common disciplinary policies,nor the school exercise of discretion in enforcing them,altered the relationship between the school and its students to the extent required to create a constitutional duty under the supreme court precedent 
the morrows attempt to distinguish their situation based on the defendants actual knowledge of anderson criminal conduct in this case is similarly unpersuasive.they argue that such knowledge,combined with the relationship that exists in all cases between a public school and its pupils,created a special relationship for substantive due process purposes.
deshaney suggests otherwise.neither our decision in middle bucks,nor the dictum in vernonia,necessarily forecloses the possibility of a special relationship arising in an appropriate case.however,the court has instructed that any such relationship arises not from the state knowledge of the individual predicament or from its expressions of intent to help him,but from the limitation which it has imposed on his freedom to act on his own behalf.deshaney,at.thus,under deshaney,the defendants knowledge of both the orders and anderson threats and conduct may be relevant to determining whether the defendants conduct was sufficiently egregious to violate a previously existing duty to protect the morrow children,but that knowledge can not create a duty that did not otherwise exist.
to find a special relationship here,our dissenting colleagues rely,in part,on our analysis in the foster care context in nicini morra,cir en banc.see fuentes dissent.however,we explained there that distinctions between children placed in foster care and the prisoners at issue in estelle or the institutionalized mentally retarded persons at issue in youngberg are matters of degree rather than of kind.in each of these cases the state,by affirmative act,renders the individual substantially dependent upon the state to meet his or her basic needs.id.at alteration in original citation omitted quoting middle bucks,at.by finding the children and placing them with state approved families,the state assumes an important continuing,if not immediate,responsibility for the child wellbeing.id.quoting middle bucks,at 
as we explained in middle bucks,unlike children in foster care,students in public schools continue to be primarily dependent on their parents for their care and protection,not on their school.despite the students compulsory attendance in school during the school day and the school authority to act in loco parentis during that time,the school authority and responsibility neither supplants nor replaces the parent ultimate responsibility for the student absent more than is alleged here.unlike foster care,the restrictions that schools place on students generally,and the specific restrictions alleged here,are different in kind from the restrictions faced by the prisoners at issue in estelle or the institutionalized persons in youngberg.
this point is illustrated by the fact that schools generally may not administer medical treatment to students without first obtaining parental consent.see parents united for better,sch.dist.of phila.bd.of,the principle that parental consent must be secured before schools may provide medical treatment is time honored and has been recognized by both the courts and the legislature.in contrast,when a minor enters foster care,state actors have the authority to bypass parental consent by obtaining a court order authorizing medical treatment.see,b.stat.ann.stating that the custodian,to whom legal custody of a child has been given by the court of common pleas under the juvenile act,has the right to determine the nature of the care and treatment of the child,including ordinary medical care when a state agency has custody of a minor child for whom a decree of termination of parental rights has been entered,the agency acquires authority to consent to all medical examination or treatment,including major medical,psychiatric and surgical treatment of the minor even without obtaining a court order.see.stat.ann.c.
the dissent citation to smith district of columbia,is also unavailing.in smith,the court found a special relationship between the district of columbia and an adjudicated delinquent whom the district had,by affirmative exercise of its police power,placed with its agent,an independent living program,through a court order revocable only by another court order.id.at.the dissent argues that l ike the children in smith,the morrows were technically free to come and go from school after certain hours but risk ed punishment for fail ing to obey the state restrictions on their freedom while in school.fuentes dissent alterations in original quoting smith,at.however,the fact that the juvenile in smith enjoyed a degree of freedom of movement while housed at the independent living program is not determinative.the state liability arose from the fact that the state,through court order,had removed the juvenile from the care and custody of his parents and required him to live under the care and custody of the independent living program,which was acting as the state agent under a very detailed contract between the program and the state.
in deshaney,the supreme court expressly noted that h ad the state by the affirmative exercise of its power removed the child from free society and placed him in a foster home operated by its agents,we might have a situation sufficiently analogous to incarceration or institutionalization to give rise to an affirmative duty to protect.deshaney,at.that is precisely what happened in nicini it is not what happened here.moreover,the court acknowledged in deshaney that several courts of appeals have held,by analogy to estelle and youngberg,that the state may be held liable under the due process clause for failing to protect children in foster homes.id.citing this footnote,the court in smith found that the independent living program there presents a scenario close to the one described in the deshaney footnote.smith,at.
the dissent contends that this focus on who remains the victim primary caregiver contrast s sharply with our holding in horton flenory,cir.fuentes dissent.we agree that the facts of horton are instructive,but believe that they clearly counsel against imposing a constitutional duty here.
in horton,the owner of a nightclub suspected an employee,powdrill,of burglarizing the club.the owner and another employee began interrogating powdrill about the burglary.during that interrogation,powdrill was severely beaten.the owner was a retired veteran of the local police department,at,and the township where the club was located had a n official policy of deferring to private owners with respect to the investigation of crimes in private clubs.id.at.nevertheless,the owner did eventually call police.an officer,who had served on the police force with the owner,subsequently arrived,but the officer left powdrill alone in the owner custody noting that powdrill was in good hands despite observing blood and evidence of a beating.id.at.after the officer left,powdrill was beaten again and subsequently died from his injuries.his estate brought an action against the municipality and the responding officer under.we held that the township could be liable because the jury could have found that the township had delegated its traditional police functions to the owner of the club.id.at.the responding officer used his official status to confirm that the owner was free to continue the custodial interrogation even though powdrill was in fear for his safety and wanted to leave.id.although we framed the precise issue there as whether or not powdrill was in state custody at the time of the fatal beating,id,our inquiry focused on whether the defendant had so limited powdrill ability to act in his own interest as to create the special relationship required for constitutional liability.we explained 
deshaney requires that the state have imposed some kind of limitation on a victim ability to act in his own interests.while specifically referring to imprisonment and institutionalization the estelle and youngberg examples the court acknowledges that other similar restraints of personal liberty trigger a state duty to prevent harm.
our finding of a special relationship in horton also turned on the fact that the abuser there acted pursuant to delegated state authority.
from the evidence the jury could find that new kensington delegated to the owner its traditional police functions a state can be held responsible for a private action if the private actor has exercised coercive power with significant encouragement,overt or covert,from the state.the function of investigating crimes is clearly a governmental function.an official policy of deferring to private owners with respect to the investigation of crimes in private clubs,which the jury could have found from the evidence,suffices to permit a legal conclusion that the owner,maintaining custody over powdrill,was exercising a delegated state function.
id.citations omitted.
the custody that the plaintiff in horton was subjected to when he was fatally beaten was thus akin to the state custody over prisoners.the township had ceded its police authority to detain and interrogate to the club owner.the control a school has over its students does not begin to approximate the restriction of freedom of movement and isolation from possible assistance that existed in horton or other cases prescribed by deshaney and its progeny.
despite our dissenting colleagues suggestion that the school passivity here amounted to affirmative conduct,there is no assertion that anderson acted under authority delegated by the school or that she exercised coercive power with significant encouragement from the school.see id.in fact,anderson was disciplined for her conduct.although the school response may well have been as inadequate as it was unfair to the morrow children,the school certainly did not give anderson or her confederate the authority to harass or bully the morrow children.we therefore see no conflict between our analysis here and our analysis in horton.
in reaching this conclusion,we reiterate that we both appreciate the morrows concerns and that we are sympathetic to their plight.parents in their position should be able to send their children off to school with some level of comfort that those children will be safe from bullies such as anderson and her confederate.indeed,the increasing prevalence of the kind of bullying alleged here has generated considerable discussion and legislative action.see new york city dep t of,d,discussing the problem of school bullying in the united states nonetheless,the constitution does not provide judicial remedies for every social ill.lindsey normet,d.given the limitations of deshaney,and the language in vernonia,it is now clear that the redress the morrows seek must come from a source other than the united states constitution.
our dissenting colleagues take us to task for expressing concern for the morrows plight without providing a remedy and suggest that the very fact that we are troubled by the result counsels in favor of a constitutional remedy.see fuentes dissent the morrows are today left without a legal remedy for these actions.that future victims may seek relief from state legislatures is of no help to them.we do not adequately discharge our duty to interpret the constitution by merely describing the facts of these cases as tragic and invoking state tort law.internal citation and quotation marks omitted alteration in original ambro partial concurrence and partial dissent i share judge fuentes concern that failing to hold a school accountable for violence done to students creates an incentive for school administrators to pursue inaction when they are uniquely situated to prevent harm to their students.
however,the due process clause is not a surrogate for local tort law or state statutory and administrative remedies.hasenfus lajeunesse,cir.nor is s ubstantive due process a license for judges to supersede the decisions of local officials and elected legislators on such matters.id.
obviously,neither our holding here nor the supreme court jurisprudence forecloses states from providing public school students and their parents with personally enforceable remedies under state law.we realize that pennsylvania courts have held that school districts are the beneficiaries of immunity pursuant to the political subdivision tort claim act now codified at.and are not subject to tort liability when students are injured in the course of the school day,even if,assuming arguendo,there was negligence on the part of the school officials.auerbach council rock sch.however,state legislatures retain the authority to reconsider and change such restrictions in order to better respond to the kind of bullying that happened here and that appears to be all too pervasive in far too many of today schools.see new york city dep t of,d at.
for the reasons we have explained,we can not fashion a constitutional remedy under the special relationship theory based on the facts alleged in this case.
state created danger 
the morrows alternatively argue that the defendants had a duty to protect brittany and emily because they created or exacerbated a dangerous situation.as we explained above,in kneipp tedder,at,we first adopted the danger theory as a way to establish a constitutional violation in suits brought under.we confirmed that liability may attach where the state acts to create or enhance a danger that deprives the plaintiff of his or her fourteenth amendment right to substantive due process.kneipp,at.to prevail on this theory,the morrows must prove the following four elements 
the harm ultimately caused was foreseeable and fairly direct 
a state actor acted with a degree of culpability that shocks the conscience 
a relationship between the state and the plaintiff existed such that the plaintiff was a foreseeable victim of the defendant acts,or a member of a discrete class of persons subjected to the potential harm brought about by the state actions,as opposed to a member of the public in general and 
a state actor affirmatively used his or her authority in a way that created a danger to the citizen or that rendered the citizen more vulnerable to danger than had the state not acted at all.
bright westmoreland,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the defendants focus on the last prong of the test they argue that the morrows have failed to allege any affirmative action by school administrators that made the morrow children more vulnerable than they would have been had the administrators stood by and done nothing at all.the morrows argue that the defendants affirmative act was suspending anderson,and then implicitly inviting her to return to school following the suspension.in other words,the morrows argue that by permitting anderson to return to school rather than expelling her,school officials affirmatively used their authority to create a danger that anderson would attack brittany and emily once again.the morrows also point to the affirmative act of allowing anderson to board the morrow children school bus,where anderson threatened to attack brittany.
we have explained that the line between action and inaction is not always easily drawn.if the state puts a man in a position of danger from private persons and then fails to protect him,it will not be heard to say that its role was merely passive it is as much an active tortfeasor as if it had thrown him into a snake pit.middle bucks,at quoting bowers devito,cir.however,the morrows complaint simply attempts to redefine clearly passive inaction as affirmative acts.sanford stiles,cir holding that,where a high school guidance counselor failed to properly evaluate the sincerity of a student comment to another student that he wanted to kill himself,she had not committed an affirmative act but rather failed to prevent his death.
we are not persuaded by the morrows argument that the defendants affirmatively created or enhanced a danger to brittany and emily by suspending anderson and then allowing her to return to school when the suspension ended.although the suspension was an affirmative act by school officials,we fail to see how the suspension created a new danger for the morrow children or rendered them more vulnerable to danger than had the state not acted at all.bright,at.to the contrary,the suspension likely made the morrows safer,albeit temporarily.in addition,the fact that defendants failed to expel anderson,or,as the morrows would describe it,permitted anderson to return to school after the suspension ended,does not suggest an affirmative act.
while the morrows make much of the fact that defendants failure to expel anderson after she was adjudicated guilty of a crime may have been contrary to a school policy mandating expulsion in such circumstances,we decline to hold that a school alleged failure to enforce a disciplinary policy is equivalent to an affirmative act under the circumstances here.
the dissent argues that defendants failure to expel anderson constitutes an affirmative exercise of authority that contributed to the danger the morrows faced,thereby triggering a duty to protect.under this reasoning,however,every decision by school officials to use or decline to use their authority,disciplinary or otherwise,would constitute affirmative conduct that may trigger a duty to protect.the dissent claims that state authority necessarily brings with it discretion as to whether or not to take specific actions,and the decision to take one action over another or to take no action at all is itself an affirmative exercise of authority that may carry serious consequences.fuentes dissent.thus,were we to accept the dissent formulation here,the danger exception would swallow the rule schools would always be liable,under the dissent view,for any injury that could be linked to either action or inaction.any and all failures to act would be transformed into an affirmative exercise of authority.
the morrows also rely on the fact that the defendants permitted anderson to board emily and brittany bus despite knowing about the orders against anderson,and knowing that that bus did not service anderson home route.however,the only reasonable interpretation of that allegation is that the defendants failed to take any affirmative steps to ensure that anderson did not board the morrow children bus here again,the complaint attempts to morph passive inaction into affirmative acts.however,merely restating the defendants inaction as an affirmative failure to act does not alter the passive nature of the alleged conduct.
as judge ambro explains,the requirement of an actual affirmative act is not intended to turn on semantics of act and omission.instead,the requirement serves to distinguish cases where officials might have done more from cases where officials created or increased the risk itself.ambro partial concurrence and partial dissent.we therefore hold that the complaint also fails to state a cause of action under the danger exception.
iv.conclusion 
for all the reasons set forth above,we will affirm the district court order granting the defendants motion to dismiss 
i join chief judge mckee majority opinion in its entirety.i write separately only to explain the limited circumstances under which i believe we may overrule one of our prior en banc decisions.
stare decisis should be more than a phrase.oregon ex rel.state land bd.corvallis sand gravel,d marshall,dissenting.yet it is nothing more than that if it does not require us,in the ordinary course,to adhere to a precedent with which we disagree.and even sitting en banc,we do not conduct a plenary of our prior decisions we instead remain constrained by our precedent to the degree counseled by principles of stare decisis.bolden se.transp,cir en banc.indeed,even in constitutional cases such as this one,the doctrine of stare decisis carries such persuasive force that departing from it has always required some special justification.arizona rumsey,d.
according to the supreme court,those justifications must be nothing short of exceptional.randall sorrell,so largely because it rejected the argument that enforced segregation laws were intended to stamp blacks with a badge of inferiority.id.the next sixty years of experience,however,directly disproved this premise,showing that facilities nonetheless had the effect of creating unequal educational opportunities based on race.brown bd.of educ.of topeka,shawnee.whatever may have been the extent of psychological knowledge at the time of plessy ferguson,this finding is amply supported by modern authority.such experience justified indeed,required the court to correct its clearly erroneous interpretation of the purpose behind the enforced segregation laws and overrule plessy.see id.at.
a less egregious example of precedent that was rightly discarded is miles medical john park sons.in miles,the supreme court held that vertical price agreements between a manufacturer and its distributors were per se antitrust violations.the court reasoned that such vertical agreements were economically analogous to unlawful horizontal agreements among competing distributors because vertical agreements always tended to restrict competition and decrease output.id.at.nearly a century later,though,the supreme court recognized the differences in economic effect between vertical and horizontal agreements,differences the miles court failed to consider.leegin creative leather,psks,d.with the economic literature replete with procompetitive justifications for vertical price agreements between,d quoting rumsey,at.if its precedent reasoning was clearly wrong,then stare decisis loses some though not all of its force.see dickerson united states,d whether or not we would agree with miranda reasoning and its resulting rule were we addressing the issue in the first instance,the principles of stare decisis weigh heavily against overruling it now.see also mcdonald city of,d scalia,concurring despite my misgivings about substantive due process as an original matter,i have acquiesced in the court incorporation of certain guarantees in the bill of rights because it is both long established and narrowly limited.quotation marks and citation omitted.perhaps a prior case has become unworkable that is,newly discovered facts have undermined the case reasoning,subsequent legal developments have unmoored the case from its doctrinal anchors,or experience has otherwise pointed up the precedent shortcomings.pearson callahan,d leegin creative leather,psks,d.and if the precedent is particularly recent and has not generated any serious reliance interests,the rigging controlling the sails of stare decisis carries additional slack.see,citizens united fec,d montejo louisiana,d.

none of these special justifications are present here.
middle bucks interpretation of the supreme court decision in deshaney winnebago county department of social services,d,was correct at the time it was decided.deshaney held that substantive due process does not confer a right to state protection except when the state affirmatively acts to restrict a person freedom to act on his own behalf,through imprisonment,institutionalization,or other similar restraint of personal liberty.id.at.in middle bucks area vocational technical school,we interpreted other similar restraint of personal liberty to require total and involuntary state custody with no access to private assistance,cir en banc institutionalized persons are wholly dependent upon the state for food,shelter,clothing,and safety.it is not within their power to provide for themselves,nor are they given the opportunity to seek outside help to meet their basic needs.obviously,they are not free to leave.we then concluded that,unlike prisoners and institutionalized individuals,students are not rendered totally dependent on the state just because the state requires them to attend school.id.
the reasonableness of that interpretation of deshaney requirement is.to be sure,the middle bucks dissent viewed deshaney requirement more expansively to reach not only custodial restraints such as incarceration and involuntary institutionalization but also situations in which an individual faces substantial state compulsion.id.at sloviter,dissenting.but compared to incarceration and institutionalization,substantial state compulsion is not a similar restraint of personal liberty a state can substantially compel a person without so restrain ing his liberty that it renders him unable to care for himself while fail ing to provide for his basic human needs.deshaney,at.even if,as the majority notes,the supreme court jurisprudence at the time of middle bucks allowed room to debate this issue,majority op.at,the very point of stare decisis is to forbid us from revisiting a debate every time there are reasonable arguments to be made on both sides.agostini felton,d explaining that stare decisis reflects a policy judgment that in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right quoting burnet coronado oil gas.brandeis,concurring.middle bucks reasoning was not so clearly wrong that we may or should cast it aside.
and that is especially true when one considers the limited nature of en banc review.en banc review is primarily reserved for correcting and maintaining consistency in panel decisions involving difficult and important questions of law.fed.a see,united states games perez,cir gorsuch,dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc s urely it is uncontroversial to suggest that the point of the en banc process,the very reason for its existence,is to correct grave errors in panel precedents when they become apparent emphasis added pfizer,apotex,newman,dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc the function of en banc hearings is not only to eliminate conflicts,but also to correct and deter panel opinions that are pretty clearly wrong.emphasis added internal quotation marks and citations omitted.we do not sit en banc to reopen settled issues which have already been given en banc treatment absent intervening developments undermining our earlier decision.igartua united states,cir lynch,concurring in the denial of en banc review see also mckinney,at t his is the first time this court sitting en banc has addressed this issue thus,the implications of stare decisis are less weighty than if we were overturning a precedent established by the court en banc.absent such exceptional intervening developments,the essence of stare decisis is that the mere existence of middle bucks becomes a reason for adhering to its holding in subsequent cases.united states reyes hernandez,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
intervening legal and factual developments have only strengthened our decision in middle bucks.since then,the supreme court has sharply circumscribed substantive due process,limiting its protections to only those carefully described,unenumerated rights that are deeply rooted in this nation history and tradition and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.chavez martinez,d quoting washington glucksberg,d see also dist.att y office for third judicial dist.osborne,d refusing to recognize a liberty interest protected by due process unless it is so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
it can hardly be said that neither liberty nor justice would exist,by forgoing a judicially enforceable right against the states to protect students from private harm.history points the other way.under the doctrine of in loco parentis,states have long permitted schools to exercise control over students on the theory that parents delegated part of their parental authority to the schools during the school day.see.s choolteachers and administrators had almost complete discretion to establish and enforce the rules they believed were necessary to maintain control over their classrooms discretion that the judiciary was reluctant to interfere with.safford unified sch.dist.redding,d thomas,concurring internal quotations and citations omitted see also lewisburg area sch.dist.bd.of sch,noting that local school boards have broad discretion in determining school disciplinary policy and that a court may not act as a super school board by substituting its own judgment for that of the school district washington seattle sch.dist,d no single tradition in public education is more deeply rooted than local control over the operation of schools quoting milliken bradley,d.faced with a tradition that once permitted almost no judicial limitations on schools disciplinary authority,id.at,i can not conclude that substantive due process enshrines the opposite a right to judicial intervention in school disciplinary decisions.the mere novelty of such a claim is reason enough to doubt that substantive due process sustains it.osborne,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
just as the constriction of substantive due process has bolstered middle bucks vitality,there are no new factual developments that undermine the decision reasoning.to be sure,a body of intervening research has revealed that school bullying undeniably causes serious harm to its victims.this evidence,however,has no bearing on middle bucks rationale.first,the severity of harm caused by bullying is irrelevant to middle bucks constitutional judgment that substantive due process is not triggered by substantial state compulsion.see,planned parenthood of se.casey,d acknowledging that time has overtaken some of roe wade factual assumptions about when a fetus is viable and when abortions are safe for the mother,but concluding that these developments have no bearing on the soundness or unsoundness of roe constitutional judgment that viability marks the earliest point at which the state interest in fetal life is constitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic abortions.after all,substantive due process does not entail a body of constitutional law imposing liability whenever someone cloaked with state authority causes harm.cnty.of sacramento lewis,d.
second,empirical revelations about bullying effects do not change middle bucks factual judgment that compulsory education laws fall short of making students wholly dependent on the state.if anything,students are subjected to less state compulsion today than at the time of middle bucks.with increased availability of private schooling,homeschooling,private tutoring,online and distance education,and charter schools,modern families have more options to satisfy the compulsory school laws.and school authority over students has significantly eroded in favor of parental control and private sources of assistance.see new jersey,d more generally,the court has recognized that the concept of parental delegation as a source of school authority is not entirely consonant with compulsory education laws.today public school officials do not merely exercise authority voluntarily conferred on them by individual parents rather,they act in furtherance of publicly mandated educational and disciplinary policies.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the most serious disciplinary problems are handled by police officers and the legal system,not school administrators and the disciplinary code.see,in re,commonwealth williams.states no longer permit schools to inflict corporal punishment.see,a.and so forth.
students these days also have the protection of state tort laws that did not exist when we decided middle bucks.nearly every state has enacted laws since we decided middle bucks,showing that our decision has not prevented states from experimenting with their own solutions to the problems of bullying.there is no institutional need to send judges off on a to prevent and cure the effects of school bullying when legislators are able to amass the stuff of actual experience and cull conclusions from it.mcdonald.at breyer,dissenting quoting united states gainey,d.to suddenly constitutionalize this area would what looks to be a prompt and considered legislative response.osborne,at.if the people of pennsylvania,delaware,new jersey and the virgin islands want to expose their schools to greater liability for inaction,or if they desire different solutions to the problem that all on this en banc court agree bullying to be,it is their prerogative to do so.middle bucks does not stand in their way.
in fact,pennsylvania,like many other states,has deliberately chosen not to make schools and other local government agencies liable for claims like the morrows.pennsylvania political subdivision tort claims act.see sanford stiles,cir per curiam explaining that local state agencies,including school districts,are given broad tort immunity under the pennsylvania political subdivision tort claims act tackett pine richland sch,holding that the pennsylvania political subdivision tort claims act immunized a school district from liability where a teacher alleged failure to supervise students chemistry experiment caused an explosion and severely burned a student auerbach council rock sch,holding that the political subdivision tort claims act immunized a school district from liability for injuries,even if school district allegedly failed to protect the victim or supervise the attacker husser sch.dist.of pittsburgh,holding that a school district was entitled to governmental immunity for a student mugging even if school officials knew of similar criminal acts that had occurred with great frequency in the months immediately prior to the attack and took no precautionary measures.and of course,state law usually provides victims with the ability to sue and recover from bullies who assault,inflict emotional distress on,or commit other torts against fellow students and from the parents whose negligent care allow the bullies to do so.see restatement second of torts discussing children tort liability,discussing a parent tort liability for negligently controlling his child see,condel savo,permitting a tort action against parents who kn e w of the habit of their child of striking other children with sticks and took no steps to correct,or restrain the child.
lastly,even though middle bucks is only two decades old,schools have come to rely on it in developing their personnel and behavioral policies.schools have long operated under a regime in which they have no affirmative federal duty to protect students from private violence during the school day.there is no reason to upset these expectations by imposing an amorphous,judicially created standard that raises more questions than it answers especially when states have proven themselves capable of addressing the problem of bullying.osborne,at it is hard to imagine what tools federal courts would use to answer such questions t here is no reason to suspect that their answers to these questions would be any better than those of state courts and legislatures,and good reason to suspect the opposite.mcdonald.at stevens,dissenting another key constraint on substantive due process analysis is respect for the democratic process.if a particular liberty interest is already being given careful consideration in,and subjected to ongoing calibration by,the states,judicial enforcement may not be appropriate.abruptly reversing course would require precisely the sort of extensive legislative response that stare decisis aims to avoid.hilton pub.rys.comm n,d noting that stare decisis has added force when the legislature has relied on a previous decision in such a way that overruling that decision would require an extensive legislative response.
it comes as no surprise,then,that middle bucks is no legal anomaly deserving of abandonment.randall,at.aside from the second and circuits,which have not considered the issue,all other courts of appeals have held that compulsory school attendance,coupled with schools authority over their students,does not trigger the protections of substantive due process.doe covington cnty.sch,cir en banc patel kent sch,cir stevenson martin cnty.bd.of,app x,cir hasenfus lajeunesse,cir wyke polk cnty.sch,cir sargi kent city bd.of,cir dorothy little rock sch,cir involving an intellectually disabled high school boy assaulted by another intellectually disabled student maldonado josey,cir alton cmty.unit sch.dist,cir.it is rarely appropriate to overrule circuit precedent just to move from one side of the conflict to another,united states corner,cir en banc,and no compelling basis warrants our creating a conflict here where none exists,wagner pennwest farm credit,aca,cir in light of such an array of unanimous precedent from seven other courts of appeals,we would require a compelling basis to hold otherwise before effecting a circuit split.butler cnty.mem l hosp.heckler,cir t his court should be reluctant to contradict the unanimous position of other circuits.
in short,nothing convinces me that adherence to middle bucks puts us on a course that is sure error.citizens united.at.departing from middle bucks would create a circuit split in exchange for forsaking the supreme court repeated reluctance against expanding substantive due process.see nasa nelson,d.that,to me,is a proposition.
i share judge fuentes concern that failing to hold a school accountable for violence done to students creates an incentive for school administrators to pursue inaction when they are uniquely situated to prevent harm to their students.for that reason,as well as the others in judge fuentes exceptional opinion,i wholeheartedly join part i of the dissent,and would hold that a special relationship exists between the school and its students.
but i can not agree that the facts of this case demonstrate a cause of action under our danger theory.the majority concludes that the school decision not to expel anderson is a failure to act and one that did not render the morrows more susceptible to danger.i agree,but think we must delve further.thus,while i join that part of the court judgment,i write separately on this issue.
the fourth requirement of our danger claim is that a state actor affirmatively used his or her authority in a way that created a danger to the citizen or that rendered the citizen more vulnerable to danger than had the state not acted at all.bright westmoreland,cir.this test,i believe,is not intended to turn on the semantics of act and omission.instead,the requirement serves an important purpose to distinguish cases where government officials might have done more to protect a citizen from a risk of harm in contrast to cases where government officials created or increased the risk itself.following violence,suffering,death of one of our citizens,we often wish that a state actor with the authority to do so had intervened.we are not comforted by concluding that officials failed to act when we could just as easily say that they affirmatively decided to do something.but we are limited by the protection afforded by the constitution and the supreme court holding in deshaney winnebago cnty.dep t of soc,d a state failure to protect an individual simply does not constitute a violation of the due process clause.we have recognized a narrow exception to deshaney rule a constitutional remedy may exist when a government actor creates or increases the risk to a citizen.id.at kneipp tedder,cir.
judge fuentes makes the most compelling case possible it may be inferred from the complaint that the school did do something by deciding to suspend rather than expel anderson,and then continuing to keep her in school despite repeated acts of violence,criminal adjudication,and a disciplinary code that directed expulsion.fuentes dissent.but the context of the school decision the prior violence,the order,the disciplinary code,and the ability to protect the morrows by expelling anderson are factors relevant to the school special relationship with the morrows.i do not believe we can consider these factors to deem the school behavior a creation of risk.the school acted no differently in failing to protect a vulnerable member of society from harm than defendants in cases where no danger exists,including deshaney.at risk of abuse suffered by four year old left in the care of his father was not created by social workers who had previously removed him and returned him to the home sanford stiles,cir high school student risk of suicide not caused or increased by guidance counselor who met with him twice bright,risk of attack not created by police who failed to arrest attacker after he violated parole.
holding that the school actions or lack thereof in this case were sufficient to plead a danger claim would substantially broaden this narrow exception.deshaney is grounded in constitutional law,but has an important practical effect too.federal courts can not be the forum for every complaint that a government actor could have taken an alternate course that would have avoided harm to one of our citizens.i also worry that creating a constitutional tort out of a school failure to expel a student creates a incentive for schools to expel quickly students who engage in any violent behavior in order to avoid liability or the threat of suit.
the special relationship theory,which is far more circumscribed,does not present this same risk.accordingly,i concur in part and dissent in part.
over the course of several months,minors brittany and emily morrow the morrows suffered repeated physical and verbal assaults at the hand of a bully and her friend,classmates in their public school in the blackhawk school district in pennsylvania the school or blackhawk the attacks included racially motivated assaults,verbal harassment of the morrows in their home and,attempting to push brittany down a flight of stairs during school hours,and violent physical assaults on the morrows at a school football game and on a school bus.early on in this history of attacks,the bully was charged by the authorities with assault and making terroristic threats,was eventually placed on probation by the court of common pleas,and was ordered to have no contact with brittany.school officials were aware of these proceedings and had even suspended the bully for a brief period before she was placed on probation.nevertheless,the bully was readmitted to school and some of the instances of violence described above occurred after her return.eventually,the bully was adjudicated a juvenile delinquent and was again ordered to have no contact with brittany.it also bears noting that many of the bully attacks occurred after blackhawk officials had suspended the morrows themselves for their involvement in the dispute,pursuant to the school no tolerance policy.it is reasonable to infer that,to the morrows,application of the policy which could have led to their permanent expulsion from the school meant that they risked disciplinary action should they act to forestall attacks by the bully.despite all this,blackhawk officials refused to protect the morrows from danger.when the morrows sought help,they were told that the school would not guarantee their safety and,surprisingly,that their best course of action would be to find another school.
the morrows are today left without a legal remedy for these actions.that future victims may seek relief from state legislatures,majority op.at,is of no help to them.we do not adequately discharge our duty to interpret the constitution by merely describing the facts of these cases as tragic and invoking state tort law.doe ex rel.magee covington cnty.sch,cir en banc weiner,dissenting citing maldonado josey,cir seymour,concurring.
worse,today result is wrong as a matter of law.the legal and factual relationship between students and school officials during the school day,the coercive power that the state exercises over school children,and the role of the school officials in this case in placing the morrows in greater danger,all dictate a result contrary to that reaffirmed and endorsed today.
i.the existence of a special relationship between the morrows and blackhawk school officials 
twenty years ago,a narrow majority of this court decided in middle bucks area vocational technical school,cir en banc,that school officials have no obligation to protect school children from any physical harm that may occur during school hours.close analysis of the reasoning in middle bucks,however,shows that its entire legal basis was a misunderstanding of the supreme court seminal decision in deshaney winnebago county social services,d,and of the relationship between the state and school children.
reconsidering the coercive power that the state exercises over students,and the ways in which the state may restrict a student and his or her parents ability to protect that student from harm,we would conclude,like judge becker in middle bucks,that a special relationship may exist under certain narrow circumstances.see middle bucks,at becker,dissenting.as pertains to this case,we would hold that blackhawk undertook a limited obligation to keep the morrows safe from harm at the hands of the bully because blackhawk compelled school attendance,exercised extensive control over not only the student victims but also the specific threat at issue in the case a violent bully subject to two restraining orders that victimized the morrows over an extended period of time and enforced school policies that prevented the morrows from being fully able to protect themselves.
as the majority outlines,in deshaney the supreme court held that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment did not impose on the state of wisconsin a blanket affirmative duty to interfere with the parental relationship between randy deshaney and his son joshua,and that therefore the state was not liable for harm the child suffered or was likely to suffer at the hands of his father.at.the court noted that an affirmative duty to protect arose only if there was a special relationship between the state and the imperiled individual,and that the state actions in taking temporary custody of joshua and later returning him to his father,who was known to be abusive,were insufficient to give rise to such a relationship.id.at.
the deshaney court referred to two cases that exemplify when a state enters into a special relationship.in estelle gamble,the court had held that the eighth amendment imposed a duty to provide adequate medical care to prisoners given that they were unable to procure such care on their own by reason of the deprivation of their liberty by the state.id.at quoting estelle gamble,d.and in youngblood romeo,the court extended estelle holding to require states to provide involuntarily committed mental patients with such services as are necessary to ensure their reasonable safety from themselves and others.id.at quoting youngblood romeo,d.
three years later,in middle bucks,we held that a special relationship did not exist between the state and school children,despite pennsylvania compulsory education laws.at.as the majority recognizes today,the crux of our holding in middle bucks is that although the state exercises in loco parentis authority over children during school hours,the parents remain the primary caretakers over their children.id.at.in other words,middle bucks central premise is that a student,unlike a prisoner or the involuntarily committed,is not subjected to full time severe and continuous state restriction.id.
but middle bucks provides no basis to conclude that deshaney endorses an approach that turns on the existence of physical custody or on who remained the primary caregiver.see id.at sloviter,dissenting.were the existence of either fact dispositive in estelle,youngblood,or even deshaney itself,the supreme court surely would have said so explicitly.instead,the court explained that the common thread that unites estelle and youngblood is that a person is left unable to care for himself by the state affirmative act of restraining the individual freedom to act on his own behalf.deshaney,at.the court contrasted these situations to joshua case by noting that returning joshua to his father care did not constitute a restraint on his liberty to act on his own behalf.id.the result in deshaney is also explained by other facts,none of which turns on the lack of permanent physical custody that the harms joshua suffered occurred not while he was in the state custody that the state played no part in the creation of the danger and that the state did not do anything to render joshua any more vulnerable.id.at 
because deshaney itself did not provide the middle bucks majority with the absolute physical custody requirement,it relied on our prior decision in philadelphia police to conclude that deshaney set out a test of physical custody.middle bucks,at citing philadelphia police fire ass philadelphia,cir.philadelphia police had held that the state is not responsible for harm suffered by mentally handicapped individuals living at home,but it neither requires absolute physical custody nor turns on who the primary caregiver was.see philadelphia police,at.indeed,the case arguably implies that the state could be held liable for harm suffered by the individual while in temporary state custody.to be sure,philadelphia police and deshaney foreclose any argument that the state is responsible for the safety of school children while in their own homes.but philadelphia police does not bridge the gap between deshaney and an absolute physical custody requirement.thus,it is clear that middle bucks gloss on deshaney has no doctrinal foundation 
as the supreme court has observed,t he state exerts great authority and coercive power through mandatory attendance requirements.edwards aguillard,d.reexamining the relationship between school children and the state in light of our understanding of deshaney leads to the inescapable conclusion that a special relationship may exist under certain specific circumstances.
in pennsylvania,attending school is obligatory for children between the ages of eight and seventeen.stat.ann,a.parents who fail to comply with these mandates face punishment as severe as imprisonment.id.a once the state compels attendance,it has considerable power over the child as a matter of both law and fact.pennsylvania in loco parentis statute gives school officials the same authority as to conduct and behavior over the pupils attending school as the ir parents.id.and t he rights and liabilities arising out of an in loco parentis relationship are exactly the same as between parent and child.this may be an understatement.a parent may punish a child for incorrigibility,but he may not,like the state,initiate juvenile delinquency proceedings.stat.ann.
it is true that parents retain the ultimate legal custody and responsibility over the child.but a parent immediate ability to protect his child is significantly curtailed during the time the child is in the physical custody of school officials.during that time,the state may well be the only caregiver to which children may turn to for help.middle bucks attempted to dilute the strength of this reasoning by noting that it can not be denied that a parent is justified in withdrawing his child from a school where the health and welfare of the child is threatened.at quoting zebra sch.dist.of pittsburgh.but this overlooks that this right is extremely narrow,limited to situations in which a child safety is positively and immediately threatened.commonwealth ex rel.sch.dist.of pittsburgh ross.in ross,a parent could not withdraw a student although the child had been pushed into a wall and cut with scissors by other students.id.at.and in zebra,a parent could not withdraw his child even though he was threatened with physical harm if any reports were made to the school authorities regarding a bully extortion attempt,and m any of the students became ill,developed nervous conditions,required medical treatment,and were afraid while attending the school.sch.dist.of pittsburgh zebra,order reversed by zebra.thus,a pennsylvania parent appears not to be free to withdraw a child absent the most egregious conditions.indeed,m ost parents,realistically,have little ability to influence what occurs in the school.morse frederick,d alito,concurring.
the state authority over children while they are in school extends beyond their and is nearly absolute,covering what they may wear and how they may behave.see generally.stat.ann.detailing student responsibility to engage in conscientious effort in classroom work and homework.officials may proceed against said child before the juvenile court for misbehavior.stat.ann.at thirteen,the child is also subject to penalties for failure to comply with compulsory school laws.id.b 
the blackhawk student handbook reflects these restrictions on students liberty and on their parent ability to act on the child behalf,and goes further by regulating student conduct in classrooms,school buses,cafeterias,and sporting activities providing that students missing class will be required to attend the school for detention on saturdays and that officials may consider corporal punishment upon a student and prohibiting students from having cell phones.see blackhawk high school student handbook statement of student behavior,available at.pht hereinafter handbook see also.stat.ann.
in deshaney,the state simply left joshua where it found him he was not harmed while in the state physical custody or by anyone or anything over which the state had any immediate authority.here,by contrast,the state affirmatively removed the children from their parents custody for a period of time,limited what both the children and the parents could do respecting the children safety during that period,and exercised control over a continuous threat the children faced over an extended period of time.this is enough to hold that a special relationship existed between the school and the morrows.but if more were needed,one may look at cases involving the special relationship between the state and children it places in foster care.
since middle bucks,several courts of appeals have answered the question left open by the supreme court in deshaney regarding the existence of a special relationship between the state and the children it places in foster homes.see at.these courts have held that a special relationship exists in such cases because the state,in placing a child in foster care,renders the individual substantially dependent upon the state to meet his or her basic needs.nicini morra,cir en banc quotation marks and citation omitted see also lintz skipski,cir norfleet.dep t of human,cir yvonne dep t of human,cir.
our own case,nicini,involved a child who was not in the state absolute care but was placed in a foster home.the child parents had signed a foster care placement agreement with the state,and the state permitted the child to stay on a temporary basis with another family,the morras,after the child ran away from home.the child sued the state on the theory that it had failed to sufficiently investigate the morras,whom he alleged sexually abused him.although we recognize d that the analogy between foster children and prisoners and institutionalized persons from estelle and youngblood was incomplete,and that foster children enjoy a greater degree of freedom and are more likely to be able to take steps to ensure their own safety,we held that a special relationship existed because the child was effectively in state custody and was substantially dependent on the state for his safety.at quotation marks omitted 
nicini thus discredit s not just the underlying reasoning of middle bucks,but also its reading of deshaney.citizens united.at roberts,concurring explaining that stare decisis does not control when the underlying reasoning of precedent in question has been discredited.nicini makes clear that physical custody can not be the lynchpin of a deshaney special relationship because the child there was not under the state control at the time the harm occurred.moreover,the state in nicini was not the primary caregiver.as the circuit has recognized,the result and reasoning in the foster care cases have thus created tension with the public school cases because b oth involve state constriction of a child liberty yet only the former triggers deshaney custody.smith district of columbia.and smith itself demonstrates that the fact that children return to their parents at the end of the school day is not dispositive.there,the court held that a state has a special relationship with juvenile delinquents the state places in an independent living youth program,but over which it exerts neither absolute physical control nor supervision.see id.at 
moreover,not only do these cases provide reason to revisit the legal underpinning of middle bucks,they provide further support for holding that a special relationship exists in this case.here,unlike in nicini or deshaney,the state had custody of the children at the time of the injury in question,and the children were substantially dependent on the state for their safety during school hours,despite the existence of other caregivers.nicini,at quotation marks omitted.like the children in smith,the morrows were technically free to come and go from school after certain hours but risk ed punishment for fail ing to obey the state restrictions on their freedom while in school.smith,at.if anything,the existence of a special relationship is clearer here than in nicini because the state in this case had physical custody over both the victim and the aggressor and was thus uniquely positioned to protect the child from harm.neither factor existed in nicini or in deshaney.fairly read,the additional element of control that existed in the relationship between the state and nicini that did not exist in deshaney is that in nicini the state entered into a temporary agreement with nicini parents pursuant to which the parents consented to have their son placed in foster care.more is present here.compulsory schooling laws,together with the restrictions on parents and their children ability to free themselves from state control,arguably impose on the state a greater obligation here than that which it undertook in nicini.
the majority seizes on the temporary nature of the relationship and also attempts to distinguish nicini and smith on the ground that parents remain the primary caregivers over school children.but this fact does not negate that during school hours the state has the immediate responsibility for the child wellbeing.nicini,at.in our view,this fact demonstrates,at most,that the difference between the state relationship with the nicini children and schoolchildren is a difference in degree,not kind,and suggests that the proper course is to impose a constitutional duty on schools only under limited circumstances.see middle bucks,at becker,dissenting.in middle bucks,judge becker found the existence of a special relationship based on the state compulsory attendance laws,the student disability,and the affirmative steps the school took to confine the student to situations where she was physically threatened.id.under the circumstances before us pennsylvania compulsory schooling laws,the existence of the restraining orders that prohibited contact between the bully and the morrows,the fact that the school had custody and control over the very threat that harmed the morrows,and the enforcement of the no tolerance policy,all suggesting that the morrows ability to protect themselves was limited we have no difficulty deciding that a special relationship arose between the school and the morrows.id.
restrictions on a person liberty to protect herself from danger are the lynchpin of deshaney.see at.an approach that abandons middle bucks doctrinally unsound requirements and focuses on whether a state substantially restricted a student ability to defend herself from a particular danger,in addition to the general restraints on liberty imposed by compulsory schooling laws,is therefore more in line with deshaney and simply makes more sense.adopting such an approach and considering the specific circumstances of this case,we would hold that the complaint has adequately pled the existence of a special relationship between the morrows and the school the bully,and remand the case for discovery on that claim 
today majority does not quarrel with the foregoing or fully reject the dissenters reasoning in middle bucks.majority op.at instead calling the middle bucks dissent compelling.nevertheless,the court refuses to revisit middle bucks,asserting that the matter has been settled by dictum in a decision of the supreme court.but neither that comment nor principles of stare decisis preclude us from revisiting middle bucks or control the outcome of this case.
in vernonia school district acton,the supreme court upheld under the fourth amendment a school policy requiring athletes to submit to drug tests.the court relied on the lowered expectations of privacy that students have in schools,because they are committed to the temporary custody of the state,d.the court commented that it did not mean to suggest that public schools as a general matter have such a degree of control over children as to give rise to a constitutional duty to protect.id.at citing deshaney,at.seizing on this language,the majority concludes that it is difficult to imagine a clearer or more forceful indicator of the court interpretation of its holding in deshaney.majority op.at.
but the vernonia dictum can not bear the great weight the majority places on it simply put,this case is not a general matter.vernonia,at.the school administrators here had custody of a bully,who was prohibited from contact with brittany morrow by two court orders.despite the state knowledge of a very specific,continuing,and serious threat against a particular student,the school failed to prevent subsequent attacks and instead took action against the victims themselves pursuant to the no tolerance policy.when faced with a specific request for help,the school told the morrows that it could not offer assistance,and even suggested it would be best if they,not the bully,left and attended another school.
to be sure,we do not lightly ignore supreme court dicta,majority op.at,and the vernonia dictum undoubtedly invites some caution,hasenfus lajeunesse,cir.but we also ought not to stretch dicta beyond the specific question it controls,so as to curtail constitutional rights.while the vernonia dictum precludes us from holding that school districts have as a general matter a duty to protect students,it does not foreclose finding a special relationship under specific circumstances 
nor do we lightly suggest that our precedent be overturned.but even assuming that the same stare decisis concerns that cabin the supreme court discretion to revisit its own precedent apply with equal force to the courts of appeals,those principles do not stand in the way of revisiting middle bucks.
we should revisit middle bucks because its underlying premise,that the special relationship test turns on the existence of permanent physical custody,was clearly erroneous and set our jurisprudence astray from the contours of the special relationship test.see supra part.the fact that the majority does not defend the outcome of middle bucks as standing on its own suggests that the decision remains sufficiently controversial as to counsel a greater willingness to consider new approaches capable of restoring our doctrine to sounder footing.citizens united.at roberts,concurring.even the supreme court,when it has confronted a wrongly decided,unworkable precedent calling for some future action,ha s chosen to overrule the precedent.payne tennessee,d souter,concurring 
in addition,although the record before us on this question is bare,one might also argue that at least some factual developments since middle bucks have further undercut its rationale and provide additional reasons to reexamine it.the proper question is whether middle bucks assumptions about the level of control that schools exert over students have been challenged.there are now abundant examples of schools exercising greater control over students,ranging from technology tracking student movements at all times to ensure they are in class,see maurice chammah and nick swartsell,student ids that track the students,times,to monitoring online social media activity within and outside school premises,see,at,and,in the wake of recent tragic school shootings,locking classrooms in further restriction of student movement.see,stephen ceasar and howard blume,to lock classroom doors or not,los angeles times,noting increase in locked classrooms in the wake of the newtown,connecticut shootings,and how such measures have resulted in other problems such as an instance of a teacher sexually assaulting students stare decisis does not require us to definitively settle the questions raised by these new circumstances,nor does it preclude us from revisiting middle bucks while sitting en banc.
ii.blackhawk may have also created the danger that harmed the morrows 
the morrows also argue that the school may be liable under the danger theory the majority concludes that this cause of action must also be dismissed because the morrows have failed to plead an affirmative act by the school.majority op.at.although we have acknowledged that the line between action and inaction may not always be clear in the context of these kinds of claims,bright westmoreland,cir,the consequence of that line becomes sadly clearer with the court decision in this case administrators who let violence run rampant can take shelter under the label inaction.dereliction of duty becomes a school best defense.this outcome is contrary to an appropriate understanding of the danger doctrine.indeed,although the doctrine represents a narrow exception to deshaney,the majority narrows the exception to the vanishing point by saying that school officials are free to ignore court orders and their own disciplinary code,enabling a pattern of physical abuse to persist.
to prove a danger,a plaintiff must demonstrate that 
the harm ultimately caused was foreseeable and fairly direct a state actor acted with a degree of culpability that shocks the conscience a relationship between the state and the plaintiff existed such that the plaintiff was a foreseeable victim of the defendant acts,or a member of a discrete class of persons subjected to the potential harm brought about by the state actions,as opposed to a member of the public in general and a state actor affirmatively used his or her authority in a way that created a danger to the citizen or that rendered the citizen more vulnerable to danger than had the state not acted at all.
id.at quotation marks and citations omitted.the first and third elements are not in dispute in this case we therefore discuss the second and fourth elements to demonstrate that the morrows complaint adequately pleads this cause of action 
the second prong of the danger test sets deliberate indifference as t he level of culpability required to shock the conscience in cases where deliberation is possible and officials have time to make unhurried judgments.sanford stiles,cir quotation marks omitted.the deliberate indifference formulation applies here because the decision with respect to the bully and the morrows was neither nor made in a matter of hours or minutes,id.at citation omitted,but rather was made and sustained over eight months stretching from january to october.
in addition,the complaint here supports an inference of deliberate indifference on the part of the school principal,balaski.balaski knew that the bully was not permitted to contact the morrows.moreover,the handbook mandates some action by officials in response to students who commit level iv offenses,which include assault and battery,and arguably calls for their expulsion.however,balaski ignored the import of the orders and decided not to abide by the school own disciplinary code.his decisions are alleged to have put the bully in proximity to and contact with the morrows,despite ample reason to believe the bully would continue to assault the morrows.consequently,they have adequately pled deliberate indifference and satisfied the second prong of the danger theory.
under the fourth prong of the theory,liability is predicated upon the states affirmative acts which work to the plaintiffs detriment in terms of exposure to danger.bright,at quoting middle bucks,at.but it is not easy to discern from our cases what constitutes an affirmative act and what does not.
in kneipp tedder,we held that there was a substantive due process violation when police stopped an intoxicated couple on the street and then permitted the wife to go home alone,resulting in her fall down an embankment and ultimate death,cir.then,in rivas city of passaic,we held liable emergency medical technicians emts who told police officers that a man in the midst of a seizure had assaulted them but did not inform the officers of the man medical condition,cir.we said that the state had created a danger in kneipp because the defendants used their authority as police officers to create a dangerous situation or to make the victim more vulnerable to danger than had they not intervened.at.in rivas,we aggregated an earlier action the emts call that brought the police with the inaction that was the actual cause of harm the failure to inform the police of the victim condition and decided it was sufficient because such sequence created an opportunity for harm that would not have otherwise existed.at.
as these cases demonstrate,virtually any action may be characterized as a failure to take some alternative action or.see,covington,at,describing the police officers in kneipp as having sent the victim home alone,but recasting parents allegation that a school released their child to an unauthorized person in violation of school policy as a failure to adopt a stricter policy 
moreover,any conduct pled as the source of a danger is likely to include a combination of action and inaction,depending on how far back in the causal chain a court goes.see bright,at nygaard,dissenting by cabining bright claim based solely on an ensuing delay in taking action,the majority lops off the initial affirmative act so it can conclude that there was no affirmative act.indeed,in kneipp and rivas,the immediate harm to the victims was due to the defendant failure to act.therefore,the better way of understanding these cases,contrary to the majority embrace of the affirmative act requirement today,is to recognize that the dispositive factor appears to be whether the state has in some way placed the plaintiff in a dangerous position that was foreseeable,and not whether the act was more appropriately characterized as an affirmative act.morse lower merion sch,cir 
the majority in bright suggested that there is no conflict between the use of authority and affirmative act formulations of the fourth prong of the danger test because state actors can not use their authority to create an opportunity for injury to the plaintiff by failing to act.at quotation marks omitted.but that statement is wrong both linguistically and logically.it is wrong linguistically because
