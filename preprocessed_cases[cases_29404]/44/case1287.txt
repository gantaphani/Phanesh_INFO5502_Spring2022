factual background and procedural history 
evancho was employed by the bureau from until september.in,she became a regional supervisor for the greensburg office of the bureau and supervised approximately eighteen agents.
in,the regional director of the bureau assigned evancho to serve as the custodian of the evidence room.twice,evancho requested that an inventory of the evidence room be taken,once when she learned that both evidence records had been altered and money was missing and again when she discovered additional money as well as drugs were missing.the regional director,however,denied both requests and eventually relieved her of her custodial responsibilities.
over memorial day weekend in,the evidence room was burglarized,triggering investigations both internally and by the pennsylvania state police.evancho assisted in these investigations.specifically,she disclosed her prior findings with respect to the evidence room and reported her management failure to investigate the altered records and missing funds and drugs.pursuant to these investigations,the regional director was fired,the western zone commander retired,and the prior custodian of the evidence room and another agent were suspended.
in august of,evancho was transferred to the position of supervising agent of the financial investigative unit fiu,where she was charged with supervising only two other agents.evancho neither applied for nor received advance notice of the transfer.she alleges that this position was a dead end job involving an outrageous and unaccomplishable workload.
in her new assignment,she was given significantly lower performance evaluations than at any other time in her career with the bureau.evancho was also placed in counseling and was required to undergo interim evaluations.she began to suffer from severe depression and anxiety due to her work circumstances.on september,she left her job for medical and psychological reasons and has not been able to return.in her complaint,evancho alleges that her transfer was carried out by underlings reporting directly to the attorney general by the attorney general himself for the explicit purpose of either setting her up for dismissal or,it sic that were not successful,making her work life so miserable as to force her resignation.
on september,four years after her transfer,evancho filed a writ of summons in the court of common pleas of allegheny county against attorney general fisher officially and individually and the office of the attorney general collectively defendants.on october,she filed a complaint in state court.on october,defendants removed the case to federal district court.on october,evancho filed an amended complaint,claiming that defendants violated the pennsylvania whistleblower law,and her civil rights under in retaliation for her whistleblowing activities.on november,defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.on march,the district court granted the defendants motion as to both claims.
first,the district court observed that evancho failed to specify any acts committed by attorney general fisher individually.in particular,the district court noted that the only mention of attorney general fisher in evancho amended complaint appears at paragraph sic,in which she alleges that her transfer to the fiu was carried out by underlings reporting directly to the attorney general by the attorney general himself for the explicit purpose of either setting plaintiff up for dismissal or,if that were not successful,making her work life so miserable as to force her resignation.evancho,slip op.at alteration in original.the district court also observed plaintiff even admits in her brief that she simply does not have firm evidence of michael fisher individual involvement.id.thus,the district court concluded that evancho allegations against attorney general fisher in his individual capacity do not satisfy the heightened pleading standard to which claims against individual government defendants were historically subject.the district court specifically stated plaintiff conclusory allegations in paragraph do not satisfy the heightened pleading standard to which claims against individual government defendants are subject.id.the district court therefore dismissed evancho amended complaint against attorney general fisher individually without prejudice,allowing evancho to amend her complaint setting forth her allegations against attorney general fisher with greater specificity,slip op.at.
second,the district court noted that evancho conceded that her civil rights claim against attorney general fisher in his official capacity and the office of the attorney general is barred by will michigan department of state police,d,which held that neither states nor state officials sued in their official capacities for money damages are persons within the meaning of.accordingly,the district court dismissed evancho claim against attorney general fisher in his official capacity and the office of the attorney general.evancho timely appealed.

iii.discussion 
on appeal,evancho challenges only the district court dismissal of her complaint against attorney general fisher in his individual capacity and only as to her claim,not her claim under the pennsylvania whistleblower law.she first argues that it was incorrect for the district court to apply a heightened particularity requirement beyond the simple notice pleading standard required by rule,citing leatherman tarrant county narcotics intelligence and coordination unit,d,abbott latshaw,cir,and weston commonwealth of pennsylvania,cir.under rule,she contends that her amended complaint sets forth sufficient detail to show that her claim against attorney general fisher individually may have merit and to enable attorney general fisher to frame an answer.hence,evancho argues that we should reverse the district court dismissal of her amended complaint against attorney general fisher in his individual capacity,even though it was without prejudice and she declined to further amend.
