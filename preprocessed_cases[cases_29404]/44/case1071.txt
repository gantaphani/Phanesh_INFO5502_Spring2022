this appeal arises under the medicare as a secondary payer act msp act,b.appellant cecelia taransky,a medicare beneficiary,contends that she is not required to reimburse the for conditional medical expenses that it advanced on her behalf.we disagree.
medicare is a federal entitlement program that provides health insurance benefits to qualified elderly and disabled individuals.see b.when first enacted,medicare paid its beneficiaries medical expenses,even if beneficiaries could recoup them from other sources,such as private health insurance.see,zinman shalala,cir.
in,congress enacted the msp act in an effort to reduce escalating costs.as its title suggests,the statute designates medicare as a secondary payer of medical benefits,and thus precludes the program from providing such benefits when a primary plan could be expected to pay.b a.when the primary plan can not promptly pay a beneficiary medical expenses,however,medicare makes conditional payments to ensure that the beneficiary receives timely care.id.b b.once the beneficiary gets the health care she needs medicare is entitled to reimbursement if and when the primary payer pays her.cochran health care fin,cir.
this appeal involves,inter alia,the interaction of the msp act with a state law,the new jersey collateral source statute njcss,stat.ann.under the njcss,a tort plaintiff can not recover damages from a defendant when she has already received funding from a different source.the statute provides 
in any civil action brought for personal injury or death if a plaintiff receives or is entitled to receive benefits for the injuries allegedly incurred from any other source other than a joint tortfeasor,the benefits,other than workers compensation benefits or the proceeds from a life insurance policy,shall be disclosed to the court and the amount thereof which duplicates any benefit contained in the award shall be deducted from any award recovered by the plaintiff,less any premium paid to an insurer directly by the plaintiff or by any member of the plaintiff family on behalf of the plaintiff for the policy period during which the benefits are payable.
stat.ann.emphasis added.
the njcss has two purposes.first,it prevents a tort plaintiff from recovering damages from both a collateral source of benefits,a health insurer and a tortfeasor.parker esposito.second,it aims to shift the burden of medical costs related to tort injuries,whenever possible,from liability insurers to health insurers,and thereby keep liability insurance premiums down.lusby hitchner.in this appeal,taransky contends that because the njcss barred her from recovering medical costs from her tortfeasor,it would be inappropriate for her to reimburse the government for its conditional medical payments.
taransky was injured on november,when she tripped and fell at the larchmont shopping center in laurel,new jersey.the medicare program conditionally paid for her medical care.
almost two years later,taransky filed suit against the owners and operators of the shopping center collectively,larchmont in the superior court of new jersey,burlington county,seeking damages for bodily injury,disability,pain and suffering,emotional distress,economic loss,and medical expenses.shortly after filing suit,taransky lawyer contacted her designated medicare contractor repeatedly,requesting the exact amount of medicare claim.in one letter,counsel complained i can not negotiate the case unless i know the full amount of medicare claim.ja at.in another,he stated i would like to try to resolve taransky claim,but will have difficulty doing so without knowledge of medicare lien and its benefit payments in this matter.ja at.on several occasions,the medicare contractor provided taransky counsel with information about medicare conditional payments,which continued to accumulate as taransky lawsuit proceeded.
after two years of litigation,taransky settled her claims against larchmont for.in the settlement agreement,she granted larchmont a full release of all past,present and future claims,including for medical treatment and for medical expense benefits in connection with the accident.ja at.the agreement also provided that any liens or subrogation claims would be satisfied and discharged from the settlement proceeds,and that taransky would indemnify larchmont with respect to such claims.id.relevant to this case,the agreement provided that the indemnified liens specifically include,but are not limited to,medicare,medicaid,workers compensation liens claims.id.
on the heels of the settlement,taransky filed a motion in the new jersey superior court requesting an order apportioning the proceeds of the settlement between various elements of damages,but only to the extent necessary to obtain specified documentation relevant to anticipated administrative proceedings with the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services.ja at.taransky acknowledged that her lawsuit had sought damages for certain expenses for medical treatment,and that some of her treatment was paid for through the federal government medicare program.id.in spite of these facts,taransky argued that the njcss precluded tort plaintiffs like herself from recovering losses such as medical expenses that were already paid by another source.based on that premise,she claimed that her medicare expenses were not considered in the settlement negotiations and were not included in the settlement amount.ja at.taransky counsel notified her medicare contractor of the motion,but did not make the contractor or the government a party to her state court case.neither larchmont nor the government responded to taransky motion.
on november,the superior court granted taransky motion and entered an order for good cause shown,stating that the settlement did not include any medicare expenses n o portion of the recovery obtained by taransky in this matter is attributable to medical expenses or other benefits compensated by way of a collateral source.ja at.the order specified that the settlement amount was allocated solely to recovery for bodily injury,disability,pain and suffering,emotional distress,and such and loss as plaintiff may have suffered.ja at.
after taransky settled her case,a medicare contractor demanded reimbursement of the that the medicare program had paid on her behalf taransky refused to pay,citing the njcss and the allocation order she had received from the superior court.she also contended that the government could not demand reimbursement from a tortfeasor liability settlement under the msp act because a tortfeasor was not a primary plan under the meaning of the statute,and that reimbursement would be inequitable because she had not recovered any of her medical expenses.
the administrative law judge alj found against taransky on all claims the alj ruled that the government could be reimbursed from the proceeds of a tort settlement,and refused to recognize the state court allocation order because it was not made on the merits.he also rejected taransky contention that the njcss precluded the government from reimbursement,reasoning that the njcss did not apply to medicare conditional payments.finally,the alj found that reimbursement would not be inequitable,as he was unconvinced that the settlement truly did not include damages for medical expenses.
the medicare appeals council affirmed the alj opinion in its entirety,writing separately only to expound on two points.first,it determined that the settlement in fact included damages for taransky medical expenses,finding that taransky counsel who repeatedly demanded confirmation of the amount of medicare lien had used medicare payments as a basis for the settlement.second,citing mason sebelius,wl,the appeals council ruled that the njcss did not preclude tort victims from obtaining damages for medicare benefits in tort liability settlements.
on july,taransky filed suit in the united states district court for the district of new jersey,reiterating her claim that she was not responsible for reimbursing the medicare program from the proceeds of her settlement.as she had argued during the administrative process,taransky contended that reimbursement was unauthorized by the msp act and barred by the njcss.she also proffered two new arguments that medicare recovery should be limited to a proportionate share of her settlement that reflected her medical expenses and that the government refusal to acknowledge the superior court allocation order violated her right to due process under the fifth and fourteenth amendments.
the government moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim,or in the alternative,for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion,holding that it lacked jurisdiction over taransky proportionality and due process claims because she had failed to raise them before the agency.it also determined that the njcss did not apply to conditional medicare benefits,and that the msp act authorized reimbursement from the settlement.

taransky contends that the msp act does not authorize the government to be reimbursed for conditional medicare payments from the proceeds of a tortfeasor liability settlement.she advances three primary arguments on appeal.first,she contends that a tortfeasor can not be considered a primary plan from which the government may receive payment under the msp act.next,she argues that the government failed to prove that larchmont had a demonstrated responsibility to pay her medical expenses,as the njcss prohibited her from obtaining damages for medical expenses as part of the tort settlement.finally,she insists that the government had to defer to the state court order apportioning the settlement to exclude medical expenses.we address each argument in turn.
taransky claims that a tortfeasor liability settlement is not a primary plan within the meaning of the msp act,citing only one relevant case mason american tobacco,cir.in mason,the second circuit found that an entity could be a primary plan under the msp act only if it had a preexisting obligation to provide health benefits for example,via a contract to provide health insurance.id.at.the court ruled that the trigger for bringing a msp claim is not the pendency of a disputed tort claim,but the established obligation to pay medical costs pursuant to a arrangement to provide insurance benefits.id.at emphases added citation and internal quotation marks omitted.following mason,taransky urges us to define primary plan to include only health insurance companies who have a preexisting contractual obligation to pay for medical expenses.
although taransky description of mason is accurate,she fails to acknowledge that the case was abrogated by the december amendments to the msp act,which explicitly broadened the definition of primary plan to include tortfeasors see bio medical applications of,central states se.sw.areas health welfare fund,cir explaining congress intent to foreclose litigation on the definition of primary plan via the amendments.the statute as amended plainly includes tortfeasors and their insurance carriers in its definition of primary plan 
t he term primary plan includes a liability insurance policy or plan including a plan or no fault insurance an entity that engages in a business,trade,or profession shall be deemed to have a plan if it carries its own risk whether by a failure to obtain insurance,or otherwise in whole or in part.
b a ii emphasis added.the tortfeasor in taransky case,larchmont,is a n entity that engages in a business,trade,or profession,and the record demonstrates that it had a liability insurance policy.accordingly,despite not having a preexisting obligation to pay for taransky medical expenses,larchmont is a primary plan from whose payments the settlement amount the government may obtain reimbursement 
next,taransky contends that the government has failed to demonstrate,as a condition precedent for reimbursement,that larchmont had a responsibility to make payment for her medicare expenses.b b ii see also glover liggett,cir a n alleged tortfeasor responsibility for payment of a medicare beneficiary medical costs must be demonstrated before an msp private cause of action for failure to reimburse medicare can correctly be brought.emphasis in original.
the msp act provides that a beneficiary reimbursement obligation may be demonstrated by settlement 
a primary plan responsibility for such payment may be demonstrated by a payment conditioned upon the recipient compromise,waiver,or release whether or not there is a determination or admission of liability of payment for items or services included in a claim against the primary plan or the primary plan insured,or by other means.
b b ii emphasis added see also b.the medicare manual further provides medicare policy requires recovering payments from liability awards or settlements without regard to how the settlement agreement stipulates disbursements should be made.that includes situations in which the settlements do not expressly include damages for medical expenses.msp manual,ch,emphasis added 
like the other courts of appeals that have considered the issue,we hold that the fact of settlement alone,if it releases a tortfeasor from claims for medical expenses,is sufficient to demonstrate the beneficiary obligation to reimburse medicare.see hadden united states,cir mathis leavitt,cir.for this reason,we adopt the sixth circuit analysis in hadden,which held that the scope of the plan responsibility for the beneficiary medical expenses and thus of the beneficiary own obligation to reimburse medicare is ultimately defined by the scope of the beneficiary own claim against the third party that is later released in settlement.at emphasis in original.this rule comports with the text of the msp act and the medicare manual.it also ensures a beneficiary can not tell a third party that it is responsible for all of his medical expenses,on the one hand,and later tell medicare that the same party was responsible for only a compromise percentage of them,on the other.id.
applying these principles,taransky settlement which released larchmont from all her claims,including those for medical expenses renders her liable to the government.in mathis,the eighth circuit found that a beneficiary obligation under the msp act was triggered even when the parties did not specifically address obligations to medicare.at.here,taransky settlement agreement expressly anticipated medicare lien,and provided that reimbursement to the medicare program would be satisfied and discharged from the settlement proceeds.ja at.there is also substantial evidence to support the agency factual finding that the settlement included the costs of taransky medical care.before entering into the settlement agreement,taransky counsel repeatedly contacted her medicare contractor to determine the amount of the program lien,so he could use the amount to justify her settlement demand.see,ja at stating counsel intent to negotiate this case using an estimate of medicare benefits as a basis for potential settlement ja at i can not negotiate the case unless i know the full amount of medicare claim.after the settlement,counsel certified that taransky lawsuit included certain expenses for medical treatment,and s ome of the medical treatment for the personal injuries suffered by taransky was paid for through the federal government medicare program.ja at.given the substantial evidence that taransky was compensated for her medical costs,she can not now hide behind the lump sum settlement to deprive the government of the reimbursement it is owed.
in response,taransky contends that her settlement amount could not have included her medical costs as a matter of law,as medicare payments are a collateral source of benefits that may not be obtained from a tortfeasor under the njcss.it would follow that the msp act reimbursement provision was never triggered,and that the government request rather than preventing her from obtaining a double recovery would strip her of any recoupment of her medical expenses.
the new jersey supreme court has not considered whether the njcss operates to prevent a plaintiff from recovering medicare payments in a tort suit thus,we must attempt to predict how that tribunal would rule.underwriters ins.liberty mut.ins,cir.in doing so,we may consider the decisions of state intermediate appellate courts,which,a lthough not dispositive,should be accorded significant weight in the absence of an indication that the highest state court would rule otherwise.orson,miramax film,cir.
several decisions by the new jersey appellate division inform our analysis.in lusby,the appellate division held that the njcss did not bar the plaintiff from recovering his medical expenses as part of tort damages,even though those costs had been provisionally covered by the state medicaid program.at.the court rested its decision on the statutory purpose of the njcss 
the legislative determination was apparently not only to prevent plaintiffs from obtaining a double recovery but also to shift the burden,at least to some extent,from the liability and casualty insurance industry to health and disability payers.
we think it plain,however,that neither of these purposes is advanced by application of the collateral source statute where,as here,a plaintiff could not in any case pocket a double recovery for medical expenses for the reason that his entire recovery is subject to medicaid reimbursement rights.
id.emphasis added.the court further emphasized that the njcss purposes were not served when the ultimate burden is shifted from the tortfeasor liability carrier to a secondary payer.id.since lusby,panels of the appellate division have consistently found that application of the njcss turns on whether the government benefits provided are reimbursable if they are,then the payments are considered conditional,and are not collateral benefits that may not be recovered pursuant to the statute.compare thomas toys r us,finding that social security payments are a collateral source of benefits under the njcss because the government has no right to their reimbursement,with woodger christ,we have also held that benefits such as medicaid,subject to reimbursement by the plaintiff to the payer from the proceeds of a negligence judgment or settlement,are similarly not includable as a collateral source because they do not constitute double recovery.emphasis added.
while lusby involved a state medicaid statute its reasoning applies with equal force in the medicare context.the msp act makes clear that congress intended the medicare program to serve only as a secondary payer medicare may pay a beneficiary medical bills only if a primary plan can not be expected to pay promptly,and beneficiaries are obligated to reimburse medicare once a responsible primary plan has been identified.b b ii fanning united states,cir.medicare benefits,then,are reimbursable and conditional.for that reason,the njcss,which operates only when the beneficiary is entitled to receive benefits from another source,stat.ann,is inapplicable.
as further support for this conclusion,the appellate division extended lusby logic to medicare payments in jackson hudson,llc,no.l,wl.may,there,in a case similar to taransky,the medicare beneficiary sought an order from the motions judge that no portion of her personal injury settlement was attributable to medical expenses.id.at.on appeal,the appellate division affirmed the motions judge denial.analogizing lusby,the court found that medicaid liens were virtually identical to medicare liens,and that medicare,as a secondary payer,ha d a nearly unqualified right to reimbursement.id.at.because of this reimbursement right,the claimant,even if she were able to recover medical expenses from another source,could not pocket them and hence can not obtain the double recovery that the collateral source statute is designed to avoid.id.we predict that the new jersey supreme court would adopt this sound reasoning when considering the njcss application to medicare liens.
by contrast,only one case supports taransky position early wal mart stores,civ.cv july,in which the district court,in an unpublished opinion,ruled that medicare benefits constituted a collateral source under the njcss.see ja at.there,the court found that the plaintiff had already recovered the cost of the victim medical treatment from medicare,and concluded that the njcss precluded the plaintiff from obtaining the amount from the tortfeasor.see ja at.
while early is certainly on point,we find the case unpersuasive for two reasons.first,the decision turned on a flawed simplification of new jersey law the district court,in predicting how the new jersey supreme court would rule,held that the njcss requires that tort judgments be reduced by the amount of any recovery from other sources.id.emphasis added.this conclusion contradicted the holdings of prior intermediate court decisions,such as lusby and woodger,which received no attention in the opinion.instead,the court relied on the new jersey supreme court decision in perreira rediger,which focused on a very different question whether a health insurance company could recover funds from a tortfeasor pursuant to the njcss.see ja at.the perreira court held that the njcss barred an insurance company recovery because the statute aimed to shift the burden of payment from liability insurers to the health industry.see at citing,inter alia,lusby,at.however,as lusby made clear,this statutory purpose is not served when a beneficiary shifts the burden of payment from a tortfeasor to the government.see at.second,the early court relied in large part on the fifth circuit decision in thompson goetzmann,cir,which held that the medicare program could not be reimbursed from the proceeds of a tort settlement.see ja at.goetzmann,however,relied on the fifth circuit conclusion that tortfeasors were not a primary plan under the msp act a conclusion that was abrogated by the amendments to the statute for the reasons we explained in section,supra.
informed by the consistent line of appellate division decisions,and finding no persuasive rulings to the contrary,we predict that the new jersey supreme court would hold that medicare payments,because of their conditional nature,do not constitute a collateral source of benefits under the njcss.accordingly,taransky may not rely on the njcss to avoid reimbursing the government for medicare payments it has made on her behalf 
taransky also argues that,regardless of our interpretation of the njcss,the government must defer to the new jersey superior court apportionment order in accordance with medicare own regulations.because the state court order provides that no portion of the settlement recovery is attributable to medical expenses,taransky claims that she has no obligation to pay.
under the msp manual,t he only situation in which medicare recognizes allocations of liability payments to nonmedical losses is when payment is based on a court order on the merits of the case.msp manual,ch,emphasis added.further,i f the court or other adjudicator of the merits specifically designate s amounts not related to medical services,medicare will accept the court designation.id.in deference to the court substantive decision,medicare does not seek recovery from portions of court awards that are designated as payment for losses other than medical services.id
