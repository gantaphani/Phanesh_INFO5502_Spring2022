mary patrick latham appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of office of the attorney general of the state of ohio oag and others.latham brought this action against the oag claiming that its termination of her employment violated both her first amendment rights and the provisions of the age discrimination in employment act of adea.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on both claims.because latham position is properly viewed as a confidential or policymaking position,and because plaintiffs are barred from recovering damages against a state under the adea,we hereby affirm the judgment of the district court.
mary patrick latham was hired as a consumer protection attorney in the oag cincinnati office on april.while she reported to a section head in the oag main office in columbus,she was the only consumer protection attorney in cincinnati.as an assistant attorney general,her duties included,inter alia,preparing,presenting,and arguing cases assisting settlement negotiations,and making recommendations to her superiors as to how best to protect ohio consumers.however,she required approval from supervisors in the columbus office before opening a case file,filing a complaint,submitting a brief,or initiating or finalizing a settlement.latham was also not allowed to speak to the press on behalf of the oag.
on july,trial was scheduled to begin in a case brought by the oag against allied pest control for enforcement of a consent judgment.latham was assigned to conduct the trial on behalf of the oag.in the weeks before the scheduled trial date,she was informed that robert hart,an assistant attorney general based in columbus,would be handling settlement negotiations between the parties,with an eye towards avoiding a trial altogether.the day the trial was to have begun,the parties settled the case.
that night,latham drafted a letter the letter to attorney general betty montgomery,outlining concerns she had with both the allied settlement and the general direction of the consumer protection section.on the following day,july,she sent the letter to montgomery,forwarding copies to robert hart,randal berning head of the oag cincinnati office,and eric brown head of the consumer protection section,and latham immediate supervisor.latham received no reply or other response to her letter.
the next month,brown was replaced as head of the consumer protection section by helen macmurray.two years later,in the fall of,latham,macmurray,and berning had a series of meetings,at which macmurray raised concerns about latham job performance and relationship with other oag staff members.the parties dispute the tenor of these meetings,but it is undisputed that latham was upset at macmurray allegations.following one of these meetings,latham filed an discrimination complaint with the oag,alleging that the oag through berning and macmurray failed to promote her and kept her from being involved in certain cases because of her age.finally,after a contentious meeting regarding a complaint about latham made by another oag staff member,attorney general montgomery terminated latham employment on january.
latham brought suit in federal court,alleging,after two amendments to her complaint,that her discharge was both a violation of the adea and of her first amendment rights under.the district court granted summary judgment on the adea claim on eleventh amendment grounds,and then,upon the release of our decision in rose stephens,cir,several weeks before the scheduled trial of the instant case,granted summary judgment on the first amendment claim.this appeal followed.
standard of review 
as always,this court reviews grants of summary judgment de novo.farhat jopke,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.
section first amendment retaliation claim 
latham asserts that she was fired,at least in part,because of the letter she wrote to general montgomery.such a dismissal,she argues,violated her free speech rights under the first amendment and.the oag asserts that latham was terminated because she was disruptive in the office and could no longer be trusted to represent the oag responsibly.however,since this appeal is from a grant of summary judgment in the oag favor,we must view all facts in the light most favorable to latham.see,matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.as a result,we must determine if latham termination would result in a viable claim under if,in fact,she had been terminated in retaliation for the views she expressed in the letter.
it is law that public employees are not obligated to abandon all their constitutional rights as a requirement for either obtaining or retaining their employment.see,connick myers,d pickering bd.of,d the theory that public employment may be subjected to any conditions,regardless of how unreasonable,has been uniformly rejected.quoting keyishian bd.of regents,d.therefore,in order to determine whether a public employer has violated the first amendment by firing an employee for engaging in speech,courts must balance the interests of the both sovereign and those of the employee as citizen.pickering,at.to do so,we first determine whether an employee speech addresses a matter of public concern,and,if so,then balance the interests of the employer in providing effective and efficient services against the employee first amendment right to freedom of expression.dambrot cent,cir.
was the subject of latham speech a matter of public concern 
an expression addresses a matter of public concern where its subject matter is such that the public at large would have an important interest in the issue.pickering,at.latham letter dealt with both her concerns about the settlement of a case and her general concerns regarding the oag enforcement of ohio consumer protection laws.it is indisputable that the enforcement decisions of the oag in consumer protection cases,in both particular cases and generally,are a matter of public concern,and,indeed,the oag has not disputed this issue on appeal.we thus turn to the balancing step of the pickering analysis.
does rose stephens apply to latham case 
in rose stephens,cir,we held that,as a matter of law,the second step of the pickering test favors the governmental employer where a confidential or policymaking public employee is discharged on the basis of speech related to his political or policy views id.at.rose involved a action by the kentucky state police commissioner alleging that he was terminated in violation of his right to freedom of expression under the first amendment when his termination was based on his refusal to withdraw a memorandum to the governor outlining rose reasons for eliminating the deputy police commissioner position.considering that the supreme court had already allowed government employers to terminate confidential or policymaking employees solely on the basis of their political affiliation,see,elrod burns,d branti finkel,d,we noted that it would make little sense to permit the government to dismiss employees on the basis of political affiliation alone,while restricting its ability to respond to an overt act of disloyalty by an employee in the same position.rose,at.
latham argues that the presumption in favor of the government that we outlined in rose should not apply to her case for three reasons her speech was not made publicly her speech did not constitute insubordination or disloyalty and,most importantly,her position was not a confidential or policymaking position.we consider each argument in turn.
a.the public nature of latham speech 
first,latham argues the speech must be public for the presumption in favor of the government to apply,and that her speech,the letter was not public.therefore,she claims,the presumption from rose should not apply here.in fact,however,the speech at issue in rose was also never made public.rose only sent his memorandum to his superior the secretary of kentucky justice cabinet and his sup
