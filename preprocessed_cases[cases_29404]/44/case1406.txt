we are for the third time entertaining this complex matter,which began more than fifteen years ago as a scheme conjured up by shipping businesses to defraud the united states.in,gosselin group then known as gosselin world wide moving,and another business entity entered conditional guilty pleas in the eastern district of virginia to a pair of criminal conspiracy offenses.the district court thereafter dismissed one of those charges,and ensued.we determined in those appeals that the defendants were criminally liable for both conspiracies and remanded for resentencing.see united states gosselin world wide moving,cir.
more recently,in the qui tam proceedings at issue herein,a jury returned a verdict in against three defendants that we collectively refer to as the gosselin defendants gosselin group gosselin worldwide moving,and marc smet,gosselin group chief executive officer and former managing director.appeals were pursued by the united states and by relators kurt bunk and ray ammons together,the relators,who contested the district court refusal to award civil penalties.we granted relief,directing the court to enter judgment on a claim pursued by bunk in the sum of to be levied against the gosselin defendants and remanding for further proceedings.see united states ex rel.bunk gosselin world wide moving,cir.
on remand,the district court was called upon to resolve the issue of whether bunk was entitled to recover his judgment from another defendant,government logistics govlog,which was alleged to be a successor corporation to gosselin group.in disposing of the successor corporation liability issue,the court ruled against bunk on two bases.see united states ex rel.bunk birkart globistics gmbh,cv,ecf the decision.first,the court decided that the successor corporation liability claims against govlog should be dismissed because they had been inadequately pleaded.in the alternative,the decision rejected those claims on the merits and awarded summary judgment,ruling that there was insufficient evidence to justify a trial.the relators have appealed from the judgment,and as explained below,we are satisfied that the court erred.we therefore vacate and remand.
two government programs that facilitate the shipment of household goods belonging to military and domestic personnel to and from europe have been at the center of this litigation the first,known as the international through government bill of lading itgbl program,involves the solicitation of bids by the department of defense the dod from domestic freight forwarders who then subcontract their foreign operations to overseas businesses.the second,known as the direct procurement method dpm program,involves the solicitation of bids by the dod directly from foreign businesses.both programs were,as relevant to the conspiracy,administered by the army military transport management command the mtmc 
beginning in about,the gosselin defendants and at least one other entity,the pasha group,agreed to and implemented the scheme.their scheme substantially increased the prices that the dod paid to the culprits for shipping household goods belonging to military and diplomatic personnel to and from europe under the itgbl and dpm programs.as a result of what we characterized in the criminal appeals as naked bid rigging,the dod paid millions of dollars more to the conspirators than it should have paid.see gosselin,at.the scheme did not go undetected,as it resulted in these qui tam proceedings and the successful criminal prosecutions.
in,the relators instituted these qui tam proceedings under the false claims act the fca the relators operated businesses that provided to the dod services much like those performed by gosselin group and pasha.bunk filed his qui tam action in the eastern district of virginia on august,alleging an fca claim related to the dpm program the dpm claim ammons filed his qui tam action in the eastern district of missouri on september,alleging fca claims related to the itgbl program the itgbl claim and to gosselin group exertion of pressure on covan international the covan claim and cartwright international van lines the cartwright claim to submit higher itgbl bids.both qui tam actions were commenced under seal,pursuant to,and remained sealed and pending in the district courts during the criminal proceedings.
on november,a grand jury in the eastern district of virginia returned a indictment against gosselin group and smet,charging them with conspiracy to restrain trade,in violation of,and conspiracy to defraud the united states,in contravention of.describing the manner and means of the conspiracy to restrain trade,the indictment specified that gosselin group,smet,and their participat ed in meetings and conversations to discuss and agree upon a strategy to eliminate the prime rates in specific transportation routes,or channels,from germany to the united states for the transportation of military household goods.see indictment,united states gosselin world wide moving,cr,at,ecf.the indictment further alleged that gosselin group and smet engaged in written exchanges and other communications to ensure other freight forwarders would not match the rates set by a certain freight forwarder and would cancel any rates lower than the second highest rate in channels from germany to the united states.id.the indictment charged the same with respect to the conspiracy to defraud the united states.id.alleging that gosselin group and smet discussed and agreed upon a strategy to eliminate the prime rates see also id.
in february,gosselin group and pasha agreed to be charged and prosecuted by criminal information in the eastern district of virginia for those same conspiracy offenses.by plea agreements with the united states attorney,gosselin group and pasha also agreed to plead guilty to the two charges alleged in the information.smet,who signed gosselin group plea agreement individually and on behalf of gosselin group,thereby escaped further criminal prosecution.that is,as a result of gosselin group plea agreement being consummated,the prosecutors dismissed the indictment theretofore lodged against gosselin group and smet.
pursuant to its plea agreement,gosselin group admitted that,at smet urging,gosselin group and pasha had conspired to undermine the itgbl program competitive bidding process by preventing bids,or matching bids,from converging to the prime through rate,the low bid for a particular route to accomplish that objective in particular channels,i n early january,smet agreed in writing to pay twelve of the largest german moving agents a specified fee,and t he german agents agreed not to handle business from freight forwarders in those channels unless the forwarders submitted bids at the second lowest level or above.see gosselin,at.even more,as smet acknowledged in a writing filed with the district court,gosselin group,pasha,and their had provided misleading information to dod personnel in germany.see statement of facts,united states gosselin world wide moving,cr,at,ecf the statement of facts in the end,the scheme to defraud the dod was successful and gosselin was awarded a contract,effective may,after colluding with its fellow bidders to artificially inflate the packing and loading component of the submitted bids.see bunk,at.in turn,gosselin subcontracted much of the work,in predetermined allocations,to its supposed competitors.id.as a result of the scheme,dod costs to transport military household goods were greater than they would have been had the shipments moved at the prime through rates.see statement of facts.
the guilty pleas of gosselin group and pasha were tendered to and accepted by the district court in alexandria on february.pursuant to a separate agreement between smet and the army,smet was barred from doing business with the united states for three years,from march to march.soon after that agreement was executed,a united states management team was created within gosselin group to handle its business in smet absence with the dod.that team consisted of four gosselin group employees chief operating officer stephan geurts,his son stephan geurts,plus timotheus noppen and ludi bokken.
meanwhile,gosselin group and pasha exercised a reservation under their plea agreements to pursue an immunity claim in the district court,seeking dismissal of both the charges lodged in the information.in that regard,they asserted that their scheme was entirely immune from federal prosecution.in august,the district court determined that certain provisions of the shipping act immunized gosselin group and pasha from federal prosecution on the antitrust conspiracy offense alleged in the information the court also ruled,however,that those defendants possessed no immunity from prosecution on the other charge,the conspiracy to defraud the united states.gosselin group and pasha were therefore sentenced on the conspiracy to defraud offense only.
in,the government successfully appealed to this court the district court immunity ruling on the antitrust conspiracy offense.our decision rejected the proposition that gosselin group and pasha were somehow immune from prosecution on that offense.see gosselin,at.concomitantly,we rejected gosselin group and pasha seeking immunity from prosecution on the conspiracy to defraud offense.id.as judge wilkinson succinctly explained,the shipping act immunity provisions afford the conspirators no relief from liability for the antitrust violation and conspiracy to defraud they have admitted.id.concluding that gosselin group and pasha were not entitled to immunity on either offense,we remanded to the district court for resentencing.those proceedings were conducted in.
in the resentencing proceedings,the district court imposed a fine on gosselin group for its offenses.it imposed two separate fines on pasha one for each count for an aggregate fine of.the court also ordered both gosselin group and pasha to make restitution to the dod for losses suffered by the mtmc,in the sum of.
in september,with the criminal proceedings concluded,the department of justice the doj gave the gosselin defendants notice of the two pending qui tam actions.the doj lawyers detailed the false claims and evidence underlying the qui tam actions to the lawyers for the gosselin defendants and advised them that the united states might intervene.shortly thereafter,in january,the doj communicated a settlement demand to the gosselin defendants.
after completion of the criminal proceedings and with the civil qui tam proceedings just beginning,smet was completely fed up with the doj and the dod a sentiment he expressed to geurts.see as smet further explained to noppen,his frustration arose from the whole criminal case and everything around it.id.at see also,id.at smet was really fed up with all those chasings towards his person.smet thus approached jan lefebure,who worked as managing director of international freight forwarding service which handled gosselin group commercial exports,with a proposal to move gosselin group business with the united states into the hands of another business entity.
lefebure owned a corporation called brabiver,which was described by geurts as a company doing nothing.see.notably,however,and helpful to smet,brabiver owned a license for transportation or freight forwarding.id.smet proposed to lefebure a scheme to reopen brabiver,and to put his,gosselin group government contracts into it.id.at.
joining lefebure as principals in the brabiver venture,as orchestrated by smet,were noppen,geurts,and rene beckers all of whom were employed by gosselin group or one of its subsidiaries.on june,in order to carry out smet scheme and to capitalize brabiver,smet made several loans to the four principals,totalling approximately noppen,geurts,and beckers each received loans from smet of more than.lefebure received an initial loan of more than,which was later increased to more than.notably,those loans were not secured in any way.each loan was repayable on smet demand,but no demands were ever made.
on june,at their first and only shareholder meeting,smet principals used the foregoing loans to purchase shares in and to formalize brabiver resurgence as govlog a new name selected by smet himself.the next day,june,govlog and gosselin group entered into a series of agreements,memorialized by contracts prepared by smet attorneys and presented by smet to the govlog principals.two of the agreements transferred gosselin group business with the dod to govlog,and three other agreements committed govlog to exclusively use the services of gosselin group and its related entities to perform the dod contracts.
in exchange for gosselin group business with the dod,govlog paid nothing at the time.instead,govlog promised gosselin group a percentage of its future net revenues.the agreements transferring gosselin group business with the dod to govlog defined those net revenues as all of those revenues received by govlog minus the amount of the services invoiced by gosselin group to govlog in connection with the services provided to govlog by gosselin group and its subsidiaries.see emphasis omitted regarding facility services see also id.at regarding support services.the terms of the various agreements were not even negotiated rather,they were all dictated by smet.after smet lawyers prepared the agreements,smet simply handed them to lefebure,who signed each on behalf of govlog.
at no point during the implementation of the govlog scheme did gosselin group consider selling or seek to sell its business interests to any entity other than govlog.manned with only about twenty employees all but one of whom joined govlog from gosselin group govlog began its dod shipping operations on behalf of gosselin group on july.
thereafter,the sole business of govlog was signing contracts with the dod and arranging shipping services for the dod.it did not,as lefebure said,actually do any shipping.as lefebure testified 
other than making the arrangements for these movements of household goods,does govlog provide any other services 
for the time being,no.
see.although govlog contracted with the dod and govlog carriers to perform shipping services,gosselin group continued to perform nearly all those services.govlog did not have its own warehousing facilities it leased warehousing facilities from gosselin group.govlog owned nothing except a couple of automobiles,a chair,and a table.
govlog earned no net revenues,as defined by its agreements with gosselin group,during the or fiscal years.as a result,govlog was not obligated to pay any funds to gosselin group in exchange for gosselin group business with the dod.govlog,however,paid gosselin group for the leased warehouse facilities and other gosselin group services.in other words,as a representative of govlog succinctly explained,the money that going to govlog is actually ending up being paid to gosselin.see.
meanwhile,on november,ammons qui tam action was transferred from the eastern district of missouri to the eastern district of virginia,where bunk qui tam action remained pending.the two qui tam suits were thereafter consolidated.in,after govlog was formed,the district court ordered the relators complaints unsealed.on july,ammons qui tam complaint was superseded by the government complaint in intervention.see b the government may elect to intervene and proceed with the action.the government did not,however,intervene in bunk qui tam suit 
in its complaint in intervention,the government named govlog as a defendant,alleging that govlog was a in interest of gosselin group.see compl.int.on october,bunk filed his second amended complaint,which also included govlog as a named defendant and alleged a successor corporation liability claim against govlog.in december,bunk amended his complaint again,filing his operative third amended complaint the bunk complaint.
the bunk complaint pleaded various fca theories of liability against the gosselin defendants and others.suing in his individual capacity,bunk joined several additional claims,including a claim and state law claims.see bunk,at citations omitted.as we observed in bunk,however,only his dpm claim was not superseded by the government complaint in intervention 
although the government did not intervene in the bunk proceeding,the district court determined that all of bunk claims had nonetheless been effectively superseded by the government complaint in intervention,except for count ii of the bunk complaint,which sought recovery under the fca for gosselin actions in connection with the dpm scheme.
id.at see also bunk compl.alleging that the gosselin defendants knowingly made,used,or caused to be used a false record or statement to get a false claim paid or approved by the united states government.by incorporating and realleging a substantial portion of the bunk complaint,see bunk compl,count ii of the bunk complaint alleged the successor corporation liability contention in the following terms 
the transaction between govlog and gosselin group is,knowingly,a sham transaction for inadequate consideration through which gosselin group its operating subsidiaries still profit through their business interests in shipping related to government markets and that transaction is designed to hinder,delay defraud relators as a potential judgment creditor.
on may,after the government and the relators had moved for summary judgment on the issue of whether govlog was liable as a successor corporation of gosselin group,the district court severed the claims against govlog from those against the gosselin defendants.the court then proceeded to conduct a trial,seeking to first resolve the claims against the gosselin defendants.
the jury trial on the dpm,itgbl,and covan claims against the gosselin defendants began in alexandria on july,at the close of the government case,on july,the district court awarded judgment as a matter of law to the gosselin defendants on the itgbl claim.the dpm and covan claims were submitted to the jury,and on august,the jury returned a verdict against the gosselin defendants on the dpm claim and in favor of the gosselin defendants on the covan claim.
with respect to the dpm scheme,the trial evidence established that the gosselin defendants had submitted false invoices to the dod.each of those false claims authorized the imposition of a minimum civil penalty of.as we explained in our bunk decision,the imposition of no more than the statutory minimum would have resulted in a cumulative penalty just in excess of million.see at.nevertheless,the district court did not impose any civil penalties,ruling that such an award would be unconstitutionally punitive in violation of the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment.id.
both the government and the relators appealed,and the gosselin defendants.bunk challenged the district court denial of civil penalties in relation to the dmp claim the government challenged the court award of judgment to the gosselin defendants on the itgbl claim and the gosselin defendants argued that bunk lacked standing to sue.after rejecting the gosselin defendants standing argument,we directed the court to amend its civil penalties judgment and to award in civil penalties to bunk on the dpm claim.see bunk,at.we explained that such an award was not unconstitutionally excessive under the eighth amendment,and specified that the award appropriately reflects the gravity of gosselin offenses and provides the necessary and appropriate deterrent effect going forward.id.at.finally,we vacated the court entry of judgment in favor of the gosselin defendants on the itgbl claim.id.at.we thus remanded the matter for further proceedings 
in additional bunk remand proceedings,with the claims against the gosselin defendants having been resolved,the district court turned to the successor corporation liability claims that were pending against govlog.in that regard,the court initially focused on identifying the applicable legal test for a successor corporation liability claim.the relators requested that the court apply the substantial continuity test enunciated by this court in united states carolina transformer,cir,as an expansion of traditional common law principles.govlog contended,however,that use of the substantial continuity test was foreclosed by the supreme court decision in united states bestfoods.on september,the district court agreed with govlog and ruled that application of carolina transformer substantial continuity test in the context of the fca would be inconsistent with bestfoods.as a result,the court decided that only traditional common law principles would govern the issue of govlog liability as a successor corporation.the court then invited the parties to renew and litigate their motions for summary judgment.
relying on a fraudulent transaction theory of successor corporation liability under the common law,the relators and the government,on november,sought summary judgment with respect to the successor corporation liability claims.govlog then for summary judgment,also asking for judgment on the pleadings.in support of its request for judgment on the pleadings,govlog maintained that the government complaint in intervention and count ii of the bunk complaint failed to properly allege that govlog was liable as a successor corporation to gosselin group.in its summary judgment request,govlog cast the fraudulent transaction theory posited by the government and the relators as entirely speculative,arguing that the evidence was insufficient to create any material issues of fact,thereby entitling govlog to summary judgment.
on december,the district court granted judgment to govlog,utilizing two theories.see decision.the decision first concluded that neither complaint had properly alleged that govlog was liable as a successor corporation to gosselin group under any recognized legal theory.alternatively,the court concluded that govlog was entitled to summary judgment for want of a genuine dispute of material fact.indeed,the court ruled that the various transactions between gosselin group and govlog were not shown to have been pursued with a fraudulent intention.in the court view,there was simply no evidence sufficient to establish any of the recognized badges of fraud with respect to the creation and operation of govlog.id.at.
the district court observed that gosselin group had an absolute right to end its direct contractual relationship with the american carriers and there was nothing that could be deemed fraudulent based on that decision alone,and that gosselin group was not under any obligation to stay in any particular line of business in order to generate revenue to pay the judgment.see decision.the decision swept aside the government and the relators contentions that the transfer lacked consideration,explaining,inter alia,that gosselin group did not transfer or assign any itgbl contracts to govlog,and t here is likewise no evidence,expert or otherwise,that the various agreements between gosselin group and govlog failed to provide commercially reasonable terms or adequate consideration.id.at.accordingly,on december,the court entered judgment in favor of govlog.
the relators timely noted this appeal from the judgment.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to 
at the outset,we must address govlog contention that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over bunk successor corporation liability claim against govlog and that the claim thus must be dismissed.the question is whether the court possessed supplemental jurisdiction over bunk claim.
if a district court possesses original jurisdiction in a civil proceeding,it shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy.see a.supplemental jurisdiction is not limited to restatements of the same basic ground for recovery.white cty.of newberry,cir.indeed,the related claims need only revolve around a central fact pattern.id.we review de novo an issue of whether subject matter jurisdiction was possessed by a district court.see taylor kellogg brown root,cir.
original jurisdiction is supplied in these qui tam proceedings by bunk fca claim,the dpm claim.see.supplemental jurisdiction thus turns on whether the inquiry into the successor corporation liability claim against govlog involves the same facts as the fca claim.here,govlog liability as a successor corporate entity is wholly dependent on the gosselin defendants liability under the fca that is,the facts upon which the judgment against the gosselin defendants was predicated also serve as the foundation for govlog liability as a successor corporate entity.simply put,those two issues revolve around a central fact pattern.see white,at see also,bd.of,sheet metal workers pension fund elite erectors,cir.observing that federal courts may entertain theories in a single suit by way of supplemental jurisdiction.
nevertheless,govlog maintains that the district court lacked supplemental jurisdiction with respect to bunk successor corporation liability claim under the supreme court decision in peacock thomas.the peacock court was concerned with a district court exercise of ancillary jurisdiction over subsequent proceedings,concluding that ancillary jurisdiction is not justified over a new lawsuit to impose liability for a judgment on a third party.id.at emphasis added this matter is readily distinguishable from peacock.bunk successor corporation liability claim against govlog,as alleged in count ii of the bunk complaint,is not part of a new lawsuit indeed,the successor corporation liability question is part and parcel of bunk original qui tam action.accordingly,the peacock principle is inapplicable here,and the district court exercise of supplemental jurisdiction over the successor corporation liability claim against govlog was entirely appropriate.
turning to the heart of this appeal,we must assess and decide whether the district court erred by entering judgment in favor of govlog on the successor corporation liability issue.in the district court,bunk pressed two theories of successor corporation liability against govlog the substantial continuity theory,and the fraudulent transaction theory.after an opening round of briefing,the court rejected the substantial continuity test,deeming it inconsistent with supreme court precedent.additional briefing ensued,and the court decision ruled that bunk had not adequately pleaded the fraudulent transaction theory.in the alternative,the decision determined that the fraudulent transaction theory of successor corporation liability was without evidentiary support,leaving no genuine issue of material fact and entitling govlog to summary judgment.on appeal,bunk challenges each of those rulings.
as a general rule,a corporation that acquires the assets of another corporation does not also acquire its liabilities.see united states carolina transformer,cir.the traditional rule against successor corporation liability,however,is subject to four exceptions under the federal common law.that is,a successor corporation takes on the liabilities of its predecessor if 
the successor expressly or impliedly agrees to assume the liabilities of the predecessor the transaction may be considered a de facto merger the successor may be considered a mere continuation of the predecessor or the transaction is fraudulent.
the mere continuation theory authorizes the imposition of liability if,after the transfer of assets,only one corporation remains,and there is an identity of stock,stockholders,and directors between the two corporations.carolina transformer,at.bunk is unable to rely on the mere continuation theory because the two corporations govlog and gosselin group were both viable after the transfer.
bunk therefore relies on the more lax substantial continuity theory conceived in carolina transformer.substantial continuity expands on the mere continuation theory,allowing a court to look at an ensemble of at least eight factors to determine whether successor corporation liability should be imposed.see carolina transformer,at identifying relevant factors as retention of the same employees retention of the same supervisory personnel retention of the same production facilities in the same location production of the same product retention of the same name continuity of assets continuity of general business operations and whether the successor holds itself out as the continuation of the previous enterprise.
as the supreme court instructed in united states bestfoods,however,the failure of a statute to speak to a matter as fundamental as the liability implications of corporate ownership demands application of the rule that i n order to abrogate a principle,the statute must speak directly to the question addressed by the common law.see,second alteration in original quoting united states texas.put simply,the fca does not speak to successor corporation liability and thus has no impact on the traditional common law principles governing successor corporation liability.it follows that carolina transformer substantial continuity theory a theory that alters the common law mere continuation rule is not a viable theory for bunk to pursue.accordingly,we are satisfied that the district court properly declined to apply the substantial continuity test here.
without the substantial continuity theory,bunk must rely on the fourth exception identified in our carolina transformer decision the fraudulent transaction theory of successor corporation liability.the district court,however,rejected bunk allegations as insufficient with respect to that theory.see decision the court concludes that the plaintiffs had not,prior to the current round of summary judgment proceedings,adequately placed govlog on notice of their fraudulent transaction theory.we must therefore initially assess de novo whether the relevant pleading was legally sufficient.see teachers retirement of hunter,cir.
in general,to survive dismissal,a complaint must state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face by alleging factual matter to support the claims asserted.see ashcroft iqbal,quoting bell atl.twombly.more may be required,however,when a successor corporation liability claim is being pursued under the fraudulent transaction theory.in that circumstance,the complaint may need to satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.compare,ricciardello gant,supp,if plaintiff purports to rely on fraud to impose successor liability,he must plead with particularity facts from which fraud may be inferred.citing fed.civ.b,with old republic ins.hansa world cargo,p leadings of successor liability are subject to the lenient pleading requirements of rule a,not the more rigorous standards of rule b.in this proceeding,however,we need not either assess or decide whether rule b pleading requirements apply to a successor liability claim.that is because,assuming those standards are applicable,they are readily satisfied here.
pursuant to rule b,the plaintiff must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.malice,intent,knowledge,and other conditions of a person mind may be alleged generally.see fed.civ.b.although we must view the facts alleged in the operative complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,we will not accept legal conclusions couched as facts or unwarranted inferences,unreasonable conclusions,or arguments.see nathan,at quoting wag more dogs,llc cozart,cir.in simple terms,a plaintiff complies with rule b by,at a minimum,describ ing the time,place,and contents of the false representations,as well as the identity of the person making the misrepresentation and what he obtained thereby.see smith,cir.quoting united states triple canopy,cir.as a general rule,as we have recognized,a court should hesitate to dismiss a complaint under rule b if the court is satisfied that the defendant has been made aware of the particular circumstances for which she will have to prepare a defense at trial,and that plaintiff has substantial prediscovery evidence of those facts.id.quoting harrison westinghouse savannah river,cir.
by incorporating and realleging a substantial portion of the bunk complaint,see bunk compl,count ii of the bunk complaint alleges that,in or about june,two former employees of gosselin group formed govlog,hired over twenty employees of gosselin group and entered into agreements with gosselin group to purchase all of its business interests in shipping related to government markets.id.gosselin group and govlog,as count ii further alleges,then entered into various service agreements to enable govlog to be able to
