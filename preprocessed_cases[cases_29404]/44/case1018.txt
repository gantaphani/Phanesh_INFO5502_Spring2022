plaintiff pro se alvin fulton,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the western district of new york,charles siragusa,judge,dismissing his claims brought under against defendant laurie robinson,a police officer in the city of rochester,new york,for malicious prosecution,false arrest,and use of excessive force during arrest.the district court granted summary judgment dismissing the malicious prosecution and false arrest claims on the ground that they were foreclosed by the fact that fulton was convicted on one of the charges on which he was arrested the court dismissed the excessive force claim on the ground that the force used against fulton,in the circumstances,was not excessive.on appeal,fulton contends principally a that he is entitled to pursue his claims of malicious prosecution and false arrest because one of the charges on which he was arrested was dismissed on double jeopardy grounds,and b that the court erred in ruling as a matter of law that the force used against him was not excessive.he also makes various assertions of procedural error.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that summary dismissal of the complaint was appropriate.
background 
the present action has its origin in a domestic dispute between fulton and his estranged wife,mary lee mccoullough fulton mary,which was the subject of proceedings in new york family court in monroe county,new york,beginning in may.on may,the family court issued a temporary protective order prohibiting fulton,until june,from being within feet of mary that order was reissued on june,and remained in effect until july,collectively the protective order.most of the ensuing events are not genuinely in dispute where there are genuine disputes as to material facts,the record is viewed in the light most favorable to fulton as the party against whom summary judgment was granted.
a.the events of july,
on june,mary filed in family court a verified petition for violation of order of protection,stating that on that morning,fulton had come to the back door of her home,with a gun in his waistband and a gasoline can in his hand,and had threatened to kill her and burn her house down.the petition requested that fulton be jailed for the maximum time allowed.
on july,mary lodged a complaint with the police.in a written deposition,which contained a notice that any false statements therein would be punishable under of the new york penal law,she described fulton threats and conduct of june.in addition,she stated that on june,fulton came to her house around midnight and silently looked into her windows and she stated that on july,during an appearance in family court,fulton murmured,loudly enough for mary to hear but too softly for the judge to hear,apparently threatening words.based on mary deposition,rochester police officers filled out two sworn accusatory instruments against fulton with respect to his june conduct one was a felony charging him with criminal contempt in the first degree,in violation of penal b i,ii,and vi mckinney the other was a misdemeanor charging him with harassment in the second degree,in violation of penal and mckinney.
fulton learned of mary complaint from his attorney on july.he telephoned the police and stated that he would turn himself in at midnight.fulton was then temporarily staying in an apartment at frost avenue,rochester,which had been rented to one loretta davis,who was then in jail.following fulton call to the police,robinson went to frost avenue in order to arrest fulton but did not find him there.
later that evening,mary made a call seeking police assistance in removing property from the frost avenue apartment the call was apparently made on behalf of davis sister,samantha benjamin,who was taking care of one or more of davis children and wanted to pick up some of their clothing.in response to this call,five police officers went to the frost avenue apartment they were admitted into the building by its owner and its manager.fulton,who was then in davis apartment,was arrested on charges of criminal contempt in the first degree and harassment in the second degree.
the manner of,and participants in,that arrest are somewhat in dispute.fulton asserts that the police officers,after being let into the building,broke the locks on the door to davis apartment and forced their way in while he was asleep.he awoke to find robinson shining a flashlight in his face and pointing her gun at him.one or more of the other officers pointed guns and mace at him,kicked the bed frame,and verbally abused him.robinson denies that she was in the apartment at the time of fulton arrest she states that she was outside,securing the perimeter of the building.it is not disputed that after his arrest,fulton was placed in handcuffs and was taken to the police station by robinson in her patrol car.nor is it disputed that fulton threatened to kick out the car windows and that,in response,robinson threatened to him.
resolutions of the charges against fulton 
on august,fulton was indicted in a indictment that included three counts based on his alleged conduct on june one count of criminal contempt for violating the protective order by placing mary in reasonable fear of physical injury by displaying what appeared to be a pistol,revolver,or other firearm or by means of a threat or threats count one one count of criminal contempt for violating the protective order by coming within feet of mary count two and one count of harassment in that with intent to harass,annoy or alarm another person,to wit,mary fulton,fulton did strike,shove,kick or otherwise subject such other person to physical contact or attempted or threatened to do the same count three.in addition,fulton was charged with five counts of criminal contempt or harassment for other alleged violations of the protective order between june and june and he was charged with two counts of harassment for threatening robinson on july.
in september,proceedings were held in family court on mary complaints that fulton had violated the protective order on june and june.see family court transcript,september,at the court we are scheduled to continue the concerning the two violations of order of protection case.those proceedings were resolved by a settlement,as reflected in the following colloquy 
the court all right.on these matters,my understanding is that an order of protection for three years by stipulation without the court making any specific findings of aggravating circumstances would be acceptable to fulton 
what being proposed is that this order of protection,fulton,would take care of the three cases that i have.
two of those cases are contempt cases.each one of those could carry a jail term of up to six months.and those petitions would be withdrawn.
and i would make a one year order of protection on the family offense proceeding without finding that anything wrong happened,simply to settle the matters between you and fulton.
there would be an order of protection to direct that you stay away from fulton wherever she may be and have no contact with her 
i will also place you on probation for a period of one year.
you do not have to agree to this.you have the right to have the trial continue,and have the matters concluded,but if you do agree,you are giving up the right to have a trial.
respondent alvin fulton i understand that very well,judge.
the court all right.
respondent alvin fulton also,let it it also noted in that agreement that this is without prejudice.
the court well,it prejudice is not the term that used.i not making any findings.
respondent alvin fulton you not making a finding 
the court there is prejudice to you because if you violate this order,you can be prosecuted in criminal court and in family court.and in criminal court the penalties can be a class d felony in certain cases.
in family court,again,you could be prosecuted and a request made for six months incarceration for each and every violation.so i ca say that this is without any prejudice to you because there could be prejudice if you violated it.
respondent alvin fulton i understand this,judge.
the court but i not finding that anything wrong happened.
the court i going to make a one year order of,three year order of protection 
i going to ask that the clerk office prepare that order right away.there are no aggravating circumstances noted.this is by stipulation and without a finding.
and i going to make a one year term of probation 
some three weeks after this disposition,fulton moved in new york supreme court for monroe county to dismiss the august indictment,contending principally that the charges had been resolved in the family court proceeding and that the criminal prosecution was thus barred by principles of double jeopardy.the supreme court,in a decision dated october,first supreme court decision,ordered fulton to submit documentary support for his contention that the family court adjudication constituted a previous prosecution as defined in the new york criminal procedure law,including the family court protective order,the petition alleging violation of that order,and the papers and transcripts revealing the final disposition of those allegations.see first supreme court decision at.after receiving the additional information,the court,in a decision dated october,second supreme court decision,granted the motion to dismiss as to the criminal contempts charged in counts one and two,which were based on fulton june conduct collectively the june contempt counts,and count eight,which was based on his june conduct.the court denied the motion to dismiss the remaining counts,most of which charged conduct other than the june and june acts that were at issue in the september family court proceeding.see second supreme court decision at i n the family court hearing,the alleged victim only testified to an alleged incident on june,which is the subject of counts one,two and three of the indictment,and the alleged incident on june,which is the subject of count eight in the indictment.the supreme court refused to dismiss count three,charging fulton with harassment on june,because that count and the family court charge of violating a protective order each contained an element that was not an element in the other.see id.at.
in january,after a jury trial in supreme court,fulton was convicted of all the undismissed charges in the indictment.
c.the present action 
fulton commenced the present action in,asserting a variety of personal and property claims in connection with the family court proceedings and the events of july,naming as defendants robinson,mary,benjamin,the family court judge,monroe county and its sheriff,the city of rochester,the frost avenue building owner,and the building manager.by order dated may,the district court,john curtin,judge,dismissed all of fulton claims except those against robinson for excessive force,false arrest,and malicious prosecution.
following a period of discovery and unsuccessful motions by both sides for summary judgment,judge siragusa,to whom the case had been reassigned,granted a motion by robinson for summary judgment,which asserted both qualified immunity and lack of merit,dismissing the remaining claims against robinson for lack of merit.noting that there was a dispute as to whether robinson had participated in fulton arrest,the court assumed for purposes of the summary judgment motion that she had participated,see amended decision and order dated november,november opinion,at but it concluded that the claims for false arrest and malicious prosecution were barred because fulton had been convicted on one of the charges on which he was arrested.the court stated that 
robinson relies on the existence of an arrest package which charged fulton with the felony offense of criminal contempt in the first degree and the violation of harassment in the second degree,both charges based on fulton conduct on june.the june conduct formed the basis for his arrest on july,and eventual indictment by the grand jury on august,the first two counts of the indictment charged fulton with violations of a family court order of protection by his conduct on june,the third count alleged the same conduct,time and place,but charged him with the violation of harassment in the second degree.the first two counts were dismissed in criminal court since fulton had already undergone a factual hearing on the underlying conduct in family court and entered into an agreement to be placed on one year of probation as a result.though fulton lawyer,in his motion in criminal court,characterized fulton as having pleaded guilty in family court to the violation of the order of protection,fulton at oral argument insisted that family court judge kohout specifically found that he had committed no wrong this court notes that one can not be placed on probation if one is not found responsible for conduct supporting the underlying charge.nevertheless,fulton went to trial on the remaining counts in the indictment,including the third count charging harassment in the second degree,and was found guilty.
november opinion at.citing cameron fogarty,cir,cert.denied,d,the district court stated the general rule that if the arrested individual is subsequently convicted of the offense for which he was arrested,that conviction bars a claim under for,inter alia,false arrest or malicious prosecution,november opinion at and it noted that fulton had been subsequently convicted of harassment in the second degree,one of the offenses for which he was arrested by robinson,id.at.although the june criminal contempt charge on which fulton was arrested had been dismissed on grounds of double jeopardy,the district court reasoned that fulton conviction of harassment,the remaining arrest charge,sufficed to bar his claims,given that all of the june charges were based on the same underlying conduct on a single occasion against a single victim.
as to the claim of excessive force,the district court noted that fulton did not claim that he was subjected to actual physical force,but only that robinson was shining her light and her gun,in the plaintiff face when the police entered the apartment where he was sleeping on july.id.at quoting fulton deposition testimony.fulton contended that his arrest should not have been at gunpoint.id.at emphasis in original.the court concluded that the arrest of fulton at gunpoint was justified in light of robinson knowledge of the undisputed facts,inter alia,that fulton had previously been convicted of criminal possession of a weapon and that he was wanted on a felony charge in connection with threats he had made to mary while displaying a gun in his belt.
judgment was entered dismissing the complaint,and this appeal followed.the only claims whose dismissals are challenged on appeal are the malicious prosecution,false arrest,and excessive force claims against robinson.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,fulton contends principally that,because the contempt charge on which he was arrested was dismissed on grounds of double jeopardy,the district court erred as a matter of law in ruling that his claims of malicious prosecution and false arrest were foreclosed by his conviction of harassment.he also pursues his contention that his arrest at gunpoint constituted the use of excessive force,and he makes various claims of procedural error.we affirm the dismissal of fulton excessive force claim for the reasons stated by the district court we reject fulton other contentions for the reasons that follow.
a.the claim of false arrest 
a claim of false arrest based on the fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures may not be maintained if there was probable cause for the arrest.see,weyant okst,cir singer fulton county sheriff,cir there can be no federal civil rights claim for false arrest where the arresting officer had probable cause,cert.denied,d.an arresting officer advised of a crime by a person who claims to be the victim,and who has signed a complaint or information charging someone with the crime,has probable cause to effect an arrest absent circumstances that raise doubts as to the victim veracity.id.at.
in the district court proceedings,fulton did not dispute that he had been arrested on charges of criminal contempt and harassment
