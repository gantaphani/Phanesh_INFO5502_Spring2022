opinion of the court 
this lawsuit,which concerns the mismanagement of a nursing home and its ensuing bankruptcy,comes before the court for a third time on appeal.in the present appeal,the defendants,two former officers and fourteen former directors of the nursing home,present several challenges to the jury verdict,which found them liable for breach of fiduciary duties and deepening insolvency.the jury also imposed punitive damages against the two officers and five of the directors.
we will affirm the jury liability findings and the punitive damages award imposed against the administrator and the chief financial officer of the nursing home.we will,however,vacate the jury award of punitive damages against the defendants who served on the nursing home board of directors.we conclude that the punitive damages award against those defendants was not supported by evidence sufficient to establish that they acted with malice,vindictiveness and a wholly wanton disregard of the rights of others.smith renaut,citations omitted.
the lemington home for the aged the home,established in,was the oldest,unaffiliated nursing home in the united states dedicated to the care of african america n seniors.app.as part of its mission statement,the home sought to e stablish,support,maintain and operate an institution that is able to extend nursing home care for persons who are infirm due to age and other reasons,without regard to age,sex,race,religion,and to do so regardless of whether such persons themselves have the ability to pay for such care.app.
defendant mel lee causey was hired to serve as the home administrator and chief executive officer in september.defendant james shealey became the home chief financial officer in december and reported to causey defendants arthur baldwin,jerome bullock,angela ford,joanne andiorio,wallace,twyla johnson,nicole gaines,william thompkins,roy penner,eugene downing,george calloway,leber,and the reverend ronald peters all served as members of the board of directors of the home collectively,director defendants,and had direct supervisory control,authority and responsibility over causey.app.
the home had been beset with financial troubles for decades,but had remained afloat with help from the city of pittsburgh,allegheny county,and donations from several private foundations.in re lemington home for the aged lemington i,cir.the home financial difficulties became particularly acute during the early,under the management of the officer defendants.the home was cited by the pennsylvania department of health for deficiencies at a rate almost three times greater than the average nursing home operating in the state.in,causey began working in her capacity as administrator,although state law required all nursing homes to employ administrators.that year,two patients died under suspicious circumstances while residing at the home,resulting in investigations by the pennsylvania department of health.the home patient recordkeeping and billing were in a state of disarray.
on january,the board convened and voted to close the home.however,its chapter petition was not filed until april of that year.during the intervening period,the patient census dropped to as low as patients.at a bankruptcy status conference held on june,no one expressed any interest in funding or acquiring the home,and the bankruptcy court therefore approved the home closure.lemington i,at.it was later revealed that the home had delayed filing its monthly operating reports for may and june until september,although the reports would have shown that the home received nearly million in nursing home assessment tax payments,which could have increased its chances of finding a buyer.id.
in november,the bankruptcy court granted the request made by the committee of unsecured creditors the committee to bring this adversary proceeding against causey,shealey,and the director defendants claiming breach of fiduciary duty,breach of the duty of loyalty,and deepening insolvency.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on all claims.
on appeal,we vacated the district court grant of summary judgment in its entirety,concluding that our independent review of the record discloses genuine disputes of material facts on all claims.id.at.on remand,the district court set stringent time limits for trial,which the defendants contested before this court in a request for a writ of mandamus.we denied the defendants request but urged the district court to consider increasing the time allotted for trial.in re baldwin,cir.
the district court increased the time limits and the case proceeded to a jury trial,which began on february.at the close of the committee case,the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law,whiich the district court granted with respect to the breach of the duty of loyalty claim against the director defendants and denied in all other respects.following the close of trial,the jury deliberated for three days before returning a compensatory damages verdict against fifteen of the seventeen defendants,jointly and severally,in the amount of.the jury awarded punitive damages in the amount of,individually,against five of the director defendants.the jury also awarded punitive damages of million against shealey and against causey.
following the verdict,the defendants filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law,a new trial,or remittitur.the district court denied that motion in its entirety.this appeal followed.
we exercise plenary review of an order granting or denying a motion for judgment as a matter of law and apply the same standard as the district court.lightning lube,witco,cir citation omitted.a judgment notwithstanding the verdict may be granted under.b only if,as a matter of law,the record is critically deficient of that minimum quantity of evidence from which a jury might reasonably afford relief.trabal wells fargo armored serv,cir quotation marks and citations omitted.because the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff,we must examine the record in a light most favorable to the plaintiff,giving her the benefit of all reasonable inferences,even though contrary inferences might reasonably be drawn.dudley jersey metal,cir.
the defendants first argue that the committee introduced insufficient evidence at trial to establish that the director and officer defendants had breached their duty of care and that the officer defendants had additionally breached their duty of loyalty.we disagree.the committee presented evidence to the jury that was sufficient to support a rational finding that the defendants had breached their fiduciary duties by failing to exercise reasonable diligence and prudence in their oversight and management of the home.
officer defendants 
pennsylvania law provides 
a n officer shall perform his duties as an officer in good faith,in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation and with such care,including reasonable inquiry,skill and diligence,as a person of ordinary prudence would use under similar circumstances.
ann.c.the duty of loyalty under pennsylvania law requires that corporate officers devote themselves to the corporate affairs with a view to promote the common interests and not their own.tyler.
the committee presented extensive evidence at trial of causey mismanagement of the home in her role as administrator,clearly satisfying the minimum quantity of evidence required to sustain the jury verdict on appeal.trabal,at.the jury heard testimony that it was causey responsibility as the nursing home administrator to 
make sure that there are contracts in place,that the facility is being managed financially,that bills are being paid,that the nursing staff is adequate in its numbers as well as in their education and training,and that the facility is operating in compliance with both federal and state regulations,which are really very extensive.
evidence presented at trial demonstrated that causey fell far short of fulfilling these responsibilities.throughout causey tenure,the home was not in compliance with federal and state regulations.causey began her role as administrator in.t here were significant problems identified by the pennsylvania department of health,the inspectors of the nursing home from through app.the home was cited repeatedly for failing to keep proper documentation of residents clinical records.in,the department of health launched an investigation following the death of patient elaine carrington.the review concluded that causey lacks the qualifications,the knowledge of the pc regulations and the ability to direct staff to perform personal care services as required.app.this evaluation,citing causey inexperience and lack of qualifications,came after causey had already been in the role of administrator for more than six years.
the jury also heard testimony that,at the time of carrington death,causey was not working at the home,despite holding the title of administrator and collecting her full salary.pennsylvania law requires all facilities of the home size to employ a administrator.but in an application for disability benefits she filed with the state,causey represented that she was working only to hours per week at lemington for more than eight months in.app.when confronted at trial with this portion of her benefits application,causey avoided giving a precise figure for how many hours she worked during this period,although she eventually admitted,i was working.app.
we are satisfied that the jury was presented with more than sufficient evidence to conclude that causey breached her duty of care.additionally,testimony regarding causey decision to stay on as an administrator despite being unable to serve as required under state law supported the jury verdict that she breached her duty of loyalty by collecting her full salary while not in fact fulfilling the duties of the role for which she was being compensated.
the jury also heard sufficient evidence to support its determination that defendant shealey breached his duties of care and loyalty as chief financial officer.the committee presented testimony from william terrence brown,a nursing home consultant who had conducted an assessment of the home on behalf of a major creditor in may.brown testified that during his review,he requested records from shealey,including the latest financial statements,monthly,internally prepared,the annual audits,the last year medicare and medicaid cost reports,the nursing reports,the census data,accounts receivable and accounts payable,and aging reports app.brown testified that he repeatedly asked shealey for this information,but it was not provided to him.
brown also testified that,towards the end of his review of the home,shealey,in an attempt to avoid brown persistent requests for basic financial information,locked himself in his office.brown responded by camp ing outside of shealey office,waiting for him to leave in order to speak with him about the home finances.app.brown testified that when he finally managed to speak with shealey 
i said,shealey,there really are any books are there and he said no.
so i said,well,shealey,you got to have something that you keep an idea of what kind of cash is in the bank.so what do you use for that 
and he said,well,i got,you know,a little excel spread sheet i use,only i try to keep a bank balance.
id.when pressed by brown as to how long he had operated without a general ledger that recorded the home finances in detail,shealey admitted that june,was the last time they kept any books.id.brown testified that shealey never provided him with the excel spreadsheet he allegedly used in lieu of a general ledger.despite shealey failure to provide these documents to brown,minutes from a board meeting following brown visit state that shealey informed the board that brown had received everything he requested.app.brown also testified that,under shealey,the home had failed to bill for medicare since august.brown calculated that this resulted in the home failing to collect at least it was due for services rendered.app.
the committee also introduced into evidence an email that shealey sent to a representative of mount ararat baptist church in april,before the home had filed for bankruptcy.the proposal suggested that ararat purchase lemington to create a revitalized faith based retirement community named mount ararat retirement community marc.app.the proposal indicated that shealey would assume the position of marc president and chief executive officer.app.director baldwin testified that he believed shealey involvement in this potential sale was inappropriate,as shealey would receive a benefit if the home was merged with ararat.app.
the jury therefore heard sufficient evidence to find that shealey fell far short of fulfilling his duty to act with such care,including reasonable inquiry,skill and diligence,as a person of ordinary prudence would use under similar circumstances.ann.c.a person serving as chief financial officer with reasonable skill and diligence would not fail to maintain a general ledger for over nine months,refuse to meet with a consultant hired by a major creditor of the home,and forgo collection of upwards of due to the home in medicare payments.shealey decision to stay on as cfo despite his inability to competently fulfill the duties with which he was charged,combined with his proposal that ararat purchase the home and elevate him to the position of president and ceo,also gave the jury a sufficient basis for concluding that shealey acted in,breaching his duty of loyalty to the home.
director defendants 
the evidence also supported a finding that the director defendants breached their duty of care by failing to take action to remove causey and shealey once the results of their mismanagement became apparent.
pennsylvania law provides 
a directors.a director of a nonprofit corporation shall stand in a fiduciary relation to the corporation and shall perform his duties as a director in good faith,in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation and with such care,including reasonable inquiry,skill and diligence,as a person of ordinary prudence would use under similar circumstances.in performing his duties,a director shall be entitled to rely in good faith on information,opinions,reports or statements,including financial statements and other financial data,in each case prepared or presented by any of the following one or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented.counsel,public accountants or other persons as to matters which the director reasonably believes to be within the professional or expert competence of such person 
b effect of actual knowledge.a director shall not be considered to be acting in good faith if he has knowledge concerning the matter in question that would cause his reliance to be unwarranted.
the jury heard testimony that the board was responsible for the oversight of the nursing home administrator and for the hiring and firing of the home management staff.app.the directors were aware that the home had three times the deficiencies of the average nursing home operating in the state during causey tenure as administrator.app.the jury heard testimony that an independent review of the home in recommended that,due to the home continued citations for health violations,causey should be replaced with a seasoned nursing home administrator.app.the report further urged that t he facility can not improve overall patient care without a competent administrator on staff app.although the board sought and obtained a grant of from the pittsburgh foundation to fund the search for a new administrator,the funds were never used to find a replacement for causey,who remained at the home despite increasing evidence that her performance as the nursing home administrator was poor.app.
although the date by which the directors became aware that causey was working from april through december was contested at trial,some evidence was introduced that the board allowed causey to continue to operate and collect her full salary as administrator with the knowledge she was working,in violation of state law.director andiorio testified that causey informed the board that she would be working and the board did not intervene to replace her with a administrator.app.the jury also heard testimony from director baldwin that the board elevated shealey into a role as a ceo type figure from december through may,even after the board discovered that shealey had not been maintaining proper financial records for the home in his role as.
this evidence supported the jury finding that the director defendants did not exercise reasonable prudence and care in continuing to employ causey and shealey.the director defendants kept causey in the role of administrator and ceo for six years in the face of abnormally high deficiency findings.even after she ceased working at the home,in violation of state law,the director defendants allowed causey to continue in her role as administrator.this is not a case where directors,acting in reliance on information,opinions,reports or statements prepared by employees or experts,made a business decision to continue to employ an administrator whose performance was arguably less than ideal.ann.a.the jury heard testimony that the director defendants received several independent reports documenting causey shortcomings and urging that she be replaced.the director defendants therefore had actual knowledge of her mismanagement,yet stuck their heads in the sand in the face of repeated signs that residents were receiving care that was severely deficient.this is enough to support the jury verdict that the director defendants breached their duty of care to the home.
the defendants next argue that the committee introduced insufficient evidence to support the jury verdict that the defendants had deepened the home insolvency.even when a corporation is insolvent,its corporate property may have value,which can be damaged by t he fraudulent and concealed incurrence of debt official comm.of unsecured creditors lafferty,cir.thus,we have predicted that pennsylvania courts would recognize the tort of deepening insolvency,defining it as an injury to the debtors corporate property from the fraudulent expansion of corporate debt and prolongation of corporate life.id.at we are satisfied that the committee introduced sufficient evidence to support the jury deepening insolvency verdict.
the committee presented evidence that the director defendants concealed for over three months the board january decision to close the home and deplete the patient census.in lemington i,we held that this evidence could suggest to a jury that although the board knew that its actions would cause further deterioration of the home finances to the detriment of its creditors,by its silence,the board consciously defrauded the home creditors by implementing these policies and delaying the filing of bankruptcy at.trial testimony from brown,the bankruptcy consultant for the major creditors,supported the committee theory that the board decision to deplete the patient census before it filed for bankruptcy resulted in a slow death of the home ability to generate revenue.app.the committee presented additional evidence that,during the bankruptcy process,the board failed to disclose in its monthly operating reports that the home had received a million nursing home assessment tax payment in may,which could have increased the home chances of finding a buyer.an email from the board bankruptcy attorney to the board summed up the mismanagement of the bankruptcy process,warning that we have not established a sale process in a manner that is customarily done in chapter cases.nobody has had the opportunity to bid and we have no meaningful financial records.app.
as to the officer defendants,the committee presented evidence that causey and shealey mismanagement of the home finances,inattention to recordkeeping and patient billing,and failure to conduct a proper bankruptcy process damaged the already insolvent home value.shealey did not maintain a general ledger of the home finances in his capacity as cfo.as a result of the errors repeatedly identified by the pennsylvania department of health during causey tenure,the home did not recoup reimbursements it was due for care provided to medicare patients,resulting in an estimated loss to the home of.app.during the bankruptcy process,shealey refused to meet with brown,the consultant hired by the home major creditors,and did not make information about the home financial condition available to potential buyers.all of this conduct damaged the home financial viability after it had already become insolvent.thus,the jury verdict on the deepening insolvency claim had ample evidentiary support.
finally,the seven defendants against whom the jury imposed punitive damages argue that the jury was not presented with certain factual prerequisites necessary to support a punitive damages award.first,the defendants argue that there was no evidence introduced of any defendant financial status,even though wealth is a relevant consideration for punitive damage awards under pennsylvania law and the district court instructed the jury that they could consider the defendants wealth in fixing the amount of punitive damages.the defendants also argue that the jury was not presented with sufficient evidence of the defendants subjective state of mind to justify the imposition of punitive damages.
although we conclude that wealth evidence is not a necessary prerequisite for an award of punitive damages under pennsylvania law,we agree that the evidence presented to the jury did not contain the minimum quantum of proof of outrageous conduct necessary to support a punitive damages award against any of the director defendants.we will therefore vacate the punitive damages imposed against five of the director defendants.however,because we conclude that adequate evidence was presented to support a finding that shealey and causey acted outrageously,we will affirm the jury punitive damages verdict as to them.
evidence regarding wealth of the defendants 
at the close of trial,the district court instructed the jury on the relevant factors they could consider in fashioning a punitive damages award under of the second restatement of torts,which pennsylvania has adopted.in particular,the court instructed the jurors that they could consider t he wealth of the defendant or defendants insofar as it is relevant in fixing an amount that will punish him or her,and deter him or her and others from like conduct in the future.app.however,no evidence of the defendants wealth had been introduced to the jury during the trial in any form,either testimonial or documentary.
defendants argue that the punitive damage award can not stand because the jury was not presented with any evidence regarding the wealth of any defendant and therefore could not evaluate what amount of punitive damages would serve as an appropriate deterrent.the wealth of a defendant is indeed one of the three factors that can properly be consider ed by the trier of fact in assessing an award of punitive damages under.nonetheless,that section use of the permissive can,rather than the compulsory must,suggests that evidence of a defendant wealth is not a necessary prerequisite to an award of punitive damages.the weight of pennsylvania case law agrees that evidence of a tortfeasor wealth is not a necessary condition precedent for imposition of an award of punitive damages.vance and,collecting cases.
despite permissive language,the defendants urge that evidence of wealth is a necessary prerequisite to an award of punitive damages.the defendants point to case law which they claim suggests that the fact finder is required to weigh a defendant wealth to properly calibrate an assessment of punitive damages.in kirkbride lisbon contractors,the pennsylvania supreme court rejected a defendant claim that a punitive damages award must be proportional to an award of compensatory damages,noting that such a requirement would undermine the deterrent purpose of such awards 
if the purpose of punitive damages is to punish a tortfeasor for outrageous conduct and to deter him or others from similar conduct,then a requirement of proportionality defeats that purpose.it is for this reason that the wealth of the tortfeasor is relevant.in making its determination,the ju
