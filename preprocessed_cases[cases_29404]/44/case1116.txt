opinion of the court 
mary glover glover appeals the district court dismissal of her claims against defendants mark udren and udren law offices udren or udren defendants under the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa and pennsylvania fair credit extension uniformity act fceua.this appeal requires us to flesh out the notice requirements inherent in federal rule of civil procedure c,as well as address novel issues of statutory interpretation pertaining to each statute.we will affirm.
factual background 
in august of,glover entered into a mortgage loan transaction with washington mutual bank wamu.after suffering injuries from an automobile accident in march of,glover fell behind on her mortgage and requested a agreement to reduce her monthly payments.wamu initially threatened to foreclose on the home,but subsequently agreed to postpone her payments until the request had been evaluated.eventually,on march,wamu denied glover request.
around this time,bill murray,an attorney with udren law offices,called glover and informed her that she owed wamu eleven missed mortgage payments,in addition to attorney fees and costs,totaling approximately.on april,wamu filed a foreclosure complaint against glover in the court of common pleas of allegheny county,claiming on the mortgage and threatening foreclosure if glover did not pay.the aggregate claim included in principal,in interest,in anticipated court costs,in anticipated attorney fees,and various other fees.mark udren of udren law offices was counsel of record on wamu foreclosure complaint.no further action took place following this initial filing.
after various communications between glover and wamu assignee,wells fargo glover entered into a loan modification agreement agreement or modification agreement with wells fargo on january.the agreement stipulated to unpaid principal in the amount of,increased glover monthly payment,and extended the repayment period by six years.although glover began making payments under the agreement soon thereafter,the foreclosure complaint was not discontinued until november.
ii.procedural history 
on june,glover filed a putative complaint in the court of common pleas of allegheny county against wamu,wells fargo,and the udren defendants,alleging,inter alia,violations of the fceua.ann.a,premised in turn on broadly alleged violations of the fdcpa,et.the case was removed to the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania on july,and motions to dismiss were filed by all defendants.
on october,the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic,in its capacity as receiver for wamu filed a motion for a stay for glover to submit her claims against wamu to the fdic mandatory claims review process.the motion was granted on october.on january,at the conclusion of the stay,the fdic again moved to stay the proceedings pending completion of its review process.the motion was granted over glover objections on march,and reaffirmed on june.on september,the fdic denied glover claims against wamu.
glover filed a first amended complaint on october,adding a count against the udren defendants for fdcpa violations arising out of the udren defendants alleged failure to voluntarily discontinue the foreclosure complaint after glover signed the modification agreement.app.at.the udren defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b.on june,the magistrate judge issued a revised report recommending dismissal of the newly alleged fdcpa claim against the udren defendants with prejudice.
on june,glover filed a second amended complaint,adding goldman sachs as a defendant and restyling,among other claims,the fdcpa claim against the udren defendants.app.at.the magistrate judge vacated the revised report to allow filing of the second amended complaint,but subsequently reinstated the report.on august,adopting the revised report,the district court entered an order dismissing the first amended complaint fdcpa and fceua counts against the udren defendants without prejudice,thereby rendering the second amended complaint the operative pleading 
on october,the udren defendants filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint.the district court granted the motion as to the fdcpa claim,finding that the amended complaint was not filed within the fdcpa statute of limitations,d,and did not relate back to the timely filed original complaint under federal rule of civil procedure c b.the district court also dismissed glover fceua claims against the udren defendants,finding that the udren defendants were not debt collectors under the fceua because glover mortgage was a purchase money mortgage,and hence excluded from the fceua definition of debt.see.ann.glover timely appealed.

iv.analysis 
glover appeals the district court dismissal of her fdcpa and fceua claims against the udren defendants.we address each claim in turn.
fair debt collection practices act 
the district court treated the fdcpa claim against the udren defendants as accruing on january,the date on which the modification agreement was signed.although the fdcpa imposes a statute of limitations from the date of the alleged violation,glover filed her first amended complaint,in which she first presented this claim,on october.glover argued that the claim was timely because it related back to her original complaint under federal rule of civil procedure c b,or,in the alternative,because the statute of limitations was tolled during the fdic mandatory review of her claims against wamu.the district court found that glover first amended complaint bore absolutely no connection to her original claims against the udren defendants,and therefore rejected glover relation back argument.and after generously accounting for the stays issued in response to the fdic claims review process,the district court calculated that the statute of limitations expired on october,five days before glover filed her first amended complaint.
on appeal,glover submits that the district court erred in finding that her amended fdcpa claim against the udren defendants did not relate back to her original complaint.she also argues that the district court erred in calculating the statute of limitations by using the incorrect accrual date for her claim and by failing to toll the statute of limitations for the proper length of time.
relation back 
glover initially contends that the district court erred in finding that her amended fdcpa claim against the udren defendants did not relate back to her original complaint.despite the presence of overlapping facts between the two pleadings,we reach the same result because glover original pleading failed to give fair notice to the udren defendants of her subsequently amended claim.
under federal rule of civil procedure c b,an amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading where the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set out or attempted to be set out in the original pleading.relation back is structured to balance the interests of the defendant protected by the statute of limitations with the preference expressed in the federal rules of civil procedure in general,and rule in particular,for resolving disputes on their merits.krupski costa crociere,d.where an amendment relates back,rule c allows a plaintiff to sidestep an statute of limitations,thereby permitting resolution of a claim on the merits,as opposed to a technicality.see id.at the same time,rule c endeavors to preserve the important policies served by the statute of limitations most notably,protection against the prejudice of having to defend against a stale claim,as well as society general interest in security and stability by requiring that the already commenced action sufficiently embraces the amended claims.nelson cnty.of allegheny,cir.
as we have explained,application of rule c b normally entails a search for a common core of operative facts in the two pleadings.bensel allied pilots ass n,cir.importantly,however,rule c is not merely an identity of transaction test,such as the rules governing joinder of claims or parties.charles allen wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice procedure.though not expressly stated,it is that the touchstone for relation back is fair notice,because rule c is premised on the theory that a party who has been notified of litigation concerning a particular occurrence has been given all the notice that statutes of limitations were intended to provide.baldwin cty.welcome ctr.brown,d bensel,at.thus,only where the opposing party is given fair notice of the general fact situation and the legal theory upon which the amending party proceeds will relation back be allowed.bensel,at.conversely,amendments that significantly alter the nature of a proceeding by injecting new and unanticipated claims are treated far more cautiously.united states hicks.
in bensel,we approved relation back of amendments that restate the original claim with greater particularity or amplify the factual circumstances surrounding the pertinent conduct.at.in that case,the plaintiff broad allegations of breach of a duty of fair representation in the original complaint easily encompassed the more particularized claims alleged in the amended pleading,and the defendant was therefore unquestionably on notice that it would be held liable for every possible breach of its fair representation duty occasioned by the outlined facts.id.thus,the facts in bensel fit squarely within the contours of rule c b,and gave us no opportunity to speak to the limits imposed by the notice requirement.
we do so now where the original pleading does not give a defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff amended claim is and the grounds upon which it rests,the purpose of the statute of limitations has not been satisfied and it is not an original pleading that can be rehabilitated by invoking rule c.baldwin,at internal marks and citation omitted see wright et,federal practice procedure although not expressly mentioned in the rule,courts also inquire into whether the opposing party has been put on notice regarding the claim or defense raised by the amended pleading.only if the pleading has performed that function will the amendment be allowed to relate back.put another way,the underlying question for a rule c analysis is whether the original complaint adequately notified the defendants of the basis for liability the plaintiffs would later advance in the amended complaint.meijer,biovail,emphasis added see wilson fairchild republic,cir the pertinent inquiry,in this respect,is whether the original complaint gave the defendant fair notice of the newly alleged claims.citing baldwin,at,overruled on other grounds by slayton am.express,cir adopting de novo standard of review for rule c.
here,we can not agree that glover original complaint adequately notified the udren defendants of the basis for liability asserted against them in the amended fdcpa claim because it did not arise from the factual occurrences which,fairly construed,implicated the udren defendants in her first pleading.glover amended fdcpa claim specifically averred that the udren defendants violated the fdcpa by failing to withdraw the foreclosure complaint against glover after glover signed the modification agreement,because the foreclosure complaint constituted a continuing representation that glover had defaulted on and had not yet paid her mortgage debt.app.at.glover original complaint,by comparison,alleged no such conduct by the udren defendants.in fact,amongst the plethora of allegations made in glover page and paragraph complaint,glover accused the udren defendants only of making a phone call and of filing a foreclosure complaint demanding payment of purportedly unlawful attorney fees.both of these communications or representations would constitute violations of the fdcpa that are factually and legally distinct from each other and from the amended claim,see prohibiting any false,deceptive or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt,and could neither offer fair notice of the general fact situation nor of the legal theory upon which glover amended fdcpa claim relied.bensel,at.in other words,glover amended fdcpa claim differed in time and type from the claims earlier alleged against the udren defendants.see mayle felix,d oja army corps of eng rs,cir adding allegation of publication of private information in violation of privacy act did not relate back to earlier complaint alleging publication of same information,but at a different time and from a different url address.
we acknowledge,as we must,that the district court arguably mischaracterized the relationship between glover original and amended fdcpa claims as bearing absolutely no connection.buried amidst glover excruciatingly and often excessively detailed pleading so much so that it apparently evaded the eyes of the district court,and presented almost as an afterthought,paragraph averred that 
although the monetary claims in washington mutual foreclosure complaint have now long been resolved as a result of wells fargo and glover january,loan modification,neither washington mutual nor wells fargo have withdrawn that complaint.thus,the now existing public record shows that washington mutual is pursuing a claim for well over that,according to wells fargo january,agreement is neither due nor owing.this again is a form of double billing.
app.at compl.emphasis added.as glover observes,paragraph of the original complaint referenced the modification agreement and the foreclosure complaint,both of which pertain to her amended fdcpa claim against the udren defendants.yet factual overlap alone is not enough,because the original complaint must have given fair notice of the amended claim to qualify for relation back under rule c.see,mayle,at listing cases in which amended claim did not relate back for lack of fair notice despite presence of overlapping facts meijer,at although the original and amended claims have some elements and facts in common,the whole thrust of the amendments is to fault defendants,and to fault them for conduct different from that identified in the original complaint.
fair notice was lacking here.just as rule a requires that a complaint be presented with clarity sufficient to avoid requiring a district court or opposing party to forever sift through its pages in search of the nature of the plaintiff claim,jennings emry,cir,rule c can not save a complaint that obscures the factual predicate and legal theory of the amended claim.see bensel,at nelson,at relation back does not permit a plaintiff to perform an around the statute of limitations.pleadings are not like magic tricks,where a plaintiff can hide a claim with one hand,only to pull it from her hat with the other.here,the facts alleged in paragraph appeared entirely peripheral to the complaint central allegations concerning wamu and wells fargo direct communications with glover and,even under the most generous reading,gave no suggestion that the udren defendants were culpable in any way for the conduct attributed to wamu or wells fargo.c c requiring satisfaction of rule c b and notice to the new defendant for relation back where the amendment changes the party against whom a claim is asserted nelson,at discussing importance of notice require
