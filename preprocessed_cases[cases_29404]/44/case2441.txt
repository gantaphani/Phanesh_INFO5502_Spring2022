plaintiff andrea smith,personal representative of the estate of kelly smith,deceased,brought an action against defendant botsford general hospital,alleging that it violated the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala when it failed to stabilize kelly smith by an open femur transporting him.following a trial,the jury found in favor of plaintiff and awarded for economic damages and for damages.botsford filed several motions seeking a new trial or a damages award reduction.the district court denied the motions,and botsford appeals.
kelly smith,a man weighing approximately pounds,fractured his left leg during a rollover car accident.smith was transported to botsford,where examining doctors diagnosed him as having an open comminuted left femur break that causes the bone to pierce the skin.considering its limited capacity to care for someone smith size,botsford decided to transfer him to another hospital.while in the ambulance,smith condition began to deteriorate,and minutes into the transfer,he died from extensive blood loss.
plaintiff alleged that botsford failed to stabilize smith,as emtala requires,before transferring him.plaintiff witnesses testified that smith suffered progressive blood loss and that botsford needed to take additional measures,such as giving smith a blood transfusion,to stabilize his condition.botsford,by contrast,presented evidence that it had taken all appropriate steps to and did successfully stabilize smith before transferring him,that smith rapid deterioration could not have been anticipated,and that smith weight and cocaine and alcohol use contributed to his death.
the emergency medical treatment and active labor act places obligations of screening and stabilization upon hospitals and emergency rooms that receive patients suffering from an emergency medical condition.roberts galen of virginia,d.this case implicates emtala stabilization requirements.specifically,the act mandates 
in general 
if any individual whether or not eligible for benefits under this subchapter comes to a hospital and the hospital determines that the individual has an emergency medical condition,the hospital must provide either 
a within the staff and facilities available at the hospital,for such further medical examination and such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition,or 
b for transfer of the individual to another medical facility in accordance with subsection c of this section.
b.to stabilize under the act means,with respect to an emergency medical condition to provide such medical treatment of the condition as may be necessary to assure,within reasonable medical probability,that no material deterioration of the condition is likely to result from or occur during the transfer of the individual from a facility.e a.the supreme court clarified that a plaintiff need not prove the existence of an improper motive to bring suit under emtala.roberts,at.
expert testimony 
botsford contends that the district court abused its discretion in striking defense expert robert aranosian testimony.aranosian testified during his deposition that smith died not from hemorrhagic shock and blood loss,but instead from cardiac arrest brought on by eight comorbidities,including his morbid obesity,history of alcoholism,smoking,and drug abuse.aranosian opinion regarding smith chronic alcoholism stemmed from conversations with smith deceased relative who had at one time consulted aranosian concerning smith drinking neither aranosian nor defense counsel disclosed this information until it came out during plaintiff of aranosian at trial.upon plaintiff counsel and the court questioning,aranosian admitted that smith relative routinely would come to my office and chat with me about his concern regarding smith habits and what i could do to assist him,and that outside of this personal knowledge,no other record evidence supported his opinion concerning smith chronic alcoholism.then,when asked,did you previously disclose this to anybody aranosian admitted,not until just now.
the district court decided to address this issue by striking entirely aranosian testimony.as the court saw it,aranosian had an affirmative obligation to disclose in advance of his deposition and trial testimony,that he had personal knowledge,even if it was second hand,and striking only the references to chronic alcoholism would not suffice to remedy the breach of this obligation.the court further found striking aranosian testimony not fundamentally unfair to botsford case,given that the testimony was largely cumulative of the testimony of another expert witness,witness the defense presented before aranosian testified.
botsford insists this move by the district court so prejudiced its case that it warrants reversal even under the highly deferential standard.we,however,find no abuse of discretion with the district court choice of sanction.fed.of civ.a b requires a party to disclose the data or other information considered by its expert in forming his opinions which botsford expert clearly failed to do here,as conceded by him under questioning.and rule,of the witness as a sanction for a rule violation.see roberts galen of virginia,cir.though rule also allows the district court to impose less stringent sanctions than mandatory preclusion,the district court choice to observe the rule primary directive exclusion,rather than its secondary options,did not constitute an abuse of its broad discretion.see ames van dyne,table,wl,at cir,b ecause the district court is in the best position to determine whether a party has complied with discovery orders,its discretion is especially broad.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.our conclusion is further strengthened by the district court finding,which botsford does not dispute,that aranosian testimony was cumulative of that provided by dragovic.
application of michigan cap on noneconomic damages 
botsford also raises several challenges to the damages award.we first address botsford contention that the noneconomic damages should be reduced in accordance with the michigan malpractice issue of first impression in this circuit.the cap,found in.comp.laws,limits noneconomic damages in an action for damages alleging medical malpractice to plaintiff,of course,vehemently objects to the application of the state cap.
as a threshold matter,we consider plaintiff argument that emtala does not incorporate state law damages caps under any circumstances.our analysis in this regard begins and ends with the plain language of the statute.emtala civil enforcement provisions specify that a ny individual who suffers personal harm as a direct result of a participating hospital violation of a requirement of the act may,in a civil action against the participating hospital,obtain those damages available for personal injury under the law of the state in which the hospital is located d a emphasis added.in plaintiff view,this language only requires courts to consider the types of damages recoverable under state law,not the amount.in support,plaintiff contrasts emtala to the federal tort claims act,which specifies that plaintiffs can recover damages in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.thus,plaintiff reasons,had congress intended to incorporate state damages caps,it would have included language similar to that found in the ftca.we find this argument unpersuasive.while we agree that the language in d a applies to elements of damages,we see nothing in the language of the section indicating that damages available does not also mean the amount of damages for which recovery is permitted under state law.power arlington hosp,cir.we thus join the majority of courts addressing the issue in finding that emtala incorporation of state law extends to caps on damages.see valencia francis hosp.health,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,agreeing with power and listing cases barris county of los angeles,cal th,d,same.but see cooper gulf breeze,discussing the differences between medical malpractice and emtala and declining to apply state procedural requirements applicable to malpractice claims.
