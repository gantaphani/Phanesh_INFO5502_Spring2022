this appeal involves a disappointed bidder who,after apparently winning the procurement race,lost the prize when the contracting agency deemed him and his company nonresponsible.after careful review,we conclude that the plaintiffs federal claims,to the extent they have been preserved,fail to state cognizable causes of action under.consequently,we affirm the district court dismissal of the action.
background 
since the district court decided this case on a motion to dismiss,we derive the raw facts from the plaintiffs amended complaint supplemented,for the sake of completeness,by certain uncontested facts.
the tale began on december,when the puerto rico public housing authority prpha awarded celta construction celta a contract to restore the lirios del sur housing project in ponce,puerto rico.the funds for that project had been assigned to prpha as part of a drug elimination program sponsored by the united states department of housing and urban development hud.
miguel is celta president.in a letter dated may,prpha informed celta that it was annulling the bid award because it had determined that and,therefore,celta was a nonresponsible bidder.the agency premised that determination on the past actions of redondo construction company rcc.according to prpha,rcc a firm in which served as an officer had defaulted on a contract with the agency in.that contract related to the same lirios de sur housing project 
the amended complaint claims,without an iota of detail,that in addition to losing the bid award,and his companies have been suspended from participating in public contracts ever since rcc alleged default.the amended complaint also claims that the plaintiffs have lost unspecified private business because a local newspaper published an account of prpha nonresponsibility determination.
ii.travel of the case 
his wife,and their conjugal partnership brought the underlying action in the federal district court on may.they later amended their complaint to add celta as a plaintiff.the amended complaint named two groups of defendants hud,the secretary of hud,and two hud officials,thomas teresi and michael colon collectively,the federal defendants comprise one group and prpha and three prpha officials,ileana echegoyen,jorge rivera,and carlos collectively,the commonwealth defendants comprise the other.the plaintiffs advanced claims under and the privacy act of,to which they appended claims under local law for breach of contract and the like.the defendants variously moved to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state an actionable claim.see.b.the district court referred the motions to a magistrate judge,see.b,who recommended dismissal.the plaintiffs objected to the magistrate judge recommended disposition of the motions.
the district court reviewed the matter de novo.see id.the court ultimately issued a thoughtful opinion in which it i dismissed the claims against the federal defendants because the plaintiffs had failed to state any viable cause of action against them ii dismissed the claims for money damages against the commonwealth defendants in their official capacities on the ground of eleventh amendment immunity iii dismissed the claims for prospective injunctive relief against the commonwealth defendants in their official capacities because the plaintiffs had failed to state any claim cognizable under section iv dismissed the claims against the commonwealth defendants in their individual capacities based on qualified immunity v dismissed the privacy act claims against the commonwealth defendants because the act applies only to federal agencies and vi elected not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims,which it dismissed without prejudice pursuant to c.see celta constr.hud,d.this timely appeal followed.
iii.discussion 
we subdivide our analysis of the issues presented into several segments.we begin by elucidating some of the legal standards applicable to motions to dismiss.
a.the rule b framework.
the district court dismissed the plaintiff action for failure to state a claim upon which relief might be granted.because there is no heightened pleading standard in civil rights cases,educadores puertorriqueños en acción hernández,cir,a district court considering a rule b motion must view the plaintiff complaint through the prism of.a notice pleading requirements.centro medico del turabo,feliciano de melecio,cir.a complaint satisfies that standard if it contains a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,and give s the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.id.alteration in original quoting.a and conley gibson,d.
the court must assume the truth of all facts and indulge all reasonable inferences that fit the plaintiff stated theory of liability.in re colonial mortg.bankers,cir.those facts may be derived from the complaint,whatever documents are either annexed to it or fairly incorporated into it,and any relevant matters that are susceptible to judicial notice.centro medico,at.in that process,however,the court need not credit bald assertions,unsupportable conclusions,periphrastic circumlocutions,and the like.aulson blanchard,cir.
we review the entry of an order of dismissal under rule b de novo,applying the same criteria that bound the lower court.centro medico,at.the threshold for affirmance is high w e will affirm a dismissal only if it is transparently clear that the complaint,in light of the facts alleged,engenders no viable theory of liability.id.at.
we begin our discussion of the plaintiffs claims by explaining what is not before us.few principles are more sacrosanct in this circuit than the principle that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.united states zannino,cir.as a corollary to this principle,a litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly,or else forever hold its peace.id.internal quotation marks omitted.even during appellate review of a rule b dismissal,which takes place under a set of guidelines,the reviewing court can not be expected to do counsel work,create the ossature for the argument,and put flesh on its bones.id.
application of these wise insights narrows the field of our endeavor.in their brief,the plaintiffs completely ignore both the district court holding on their privacy act claim and its scuttling of their supplemental claims.we therefore deem them to have waived any appeal as to those rulings.the only claims that remain for adjudication are those advanced under.we address those claims in the pages that follow.
constitutional claims against federal defendants.
the plaintiffs try to shoehorn their constitutional claims against the federal defendants into the contours of section.that endeavor has all the hallmarks of a futile gesture after all,a section claim normally does not lie against a federal official.see chatman hernandez,cir per curiam section applies to persons acting under color of state law and not to persons acting pursuant to federal law.the plaintiffs allege no facts that might permit a detour around that rule.hampton hanrahan,cir explaining that a section claim may lie against federal officers when they are engaged in a conspiracy with state officials to deprive constitutional rights.
federal officials sometimes can be liable for constitutional torts committed under color of federal law on terms that bear a family resemblance to those that govern section actions.the doctoral framework was limned by the supreme court in bivens six unknown named agents of fbn,d.here,however,even if we give the plaintiffs the benefit of every doubt and recharacterize their claims against the federal defendants as bivens claims,they would still succumb.
the amended complaint only allegation against the federal defendants is that hud was fully aware of prpha absolute disregard of award procedures,and did not correct nor adequately supervise the wrongdoing that it was funding.these bald assertions are fundamentally insufficient to support a bivens claim.most importantly,the plaintiffs have failed to connect the federal defendants to the actions central to this case,that is,the alleged debarment,prpha nonresponsible bidder determination,and the rescission of the lirios del sur bid award.although the amended complaint indicates that hud may have had some general duty of oversight prpha,it does not allege any legally enforceable connection between hud and the supposed deprivation of due process on which the plaintiffs claims depend.without such a connection,no colorable section claim exists 
in all events,the language of the amended complaint indicates that,as to the federal defendants,the plaintiffs are attempting to raise a claim of negligent supervision.such a claim,if stated,would constitute a tort action within the purview of the federal tort claims act ftca,b,not a bivens action.see,bolduc united states,cir.yet the plaintiffs have not sued the united states in tort,nor have they alleged compliance with the administrative prerequisites for an ftca action.see cotto united states,cir describing administrative scheme and explaining that e xhaustion of plaintiffs administrative remedies is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the prosecution of their ftca claims.this omission reinforces our conclusion that the allegations of the amended complaint engender no viable theory of liability against the federal defendants.
section claims against commonwealth defendants.
in the district court,the plaintiffs effectively conceded that eleventh amendment immunity bars a federal court from awarding monetary damages against the commonwealth defendants in their official capacities.celta,d at.yet eleventh amendment immunity does not bar prospective injunctive relief against defendants.see rosie swift,cir fred roque,cir per curiam.nor does that doctrine bar relief whether in the form of money damages or an injunction against the commonwealth defendants in their individual capacities.see ex parte young.rosie,at.we proceed to examine these asserted claims.
section supplies a private right of action against a person who,under color of state law,deprives another of rights secured by the constitution or by federal law.evans avery,cir.the first condition of a viable section the act in question occur under color of state law is satisfied here.puerto rico is considered a state for section purposes,see deniz municipality of guaynabo,cir,and the amended complaint challenges actions attributed to prpha an agency of the puerto rican government and its functionaries the individual commonwealth defendants.thus,we focus the lens of our inquiry on the second condition of a viable section there has been a deprivation of rights secured to the plaintiffs either by the constitution or by federal law.
in this instance,the plaintiffs claim that they have been deprived of their fourteenth amendment right to procedural due process.for that claim to succeed,the plaintiffs must identify a protected property or liberty interest.centro medico,at citing board of regents roth,d.because the plaintiffs invoke no liberty interest,we confine our discussion to the existence vel non of a constitutionally protected property interest 
to establish a constitutionally protected property interest,a plaintiff must have more than an abstract need or desire for a thing and more than a unilateral expectation of it.roth,at.a plaintiff instead must have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.id.here,however,we are unable to find any clear statement of the precise property interest that the plaintiffs contend is at stake.
after combing the amended complaint and conducting the robed equivalent of an archeological dig,we conclude that,in a scenario,the plaintiffs can be said to allege three property interests i a property interest associated with their effective debarment from prpha contracting ii a property interest associated with prpha nonresponsible bidder determination and iii a property interest associated with the rescission of the lirios del sur bid award we discuss these three possibilities in sequence.
effective debarment.the plaintiffs allege that prpha has effectively debarred them from government contracting for the last seven years without ever promulgating an explicit debarment order it is unnecessary for us to reach the issue of whether there is a constitutionally protected property interest associated with effective debarment because the plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to establish the underlying debarment.we explain briefly.
the amended complaint does little more than describe what the plaintiffs call a suspension.although it does not embellish this bare conclusory allegation,we assume,favorably to the plaintiffs,that by suspension they mean effective debarment or even blacklisting.see supra note.still,the amended complaint does not anchor this pejorative term in any supporting facts.in particular,the plaintiffs have not averred that they have bid on any prpha contracts other than lirios del sur since.a single incident is insufficient to establish a pattern or practice of exclusion and,thus,to establish even a de facto debarment.jensen frank,cir noting,in the title vii context,that a single instance of favoritism,even if proved,falls considerably short of showing an ongoing pattern and practice.
the fact that notice pleading governs at the rule b stage does not save the plaintiffs conclusory allegation.i n a civil rights action as in any other action subject to notice pleading standards,the complaint should at least set forth minimal facts as to who did what to whom,when,where,and why educadores,at.notice pleading requirements may be minimal requirements are not tantamount to nonexistent requirements.gooley mobil oil,cir.even within the generous confines of notice pleading,courts must continue to eschew reliance on bald assertions and unsupportable conclusions.chongris bd.of appeals,cir.
the plaintiffs omissions are especially telling here.elsewhere in the record,the plaintiffs flatly contradict their conclusory claim of effective debarment.for example,in a memorandum filed in the district court,they asserted that,through celta,had bid in other prpha bids and added that it was never argued by the agency that was a contractor.we thus reject the naked mention of an undocumented suspension as a possible source of a constitutionally protected property interest.
the nonresponsible bidder determination.the plaintiffs allege that,as the rationale for its rescission of the lirios del sur bid award,prpha determined that was nonresponsible and imputed his failings to celta.to the extent that the plaintiffs due process claims revolve around a supposed property interest in their responsible bidder status,we are unable to perceive how such an interest amounts to anything greater than a unilateral expectation.
a property interest does not vest simply because a government agency has developed a scheme to aid in bid award decisions.see generally smith wesson united states,cir award procedures are not designed to establish private entitlements to public contracts but to produce the best possible contracts for the government.thus,a bidder can not claim a property interest in the procedure alone.navas gonzalez vales,cir t he mere fact that the government has promulgated procedural rules by which to make retention decisions does not by itself create a constitutionally cognizable property interest in continued employment.
by the same token,the plaintiffs dashed hopes of receiving future government work,without more,can not yield a constitutionally protected property interest.that is true even if those dashed hopes stem from prpha nonresponsibility declaration.see walentas lipper,cir finding no property interest in a frustrated expectation of future employment.the short of it is that the plaintiffs do not have a strong enough claim of entitlement to a responsible bidder designation to create a constitutionally protected property interest.
the rescission of the bid award.last but not least,the plaintiffs claim a property interest in the lirios del sur bid award that prpha bestowed on them in and then revoked in.a recurrent theme in this court juris
