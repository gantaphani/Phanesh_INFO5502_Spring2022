diane knott knott appeals from the district court order granting summary judgment in the underlying action to mark sullivan sullivan,sheriff vern castle castle,officer steve sedwick sedwick,deputy sheriff allen flickinger flickinger,deputy sheriff brian cooper cooper,deputy sheriff carl williams williams,deputy sheriff jeff gura gura,and officer rodney smith smith collectively,defendants.the gravamen of knott suit is that the defendants violated her fourth amendment rights by searching her automobile and her residential property without a search warrant.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural history 
on september,diane knott son,eric,reported to the athens county sheriff department that he had discovered the body of david malcolm while looking for ginseng root in a wooded area.defendant flickinger,an athens county deputy sheriff,was placed in charge of the investigation and went to wooded area where david malcolm body had been found.eric was still present when flickinger arrived at the scene,and flickinger noticed that eric was driving a blue plymouth horizon.
flickinger then received a call that the body of david malcolm wife,ruth,had been discovered at the malcolm residence.flickinger went to the malcolm residence and was approached by two witnesses.one of the witnesses stated that at around that morning,he had heard a woman scream and a rifle shot and that he had seen a blue vehicle leave the malcolm residence shortly thereafter.the witness also stated that the blue vehicle had a loud exhaust and that he thought he had seen eric drive the same vehicle earlier in the day.the witness further noted that he had been to the david malcolm murder scene and that he had seen the blue vehicle parked there.flickinger contacted one of the officers at the david malcolm site and was told that eric and the blue vehicle were still at the scene.pursuant to flickinger direction,the officer obtained eric permission to start the blue vehicle and confirmed that it had a loud exhaust.the vehicle was then impounded and taken to the athens county sheriff department storage facility.a check revealed that the vehicle was owned by diane knott.
at approximately on september,defendants castle,flickinger,gura,smith,and williams went to the knott residence.castle and williams went to the back door of the knott residence,flickinger and gura went to the front door,and smith remained in the yard.diane knott opened the back door of the residence and told castle and williams that her sons eric and brian were not at home the two officers returned to their vehicle and left the scene.knott then went into the living room and discovered flickinger and gura,who had been let in by knott mother.flickinger and gura told knott that they were looking for her sons,asked her what her sons looked like,and asked what vehicle they were driving.gura then went back outside,and a few minutes later,flickinger left the residence as well.gura and smith were later seen looking at a pile of ashes located in the knotts yard near the garage.
later that day,eric knott was arrested.upon returning home from the scene of eric arrest,diane knott discovered defendants castle and williams pulling out of her driveway.knott asked castle why he had returned to her residence,and castle responded that he was looking for the gun that was used in david malcolm murder.castle told knott to contact him if she located the gun,and knott told castle that he could search her residence if he wanted.
that evening,diane and her husband brett knott were interviewed by defendant sedwick at the athens county sheriff office.diane knott was interviewed first,and after the conclusion of her interview,she left the athens county sheriff office.during brett knott interview,the athens county sheriff department received a telephone call reporting that men with guns were on the knotts property.after being told of the telephone call,brett knott signed a written form authorizing the search of his residence.joint appendix at consent form signed by brett knott on september,at,authorizing search of,glouster,ohio.defendant cooper,along with deputy sheriffs cottrill,taylor,heater,and fick went to the knott residence to investigate the call.
some time later,flickinger prepared a warrant and affidavit to search the vehicle impounded at the scene where david malcolm body was discovered.however,the vehicle description,license plate number,and vehicle identification number in the affidavit and search warrant referred,not to the plymouth horizon that had been impounded,but rather to a dodge hatchback owned by knott husband,brett knott.joint appendix at search warrant identifying vehicle to be searched as the automobile of brett knott,dodge hb,located at the acso garage,being described as dodge hb lic vin at search warrant affidavit same see also at compl.listing plymouth horizon vehicle identification number as and license plate number as.on september,athens court of common pleas judge alan goldsberry authorized the search warrant,and the plymouth horizon was searched.according to knott complaint,the athens county sheriff department held the plymouth horizon for approximately one year and caused in excess of in damage to the vehicle.
eric knott was eventually charged in the deaths of david and ruth malcolm.during the criminal proceedings against eric,judge goldsberry who had issued the vehicle search warrant ruled that evidence obtained from the search of the plymouth horizon had to be suppressed because the plymouth horizon was not the vehicle identified in the search warrant.record,exhibit at july,athens county court of common pleas decision on motion to suppress evidence seized from plymouth automobile and journal entry concluding that the warrant,as obtained,clearly did not authorize the search of a plymouth and the court finds no cause for invoking the good faith,reasonable reliance exception to the exclusionary rule,as it was manifestly unreasonable for officers to use a warrant specifically describing one vehicle to search a completely different vehicle.
in november,diane knott filed the instant action against defendants castle,williams,smith,gura,cooper,sedwick,and flickinger alleging that they engaged in unconstitutional searches and seizures of her vehicle and residence.knott also filed suit against defendant mark sullivan,the athens county commissioner.both sides moved for summary judgment,and the district court below granted the defendants motion.knott now appeals.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review the district court order granting the defendants motion for summary judgment de novo.johnson karnes,cir.summary judgment is proper if,when drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the,the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c johnson,at.thus,summary judgment in favor of the defendants is not proper if the defendants are not entitled to judgment as a matter of law,or if there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether knott was depriv ed of a right secured by the constitution or the laws of the united states,and the deprivation was caused by a person acting under color of state law.johnson,at quoting ellison garbarino,cir.
vehicle search 
in their motion for summary judgment,the defendants asserted that they should not face liability for the search of knott plymouth horizon because the search was conducted pursuant to a valid warrant,albeit one containing some errors in the vehicle description the district court agreed,and entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants on that basis.we conclude,however,that the defects in the warrant executed by the defendants are so grave that the defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on the grounds that the search was conducted pursuant to a valid warrant.
constitutional validity of the search warrant 
because the athens county court of common pleas previously determined,in the context of ruling on a motion to suppress in eric knott criminal trial,that the defendants search of knott plymouth horizon did violate the fourth amendment,we must decide,as an initial matter,what preclusive effect if any should be given to this prior determination.because knott would have us give preclusive effect to an ohio determination,we look to ohio law of issue preclusion to resolve this question.see mckinley city of mansfield,cir.as this court has previously explained,ohio 
doctrine of issue preclusion,also known as collateral estoppel,holds that a fact or a point that was actually and directly at issue in a previous action,and was passed upon and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction,may not be drawn into question in a subsequent action between the same parties or their privies,whether the cause of action in the two actions be identical or different.
boone spurgess,cir quoting state ex rel.stacy batavia local sch.dist.bd.of,ohio.under ohio law,the burden of demonstrating that these requirements have been satisfied rests with the party asserting that issue preclusion should apply.see goodson mcdonough power,ohio.
the district court below concluded that preclusive effect should not be given to the suppression order on two grounds.first,the district court ruled that issue preclusion should not apply because t he general rule in ohio is that a judgment in a criminal proceeding can not operate as res judicata,or collateral estoppel,in a civil action to establish any fact determined in the criminal proceeding.at.op.at citing state ex rel.ferguson court of claims of ohio,victims of crime,ohio.second,the district court also determined that giving preclusive effect to the ohio trial court suppression order would be improper because none of the parties in this case had been parties in the prior criminal proceeding,and the defendants had not had a full and fair opportunity to litigate their position as privies of the state of ohio.in her brief on appeal,knott has not addressed these arguments or otherwise explained why issue preclusion should apply in this case.see hill blue cross blue shield of,cir deeming issue not raised on appeal as waived citing radvansky city of olmsted falls,cir.moreover,it does not appear that the district court decision was in error.see boone,at noting that ohio state courts generally frown upon the use of criminal proceedings to estop parties in subsequent civil proceedings.shamaeizadeh cunigan,cir in suit,declining to collaterally estop defendant police officers from asserting the validity of a search because,although the police officers had testified at the suppression hearing,they had not received a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue,cert.denied,d.thus,we decline to give preclusive effect to the suppression order and instead consider de novo the constitutional validity of the search warrant.
the fourth amendment to the united states constitution provides in part that no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause,supported by oath or affirmation,and particularly describing the place to be searched,and the persons or things to be seized.const.amend.iv.in determining whether a warrant describes with sufficient particularity the place to be searched,we consider whether the place to be searched is described with sufficient particularity as to enable the executing officers to locate and identify the premises with reasonable effort and whether there is reasonable probability that some other premises may be mistakenly searched.united states gahagan,cir,cert.denied,d.
in the case at bar,the parties do not dispute the fact that the warrant and its supporting affidavit inaccurately described the vehicle to be searched.this court has previously ruled,however,that technical inaccuracies in a warrant do not automatically render unconstitutional searches conducted pursuant to such a warrant.rather,we must consider whether,given the circumstances of the particular case,there was a reasonable probability that another location could have been mistakenly searched because of the inaccuracies contained in the warrant.see united states durk,cir the test for determining whether a search warrant describes the premises to be searched with sufficient particularity is not whether the description is technically accurate in every detail,but rather whether the description is sufficient to enable the executing officer to locate and identify the premises with reasonable effort,and whether there is any reasonable probability that another premises might be mistakenly searched.internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also united states,cir.
based on the record before us,we conclude that,in this case,the errors in the search warrant and affidavit were so extensive that there was a reasonable probability that the wrong vehicle could have been mistakenly searched.here,virtually every descriptor of the vehicle included in the search warrant and accompanying affidavit was incorrect the vehicle make and model were wrong,the vehicle identification number was wrong,and the vehicle license plate number was wrong.indeed,the only portion of the description contained in the warrant that appears to have been correct is the statement that the vehicle was l ocated at the acso athens county sheriff office garage.at search warrant at search warrant affidavit.the danger that another vehicle could be mistakenly searched is further heightened in this case by the fact that the erroneous information included in the search warrant and affidavit did accurately describe another vehicle owned by a member of the knott family,which could have also been the target of a search as part of the ongoing investigation into the malcolm murders.
notwithstanding the extensive errors in the search warrant and affidavit,the district court concluded that the defendants execution of the search warrant was still constitutionally permissible because defendant flickinger,the police officer who prepared the search warrant and affidavit,also participated in the execution of the search.it is true that this court has previously upheld searches conducted pursuant to warrants listing incorrect addresses or property descriptions in part because the police officers involved in executing the search had also served as affiants or were otherwise familiar with the location to be searched.see,at durk,at gahagan,at.however,we believe that the risk of misidentification created by the defective warrants in those cases was markedly less severe than is at issue in the case presently before us.
in gahagan,we upheld the constitutionality of a search of a wood cabin with an address of douglas lake road,even though the search warrant only listed the address douglas lake road.in reaching such a conclusion,we explained that,although the address listed in the warrant did not include the cabin,the affidavit accompanying the warrant did clarify that the wood cabin was included as part of the premises to be searched.see gahagan,at,noting that information in the affidavit,including the statement that a lso located on the property is a single story wood frame log structure painted dark brown in color,sufficiently described both house b and cabin so that the executing officers could reasonably ascertain the premises to be searched as including both structures.by contrast,in the case at bar,the affidavit accompanying the search warrant contains the same errors as those included in the search warrant,and the affidavit contains no additional information beyond that already in the warrant that would indicate to the executing officer that the plymouth horizon was the vehicle to be searched.moreover,while in gahagan we were presented with a search warrant that,on its face,authorized a more narrow search than the one actually conducted,in this case the defect in the warrant is not vagueness or narrowness but rather wholesale inaccuracy.
in durk,we upheld a search of a residence,notwithstanding the fact that the warrant contained two errors the transposition of the house numbers from to,and the description of the defendant house as houses to the east of grandview in fact,it was three houses to the west of grandview.durk,at.in so ruling,we noted that other portions of the warrant accurately described the residence to be searched and included a reference to a particularly unusual feature of the property.see id.at the warrant correctly identifies the house as a red brick ranch home on the north side of fulton street.although brick,ranch style homes may be common in shaw neighborhood,the warrant also describes a more unusual feature a ten by fifteen foot metal storage shed,the entrance of which is secured by a plastic tie.similarly,in,we upheld the denial of a suppression motion brought by a defendant who claimed that the address for the mobile home that was searched was in all likelihood mae collins road,lot,not mae collins road as listed in the warrant.at.in reaching such a conclusion,we noted that the defendant did not definitively assert that the address listed in the warrant was incorrect,and that even if the address had been wrong,the warrant included other information such as specific directions from an identifiable point to the mobile home park at mae collins road,the color and trim of the trailer,the presence of a wooden deck,and the existence of the number displayed under a window air conditioner on the right end of the trailer that pointed the police officers to the correct location.id.in this case,on the other hand,the only accurate portion of the vehicle description included in the warrant is the fact that the plymouth horizon was stored in the athens county sheriff garage.such information may be of limited usefulness in identifying which particular vehicle is to be searched,however,given that many vehicles may be stored in the county garage at any one time,and the vehicles stored in the garage may change between the time the search warrant is issued and the time it is executed.
in sum,in this case we conclude as did the state court that,in light of the profound errors contained in the search warrant and affidavit,the search of knott plymouth horizon can not be upheld as the lawful execution of a valid search warrant.here,we are not presented with the mere transposition of digits in a license plate or vehicle identification number or a minor mistake in the description of one portion of the vehicle,but rather the wholesale inclusion of another vehicle make,model,year,license plate number,and vehicle identification number.indeed,the vehicle described in the search warrant was not simply just another vehicle,but rather one owned by the father of a person suspected of committing a double murder.given these circumstances,there was more than a reasonable probability that the incorrect vehicle could have been searched,notwithstanding the fact that the affiant was involved in executing the search and the warrant noted that the vehicle was stored in the athens county sheriff garage.
invalidity of warrant clearly established 
under the doctrine of qualified immunity,government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.sample bailey,cir quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.thus,although we have concluded that the warrant supporting the search of knott plymouth horizon was invalid,the defendants are still entitled to qualified immunity if the constitutional invalidity of the warrant was not clearly established at the time the defendants searched knott vehicle.if the law at that time was not clearly established,an official could not fairly be said to know that the law forbade conduct not previously identified as unlawful.id.at quoting harlow,at.alteration in sample.the relevant,dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.id.quoting saucier katz,d.
in light of the extensiveness of the search warrant defects at issue in this case,we conclude that the constitutional infirmity of the search warrant executed by the defendants was clearly established at the time they searched knott plymouth horizon.it is true that,in certain cases,we have ruled that a search pursuant to a warrant that contains some ambiguity or minor,typographical errors may survive fourth amendment scrutiny because the affiant officer participation in the execution of the search provides sufficient assurance that the wrong location will not be searched.such cases,however,are the exception,not the rule,and do not change the fundamental fourth amendment requirement that a warrant particularly describ e the place to be searched const.amend.iv see gahagan,at t he fourth amendment safeguard is designed to require a description which particularly points to a definitely ascertainable place so as to exclude all others.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.here,the search warrant obtained by the defendants describes a vehicle completely different than the one that was ultimately searched.the only aspect of the warrant that was accurate was its statement that the vehicle to be searched was located in the athens county sheriff garage however,any number of vehicles may be stored at a police garage at any one time,so such a statement provides little in the way of a particularized vehicle description that would be sufficient to satisfy the strictures of the fourth amendment.given that all of the specific vehicle characteristics including the make,model,year,license plate number,and vehicle identification number listed in the warrant described brett knott dodge hatchback,in effect no search warrant was ever issued for knott plymouth horizon.the fourth amendment obviously forbids relying on a warrant to search one vehicle when all of the descriptors refer to another vehicle,and thus we conclude that the constitutional invalidity of the search warrant at issue in this case was clearly established at the time knott vehicle was searched.see sample,at concluding that general standards of the fourth amendment clearly established the impermissibility of shooting a suspect who does not pose a serious threat to police officers and that the case at bar did not present a novel factual circumstance such that a police officer would be unaware of the constitutional parameters of his actions.
objectively unreasonable conduct 
finally,we conclude that the defendants reliance on the search warrant in this case was objectively unreasonable in light of the warrant clearly established constitutional infirmity.see sample,at.many of the errors contained in the search warrant such as the vehicle make,model,and license plate number would be obvious to even the most casual of observers.indeed,the defendants execution of the warrant notwithstanding these errors reveals either a blatant disregard for the terms of the warrant or utter negligence in failing to check that the vehicle to be searched is the one identified in the warrant.thus,the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants on the basis that the search of knott plymouth horizon was pursuant to a valid search warrant.
residential searches 
in addition to challenging the search of her plymouth horizon,knott also alleges that her fourth amendment rights were violated when the defendants conducted searches of her residential property 
defendants smith and gura 
knott first appears to allege that defendants smith and gura conducted an unconstitutional search of her property when they walked into her yard and inspected a mound of ashes.the district court below granted summary judgment to defendants smith and gura,concluding that no search occurred given that smith and gura were permitted to approach knott residence in order to ask her questions and that the pile of ashes was not located in part of the residence curtilage.we conclude,however,that there are genuine issues of material fact that make entry of summary judgment in favor of defendants smith and gura inappropriate at this time.
