dorothy burnley brought suit in texas state court against her employer,the city of san antonio the city,asserting claims under the americans with disabilities act of,the texas commission on human rights act,and texas negligence law.she alleged that the city failed to reasonably accommodate her disability and that the city negligence caused her respiratory illness.the city removed the case to federal court,and,after a trial,a jury returned a general verdict accompanied by interrogatories in burnley favor,awarding her in compensatory damages.the clerk prepared a judgment incorporating the substance of the jury verdict and entered it in the civil docket on february.the court did not approve the form of the judgment before it was entered by the clerk.burnley filed a motion for attorney fees on february.
several months later,on september,the district court granted burnley motion for attorney fees,awarding her.on october,the city moved the district court to order under.frcp c that burnley motion for attorney fees have the same effect under fed.frap a as a timely motion under frcp and approve the form of a separate document judgment,entered by the clerk,incorporating the jury verdict.the court granted both motions on october.also on october,the clerk entered the judgment approved as to form by the court,and the city filed a notice of appeal.
thus,the time line unfolded as follows 
february jury verdict clerk entry of judgment no court approval.
february plaintiff moved for attorney fees under frcp d.
july days elapsed after clerk entry of judgment on the verdict.
september plaintiff fee motion granted.
october defendant filed,and court granted,frcp c motion to treat fee motion as frcp new trial motion to delay running of time to appeal.
october court approved the form of the judgment on the merits entered by the clerk on february.
october defendant filed notice of appeal.
burnley objects to our exercise of appellate jurisdiction,contending that the city did not file a timely notice of appeal.frap a a provides in a civil case except as provided in rules a b,a,and c,the notice of appeal required by rule must be filed with the district clerk within days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.the taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is mandatory and jurisdictional.budinich becton dickinson,d citing frap,a,a,b united states robinson,d farley transp.santa fe trail transp,cir see moody nat.bank of galveston ge life and annuity assur,cir a timely filed notice of appeal is an absolute prerequisite to this court jurisdiction.halicki louisiana casino cruises,cir.the advisory committee note under frap states 
rule and rule combine to require that a notice of appeal be filed with the clerk of the district court within the time prescribed for taking an appeal.because the timely filing of a notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional,compliance with the provisions of those rules is of the utmost importance.
frap advisory committee note quoting robinson,d.although frap provides that a court of appeals may,to expedite its decision or for other good cause,suspend any provision of these rules in a particular case,frap b forbids a court to extend the time to file a notice of appeal except as authorized in rule.therefore,under the rules,we may not hear a case unless we can say that the notice of appeal has been filed within the time constraints laid upon us by frap.the advisory committee view that the time for filing a notice of appeal requirement of frap is jurisdictional,although not determinative,is of weight in our construction of the rule.torres oakland scavenger,d quoting.publ g murphree.
in the present case,because the city filed its notice of appeal on october,over seven months after the clerk entered the judgment in the civil docket on february,it appears that the city appeal was late.the city argues,however,that the clerk entry was a nullity and therefore did not cause the time for appeal to commence or,in the alternative,under the district court order of october,the plaintiff motion for attorney fees must be treated as having the same effect as a motion for a new trial,as delaying the effectiveness of the entry of judgment until the court disposed of the motion on september,resulting in the october,notice of appeal being timely because it was within days of the entry of judgment.
the city first argues that the notice of appeal clock never began to run because the clerk entry of judgment on february,was invalid due to the court failure to approve of that judgment as to form,as required by frcp a b i.to address this argument,we turn to frcp and frap,which contain definitions of entry and time of entry of judgments 
both frcp and frap were amended in to provide,together with frcp,an integrated system fostering promptness,accuracy,certainty and finality in the entry of judgments by district courts.frcp and frap establish the entry of judgment by the district court as the triggering event for the beginning of tolling periods for the filing of notices of appeals and motions.under frcp,in the case of specified uncomplicated orders,verdicts and judgments,judgment is deemed entered by the court when the clerk makes an entry of it under frcp a showing its nature and substance in the civil docket.see frcp a a,b.in the case of certain more complicated verdicts and other grants of relief,judgment is deemed entered by the court when the earlier of two events occurs when it is set forth on a separate document approved by the court and entered under frcp a or when days have run from the clerk entry of its nature and substance under rule a.see frcp a,a b,b see also frap a b noting that a failure to set forth a judgment on a separate document does not affect the validity of an appeal from that judgment.
in applying these provisions to the case at hand,it is important to note that frcp a authorizes and requires the clerk to make entries of all orders,verdicts and judgments and the substance of each order or judgment of the court.thus,even when the court fails to promptly approve the form of a separate document judgment under frcp a b,as in the present case,the clerk is required and authorized to make such an entry.further,when the court fails to promptly approve a judgment as required by rule a b,the rules require that if the court subsequently approves the form of a separate document judgment before days have run from the clerk initial entry in the civil docket under rule a,the judgment set forth on a separate document approved by the court shall be entered in the civil docket by the clerk and will supplant the clerk initial entry pertaining to that judgment.see frcp b i charles alan wright et,federal practice and procedure ed.supp t he deadlines in rule a will begin to run days after the judgment or order is entered in the civil docket or when the judgment or order is actually set forth on a separate document,if that occurs before the day.
in the present case,because the jury returned a general verdict accompanied by interrogatories,frcp a b i required that the court promptly approve the form of the judgment in a separate document,and that it be promptly entered by the clerk.the court failed to promptly approve the form of the judgment at that time.nonetheless,the clerk,under frcp a,promptly made an entry in the civil docket in the form of a judgment on the verdict showing the nature and substance of the verdict in burnley favor against the city.accordingly,under frcp b b,when days had run from the clerk entry in the civil docket under frcp a,the clerk entry by law constituted the entry of judgment of the court for purposes of frcp and other federal rules.because the clerk entry under frcp a was recorded on february,the entry of judgment of the court days later fell on july,thus,the city of san antonio notice of appeal,filed on october,was filed more than days after the entry of the judgment of the court and was not timely under frap a a.
the city acknowledges that its notice of appeal was not filed within days days under the cap plus the subsequent days in which to appeal after the clerk entered the judgment on the jury verdict in the civil docket on february.the city argues,however,that the clerk entry of judgment was invalid because the court did not approve its form.the city relies heavily on the language of frcp a b i,which requires that the court must promptly approve the form of the judgment,which the clerk must promptly enter,when the jury returns a general verdict accompanied by interrogatories.the city contends that because the court did not approve of the form of the judgment that the clerk entered in favor of burnley,and because the verdict was not simply a general verdict for which the clerk is required to promptly prepare,sign,and enter a judgment,the clerk was not authorized to enter anything in respect to burnley verdict in the civil docket.therefore,the city reasons,the clerk entry in the civil docket was a nullity for purposes of rule and could not mature into an entered judgment upon the passage of days.consequently,the city concludes,there was no entry of judgment until the city moved for and obtained the court approval of a separate document judgment on october.accordingly,the city contends,its notice of appeal filed on october,was timely and this court has appellate jurisdiction.
the language upon which the city relies,however,must be read in the context of other pertinent provisions of the federal rules described and quoted above,and in light of the history,purpose and design of the amendments,as explained in the advisory committee notes according to the advisory committee,frcp a and frap a,as amended in,are designed to,inter alia,work in conjunction with each other to ensure that appeal time does not linger on indefinitely.frcp advisory committee note amendments.in fact,the city appeal in the present case raises the identical question that the drafters addressed in resolving a circuit split with the amendments when a judgment or order is required to be set forth on a separate document under.but is not,does the time to appeal the judgment or the time to bring motions,such as a motion for a new trial under.begin to run frap advisory committee notes amendments.among the circuits,the first circuit alone had held that parties will be deemed to have waived their right to have a judgment or order entered on a separate document three months after the judgment or order is entered in the civil docket.id.citing fiore washington county cmty.mental health,cir.although a majority of the circuits had rejected this cap as contrary to the relevant rules,the advisory committee noted that no court has questioned the wisdom of imposing such a cap as a matter of policy.id.therefore,the drafters of the amendments decided to impose the cap provided for by frcp b b to determine the date of entry of the judgment when the court fails to perform its duty to approve a separate document judgment.the advisory committee notes to frap amendments state 
both rule a a and.have been amended to impose such a cap.under the amendments,a judgment or order is generally treated as entered when it is entered in the civil docket pursuant to.a.there is one exception when.a requires the judgment or order to be set forth on a separate document,that judgment or order is not treated as entered until it is set forth on a separate document in addition to being entered in the civil docket or until the expiration of days after its entry in the civil docket,whichever occurs first.this cap will ensure that parties will not be given forever to appeal or to bring a post judgment motion when a court fails to set forth a judgment or order on a separate document in violation of.a.
frap advisory committee note amendments emphasis added.
considering all of the foregoing,we reject the city proffered interpretation of rule a b and b b as diametrically contrary to the text,purpose and design of the integrated system established by frcp and and frap.when the jury returns a verdict,the clerk is authorized and required to enter a judgment on the verdict in the civil docket under frcp a.rule a plainly authorizes and requires the clerk to make entries in the civil docket in respect to every order,verdict and judgment,not only in respect to dispositions exempted from the separate document rule under a a.in other words,the clerk basic authority and duty in this respect arises primarily from rule a,not simply from rule a a.consequently,the court failure to promptly approve of the form of a separate document judgment as required by rule a b does not detract from the clerk independent authority and duty under rule a to promptly make the appropriate entry in the civil docket.
equally important,the city reading of rule a a would render the cap required by rule b b meaningless and defeat the purpose of the amendments.under rule b b,the cap only begins to run upon the clerk entry of judgment in the civil docket if the clerk can not make a valid entry of judgment when the court defaults on its duty,as the city contends,the cap could never begin to run in the very cases in which it was intended to apply.see frap advisory committee note amendments this cap will ensure that parties will not be given forever to appeal or to bring a post judgment motion when a court fails to set forth a judgment or order on a separate document in violation of.a.frcp,advisory committee note amendments noting that the amendments are designed to ensure that appeal time does not linger on indefinitely see also,a charles alan wright et,supra,i f the judge does nothing further in the case for days,then it should occur to even the most inattentive of appellate counsel that it is time either to seek clarification from the judge or to file an appeal,and noting i t is obviously unfair to give a party with some notice of a judgment longer to appeal than a party with no notice of a judgment.the cap imposed by the advisory which the or day deadline to file an appeal begins to run on the day after the judgment is entered in the civil a party who learns of a judgment that was not set forth on a separate document in roughly the same position as a party who does not learn of a judgment at all.
for these reasons,we find the city argument that the clerk entry of a judgment on the verdict on february,was a nullity to be without merit.although the court did not perform its duty to promptly approve a separate document judgment,the clerk had independent authority and a duty to enter the judgment based on the verdict in the civil docket.when days passed after february,without the filing of a separate document judgment the judgment prepared and entered by the clerk by law was entered as the judgment of the court on the merits on july.because the city did not file its notice of appeal until october,in excess of days after the entry of the judgment,it failed to file a timely notice of appeal.accordingly,unless the city alternate argument has merit,we lack appellate jurisdiction and must dismiss.
alternatively,the city argues that even if the clerk february,entry of judgment was valid,its effect as an entry of judgment under frap a a was delayed until september,the date upon which the court ruled on burnley attorney fee motion.the city contends that this is so because on october,the city,as authorized by frap a iii,moved under frcp c for and obtained the court order that burnley frcp d attorney fee motion would be treated as an frcp motion for new trial so as to delay entry of judgment on the merits until the motion for attorney fees had been ruled upon.according to the city,this delayed the entry of judgment until the date of the district court ruling awarding burnley attorney fees on september,thus shortening the time between the entry of judgment and the notice of appeal to days.in our opinion,however,the district court did not have the authority to modify the finality or effect of the judgment on the merits.that judgment was entered on july,and became unappealable when the city time for appeal expired on august.
because of frap and mandatory requirements pertaining to how to take an appeal and to the time for filing a notice of appeal,a court or a party seeking to extend the time to file a notice of appeal or to reopen the time to file an appeal may do so only as provided
