dominique gantt informed her employer,a private security company,that she had obtained a protective order barring her former boyfriend from any contact with her.but gantt supervisor,apparently believing that the estranged couple should talk,permitted the boyfriend access to gantt.the boyfriend then,at gunpoint,kidnaped gantt from her work place and held her captive for six hours,assaulting and raping her.gantt brings this action against her employer seeking damages for her resulting severe emotional and mental distress she asserts that her employer violated its fifth amendment duty to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace and intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon her.because no fifth amendment claim lies against a private entity,we affirm the district court dismissal of this claim.however,the district court erred in its analysis of gantt emotional distress claim accordingly,we must reverse part of its grant of summary judgment to the employer on this ground,and remand for further proceedings.
on november,upon finding that gary sheppard had caused gantt serious bodily harm by repeated acts of violence,a maryland court granted gantt a protective order.the protective order barred sheppard from abusing,threatening,or contacting gantt her home or place of employment and by any person,on the telephone,or in writing.
the next day,gantt notified her employer,security,usa,of the protective order and even brought a copy of the order to officials at security usa for their examination.security usa project manager earl wood then notified all security usa supervisors that gantt should only be assigned to secured inside posts so that sheppard could not gain access to her at work.
sheppard,who worked as a security officer at another private security company,wackenhut services,was weapon qualified that is,he was trained and qualified to use a gun.at wackenhut,sheppard worked during the week with angela claggett,who supervised gantt at security usa on weekends.claggett acknowledged that she had a friendly relationship with sheppard.
claggett testified that security usa manager wood told her when gantt obtained a protective order against sheppard,and that claggett had been directed to move gantt to an inside location at the loading dock.gantt,herself,also talked with her supervisor,claggett,about the protective order.claggett reported that gantt told her that sheppard hit her gantt and that this had been the first time and she was tired of it and did want to go through it anymore.in addition,claggett acknowledged that she knew sheppard had attempted to break into gantt mother house while gantt was there.gantt testified that she told claggett that sheppard threatened to kill her if she did not drop the charges from the previous incident at my mother house.
other sources confirmed what gantt had told claggett.sheppard himself talked with claggett about the protective order and his conduct.he acknowledged that he had put his hands on gantt but claimed that he loved her.according to claggett,she told sheppard that he should have done that but that it understandable and you all need to talk.claggett also testified that she had heard that sheppard threatened to kill himself,his children,his wife and gantt.
despite claggett admitted knowledge of sheppard abuse of gantt and threats to kill her,in november after issuance of the protective order when sheppard telephoned gantt at work,claggett took the call and urged gantt to talk to sheppard.gantt refused,saying h e not supposed to be calling me at my job.claggett responded,just talk to him and transferred the call immediately to gantt.after telling sheppard p lease do call again i notify the court and hanging up on him,a distressed gantt reported claggett conduct to project manager wood.nonetheless,claggett later in november transferred still another call from sheppard to gantt,saying all he wants to do is talk to you.
on the first saturday of the next month,december,at,gantt reported to work for security usa at the internal revenue service building in lanham,maryland.claggett was the senior person in charge no one else at the site was above claggett.willie jones,concluding his shift and being replaced as the supervisor by claggett,reminded claggett that we got to leave dominique gantt inside.yet after jones left,claggett ordered gantt to assume unsecured post outside the building.gantt tried to refuse,reminding claggett you know this stuff is still going on and i am supposed to be inside.claggett ordered gantt to go right to post and just got louder and louder as she did so.finally,gantt obeyed claggett and went outside to unsecured post.
within fifteen minutes of gantt assuming her assignment at post,sheppard telephoned her at her work station.gantt testified that the phone display indicated that sheppard call was transferred to her from claggett inside extension.during the brief telephone call,sheppard was really mean to gantt and she hung up on him.distraught,gantt then telephoned claggett,told her sheppard had just called and that gantt wanted to be moved to an inside post.claggett refused to permit gantt to move inside to safety.
at approximately,sheppard arrived at the irs building and proceeded to gantt at post.gantt ran from post toward an entrance to the irs building in search of safety.sheppard pulled a shotgun from his trench coat and with the gun drawn and aimed at gantt,chased her through the area surrounding post,shouting run run sheppard chased gantt until he caught her,then grabbed her by her arm,and pressing the shotgun against her chin,placed her in a choke hold.sheppard dragged gantt along an outside area of the irs building,off the premises,and into his van.
two security guards at the irs building witnessed sheppard kidnap gantt.one of these guards,in the presence of officer darren harvey,reported gantt abduction at gunpoint to claggett.when it was suggested that the police be called,harvey testified that claggett said no,we do need to call the police because he does want to hurt her,he just wants to talk to her.someone eventually did call the police.at her deposition,claggett testified that she did so,but acknowledged that she did not call until five to ten minutes after the abduction,even though she conceded that she knew that five or ten minutes can mean the difference between life and death when someone is held at gunpoint.
sheppard held gantt captive for six hours,driving through maryland,delaware,and the district of columbia to evade police.he raped and physically and verbally terrorized gantt,threatening to kill her with his shotgun.gantt repeatedly begged for her life and eventually convinced sheppard that she would reconcile with him and tell the police she went with him willingly.sheppard then hid his shotgun and surrendered to the police.
sheppard was convicted in state court of kidnaping,first degree rape,and violation of the restraining order.the court sentenced him to twenty years imprisonment.
when gantt returned to work at security usa,she told project manager wood and internal irs investigative officers she believed that claggett bore responsibility for sheppard assault of her.wood never responded to or acted on this complaint.instead,security usa permitted claggett to maintain her supervisory duties and rank as sergeant and,when on claggett shift,gantt had to report to her.
on december,gantt filed suit in state court against security usa the company removed the case to federal court.gantt alleges that as a result of the events of december,she has suffered physical injury,severe emotional distress,recurring nightmares and other mental health issues,which have dramatically reduced her quality of life.she contends that she has undergone medical evaluation and treatment,incurred medical expenses,and lost wages.although gantt alleged a number of theories of recovery in her complaint,she only appeals the district court rejection of her sexual harassment and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims.we consider each in turn.
gantt contends that the district court erred in dismissing her sexual harassment claim.specifically,she maintains that security usa fail ed to take reasonable steps to end,and indeed facilitated,the sexual harassment by sheppard,creating a hostile work environment.brief of appellant at.
in her complaint,gantt alleged that in so failing,security usa violated the fifth amendment of the united states constitution,title vii of the civil rights act of,and article of the maryland annotated code.the district court dismissed her statutory claims,reasoning that gantt failed to exhaust her administrative remedies,a prerequisite for a title vii claim,and that article does not create a private cause of action of sexual harassment.gantt does not appeal those dismissals.thus,as gantt recognizes,the only possible basis for her sexual harassment claim is the constitution.as she also recognizes,in order to state a constitutional claim,she must allege facts,which,if proved,would establish security usa is a governmental actor.
gantt has attempted to satisfy this requirement by alleging that security usa acted as an agent or instrumentality of the united states government to protect persons and property on the premises of the irs building and so had a fifth amendment duty to protect her from workplace sexual harassment in bivens six unknown fed.narcotics agents,d,the supreme court did recognize an implied private action for damages against agents of the united states alleged to have violated a citizen constitutional rights.however,the court has specifically declined to extend this limited holding to confer a right of action for damages against private entities acting under color of federal law.correctional services malesko,d refusing to allow a bivens claim against a halfway house operated by private entity under contract with the bureau of prisons emphasis added.indisputably,security usa is a private entity therefore no bivens claim lies against the company.for this reason,the district court properly dismissed gantt constitutional sexual harassment claim against security usa.
gantt intentional infliction of emotional distress claim presents a more complicated question.although the district court denied security usa motion to dismiss this claim,the court ultimately granted the company summary judgment on the claim.we believe the court erred in doing so.
the district court correctly recognized,that in maryland as in many other jurisdictions a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress has four elements 
the conduct must be intentional or reckless t he conduct must be extreme and outrageous t here must be a causal connection between the wrongful conduct and the emotional distress t he emotional distress must be severe.
manikhi mass transit,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in its seminal case recognizing intentional infliction of emotional distress as a valid tort in maryland,the state highest court relied on restatement second of torts,comment i to explain the first element 
the defendant conduct is intentional or reckless where he desires to inflict severe emotional distress,and also where he knows that such distress is certain,or substantially certain,to result from his conduct or where the defendant acts recklessly in deliberate disregard of a high degree of probability that the emotional distress will follow.
harris jones,accord,see also,kentucky fried chicken mgmt.weathersby,we apply the law of intentional infliction of emotional distress as we adopted it nearly years ago in harris jones.foor juvenile services,explaining that to meet the first element a plaintiff must offer evidence that the defendant either desired to inflict severe emotional distress,knew that such distress was certain or substantially certain to result from his conduct,or acted recklessly in deliberate disregard of a high degree of probability that the emotional distress will follow.emphasis in original.
the district court properly stated and applied this standard in concluding that gantt had satisfied the first element of the tort with respect to one portion of her intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.the court reasoned that gantt 
has forecasted evidence that claggett assignment of plaintiff gantt to post was an intentional act given that claggett was aware that sheppard has talked about killing plaintiff,that plaintiff was afraid of sheppard,and that she had obtained a restraining order against him.looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,one could conclude that claggett intentionally assigned plaintiff to a post where she knew plaintiff would be in fear and then refused plaintiff requests to leave the post after sheppard called her there.
this conclusion seems unassailable.however,turning to the third and fourth elements,the court rejected gantt intentional infliction of emotional distress claim,concluding that the emotional distress actually caused by claggett intentional the court determined to be the fear she suffered while waiting at the post did not meet the high burden imposed by the requirement that a plaintiff emotional distress be severe.emphasis in original and internal quotation marks and citation omitted.this was error.
the court artificially restricted the emotional distress caused by claggett intentional conduct to the fear gantt experienced while waiting at the post,ignoring the fact that gantt has testified that the hour she spent waiting in fear of sheppard arrival had a emotional impact.gantt has alleged not just that her abduction and rape caused severe emotional distress,but generally that a s a result of the injuries sustained on december,she has been caused recurring nightmares and other mental health issues which have dramatically reduced her quality of life.gantt has testified that she has been forced by the events of december not just the abduction and rape to seek psychiatric or psychological counseling for anxiety attacks,when she never before had suffered such attacks or sought such counseling.gantt also testified that she still can not go too many places by myself and she keeps having anxiety attacks,which occur three,four and five times a week and frequent nightmares.
security usa has failed to offer convincing evidence indicating that claggett assignment of gantt to unsecured post and claggett obdurate refusal to remove gantt even after sheppard telephoned her there could not have caused a significant portion of the severe emotional distress that gantt testified she continued to suffer after december.given this record,we can not hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment on this basis.we note that maryland highest court has held that an employee far less egregious conduct toward another employee caused emotional distress sufficient to preclude summary judgment for the employer.see federated dep t stores,le,holding trial court should not have granted summary judgment to employer when employee offered evidence a company security officer falsely accused him of stealing a calculator and coerced him into signing a confession,resulting in his loss of his job not fear for his life like gantt and loss of sleep for weeks not still reoccurring nightmares like gantt.
with respect to the second portion of gantt emotional distress growing out of the abduction and district court did correctly acknowledge what we believe is undeniable the distress suffered as a result of these acts would likely meet the high burden of severe emotional distress.the court held,nevertheless,that the acts did not provide the basis of an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim because they were caused by sheppard,not by claggett and no evidence suggested that claggett intended for plaintiff to suffer,or even recklessly disregarded the possibility of,the severe emotional trauma of being abducted,threatened and raped.emphasis in original.the court concluded that o nce again,therefore,the causal link between wrongful intentional conduct and severe emotional distress required by the third prong is absent.
there are several problems with this analysis.first,the district court seems to have concluded that the presence of an intervening actor,sheppard,necessarily severs any causal connection between claggett intentional conduct and the severe emotional distress suffered by gantt during the abduction.second,given claggett knowledge about sheppard past behavior and threats of violence,the court too easily dismissed the argument that claggett recklessly disregarded a high degree of probability that assigning gantt to post would result in her suffering violence at the hands of sheppard.finally,the court completely ignored gantt evidence that claggett aided and abetted sheppard,a tort that would require claggett to only have engaged in assistive conduct that s he would know would contribute to the happening of that act.saadeh saadeh.thus gantt appears to have forecast evidence that claggett engaged in conduct that knowingly assisted or recklessly disregarded a high probability that gantt would be subjected to severe emotional distress in connection with the second portion of her emotional distress claim.
this,however,does not end the inquiry.
because,as gantt concedes,her emotional distress arose out of,and in the course of,her employment with security usa,regardless of whether she forecast evidence sufficient to prove an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim,she must also offer evidence that her employer deliberately intended to injure her.this is so because the maryland workers compensation act,lab.empl.a b the act,provides gantt exclusive remedy unless she can prove she was injured as the result of the deliberate intent of her employer to injure her.id.d emphasis added.maryland high court has unequivocally held that this intentional tort exception to the act normal exclusivity rule requires proof of the employer actual,specific and deliberate intent to injure the employee.johnson mountaire,farms of delmarva.proof of an employer willful,wanton,or reckless conduct even when that conduct is undertaken with a knowledge and appreciation of a high risk to another does not suffice.id.an employee can not bring a tort action based on such evidence rather,in those circumstances,the act provides an employee exclusive remedy.id.
in ruling on security usa motion to dismiss all of gantt tort claims on the ground that the maryland workers compensation act provides her exclusive remedy for those claims,the district court clearly understood the proper relationship between the act and common law torts the court dismissed gantt negligence,gross negligence,and negligent hiring claims because it found the act barred gantt from recovering from her employer in a tort action on these bases.but the court specifically refused to dismiss the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim,finding that the intent to injure exception of the workers compensation exclusivity rule applied to it.
when considering security usa motion to dismiss gantt emotional distress claim,the district court carefully recounted gantt allegations as to security usa intent and found that,under maryland law,gantt had alleged facts sufficient to come within the intent to injure exception.in so concluding,the court relied on the most analogous maryland case,le.there,an employee sued his employer for intentional infliction of emotional distress after a company security guard coerced him into signing an allegedly untrue confession to theft,an act which assertedly caused the employee to cry,lose his job,and be unable to trust people or sleep for weeks after his discharge.id.at.on these facts,the trial court in le granted the employer summary judgment,finding the workers compensation act provided the employee exclusive remedy.id.at.maryland highest court reversed,holding that the deliberate intent to injure exception to the workers compensation exclusivity rule applied,and so the employer could be held liable to his employee in tort for intentional infliction of emotional distress.id.at.
on appeal,security usa does not contend that the district court erred in refusing to dismiss gantt emotional distress claim on grounds of workers compensation exclusivity.indeed,at oral argument security usa acknowledged that this ruling was correct,given gantt allegations.security usa maintains,however,that on summary judgment the district court should have concluded that the intent to injure exception to workers compensation exclusivity did not apply to gantt intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.
we can not agree with this argument with respect to the first portion of gantt emotional distress growing out of claggett intentionally assigning gantt to unsecured post.certainly in connection with that portion of her claim,gantt has offered as much evidence of deliberate intent to injure as the in le a jury could infer from the evidence proffered by gantt that security usa supervisor,claggett,despite awareness of sheppard abuse of gantt and gantt fear of sheppard,believed it that gantt and sheppard talk,and so deliberately determined to inflict on gantt any emotional distress she might suffer from talking to sheppard,even talking to him face to face,at post on december.thus gantt has offered evidence from which a jury could conclude,as she asserted in opposing security usa motion to dismiss,that claggett intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon dominique gantt when she ordered her to assume post,while fearing for her life.
with respect to the second portion of gantt emotional distress growing out of the abduction and,we agree that gantt has failed to offer evidence at the summary judgment stage sufficient to support her assertion at the motion to dismiss stage that claggett intentionally assigned dominique gantt to post,with the intention and for the purpose of giving gary sheppard access to her so that he could assault her,batter her,and kidnap her.gantt simply did not present evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that claggett acted with an actual,specific and deliberate intent to cause,and with a desire to bring about the assault,battery,rape,and emotional distress resulting from them.see johnson,at.just as in johnson,maryland highest court affirmed the dismissal of rodney johnson claim because he failed to allege facts to show that his employer had a desire to bring about the consequences of the acts or that the acts were premeditated with the specific intent to injure rodney,so we must affirm the grant of summary judgment on this portion of gantt emotional distress claim because she has failed to offer evidence demonstrating that her employer had a desire to bring about her abduction,rape,and resulting emotional distress,or that its acts were premeditated with the specific intent to impose this injury on her.id.
in summary,we affirm the district court order dismissing gantt sexual harassment claim and that portion of its order granting summary judgment on the emotional distress claim growing out of her abduction and rape.we reverse that portion of the order granting summary judgment on the emotional distress claim growing out of claggett intentional assignment of gantt to unsecured post.
affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part 
i concur in part ii of judge motz opinion,which affirms dismissal of dominique gantt claims under the fifth amendment and title vii of the civil rights act of.but with respect to gantt claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress under state law,i would affirm the judgment of the district court,but on different grounds.gantt has not shown that security usa,security usa,her employer,deliberately intended to cause the injury that gantt suffered,and therefore gantt state law claim against security usa can only be made as a claim for benefits under the maryland workers compensation act.accordingly,i dissent from the judgment remanding this case to the district court for further proceedings.
security usa,which contracted with the federal government to supply security for the new carrollton federal building in lanham,maryland,employed dominique gantt as a security guard and assigned her to the new carrollton building.
while assigned to the new carrollton building,gantt advised her employer that she had obtained a protective order against her boyfriend,gary sheppard,prohibiting him from contacting gantt anywhere,including at her place of employment,and gantt provided her supervisors with a copy of the protective order.security usa project manager earl wood instructed all security usa supervisors,including gantt supervisor,sergeant angela claggett,to assign gantt to an inside post to deny sheppard access should he violate the protective order.
sometime later,in november,sergeant claggett transferred a telephone call from sheppard to gantt even though claggett knew that it violated the protective order.claggett,who knew sheppard from another security job at which she worked,explained to gantt,a ll he wants to do is talk to you.claggett urged gantt,j ust talk to him.gantt took the telephone call,told sheppard not to call again,and hung up.after hanging up,gantt reported the call to project manager wood.
several weeks later,on december,sergeant claggett assigned gantt to guard the underground garage,post,which was an outside post.within minutes of taking the post,gantt received another telephone call from sheppard.after the call,gantt notified claggett of the call and requested to be reassigned to a location inside the building,in accordance with project manager wood order.sergeant claggett insisted that gantt remain at her post.
approximately minutes later,sheppard arrived at the new carrollton building and went to post,where he physically abducted gantt with a shotgun,forced her into his van,and drove away.when sergeant claggett was advised of the abduction,she refused to call the police,stating,n o,we do need to call the police because sheppard does want to hurt her,he just wants to talk to her.but five to ten minutes later,she nevertheless did call the police.
in the meantime,sheppard drove gantt from the new carrollton building into the district of columbia,maryland,and delaware.he verbally abused gantt,threatened her,physically assaulted her,and raped her.in order to extricate herself from sheppard control,gantt promised sheppard a reconciliation if he would voluntarily turn himself in to the police.when he complied,the police arrested him.
gantt commenced this action against security usa alleging a violation of the fifth amendment,a violation of title vii of the civil rights act,and the commission of two state law infliction of emotional distress and negligence.the district court dismissed the federal law counts and the negligence count on the ground that they failed to state claims upon which relief could be granted.with respect to the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of security usa.this appeal followed.
with respect to gantt appeal from the district court dismissal of her federal claims,i concur in what judge motz has written in part ii of her opinion,and therefore,i do not address those claims any further.gantt did not appeal the dismissal of her negligence claim.
with respect to gantt claim that security usa is liable to gantt on her claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress,i would affirm the judgment of the district court for the reasons that follow.
the parties seem to agree that gantt claims against security usa for her injuries arose in the course of her employment with security usa.see knoche cox,a n injury arises in the course of employment when it occurs within the period of employment at a place where the employee reasonably may be in the performance of her duties and while she is fulfilling those duties or engaged in doing something incident thereto quoting watson grimm.the district court observed likewise 
it is undisputed that gantt suffered her injuries at the hands of a third party,sheppard,while at work,and that she was on duty at the time and expected to be at her post.
thus,gantt was an employee covered by the maryland workers compensation act.see,lab.empl.b,f.
except for specified intentional conduct,the maryland workers compensation act provides the exclusive remedy for injuries sustained by an employee in the course of employment.see id.a,b the liability of an employer under this title is exclusive and the compensation provided under this title to a covered employee is in place of any right of action against any person hastings mechalske.under the act,security usa would thus have to compensate gantt for any accidental personal injury that gantt were to sustain in the course of her employment,regardless of fault as to the cause of injury.see debusk johns hopkins.accidental personal injury occurs and the workers compensation act applies even to injuries to an employee willfully caused by a third person,so long as the injury was sustained in the course of employment.see edgewood nursing home maxwell,applying the act to a nurse killed by her boyfriend for reasons unrelated to her job.accordingly,gantt claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress against security usa is barred by the immunity conferred by the act unless her claim falls within the narrow exception provided by d of the act,which authorizes common law claims for injuries caused by the deliberate conduct of her employer.that section provides 
if a covered employee is injured or killed as the result of the deliberate intent of the employer to injure or kill the covered employee,the covered employee or,in the case of death,a surviving spouse,child,or dependant of the covered employee may 
bring a claim for compensation under this title or 
bring an action for damages against the employer.
lab.empl.d.this exception to the immunity from common law liability requires that the injury to the employee be the result of the employer deliberate intent to injure,not simply deliberate conduct.the act links the injury with the specific intent to bring about that injury.while the plain language of d imposes that linkage,any doubt is removed by the decision in johnson mountaire farms.in johnson,the maryland court of appeals held that a suit against an employer for the death of a worker where the employer placed the worker in dangerous conditions did not qualify for the deliberate intention exception to the maryland workers compensation act and thus was barred.interpreting the antecedent to d,the court embraced the majority view that deliberate intention implies the formation by the employer of a specific intention to cause injury or death combined with some action aimed as accomplishing such result.johnson,at emphasis added.the court specifically rejected the minority approach of west virginia,which interpreted deliberate intent to include wilful,wanton and reckless misconduct,id.quoting mandolidis elkins.in applying this requirement,the court of appeals in johnson rejected the plaintiff argument that deliberate intention requires only that the employer intentionally do the act which happens to cause injury,adopting rather the interpretation that the deliberate intention exception requires actual,specific and deliberate intent to injure the employee.id.at see also federated dep t stores,le.
turning to this case,if security usa conduct is analyzed by the actions of its project manager wood,then there is undoubtedly no liability for a common law claim.wood expressly instructed sergeant claggett to assign gantt to an inside post,undoubtedly to protect,not to injure gantt.claggett disobedience of wood direction may be her deliberate conduct,but because that conduct was in contradiction of wood order,it can not be considered as evidence that security usa,gantt employer,deliberately intended to injure gantt.to the contrary,security usa intent is manifested by the order of project manager wood,which must be construed as an order to protect gantt from harm.
not all conduct by every employee is imputed to the employer for the purposes of the maryland workers compensation act.maryland courts historically restricted liability to acts authorized by the employer or performed by the employer alter ego.see,schatz york steak house,concluding that the conduct of an assistant manager of a restaurant in raping a fellow employee was not the intentional act of the employer so as to constitute the deliberately intended conduct of employer under the act cont l cas.mirabile,concluding that the deliberate conduct of a supervisor directed at an employee did not amount to the intentional conduct of employer under the act.although the maryland court of appeals in federated dep t stores cast doubt on the alter ego approach,the court also noted that it may well be that the general assembly intended something less than the full sweep of common law respondeat superior liability in drafting the workers compensation act.at.in this case,claggett was the lowest level supervisor of the new carrollton building reporting directly to a general local supervisor and then indirectly to project manager wood.her conduct as it related to gantt was not only unauthorized,but expressly disallowed,by her own supervisor.under any analysis of security usa common law liability under maryland workers compensation act for its employees conduct,claggett overt disobedience to the order of project manager wood should not be imputed to security usa.
but even if we were to impute sergeant claggett conduct to security usa,the evidence does not support a claim that sergeant claggett deliberately intended the injury suffered by gantt.to the contrary,the only evidence in the record supports a conclusion that sergeant claggett personally knew sheppard and believed that he had only intended to talk to gantt and work things out.i agree with the district court summary of the record where the court concluded 
t aking as true that claggett assigned plaintiff to the outside post and failed to call the police after the abduction,there is still no evidence to suggest that claggett intended for plaintiff to suffer,or even recklessly disregarded the possibility of,the severe emotional trauma of being abducted,assaulted,threatened and raped.to the contrary,the evidence agreed to by plaintiff in her statement of undisputed facts shows that claggett told harvey that sheppard only wanted to talk to plaintiff and would not hurt her.
at most,one could conclude from the record that sergeant claggett was negligent or even reckless.but a common law claim for injury from even wanton or reckless conduct is barred by the maryland workers compensation act.see johnson,at barring common law claims based on gross,wanton,wilful or reckless conduct.thus,regardless of whether or how claggett conduct might satisfy maryland requirements for intentional infliction of emotional distress,claggett conduct,as demonstrated by the record in this case,does not allow gantt to escape from the bar imposed by the maryland workers compensation act because that act requires that the employer deliberately intend to bring about the injury of which gantt complained,and there is no evidence to support that conclusion even if claggett conduct were imputable to security usa.
my colleagues suggest that factual questions remain about claggett intent to injure based on circumstances that claggett knew of facts underlying the protective order against sheppard and that claggett must have intended the uncomfortable anxiety that gantt suffered in manning post before sheppard arrived.were such injury the totality of the matter,it surely would fall short of constituting injury for purposes of either the maryland workers compensation act or intentional infliction of emotional distress.moreover,the record in this case provides no support,absent speculation,that claggett even intended to injure gantt by creating anxiety for her.to the contrary,the record shows that claggett was intending to act,however clumsily,as counselor or peacemaker,assuring gantt that sheppard only wanted to talk to her and repair their relationship.claggett misguided judgment and perhaps even recklessness,however,can not support a finding that she deliberately intended to injure gantt.see johnson,at.
because the conduct alleged and established on the record for summary judgment does not fit the narrow exception to common law immunity provided by the maryland workers compensation act,gantt claim against security usa must be for benefits under that act,and i would therefore affirm the district court summary judgment in favor of security usa on gantt common law claim,but for reasons different from those given by the district court.
i join part ii of the majority opinion,affirming the district court dismissal of gantt sexual harassment claim.i also concur in part iii,insofar as it reverses the district court order of summary judgment as to the emotional injuries suffered by gantt as she waited outside at post.
i dissent,however,from the majority affirmance of the district court order dismissing gantt claim against security usa for the emotional distress she suffered as a result of her abduction,torture and rape,as barred by the maryland worker compensation laws.in my judgment,gantt has presented sufficient evidence to support a jury verdict that security usa,acting through supervisor claggett,deliberately intended for gantt to be abducted,tortured and raped by sheppard and to suffer the severe emotional injuries that resulted therefrom.therefore,i would hold that this portion of gantt claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress may be brought by gantt outside of the provisions of the maryland workers compensation laws.
the majority holds,and i agree,that gantt presented sufficient evidence to withstand summary judgment on each of the elements of her tort claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress against security,usa for her injuries from the abduction,torture and rape.see ante at.it nevertheless affirms the district court order dismissing gantt claim as to these injuries because it holds that gantt did not present sufficient evidence to bring herself within the terms of the exception to the workers compensation act general prohibition on employee suits for workplace injuries outside the workers compensation scheme.see,lab.empl.a,b.the exception,set forth in d,provides that gantt may bring an action for damages against her employer if she demonstrates that she was injured as the result of the deliberate intent of her employer to injure her.see,lab.empl.d johnson mountaire farms of delmarva.
in holding that gantt has not presented evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that security usa deliberately intended to injure gantt,i believe the majority has failed to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence,taken in the light most favorable to gantt,and,in so doing,decided itself a factual question that should have been left to a jury instead.
claggett,gantt supervisor,and sheppard,her former boyfriend and attacker,were friends from work and they often discussed sheppard relationship with gantt.claggett knew that sheppard had previously abused and threatened to kill gantt.she knew that sheppard was barred by court order from having any contact with gantt.and she knew that,by order of manager earl wood,gantt was not to be stationed at an outside post,in order that she be protected from sheppard.yet,on the very morning in question,claggett ordered gantt to report to post,an outside post,ignoring both the instructions given to her only a few minutes earlier by willie jones,the supervisor that preceded her,and gantt own pleas that she would not be safe if located at post.then,within fifteen minutes of gantt assuming post,claggett knowingly violated the protective order against sheppard and transferred a telephone call from him to gantt.alarmed by sheppard call,gantt again pleaded with claggett that she be transferred from post to an inside post where she would not be vulnerable.claggett rebuffed gantt,insisting that she remain at post.less than an hour later,sheppard arrived at post and kidnapped gantt at gunpoint.when told that gantt had been abducted at gunpoint and was being driven away in a van,claggett even still refused to intervene to protect gantt by calling the police,instructing other employees not to be alarmed.
