on the evening of april,two vessels collided in the gulf of mexico.the chemical tanker formosa six formosa six was heading outbound from the mouth of the mississippi river,going south toward a voluntary fairway system located in an area called the southwest pass.the bulk carrier flora flora was heading in a northerly direction inbound.despite the apparent expanses of available water,flora managed to strike formosa six,damaging both vessels and causing formosa six liquid chemical cargo,owned by mitsubishi corporation,to pour into the sea.the collision occurred south of a sea buoy located just south of the southwest pass.
in april,mitsubishi filed a claim in the eastern district of louisiana against flora and six interests for the cargo lost and damaged.the owner of formosa six,formosa plastics tanker corporation,filed a separate action against flora interests.flora owners segesta shipping company,and managers efnav company,filed a petition seeking exoneration from or limitation of liability.these cases were consolidated.flora interests later filed a counterclaim in the consolidated case against formosa,seeking recovery of damages sustained by flora.mitsubishi filed a motion for partial summary judgment against flora interests in april,and the district court granted that motion,finding that flora was at fault in the collision and was therefore obliged to fund the cargo damage claim.flora interests filed a motion for reconsideration,which the court denied.the court bifurcated the liability and damage issues,and the liability trial was held in december.the court issued an order in january,finding flora percent responsible for the collision and six percent at fault.flora again filed a motion for reconsideration,which the court denied.following a stipulation on damages,the court entered a damages judgment in august,awarding formosa six interests,plus interest and costs,and dismissing flora limitation action.the judgment also acknowledged settlement by the parties of the mitsubishi claim by contributions of from formosa interests and from flora interests.flora appeals and we affirm.
in this appeal,flora argues that the district court erred as a matter of law in determining the proximate cause of the collision by failing to apply pertinent law.in the alternative,flora contends that the district court apportionment of fault was clearly erroneous.we address these arguments in turn.
flora contends that the district court erred as a matter of law by failing to apply several arguably applicable regulations.collisions at sea are governed by internationally accepted regulations recognized by treaty in the united states these are codified at foll.colregs.in arguing that the district court failed to properly apply these regulations,flora apparently hopes that this court will review the findings of the trial court de novo rather than under the appropriate clearly erroneous standard.conclusions of law are,of course,reviewed de novo.see phillips petroleum best oilfield,cir.when reviewing mixed questions of law and fact,this court should reverse only if the findings are based on a misunderstanding of the law or a clearly erroneous view of the facts.see bose consumers union of,d.because the proper regulations were considered and applied,as we discuss below,we find that there was no misunderstanding of the law.
flora argument that the district court erred in its application of the relevant regulations is grounded in a rule for finding liability in collisions at pennsylvania rule.under the pennsylvania rule,if a vessel involved in a collision was violating a statutory rule intended to prevent collisions,the burden shifts to the violating vessel to show that its fault could not have been a cause of the accident.see the pennsylvania,wall.see also garner cities serv.tankers,cir.the rule thus creates a presumption that one who violates a regulation intended to prevent collisions will be deemed responsible but that presumption is rebuttable.see otto candies,madeline,cir.further,as discussed below,the pennsylvania rule applies only to violations of statutes that delineate a clear legal duty,not regulations that require judgment and assessment of a particular circumstance.
specifying the rules that her adversary allegedly violated,flora first contends that the trial court erred by failing to take into account formosa six violation of colreg rule in apportioning responsibility for the collision.colreg rule provides 
every vessel shall at all times maintain a proper by sight and hearing as well as by all available means appropriate in the prevailing circumstances and conditions so as to make a full appraisal of the situation and of the risk of collision.
foll.flora is asking this court to find fault with the district court failure to acknowledge that six lack of a was crucial,and the proximate cause of the accident.because flora is here taking issue with the district court finding of fact,we review this aspect of the district court decision for clear error.see bose,at.
the trial court found that formosa six had not complied with the cited regulation that is not disputed.thus,flora argument involves the district court weighing of the evidence,not its application of the law.the court erred,flora contends,by failing to impose the pennsylvania burden.but the district court clearly did consider the predicate facts that constitute a violation of colreg rule.the district court also found that formosa six violated that regulation,and that such failure was a contributing cause of the collision.see tokio marine fire ins,flora,no.civ,wl,at.the court,in fact,found that this failure was a contributory cause,though a relatively small one,of the collision.id.at.flora argues that this was an error of law,and then cites the importance of complying with rule as well as the importance of having a on the formosa six at this critical juncture.the importance of the regulation does not change its application,nor does it impugn the finding of fact made by the district court.the dispute flora has is with the district court finding of fact that formosa six failure to have a was not as crucial a factor in the collision as flora seeks to make it.however,neither formosa six nor the district court clearly indicated why this failure was not to be considered a more critical cause of the accident.but because this finding is reviewed only for clear error,and flora has not demonstrated error of that sort,we find that the district court,in its considered judgment,properly weighed formosa six violation of rule in determining the proximate cause of the collision.
flora next argues that the district court failed to impose the requirement embodied in colreg rule c on formosa six.rule c states 
if there is sufficient sea room,alteration of course alone may be the most effective action to avoid a situation provided that it is made in good time,is substantial and does not result in another situation.
foll.to fail to refer to this provision of the rule explicitly in its findings of fact is certainly not clear error,let alone a mistake of law.first,the district court did consider rule in making its findings.the court recognized a duty under rule to take action to avoid collision,and that both flora and formosa six had failed to fulfill this duty.see tokio marine fire,wl,at.second,the language of rule c is suggestive,rather than mandatory.the pennsylvania rule applies in cases in which a precise and clearly defined duty is mandated by the relevant statute,not when the statute calls for the use of interpretation and judgment.interstate towing stissi,cir.the provision of the rules at issue here falls within the latter category rather than the former.thus,the burden did not have to shift to formosa six for a violation of rule c,and the court can not have erred in not shifting more of the onus on formosa six for violating it.indeed,the pennsylvania rule was not even mentioned in zim israel navigation,special carriers,a case in which one party was deemed to have violated rule c.the fact that the rule had been violated was considered in determining the cause of the collision,but no presumption of fault was invoked.it is evident that the district court did not err in its application of rule,nor in its failure to mention rule c.
flora next contends that special circumstances justify its own violations of the colregs,and that these same circumstances demand a finding that formosa six violated colreg rule.that rule states 
nothing in these rules shall exonerate any vessel,or the owner,master or crew thereof,from the consequences of any neglect to comply with these rules or the neglect of any precaution which may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen,or by the special circumstances of the case.
foll.the special circumstances to which flora refers involve an alleged custom that,in the southwest pass,outbound vessels must take extra care when leaving the area to avoid a collision,and inbound vessels have the right of way.but the existence of such a custom was convincingly undermined by two bar pilots testimony on the other hand,captain douglas torborg,the flora expert mariner,testified to the existence of the custom.but the district court did not take this alleged custom into account in determining fault,which flora contends was an error of law.
however,a court does not err as a matter of law by failing to take into account a custom whose existence is successfully disproved.the court properly found that flora violation of a passing agreement,which it had entered into with six some minutes before the collision,had no basis in maritime law or custom.tokio marine fire,wl,at.we see no reason to conclude that an alleged custom giving inbound vessels right of way vitiated the agreement,or required apportionment of greater responsibility for the collision to formosa six.
both bar pilots testified that there was no such custom.an amicus brief filed by the associated branch pilots of the port of new orleans asserts the same,arguing that there is no custom assigning a right of way in the code of federal regulations or in the practice of pilots and mariners.this conclusion is buttressed by the decision of this court in hal antillen mount ymitos ms,cir,which reversed a district court finding the area at issue in this existed a custom of passing starboard to starboard,not port to port,as the colregs provide.noting that a custom that conflicts with the colregs would be confusing,that this custom was not published and that there was highly contradictory testimony about whether the custom existed,this court held that the district court finding that such a custom existed was clearly erroneous.see id.at.flora does not dispute this,but instead argues that because this court in hal antillen apparently left intact the district court finding that inbound vessels have the right of way in the southwest pass,that custom does exist.we believe,however,that there is sufficient evidence in the present case to support the district court apparent conclusion that there is no preference for inbound ships.
even if there were such a custom,the district court found that the present vessels had entered into an agreement to pass port to port.any such agreement would override custom.as we noted in canal barge,china ocean shipping,even when the custom prevails,pilots of approaching vessels may agree to pass in some fashion other than in the manner provided by habitual practice,cir.
flora next line of attack is aimed at the district court findings of fact that led to its conclusion that flora was percent at fault for the collision.we recapitulate briefly the court findings that led to this conclusion.formosa six had just completed a downriver passage from the mississippi river,and was proceeding from the southwest pass in the gulf of mexico toward the sea buoy just south of the southwest pass.six was being directed by compulsory bar pilot kevin leger.vessels departing the southwest pass proceed on a southerly heading into the voluntary fairway system,which looks like an inverted y and bifurcates into two legs proceeding respectively in the southeast and the southwest directions.six was being steered by hand,aided by two radars and one automated radar plotting aid arpa.the arpa was equipped with a closest point of approach cpa alarm,set to alert navigators to any vessel that would pass within a nautical mile radius of six within a time period.flora was proceeding on a northerly course in the gulf of mexico,inbound and seaward of the southwest pass sea buoy.flora was equipped with an arpa and three radars.however,captain george gatsos,the vessel master,testified at trial that he used only one radar and did not turn on the arpa that evening.
somehow,these two vessels,proceeding on a clear night in a relatively large fairway,collided.how this could happen with abundant sea room available may be mystifying to landlubbers,but navigation at night has its special challenges.what exactly happened here was a source of furious contention in the trial court.at around hours,as six was entering the gulf of mexico,the six crew observed flora approaching and set flora on its arpa with a cpa of and a cpa time of minutes.thus,the cpa alarm would sound when flora was in a position to be within nautical miles of six not more than minutes later.at about,bar pilot leger,aboard six,conferred by radio with flora and agreed to pass six then turned to starboard to make a lee turning to protect a small craft from the wind to shelter leger in departing the ship.at no time in this sequence did six have a watch.shortly thereafter,the pilot boat that had picked up leger asked flora to make a lee for bar pilot samuel eddy to board flora.flora stated that it would turn to starboard to make a lee for the bar pilot,but instead turned to port.flora captain gatsos did not notify the pilot boat or the formosa six that he was turning to port instead of to starboard.thus,according to the district court,flora made a sudden,hard and unexpected turn to port just prior to the collision.a little before this,after dropping off pilot leger,formosa six returned to a southerly course and shortly learned that it had moved into a dumpsite at the west side of the fairway.the vessel turned somewhat to port in an effort to maneuver out of the dumpsite area,still expecting to accomplish a passage.
the location of the collision,and the speed at which the two vessels were traveling,was hotly disputed at trial.the district court ultimately found that the location of the collision was consistent with formosa six version of the story it occurred approximately at the position claimed by six and was based on a global satellite positioning reading taken by flora third mate at the time of six side of the fairway.the court also based this finding on its acceptance of the testimony of formosa six expert witness,gary maseuth,as well as on the location of the chemical spillage from six on the ocean floor.the court rejected the testimony of captain torborg,flora expert mariner,who testified that no one could determine the position of the vessels at the time of collision,and that global satellite positioning data can be inaccurate.this district court finding was significant because it showed that the flora had moved far from the center of the safety fairway and was encroaching significantly on to the part of the fairway occupied by the formosa six.tokio marine fire,wl,at.the court also found that flora was traveling at a speed of at least two knots,which was significant because,if flora had been going much slower,as captain gatsos testified,it would have been powerless to avoid the accident in the last few minutes,when a collision appeared likely to occur.
this court reviews the district court findings of fact for clear error.see.a american river trans kavo kaliakra ss,cir.this standard also applies to apportionment of fault.see inland oil transp.towing,cir,abrogated on other grounds,city of milwaukee national gypsum,d.the supreme court articulated the meaning of this standard of review 
if the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact,it would have weighed the evidence differently.where there are
