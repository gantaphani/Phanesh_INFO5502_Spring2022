charles and ruth warren,owners and operators of a dairy queen in athens,ohio,sued the city of athens city and city prosecutor william biddlestone under,alleging that the defendants violated the warrens constitutional rights by installing barricades that restricted access to the dairy queen.the warrens sought declaratory and injunctive relief,and the district court permanently enjoined the city from restricting access to the dairy queen.the city appeals,arguing that the district court erred by determining that the warrens takings claim was ripe finding that the city violated the warrens due process rights finding that the city violated the warrens right to equal protection of the law and granting the warrens request for a permanent injunction.we affirm the district court grant of a permanent injunction,although our reasoning differs from that of the district court in several respects.
charles and ruth warren,along with members of their family,have owned and operated a dairy queen at the northwest corner of the intersection of columbus road and sunset drive in athens,ohio,since.there has been a dairy queen at that location for over years.other than social security benefits,the dairy queen is the only source of income for charles and ruth warren.
first,it is helpful to describe the dairy queen and its immediate surroundings.the dairy queen has a drive thru lane located along the south side of the building.the lane enters from and exits onto sunset drive,a street providing access to eighteen residences.there are parking spaces located in the island created by the arc of the drive thru lane cars exiting these spaces must back onto sunset drive.the dairy queen faces columbus road,a road,and there is an entrance to the restaurant parking lot from columbus road.the entrance from columbus road leads to parking spaces on the north side of the building as well as in the front of the building the side facing columbus road.however,because of the property lines,there is no access around the back of the building from the north side to the west side abutting sunset drive.thus,all cars must exit either back onto columbus road or via the same sunset drive exit utilized by drive thru customers.the sunset drive exit is only about twenty feet from the intersection.
the dairy queen drive thru lane was constructed after the warren family decided in that a drive thru would increase business and improve access for customers.as the president of the regional dairy queen office testified,no dairy queen would continue to be economically viable in the modern economy without a drive thru.in october,the warrens applied for a building permit from the city to allow construction of the drive thru.stephen pierson,director of code enforcement for the city,determined that the proposed drive thru did not contravene any zoning regulations.pierson nonetheless denied the warrens application in december,explaining that the proposed drive thru and part of the existing dairy queen building were located on a public owned by the city in his refusal,pierson notified the warrens of their right to appeal the decision.pierson also suggested that the warrens apply for a revocable license from the city council for use of the.the warrens did so and entered into discussions with city officials,who had been contacted by sunset drive residents concerned about increased traffic on their street.
in april,the warrens proposed alternate plans for the drive thru in order to address the concerns of residents of sunset drive.wayne key,the city director,endorsed one of these plans,since it channeled the drive thru exit onto columbus road and called for parallel parking,rather than parking,along sunset drive.nevertheless,the city council denied the warrens application,citing safety concerns and the concerns of residents affected by the drive thru.the council acknowledged that its denial may become moot if the city did not in fact own the.after being advised by their attorney that the city did not in fact have a over their property,the decided to proceed with their original plan to build the.the warrens notified the city of their intent to so proceed,and the drive thru opened in july.drive thru customers generated forty to percent of the warrens business.
three years later,in april,city prosecutor william biddlestone notified the warrens counsel that due to numerous complaints from the dairy queen neighbors about traffic congestion and noise on sunset drive,the city planned to place do not block signs at the intersection of sunset and columbus place no stopping or standing signs at the exit and entrance to the drive thru on sunset and build a curb along sunset to close the illegal driveways comprising the drive thru the signs were erected soon after,and the warrens did not object to this action.on may,city officials biddlestone,key and pierson met with the warrens to discuss the matter and specifically the city plan to install curbs blocking the drive thru.on may,biddlestone wrote the warrens counsel to inform him that a little more research indicated that several automobile accidents,including a couple of fairly serious ones,had taken place at the intersection since the drive thru opened.declaring the drive thru a traffic hazzard sic,biddlestone reiterated the city intention to follow through with placement of temporary curbing along sunset and permanent curbs at some point in the future.on may,the city placed barricades along sunset,running from the exit to the west end of the property line even though the drive thru exit was not barricaded,customers could not use the drive thru,and refuse trucks could not pick up trash,recycling,and waste grease at the back of the restaurant.the warrens experienced a drop in sales of about in the month following the blockage of the drive thru.
both parties offered extensive evidence during the district court proceedings regarding traffic concerns related to the drive thru.even though city officials such as key,pierson,and police officer roger dierdorf testified,they presented no evidence that the city had attempted to design a traffic enforcement plan in the area of the dairy queen,conduct a study of traffic flow on sunset drive,or assess the particular impact of the drive thru itself.officer dierdorf,who regularly patrols the area around the dairy queen,testified that he had never seen traffic backed up on sunset drive waiting to enter the drive thru.an examination of accident reports in the vicinity of the intersection did not produce any evidence of accidents connected in any way to the drive thru.in addition,the city produced two videos of the intersection covering periods during the summer of,but neither video revealed any traffic problems or accidents.
various residents of houses on sunset drive testified about traffic problems caused by the drive thru.for example,ralph kliesch described how cars exiting the drive thru often block sunset drive,putting drivers turning onto sunset from columbus in danger.he also noted that cars turning right into the drive thru have to swing into the other side of sunset drive,and kliesch stated that he often has to swing into the oncoming traffic lane when cars are stacked up on sunset in line for the drive thru.one resident,ellen kroutel,videotaped the stacking of cars on sunset drive on march,during the largest promotion in dairy queen history.other residents echoed these concerns,as well as concerns over noise and use of residential driveways,but none of them reported an inability to see the vehicles on sunset from columbus,an inability to reach their homes,or witnessing firsthand an accident on sunset drive.the barricades installed by the city increased the number of cars using the residential driveways on sunset.
in addition to evidence from city officials and local residents,both parties offered the testimony and reports of an expert witness at trial.the city retained stephen thieken,a transportation and traffic engineer,who found fault in the stacking space available to dairy queen drive thru customers,the short distance the corner clearance between the drive thru exit and columbus road,and the angled nature of the parking spaces on sunset drive.thieken also reported that the severity of accidents around the dairy queen increased after the drive thru was installed,but he cautioned that it was difficult to link the accidents directly to the operation of the dairy queen.thieken based his report solely on maps,conversations with city officials,accident reports,and a visit to the site.
the warrens offered the testimony and report of richard dewolfe,a civil transportation engineer who had experience designing commercial sites,including drive thru restaurants and banks dewolfe reviewed the dairy queen site,other businesses in the vicinity of the dairy queen,accident reports,various letters sent among the parties to the case,the video shot by ellen kroutel,and the two videos of the intersection shot in the summer of.dewolfe report rebutted each of thieken conclusions.first,in dewolfe view,the institute of transportation engineers ite guidelines upon which thieken also relied did not require a longer stacking space than that provided by the dairy queen drive thru.second,dewolfe pointed out that thieken did not sufficiently observe traffic volumes at the intersection so as to support his conclusion that insufficient corner clearance was provided between the drive thru exit and columbus road.similarly,dewolfe found thieken analysis of the angled parking on sunset drive to be unsupported by any analysis of traffic volume or the relationship between the drive thru and the accidents that have occurred.dewolfe listed a number of other businesses in athens with angled parking,an amount of stacking space similar to that of dairy queen,and exits near an intersection.dewolfe concluded that these business locations created more potential traffic conflicts than the dairy queen.these businesses,however,were not threatened with barricades.
charles and ruth warren filed a complaint in federal court on june,seeking damages and injunctive relief against the city and biddlestone.the district court granted a temporary restraining order against the city on june,and after an evidentiary hearing,the court issued a preliminary injunction on june ordering the city to remove the barriers on sunset drive.subsequently,on the warrens motion,the district court dismissed without prejudice the plaintiffs claims against biddlestone as well as their damage claims against the city,leaving only the warrens claims for declaratory and injunctive relief,as well as for attorneys fees and expenses.additional testimony and exhibits were presented at a trial in december,and on march,the district court permanently enjoined the city from installing barricades,curbing,or otherwise restricting access to the dairy queen.the city appealed from the district court order on april.
the warrens rather imprecise complaint alleges an arbitrary taking of property without due process and a violation of their right to equal protection,procedural due process,and substantive due process.it generally asserts violation of the warrens fifth and fourteenth amendment rights.the essence of the warrens factual allegations and argument is that the city violated their federal constitutional rights by placing barriers along their property,thereby blocking access to the drive thru,both for customers and for trash and waste removal.they allege that such barriers were not erected at other similarly situated businesses.they assert that they have no administrative appeal remedy and received no notice of a hearing or appeal.
after scrutinizing the complaint,it is fairly clear that the warrens assert an equal protection claim based on their allegations that the city did not erect barricades at similarly situated businesses.also,their procedural due process claim rather obviously derives from the lack of a hearing to challenge the erection of the barriers.the warrens also assert,however,a third claim which is less in the complaint.this third claim presents the issue of whether the city erection of the barriers is an unconstitutional restriction on the warrens use of their property.the warrens have described this claim as a substantive due process claim,and we refer to it in the same way,although we do not entirely agree with either the warrens or the district court characterization of it.we address the third claim,which requires the most difficult analysis,first.
a.the substantive due process claim 
in this case,the appropriate legal analysis of the warrens claim of taking of property without due process is entirely dependent on its proper characterization.the district court extensively addressed the standards applicable to takings claims and eventually concluded that the warrens complaint actually involved a private use takings claim brought under a substantive due process theory.the court went on to evaluate this substantive due process claim,holding that the city actions amounted to a taking for private use,thus infringing the warrens substantive due process property rights.we review legal conclusions upon which a decision to grant an injunction is based de novo.sharpe cureton,cir.
although the warrens mention the fifth amendment in their complaint,they have not sought to base their action on the just compensation clause of the fifth amendment.certainly,the warrens have never contended that the city placed its barriers or otherwise physically encroached on their property.such an allegation would have been a physical takings claim.see waste,metro.gov t,cir.also,more fundamentally,although the decision to place barriers along the warrens property could be considered a regulatory taking arguably falling within the ambit of the just compensation clause,see williamson county reg l planning comm hamilton bank,d,the warrens have not sought monetary compensation for the taking of their property,even before they sought dismissal of their claims for damages therefore,the appellees claim does not fall under the just compensation clause of the fifth amendment.see id.at.montgomery carter county,cir.
another possible basis for a fifth amendment claim is the theory that a taking is for a private rather than a public use.the district court analyzed the warrens claim as a private use taking,although it grounded its analysis in fourteenth amendment substantive due process rather than in the fifth amendment implied prohibition on takings for a private use.private use takings do not involve claims for compensation,as they are unconstitutional regardless of whether just compensation is paid.see id.at.in montgomery,upon which the district court relied,the defendant county declared that it owned the plaintiff driveway and would consider any obstruction of the driveway by plaintiff a crime.id.this court held in montgomery that the county action had no rational relationship to any public purpose and was thus a rare example of a taking for a private use.id.montgomery noted,however,that few takings will meet the standard for a private use taking,because all that is required for a public use is a rational relationship to some conceivable public purpose.id.at quoting hawaii hous.auth.midkiff,d.
the district court analysis of the warrens claim as a private use substantive due process claim is problematic for two reasons.first,although the city acted at the urging of residents of sunset drive and for their benefit,the city action was rationally related to the conceivable public purposes of traffic,noise and accident control this fact situation contrasts with that in montgomery where the county declared the driveway a county road at the urging of a single neighbor whose motive was to obtain delivery of mail to her home.id.at.second,although the montgomery panel did not explicitly decide whether a private use taking claim could be asserted as a substantive due process claim,it analyzed the two issues separately in the case and cast a dim light on the prospect that a claim merging the two principles would be viable.see id.at i t is not clear why the concept of substantive due process should have any place in takings cases.the district court private use takings analysis of the warrens case thus appears inconsistent with both the facts and the law,and we decline to adopt it.
although the warrens embrace the district court private use analysis,they also assert that their claim is a substantive due process claim of the type described in williamson county.see at.their argument is that placement of the barriers constituted a government regulation that goes so far that it ha d the same effect as a taking by eminent domain and thus was an invalid exercise of the police power,violative of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.id.the remedy for such a violation would not be just compensation but rather invalidation of the regulation.id.this due process takings theory is based on language in pennsylvania coal mahon,which held that if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.in dicta in that case,justice holmes went on to suggest that the court meant taking not in the literal fifth amendment sense,but to represent all actions having the same effect as a taking by eminent domain 
government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law.as long recognized,some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to the police power.but obviously the implied limitation must have its limits,or the contract and due process clauses are gone.one fact for consideration in determining such limits is the extent of the diminution.when it reaches a certain magnitude,in most if not in all cases there must be an exercise of eminent domain and compensation to sustain the act.
id.at.see also williamson county,at.interpreting mahon and outlining the rationale for the due process takings theory.the warrens claim of taking of property without due process potentially fits well within this theory.the warrens case has never been about compensation but rather has concerned invalidation of the regulation imposed by the city,the argument being that the barricades were so onerous that they had the same effect as an appropriation of the property.id.at.yet,the supreme court has left undecided three times the issue of whether the constitution supports such a theory.see id.at.citations omitted.and supreme court authority subsequent to williamson county strongly stresses that substantive due process concepts are not available to provide relief when another provision of the constitution directly addresses the type of illegal government conduct alleged by the plaintiff.see,graham connor,d analyzing an excessive force claim under a fourth amendment standard and not the more generalized notion of substantive due process whitley albers,d noting that in the prison security context,the due process clause affords no greater protection than does the eighth amendment see also montgomery,at the takings clause itself addresses whether and under what circumstances the government may take an individual private property,which is why a number of circuits have concluded that no room is left for the concept of substantive due process.citing armendariz penman,cir en banc,and coniston vill.of hoffman estates,cir choate air conditioning heating light,gas water,fed.appx,cir rejecting an effort to repackage a takings claim as a substantive due process violation.we therefore decline to endorse a substantive due process theory based on a claim that erection of the barriers amounted to an unconstitutional taking of property.
a final avenue exists for assertion of a substantive due process claim,but this avenue appears outside the scope of the warrens complaint and their argument on appeal.this court has recognized that a substantive due process violation occurs when arbitrary and capricious government action deprives an individual of a constitutionally protected property interest.see mgmt.praznik,fed.appx,cir pearson city of grand blanc,cir see also nectow city of cambridge.holding that a court should not interfere with local zoning decisions unless the locality action has no foundation in reason and is a mere arbitrary or irrational exercise of power having no substantial relation to the public health,the public morals,the public safety or the public welfare in its proper sense internal quotation marks and citation omitted eide sarasota county,cir.while challenges to arbitrary and capricious government action appear most frequently in cases involving zoning and other ordinances,see,vill.of belle terre boraas,d,they are not necessarily limited to such cases,see,duke power carolina envtl.study group,d noting that federal economic regulations will be upheld absent proof of arbitrariness or irrationality on the part of congress see also zinermon burch,d t he due process clause contains a substantive component that bars certain arbitrary,wrongful government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.citation omitted.although the district court states that the city actions were a de facto zoning change analogous to the denial of a zoning variance or permit,the warrens do not assert such a claim here and,in fact,argue in their brief that the case at bar is not a zoning case and that the city barricades were not placed pursuant to any regulations or laws.given the warrens position,we will not consider the applicability of this theory to the sort of particularized action involved in this case.
we recognize the soundness of the district court findings and conclusions about the lack of any viable justification for the city erection of the barriers and the clear deprivation of the warrens right to ingress and egress from their property.yet,given the law,the facts,and the warrens own arguments and characterization of their claims,we can not conclude that the city violated the warrens substantive due process rights.
b.the procedural due process claim 
we now turn to consideration of the warrens procedural due process claim.the fourteenth amendment provides,in part,that n o state shall deprive any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.const.amend.xiv.procedural due process generally requires that the state provide a person with notice and an opportunity to be heard before depriving that person of a property or liberty interest.see,thompson ashe,cir courts have long recognized that the fourteenth amendment requires that an individual who is deprived of an interest in liberty or property be given notice and a hearing.only after a plaintiff has met the burden of demonstrating that he possessed a protected property or liberty interest and was deprived of that interest will the court consider whether the process provided the plaintiff in conjunction with the deprivation,or lack thereof,violated his rights to due process.hamilton myers,cir.
preliminarily,we consider the issue of ripeness of the procedural due process claim.takings claims,whether asserted as just compensation or substantive due process claims,are subject to ripeness requirements,williamson county,at,as are procedural due process claims that are ancillary to takings claims,arnett myers,cir.here the warrens procedural due process claim is not ancillary to their takings claim,but addresses a separate deprivation of a property interest without a predeprivation hearing.see nasierowski.inv.city of sterling heights,cir explaining the vital distinction between procedural due process claims and other varieties of constitutional grievances stemming from land use decisions see also hidden oaks city of austin,cir holding that williamson county would not apply when main thrust of plaintiff claim is procedural due process,not takings nasierowski,at martin,concurring stating that the williamson county requirements will apply when the procedural due process claim is in reality an adjunct to a taking or other constitutional claim.
in resolving the procedural due process claim,the first issue is whether the warrens were deprived of a property interest.property rights are created and defined not by the constitution but by independent sources such as state law.thomas cohen,cir.in state ex rel.merritt linzell,ohio,the ohio supreme court held
