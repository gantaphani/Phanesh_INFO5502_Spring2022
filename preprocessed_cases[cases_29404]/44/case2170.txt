this case arises from the collapse of a television transmission tower owned by knoe television knoe in riverton,louisiana.most of the claims resulting from the tower collapse were resolved on summary judgment.a jury awarded over million in damages to knoe first party insurer,boston old colony boc,and against general star indemnity general star,the excess liability insurer for tower network services tns.general star appeals from a number of summary judgment and evidentiary rulings of the district court.in turn,boc on two issues relating to the district court judgment on the jury verdict.after a review of the relevant facts,we address these issues in turn.
factual and procedural background 
on march,a television transmission tower owned by knoe collapsed and was completely destroyed.before the collapse,knoe had contracted with tns for maintenance and repair work on the tower.at the time of the collapse,a repair crew was working on the tower,installing diagonals,thin metal rods which prevent the tower from twisting.the investigation indicated that the sole cause of the incident was the failure on the part of the tower crew to use a temporary brace to support the tower during the removal of the diagonals,which resulted in the tower becoming unstable and collapsing.
tns is a contractor specializing in the repair and maintenance of towers.before the collapse,tns had contracted with hrc armco,armco for administrative employee services.in turn,this contract was assigned to armco sister corporation,allied resource management of florida allied.thus,allied actually paid the tower crew and performed a number of other administrative functions in relation to the workers.
due to the destruction of knoe tower,a new tower was built.before the collapse,knoe was using the tower to broadcast its signal.louisiana public broadcasting lpb was also using the tower pursuant to a philanthropic donation of space on the tower by the owner of knoe,which would expire in.after the new tower was built,knoe leased tower space to lpb for a period of years,in exchange for a payment of million.
boc,the first party insurer of knoe,made payments to or on behalf of knoe of approximately million for the new tower and transmitter,business interruption losses and other expenses related to the loss.on may,boc filed a petition for damages in louisiana state court against tns tns primary liability insurer,nautilus ins.nautilus tns excess liability insurer,general star armco allied and the builder of the tower,stainless,stainless.boc alleged that the collapse was caused by the negligence of persons for whom tns,armco,or allied were responsible or by design defects for which stainless was responsible.the case was removed to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction in june.knoe intervened to recover damages and expenses not covered by the boc policy.the state of louisiana also intervened to assert a claim on behalf of lpb.
on july,armco and allied filed a against tns,nautilus,and general star,seeking indemnity contribution.general star filed a against armco and allied for indemnity contribution and filed a complaint against their insurer,national union fire ins.national union.
a number of motions for partial summary judgment and motions in limine were filed,and all claims except those by boc against general star were resolved or dismissed before trial.at trial,the jury rendered a verdict in favor of boc and against general star,and the court entered judgment in favor of boc and against general star in the amount of plus pre and interest.
general star appeals from several district court rulings on motions for partial summary judgment and motions in limine.boc with respect to calculation of damages and interest.
discussion 
i.the care,custody,or control exclusion 
in march,general star moved for partial summary judgment in its favor on the grounds that the care,custody,or control exclusion in its policy excluded coverage for the damages sought by boc.the district court denied general star motion and rendered summary judgment against general star and in favor of boc,armco,tns,knoe,and the state of louisiana on this issue.
we review the district court summary judgment decision de novo,applying the same standard on appeal that is applied by the district court.see pratt city of houston,texas,cir.summary judgment may be granted if there is no genuine issue as to material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.see.c.in determining whether summary judgment is appropriate,the courts should view the evidence introduced and all factual inferences from that evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion and all reasonable doubts about the facts should be resolved in favor of the nonmoving litigant.see impossible techniques,wackenhut protective,cir.
the general star insurance policy contains a care,custody or control exclusion,which provides 
this policy does not apply to property damage 
c property in the care,custody,or control of the insured or property over which the insured for any purpose is exercising physical control.
the parties agree that louisiana law applies to the interpretation of the exclusion.we apply louisiana state law as interpreted by the louisiana supreme court if that court has not definitively ruled on a particular issue,we must predict how it would decide the issue.harken exploration sphere drake ins.plc,cir.
we find that the care,custody,or control exclusion does not apply in this case.under louisiana law,insurance policies are contracts,and the parties intent as reflected by the language of the policy determines the extent of coverage.reynolds select,so d.under general star interpretation of the exclusion,tns would lose virtually all liability insurance coverage.tns is in the sole business of inspecting,maintaining,and repairing towers.so to interpret the exclusion as applying whenever tns works on a tower would be an anomalous result.aladdin oil rayburn well,so d.cir.if this was intended,the insurer should have indicated more specifically its intent.id.holding that the care,custody or control exclusion did not apply to damages to an oil well where the insured was working only on a short string of tubing in the well,because the insured was in the business of reworking oil wells.
in any case,tns did not exercise care,custody,or control over the tower because the tower was only incidental to the specific sections on which repairs were made.d amaged property or premises merely incidental or adjacent to the contracted object upon which work is being performed by the insured is not within the care,custody or control of the insured for purposes of the exclusion clause in question,even though he might be permitted access thereto during the performance of the contract.see thomas hooley sons zurich general acc.liability ins,so d,
because tns did not have care,custody or control of the tower within the meaning of the exclusion in general star policy,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on this issue.
ii.vicarious liability of allied 
on for summary judgment filed by tns,nautilus,and general star on one hand,and armco,allied and national union on the other,the district court granted summary judgment for the latter group,finding that allied was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the work crew.we review this issue de novo,applying the same standard for summary judgment as did the district court.
in january,tns and armco entered a client services agreement csa according to which armco would lease its employees to tns in exchange for a fee for each leased employee,and a percentage of the employees wages every month.one of the employees would be designated as a supervising employee and would be charged with implementing armco policies and procedures at the workplace.tns was required to provide commercial general liability insurance.the csa was later assigned to allied,which performed instead of armco.
the record indicates that the csa was entered for the purpose of relieving tns of the administrative burdens involved in taking care of its employees.ordinarily,allied clients including tns would recruit,find,evaluate,and hire the employees they would then decide whether to have the person be a leased employee and if so,they would send the paperwork to allied,who would deal with group health,workers compensation,payroll,and other administrative matters.allied retained the right to refuse employment,but employment would only be refused in narrow circumstances,such as a positive drug test or lack of proper immigration forms.allied did not have the right to fire employees,and if an issue arose as to firing,tns would be consulted and asked to fire the person.
the central question with regard to allied liability is whether the work crew consisted of borrowed employees for whom allied is not responsible.general star contends that the borrowed employee doctrine no longer exists in louisiana,that allied and tns were dual employers,and consequently that allied should be held vicariously liable,along with tns,for the negligence of the tower crew.we find that the borrowed employee doctrine is still alive,and that it applies in this case.
under the borrowed employee doctrine,a general employer may be relieved of vicarious liability for an employee negligent actions if the employee was borrowed,if at the time of the negligent action the employee was under the control of a specific employer,or was engaged in the specific employer business.benoit hunt tool,so d.this doctrine has been modified somewhat by the dual employer doctrine,according to which both the special and general employer may be found jointly liable for the torts of a borrowed employee,in circumstances where the employee negligent acts were done in the pursuance of duties designated for him by his general employer,in whose pay he continued and who had the sole right to discharge him.lejeune allstate ins,so d.in addition,where a general employer is engaged in the business of hiring out its employees under the supervision of another employer,the general employer remains liable for the torts of the borrowed employees.morgan abc manufacturer,so d.thus,in morgan the louisiana supreme court held that a temporary services agency,which had the exclusive power to recruit,hire,and fire employees and handled administrative duties related to the employees for a specific employer,was a dual employer and was vicariously liable for the employees torts.id.at.neither lejeune nor morgan abrogated the borrowed employee doctrine they simply limited its scope so that it would not apply in cases where the general employer retains control over the employee at the time of the negligent action,such that it can be characterized as a dual employer.
viewing all facts in the light most favorable to general star,the work crew was under tns control at the time of the negligent action.thus,even if allied is considered to be a general employer of the work crew,the borrowed employee doctrine applies.the dual employer doctrine does not apply because allied function was primarily that of dealing with paperwork related to the employees.given that allied was not in the business of providing tower repair services to companies,it can not be said that,as in benoit,the work crew was performing the business of allied.and since the work crew was acting under the direct supervision of tns,and allied did not have hiring or firing power,it can not be said that the work crew was under allied control.allied is easily distinguished from the temporary services agency in morgan in that allied is not in the business of loaning employees.thus,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to armco,allied,and national union on this point.
iii.indemnification of armco,allied and national union 
the district court granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of armco,allied,and national union,requiring tns and its insurers to defend and indemnify the first three for claims arising out of the negligence of the tower crew,in accordance with indemnity provisions of the csa.the district court also dismissed general star for contribution indemnity.general star appeals both decisions.
as discussed previously,we review summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard of review as the district court.
the csa contained indemnity provisions requiring that tns indemnify armco for tns acts,errors or omissions,including negligent acts and statutory violations,and requiring that armco indemnify tns for its acts,errors,or omissions.general star argues that because armco and allied contractually had significant control over the work crew,the collapse of the tower was their fault.thus,general star argues,this court should apply the texas express negligence doctrine,which establishes that indemnification for one own fault must be expressly declared in the contract.see ethyl daniel constr.under that doctrine,and assuming that was at fault,tns was not obligated to indemnify.
because we find that armco and allied were not vicariously liable for the work crew actions,in accordance with the borrowed employee doctrine,the fault for the work crew acts rests with tns.the express negligence doctrine does not apply in this context.thus,under the csa,tns was required to indemnify.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in this respect.
we also affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of national union.although national union is not covered by the indemnity provision in the csa,national union is entitled to implied indemnity from tns and its insurers.see nassif sunrise homes,so d,an implied contract of indemnity arises only where the liability of the person seeking indemnification is solely constructive or derivative and only against one who,because of his act,has caused such constructive liability to be imposed.
iv.the national union policy 
general star argues on appeal that national union should have been found liable for a proportionate share of the damages awarded to boc,because the national union policy covered employees of allied as long as they were acting within their duties.
general star did not adequately raise this issue before the district court.while it filed a demand against national union demanding contribution or additional coverage for the tower crew,general star did not substantiate this demand for example,the national union insurance policy was not even part of the record before the district court.general star also failed to move for summary judgment on this issue,and did not object to the district court failure to decide the issue prior to trial.ordinarily,this court will not review claims raised for the first time on appeal.vogel veneman,cir.there is no basis for an exception in this case,as the record below was not adequately developed on this issue.see fdic lee,cir.thus,we decline to consider general star argument that the national union policy provided coverage for the tower crew negligence.
restoration cost 
in may,the district court granted boc motion in limine to limit the evidence presented at trial to the evidence regarding the replacement cost of the new tower,with no deduction for depreciation.in november,the district court also ruled that all evidence relating to the condition of the tower was excluded as it was irrelevant,and even if it were relevant,the probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and confusion of the issues before the jury.general star appeals both rulings.
on appeal,this court reviews the ruling regarding the proper measure of damages de novo.see salve regina college russell,d holding that a district court determinations of state law are reviewed de novo on appeal sykes columbus greenville railway,cir.the district court decision to exclude the evidence for lack of relevance is reviewed for abuse of discretion.wright hartford accident indemnity company,cir.
when property is damaged through the legal fault of another,the primary objective is to restore the property as nearly as possible to the state it was in immediately preceding the damage.coleman victor,so d.thus,ordinarily courts have considered the cost of restoration as the proper measure of damage where the thing damaged can be adequately repaired.id.at citation omitted.
