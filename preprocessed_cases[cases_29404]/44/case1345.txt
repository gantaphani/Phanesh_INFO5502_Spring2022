opinion of the court 
the threshold question presented by this interlocutory appeal,b,is whether indiana or pennsylvania rules govern a suit against the united states by the estates of passengers killed in the crash of a small private aircraft.two of the decedents lived in pennsylvania,another worked in pennsylvania,the plane was hangared in pennsylvania,and the corporation that owned it was incorporated in pennsylvania.the plane crash,which occurred during a landing at a kentucky airport in inclement weather,resulted from the government publication in washington,of a chart incorrectly showing that a instrument landing approach at the airport was active and the negligence of federal air traffic controllers in relying on that chart,in neglecting to monitor the radar during the flight landing approach,and in failing to respond to the pilot radio communications.
in a multistate tort action,the federal tort claims act ftca requires a federal court to apply the whole law of the place where the acts of negligence occurred,including its rules.b,richards united states,d.in a pretrial ruling,the district court determined that because acts of negligence were committed in both indiana and the district of columbia,those jurisdictions rules were candidates to govern the case.in order to determine whether it was necessary to choose between the two,the court first had to determine whether there was a true conflict between their rules.it concluded that there was a true conflict because,unlike the district of columbia,indiana law does not recognize the doctrine of depecage,conducting separate analyses for different issues within a single theory of recovery,such as liability and damages.to determine which jurisdiction rules applied,the district court employed the methodology set forth in gould electronics,united states,cir,where we described five different approaches to conflicts.concluding that these factors on balance favored indiana,the district court utilized indiana rules to determine whether to apply indiana or pennsylvania substantive law.
turning to the question whether indiana rules would apply pennsylvania or indiana substantive law to the case no party urged the application of or kentucky substantive law,the district court first determined that there was a true conflict between the two jurisdictions damages regimes,as pennsylvania damages law urged by plaintiffs allows for more generous compensation of tort victims than indiana urged by the government.the court concluded that the indiana supreme court would choose indiana substantive law over that of pennsylvania.reasoning that the issue would likely be outcome determinative,however,the court certified the question to us under b.the papers are not entirely precise,but it is clear from their tenor that the district court decided both issues and that they have been presented by this appeal.
we are unsure about the correctness of the district court threshold a true conflict exists between indiana and rules.because the indiana supreme court has not addressed the question whether indiana courts may apply depecage,we will vacate the district court conclusion that the indiana supreme court would not permit them to do so,and certify that question to the indiana supreme court itself pursuant to rule of the indiana rules of appellate procedure in the ordinary case,that would be sufficient for now.but if the indiana supreme court holds that indiana does not recognize depecage,meaning that there is a true conflict between indiana and law,we will then be obliged to decide which jurisdiction rules to apply,and if we choose indiana,another question indiana would apply its own substantive law or pennsylvania to the case this is an extremely difficult question,and we are doubtful of the correctness of the district court resolution of the issue.evaluating the indiana test for determining which state law it would apply would seem to result in a tie between two factors,the third being largely neutral.this question too would therefore benefit from a determination by the indiana supreme court as to how it would apply the factors and break the tie.
while logically we might make the initial certification to the indiana supreme court and await its results which might or might not render it necessary for us to proceed further,we are reluctant to risk the necessity of a second certification to the indiana high court,especially in view of the fact that this case was fully ready for a trial when the district court made its b certification.
avoiding the spectre of a certification requires that we assume that indiana may decide that it does not recognize depecage,in which case there will be a true conflict between indiana and principles and this court will have to decide which applies.to do this,we must clarify our reasoning in gould electronics since that opinion did not establish a general rule.we synthesize the gould approaches into a single inquiry that chooses the rules of the jurisdiction containing the last significant negligent act or omission relevant to the ftca.since we conclude that the air traffic controllers in indiana committed the last significant act,we will apply indiana rules.as noted above,under the indiana supreme court test set forth in hubbard manufacturing,greeson,one factor is indeterminate,one favors indiana substantive law,and one favors pennsylvania substantive law.since hubbard gives no indication of how to break such a tie,we will also certify this question to the indiana supreme court.upon receipt of the answers to both certified questions,the trial court can proceed to trial with certainty as to the law.
these cases arise out of a fatal plane crash in somerset,kentucky,in january of.dennis schalliol,a pennsylvania resident,was employed as a salesman by hart national,a pennsylvania corporation with its principal place of its national real estate business in pennsylvania.kenin hart,also a pennsylvania resident,was the sole owner,chairman,and ceo of hart national.in,hart national established a subsidiary,hart delaware,whose main job it was to operate the aircraft in question.although called hart delaware,it is based in pennsylvania.hart delaware had but one employee,john fare,a new jersey resident and pilot,who was hired to fly the airplane.the airplane was hangared and operated out of the northeast philadelphia airport for the primary purpose of transporting employees of hart national from pennsylvania to related business sites.
in january of,the airplane departed from northeast philadelphia airport bound for ohio state university airport,via cincinnati,with pilot fare and passengers schalliol and hart on board.after picking up a broker,loy thompson,in cincinnati,the plane traveled to ohio state university airport in columbus and remained there overnight.the next morning,pilot fare received a weather briefing indicating that there were bad conditions at the scheduled destination of somerset,kentucky.such conditions required an instrument flight rules ifr landing.while en route to kentucky,pilot fare communicated with federal air traffic controllers at the indianapolis air route traffic control center who cleared the flight for the sdf simplified directional facility runway approach at the somerset airport.the sdf system is a group of instruments that guides a plane horizontally onto the runway.together with an altimeter,it allows a plane to land blind.as it turns out,the sdf approach had been out of service since,a fact reflected in the airport facility directory afd published by the federal aviation administration faa,although pilot fare was unaware of that condition.
the plane last radio contact with the air traffic controllers occurred when it was about miles north of the somerset airport.as it descended,weather conditions made it impossible to see the surrounding terrain.with no further contact from the air traffic controllers,pilot fare relied on the instrument approach procedure iap,a document compiled and published in washington,that lists navigable ifr approaches to various airports around the country,to guide the landing.if operational,the sdf would have guided the plane safely onto the runway,but instead the plane drifted off course and struck a guy wire from a radio communications tower approximately miles from the somerset airport.the resulting crash killed everyone on board.
the personal representatives of the decedents brought suit in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.plaintiffs amended complaint under the federal tort claims act,b,et ftca,alleged that the was negligent in publishing the iap for the sdf approach to somerset when in fact that approach had been out of service for five years at the time of the crash it further alleged that the air traffic controllers in indiana acted negligently by issuing a clearance for an approach that was out of service,failing to monitor radar scopes after clearance was given,failing to conduct proper briefings,and failing to issue a safety alert to pilot fare.
plaintiff mary schalliol,as personal representative of the estate of dennis schalliol,not only brought a claim of negligence against the united states under the ftca,but also sued the estate of pilot fare alleging his negligence and fare employer,hart division.the estate of pilot fare,through separate counsel,has also brought a of negligence against the united states.in a separate action that has been consolidated on appeal,four personal representatives of the estate of kenin hart,his three children and his mother collectively,the simon plaintiffs,have brought claims against the united states.the united states filed separate motions for determinations of the applicable choice of law in each of the cases,and each motion sought the application of indiana substantive law to the claims pled against it under the ftca.plaintiff schalliol,defendants fare and hart delaware,and the simon plaintiffs each responded separately seeking the application of pennsylvania substantive law,which is far more favorable to tort victims.
as explained supra,the district court found a true conflict between indiana and rules,so it employed the procedure set forth in gould electronics to determine which jurisdiction rules apply.gould delineates five common approaches in choosing between competing regimes,although it does not express a preference for any of the five because,under the facts of that case,one of the approaches was inapplicable and the remaining four yielded the same outcome.applying the approaches to the facts in this case,the court found the first one,when the injury can be parsed by the acts or omissions in the different states,applying the relevant state choice of law rules for each act or omission,at,inapplicable because the in a plane be parsed.it concluded that the second approach,elect ing the choice of law rules of the place of the last act or omission having a causal effect,clearly favored indiana,the location of the air traffic controllers.
the district court likewise determined that the third approach,electing the rules of the place of the last act or omission having the most significant causal effect,favored indiana because a direct nexus exists between the conduct of the controllers and the crash.the fourth approach,select ing the choice of law rules of the state in which physical acts could have prevented the injury,id.at,was found to be indeterminate because just as the air traffic controllers in indiana could have given different instructions,the federal employees in could have published an accurate iap.finally,the fifth approach,choosing based on where the relevant act or omission occurred,was found to be indeterminate because there were two independent acts of negligence,each of which could have been fatal in its own right.in sum,the district court concluded that of the five gould approaches,one was inapplicable,two favored indiana,and two were indeterminate,so it applied indiana rules to choose between indiana and pennsylvania substantive law 
indiana employs a modified lex loci delicti test,which applies the substantive law of the jurisdiction where the tort was committed.hubbard,at.generally,in indiana wrongful death or injury cases,the place where the death occurred is the site of the tort commission or of the last event necessary,see,lambert yellowbird,which in this case is kentucky,the site of the crash and resulting deaths.as the district court explained,however,the indiana inquiry does not end here 
in those instances where the place of the tort bears little connection to the legal action,this court will permit the consideration of other factors such as the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred the residence or place of business of the parties and the place where the relationship is centered.these factors should be evaluated according to their relative importance to the particular issues being litigated.
hubbard,at quoting restatement second of conflicts of laws.
the district court concluded that kentucky has little connection to the legal action concerning the ftca claims against the united states air traffic controllers and chart publishers,so it turned to the three supplemental hubbard factors.it found that the first,the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred,favored indiana because although negligence also occurred in,the conduct most directly affecting the plane landing clearly occurred in indiana.for example,the indiana controllers were the only actors with direct contact with and control over the pilot and plane.
as to the second hubbard factor,the residence or place of business of the parties,they are plaintiff schalliol,pennsylvania three of the four simon plaintiffs and passenger hart,new york fourth simon plaintiff,delaware defendant fare and defendant hart delaware,and,with respect to the defendant united states,all states or no state the district court concluded that this factor favored no state,so it apparently gave that factor relatively little weight.finally,the district court concluded that the third hubbard factor,the place where the relationship is centered,could likewise point to any of several locations since none of the parties was ever located in the same state as any adverse party.
based on these three factors,the district court concluded that indiana bears the edge as the jurisdiction with the most significant contacts to the negligence claims against the united states.however,the district court recognized that such a decision would effectively dictate the case outcome,which is essentially a question of is hard to envision a successful defense to the government liability.because the issues are so critical,the court certified them for our immediate review pursuant to b,which requires that the issue involve a controlling question of law as to which there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal of the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.this being a clear case for b certification,we accepted it and,under rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure,requested briefing and heard oral argument.
the district court had diversity jurisdiction over the simon and schalliol suits pursuant to.it had jurisdiction over fare against the united states by virtue of the federal tort claims act,b and et.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to b.because is a purely legal determination,our review is plenary.
the federal tort claims act waives sovereign immunity against persons suing the federal government for commission of various torts.in a tort action,it requires a federal court to apply the law of the place where the acts of negligence occurred.b.the supreme court,however,has expressly rejected the argument that the law of the place of injury should apply where negligence occurs in one state and results in injury or death in another.richards,at.richards dictates that either indiana or rules must apply,for those are the two places where government negligence allegedly air traffic controllers were based in indiana,and the faulty iap was published in although each of the key questions will be certified,for the benefit of the indiana supreme court and the parties,it is important that we lay out the factual and legal background reasoning that animates our decision.
in choosing between indiana and regimes,we must first determine whether there exists a true conflict between them.gould,at.the parties disagree as to whether indiana and rules differ in any material respect.indiana choice of law utilizes a modified lex loci delicti test.hubbard,at.it begins with the presumption that the substantive law of the place where the tort was committed governs the case.id.however,if the place of the tort bears little connection to the legal action,indiana follows the most significant relationship test detailed in the restatement second conflicts of laws.id.at.the parties agree that kentucky,the location of the tort,has little connection to the litigation since the plane merely crashed there.therefore,in this case indiana law defaults to the most significant relationship test,in which it considers three factors the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred the residence and place of incorporation and place of business of the parties and the place where the parties relationship is centered.
in comparison,implements a hybrid of the governmental interest and restatement second methodologies that identifies the governmental policies underlying the applicable laws and determines which state policy would be most advanced by having its laws applied to the facts of the case.raflo united states,d.the stronger state interest is found by examining the place where the injury occurred the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred the domicile,residence,place of incorporation and place of business of the parties and the place where the relationship is centered.id.at.although analysis also takes into account government policies,plaintiffs contend that the factors considers do not differ meaningfully from those indiana considers,and therefore that there is merely a false conflict between and indiana law.
the united states disagrees,asserting that a true conflict exists.it points out that indiana did not adopt the policy component of of the second restatement.see,hubbard,at declining to balance competing interests of states by identifying policies underlying their differing laws in re,tires prods.liab,d,noting that interests of each state are not determinative or generally even considered by indiana courts.it notes that academic commentators agree that indiana eschews such policy considerations.see,symeon symeonides,the judicial acceptance of the second conflicts restatement a mixed blessing,indiana approach differs from section of the restatement second in that it calls for a consideration of the factual contacts alone,rather than a set of policies in light of the factual contacts as does the restatement second.emphasis added.plaintiffs,however,assert that indiana courts do consider state policies in their analysis.see,in re the estate of bruck,holding on the specific point at issue that,although indiana law would otherwise apply,only under ohio law can the distribution fulfill the essential purpose of the damages,which is to benefit the immediate survivors regardless of dependency.
it is of course possible that even if considers policy while indiana does not,the two schemes would present a false conflict because they would ultimately select the same state substantive law.but,the united states argues,the conflict in regimes goes deeper than mere consideration of policy,for rules recognize the concept of depecage while indiana do not.depecage is the process whereby different issues in a single case arising out of a single set of facts are decided according to the laws of different states.broome antlers hunting club,cir.in the case at bar,depecage would enable a court to apply one state laws to assess liability and another to assess damages.it is clear that rules permit depecage,see,stutsman kaiser foundation health plan of the states,so a critical question for true conflict purposes is whether indiana do as well.
plaintiffs identify several indiana decisions that allegedly employ depecage,including allen great american reserve ins,in analyzing each of the counts of the plaintiffs complaint,it is first necessary to determine which state law applies to that count.the answer may differ for different counts and may differ between defendants as to a single count.cap gemini america,judd,undertaking separate analyses on liability and damages estate of sullivan united states.applying arizona law to the medical malpractice action and indiana law to the wrongful death claim.none of these cases,however,establishes that indiana law embraces depecage.allen was a routine application of different analyses to different counts,as opposed to different issues within a single count.cap gemini conducted a analysis for damages purposes,but there were actually two distinct claims at stake in that case,the second of which involved only a question of liability and damages issues involved different theories of recovery.finally,although estate of sullivan did employ depecage,the indiana court in that case was applying arizona rules,not indiana.
viewing indiana caselaw as a whole,the closest an indiana court has come to employing depecage is in in re the estate of bruck.there the court said in dictum that,if it had found a true conflict,it would have applied a new york decision stating that the recovery and distribution aspects of wrongful death cases may be separated when questions arise.id.at.but as the district court correctly noted,bruck dictum is not very valuable here,especially since no indiana case has explicitly employed depecage and the dictum itself is from an intermediate appellate court.
plaintiffs offer one slightly different rationale in favor of depecage that many indiana cases adopt of the restatement,which in turn incorporates the general criteria of of the restatement.see hubbard,at.because endorses depecage,plaintiffs submit that depecage has been incorporated indirectly into indiana law.however,given the possibility that indiana has adopted only part of the restatement,we are unwilling to conclude that indiana has embraced depecage based only on such roundabout reasoning.
in sum,we find no evidence that indiana courts employ the concept of depecage,and absent depecage it is clear that there is a true conflict between indiana and rules.we nevertheless note that the indiana supreme court has not definitively resolved the matter,and we believe that a question of such importance is best left to that court authoritative disposition.we will therefore certify the issue to the indiana supreme court pursuant to rule of the indiana rules of appellate procedure.
in a multistate tort action,the ftca requires a federal court to apply the law of the place where the acts of negligence occurred.b,richards,at.we must therefore apply either indiana or rules,but we need only choose between them if they conflict.for the reasons outlined above,we will assume arguendo that indiana does not embrace the concept of depecage,and therefore that a true conflict exists.in gould,at,we addressed the matter of how to resolve such a conflict.our opinion surveyed the caselaw and literature on the subject and identified five common approaches applying different rules to different theories of liability choosing the place of the last act or omission determining which asserted act of wrongdoing had the most significant effect on the injury choosing the state in which the united states physical actions could have prevented injury and determining where the relevant act or omission occurred.under gould facts,however,the first approach was inapplicable and the final four pointed toward the same state,so we declined to adopt any one approach.
the case at bar is much closer,and the approaches yield conflicting results.the parties agree that the first approach,applying different rules to different theories of liability,is inapplicable because there is only one theory of.the second approach,choosing the place of the last act or omission,seems clearly to favor indiana.although it is true that the iap published in incorrectly depicted as operational an sdf approach that had been out of service for five years,plaintiffs stipulation of facts,the air traffic controllers negligence p
