northfield insurance northfield seeks reversal of the district court final judgment that declared northfield had a duty to defend loving home care,lhc and sheila and ronnie daniels the daniels under the commercial professional liability cpl part of the insurance policy issued to lhc by northfield,in the underlying tort suit by william and catherine barrows the barrows against lhc and the daniels.the barrows,arguing this court has no jurisdiction to review the district court decision not to determine northfield duty to indemnify lhc and the daniels at this time,and if there is jurisdiction,that such duty is properly nonjusticiable at this time.because we find the district court properly concluded northfield owed lhc and the daniels a duty to defend in the underlying tort suit filed against them by the barrows,and that northfield duty to indemnify lhc and the daniels is presently nonjusticiable,we affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
this appeal stems from a dispute about the duty of an insurer to defend its insured in an underlying negligence suit in texas state court.the daniels ran lhc,a business that provided nannies for child care.celia giral giral was employed by lhc and worked as a nanny for the barrows.on october,giral was caring for the barrows baby daughter,bianca,when bianca was fatally injured.bianca died at the hospital on the evening of october.the harris county coroner ruled bianca death a homicide,as the autopsy findings noted that bianca injuries included multiple skull fractures,brain hemorrhages,and blood behind the eyes.the cause of death listed was injuries due to blunt force trauma of the head.on may,a texas state court jury found giral guilty of felony injury to a child in the death of bianca barrows giral was sentenced to seven years in prison.
the barrows filed the underlying suit against several parties,including lhc and the daniels.the barrows petition,their live petition,stated in part 
on october,bianca died at the age of months.bianca fatal injuries were proximately caused by the negligence of celia giral,a nanny from defendant loving home care.giral negligently dropped bianca,negligently shook bianca,causing severe head injuries that resulted in the infant death.in the alternative,plaintiffs would show that giral was reckless criminally negligent as defined by texas penal code.
on september,cathy barrows had signed a service agreement,under which barrows agreed to pay per week to loving home care for celia giral,a class a caregiver.this service agreement stated,all care providers shall be employees of loving home care and will at all times remain subject to the supervision of loving home care.incorporation by reference omitted.
celia giral was the nanny provided by loving home care,to care for bianca.loving home care,entered a written employment agreement with celia giral dated september.incorporation by reference omitted 
on wednesday,september,celia giral began working for the barrows,caring for their infant bianca.on monday,october,barrows left bianca with giral and drove to work.when barrows left bianca with giral,bianca was awake,active,smiling,and giggling.barrows arrived at work at approximately.at approximately,barrows received a telephone call from giral.giral told barrows that she had to call because bianca would not wake up.a paramedic then got on the phone and told barrows that giral claimed to have fallen while carrying the baby.the paramedic told barrows that they were going to take bianca to hermann hospital.
the occurrence,proximately caused by the negligence of defendants,caused severe bodily injury to bianca,that resulted in her death.at the hospital emergency room,bianca was examined by doctors who discovered bianca skull was fractured,her brain was hemorrhaging,and she had blood behind her eyes.giral claimed to investigators that she had accidently dropped the infant,then shook her in an attempt to revive her.giral therefore admitted conduct that failed to meet the standard of care of an ordinarily prudent person acting under the same or similar circumstances,which therefore constituted negligence,and was the proximate cause of the occurrence and bianca bodily injury and death.
the barrows had amended their petition to remove all allegations relating to giral criminal conviction and the intentional nature of her behavior.at the time of bianca death,lhc was covered by a insurance policy including both commercial general liability,cgl,and cpl coverage issued by northfield.under the terms of the policy,lhc and the daniels requested defense and indemnification from northfield in the underlying action.
northfield defended under a reservation of rights,filing a declaratory judgment action in district court against lhc,the daniels,and others.in the course of the declaratory judgment action,northfield argued that it was not obligated to defend or indemnify lhc and the daniels in the underlying action because of various exclusions in the policy.in particular,in northfield motion for summary judgment,it argued it had no duty to defend or indemnify lhc and the daniels under the cgl part of the policy because the designated professional services exclusion barred coverage for damages due to the rendering or failure to render any professional service.northfield also argued that it had no duty to defend or indemnify lhc and the daniels under the cpl part of the policy,which provided coverage for damages because of a negligent act,error or omission in the rendering of or failure to render professional services,because of two exclusions relating to criminal acts and abuse.the criminal acts exclusion stated that coverage would not apply to a ny damages arising out of any dishonest,fraudulent,criminal or malicious act or omission of any insured or employee.the abuse exclusion stated that coverage would not apply to any damages arising out of the following 
the actual,alleged,or threatened physical abuse,sexual abuse or molestation by anyone.
the investigation,hiring,training,placement,supervision,or retention of anyone who engages or has engaged in physical abuse,sexual abuse or molestation.this endorsement applies whether damages arise from an act or failure to act.
the reporting of or failure to report to authorities any physical abuse,sexual abuse,or molestation.
the district court initially granted northfield motion for summary judgment in its entirety,ruling that the professional services exclusion applied so as to preclude coverage under both parts of the policy.lhc,the daniels,and the barrows then filed motions for reconsideration of the summary judgment,pointing out that the professional services exclusion only applied to the cgl part of the policy.the district court recognized its error and granted the motions for reconsideration as to the cpl part of the policy but affirmed its ruling as to northfield having no duties under the cgl part.the district court ultimately determined that the criminal acts and abuse exclusions did not apply so as to preclude coverage and a duty to defend under the cpl part.the court entered its declaratory judgment on october,which ordered that northfield has a duty to defend lhc and the daniels.the barrows then filed a motion to amend the judgment,requesting the district court delete the phrase this is a final judgment because the issue was still before the court.the district court denied the motion and dismissed the issue without prejudice.northfield timely appealed,and the barrows.

the texas supreme court recently restated in king that 
an insurer duty to defend is determined solely by the allegations in the pleadings and the language of the insurance policy.this is the eight corners or complaint allegation rule.if a petition does not allege facts within the scope of coverage,an insurer is not legally required to defend a suit against its insured.but we resolve all doubts regarding the duty to defend in favor of the duty.

after the insured meets his burden to show that the alleged facts in the petition state a potential claim against him,to defeat the duty to defend,the insurer bears the burden of showing that the plain language of a policy exclusion or limitation allows the insurer to avoid coverage of all claims,also within the confines of the eight corners rule.see.ann.b vernon supp calderon ins.of,wl,at,pet.denied not designated for publication citing chipping hanover ins,no pet.butler binion hartford lloyd ins,dist,writ denied.

whether there is an exception to the strict eight corners rule in texas.
the texas supreme court has never recognized any exception to the strict eight corners rule that would allow courts to examine extrinsic evidence when determining an insurer duty to defend.landmark chevrolet universal underwriters ins,dist,pet.filed.however,as the district court in westport insurance atchley,russell,waldrop hlavinka,d,extensively examined,certain texas appellate courts,this court,and district courts in this circuit have appeared to recognize a narrow exception the most recent texas appellate court case to apply an exception to the eight corners rule is state farm fire casualty wade,christi,writ denied,which was decided in.there,an appeals court found that in the absence of any factual allegation concerning how the boat which was the subject of the policy was used,because the court could not determine whether or not the personal boat owner private liability policy possibly provided coverage even by reading the underlying petition broadly,extrinsic evidence could be considered.id.at.the court found that how the boat in question was used at the time of the the use was commercial or an essential fact of coverage that did not question the truth or falsity of any facts alleged in the underlying petition.id.
however,in making an erie guess about what the current texas supreme court would say about the existence and application of such an exception,the court in westport noted that no texas appellate decision has ever both cited and applied this wade line of cases.d at e ven the court that announced the decision on which the wade line of cases depends has retreated see also contractors,hartford underwriters ins,dist,pet.denied applying the strict eight corners approach to reverse the trial court use of extrinsic evidence and noting how no other texas appellate court has ever applied wade.
in,the appellate court declined to follow wade and refused to consider extrinsic evidence,even though the petition did not contain sufficient facts to determine the application of a worker compensation exclusion,which indisputably would have applied to bar the duties to defend and indemnify if such evidence had been considered.at.the court found the petition did allege facts regarding the negligence of the insured sufficient to state a potentially covered cause of action.id.at.the court also concluded that the issue of whether an injured employee of the insured collected worker compensation benefits went to the merits of his lawsuit extrinsic evidence could not be considered even if the court were to craft an exception to the general rule.id.most recently in december,in light of the consideration and rejection of any exception to the strict eight corners rule by the texas appellate court in,the appeals court in landmark chevrolet again declined to apply any exception to supplement insufficient pleadings that,even given a liberal interpretation,did not state even a possibly covered claim.at.
the westport court thus came to the conclusion that only in very limited circumstances is extrinsic evidence admissible in deciding the duty to fundamental policy coverage questions can be resolved by readily determined facts that do not engage the truth or falsity of the allegations in the underlying petition,or overlap with the merits of the underlying suit.d at quotations and citation omitted.fundamental coverage issues have been defined to include whether the person sued has been specifically excluded by name or description from any coverage,whether the property in suit is included in or has been expressly excluded from any coverage,and whether the policy exists.see also calderon,wl,at,at.
as mentioned above,this court has previously relied on the wade line of texas appellate cases to recognize a narrow exception to texas strict eight corners rule.for example,in western heritage,we determined that extrinsic evidence could be used in an insurance dispute where the underlying amended petition did not allege or provide any factual explanation for how the restaurant patron involved had arrived at such an impaired state that he could not operate a vehicle.at.there,because the facts alleged were not specific enough,even interpreted in the light most favorable to the insured,to possibly bring the claim within the negligence coverage of the policy,which specifically excluded damages stemming from the sale of alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person,extrinsic evidence was allowed to determine the insured duty to defend.id.likewise,in john deere insurance truckin,cir,we determined that extrinsic evidence could be considered in an insurance dispute where the underlying petition only alleged that the tractor trailer rig involved in an accident had been furnished to the defendants or that defendants had a working relationship with the insured trucking company.there,because the facts alleged were insufficient,even if taken as true,to state a cause of action under the policy,extrinsic evidence was allowed to show whether the rig was a covered auto such that insurer had a duty to defend.id.
in light of the texas appellate courts unwavering unwillingness to apply and recent repudiations of the wade type of exception,this court makes its erie guess that the current texas supreme court would not recognize any exception to the strict eight corners rule.that is,if the four corners of the petition allege facts stating a cause of action which potentially falls within the four corners of the policy scope of coverage,resolving all doubts in favor of the insured,the insurer has a duty to defend.if all the facts alleged in the underlying petition fall outside the scope of coverage,then there is no duty to defend.however,in the unlikely situation that the texas supreme court were to recognize an exception to the strict eight corners rule,we conclude any exception would only apply in very limited circumstances when it is initially impossible to discern whether coverage is potentially implicated and when the extrinsic evidence goes solely to a fundamental issue of coverage which does not overlap with the merits of or engage the truth or falsity of any facts alleged in the underlying case 
whether the district court erred in determining that northfield had a duty to defend lhc and the daniels in the underlying tort suit.
on appeal,northfield only challenges the district court refusal to look to extrinsic evidence to determine whether bianca barrows death resulted from a criminal act by celia giral or arose from physical abuse by giral northfield points to the barrows petition and labels all the factual as the negligent dropping shaking of bianca by giral and the negligent hiring,training,and supervising of giral by legal theories that do not determine the duty to defend.thus,northfield asserts that texas law allows courts to consider extrinsic evidence when the petition in the underlying suit does not allege facts sufficient to enable the court to determine whether the criminal acts and physical exclusions apply.northfield relies on three cases for this proposition guaranty national,at applying western heritage john deere,at applying wade and matagorda ventures,travelers lloyds insurance,d,citing but not applying wade.northfield thus argues that giral criminal conviction and the autopsy report on bianca injuries establish as a matter of law that all the damages suffered by the barrows arise from a criminal act physical abuse thus,no duty to defend or to indemnify lhc and the daniels can be imposed on northfield.
northfield maintains that although the general rule under texas law is that where the complaint does not allege facts sufficient to bring it clearly within the scope of coverage,the insurer is obligated to defend if there is potentially a case falling within coverage,the exception applies when the petition labels conduct as negligent,where the true nature of the conduct has been found criminal.northfield relies on a north dakota supreme court case,ohio casualty insurance clark,which held that an insurer had no duty to defend based on extrinsic evidence of criminal conviction that established that intentional injury exclusion applied,even where the underlying petition alleged negligence 
northfield also contends that texas law under the wade line of cases permits exceptions to the eight corners rule,such as in western heritage.there,the district court concluded that based on extrinsic evidence establishing that a liquor liability exclusion applied,there was no duty to defend the insured restaurant,even where all references to alcohol and intoxication had been deleted in the amended complaint.at,in essence,northfield argues the barrows are perpetuating a fraud upon the court by artfully pleading facts to bring excluded claims within coverage courts can look to extrinsic evidence when the petition omits or misrepresents material facts that clearly would have excluded coverage,such as the barrows have done here.finally,northfield argues that the fundamental coverage caveat to the eight corners exception is either wrong,or is not limited to the three definitions laid out in case law.that is,if the caveat applies,the question of the application of the criminal acts and physical abuse exclusions is one of fundamental coverage.
the barrows,lhc,and the daniels argue that because this is a inquiry only,the district court properly applied texas law,which is clear that extrinsic evidence is not to be considered under any exception.the barrows petition clearly alleged negligent dropping shaking behavior by giral toward bianca,not intentional acts of physical abuse and these facts,if properly assumed to be true,unambiguously stated at least one negligence claim facially within the policy coverage.see lafarge hartford cas.ins,cir,overruled on other grounds by grapevine excavation,maryland lloyds,noting that the complaint as amended to include facts alleging negligence was clearly not a case where it was impossible to discern whether coverage was potentially indicated.the barrows,lhc,and the daniels contend that any uncertainties as to whether allegations in a petition state a covered cause are to be resolved in favor of the insured.see,at.in,the texas appeals court refused to consider extrinsic evidence,even though the petition did not contain sufficient facts to determine the application of a worker compensation exclusion,where the employee underlying petition alleged facts indicating negligence potentially covered by the employer liability policy.id.at.likewise,here,without such extrinsic evidence,northfield can not and did not demonstrate that any exclusion applied to all the barrows claims against lhc and the daniels.
the barrows,lhc,and the daniels assert that even if an exception to the eight corners rule does exist,it does not apply here because the barrows petition properly alleged facts sufficient,if taken as true,to potentially state at least one cause of action falling within the policy namely,negligence on the part of giral in dropping shaking bianca.this is a separate,alternative allegation from that claiming giral behavior was criminally negligent under texas penal code section.likewise,the allegation of giral negligent behavior,criminal or not,does not constitute the kind of culpable mental state to which the physical abuse exclusion would apply.this is clearly what the district court found,and what northfield did and does not contest the barrows petition alleged facts sufficient to state a claim of negligence potentially falling within northfield policy with lhc.
the barrows attack the cases relied on by northfield for its proposition that extrinsic evidence may be considered when a petition does not state sufficient facts to determine the applicability of an exclusion.guaranty national did not address this issue because in that case there was no doubt a pollution exclusion applied extrinsic evidence was necessary because sufficient facts were not alleged to meet the insured burden of showing a sudden and accidental exception to the exclusion applied.at.the barrows case is distinguished because lhc has already carried its initial burden of showing that the claims against it fall potentially within the scope of coverage,and northfield has failed to meet its burden of showing an exclusion plainly applied to exclude all the barrows claims.the barrows also argue against any exception applying here to use extrinsic evidence to trigger an exclusion because such evidence would not pertain only to coverage,but to liability as well,gonzales american states insurance,christi,no writ,and because such evidence would tend to contradict allegations pertaining to giral neglectful dropping shaking behavior in the barrows petition,id.at.
the barrows emphasize that the wade rationale applied by western heritage has never been followed by other texas courts and should be rejected.and even if such limited exception exists,it does not apply here because
