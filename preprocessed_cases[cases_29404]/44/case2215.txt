this is an appeal from a judgment entered on a jury verdict for the plaintiff,rodger nelson smith smith,in a products liability action against louisville ladder louisville.following a four day trial,the jury found in favor of smith,and,after taking smith contributory negligence into account,awarded smith.we conclude that the record evidence does not support any of smith theories of recovery.we therefore reverse and render judgment for louisville.
rodger smith worked as a technician for longview cable company longview,which provided cable television service in the longview,texas area.at the time of his accident in april,smith had been employed by longview for approximately one and years.longview purchased the extension ladder and hook assembly in use at the time of smith accident from louisville.
on the day of smith injury,he was assigned a routine repair job that required him to rest the ladder against a cable strand located some twenty feet off the ground.smith placed the cable line inside the hooks that extended from the top of the ladder and rested the ladder against the cable.the base of the ladder was on the ground approximately five feet from a utility pole to which the overhead cable was attached.because of its weight,the cable sloped down slightly as it moved from the pole.
smith climbed the ladder without securing the ladder to the pole or any other stationary object.smith plan was to secure himself to the ladder with his safety belt when he reached the top of the ladder and then use a hand line to attach the ladder to the utility pole.after smith climbed to the top of the ladder,he reached for his safety belt and his weight shifted,causing the ladder to slide to his left down the natural slope of the cable.the ladder slid sideways for some distance with smith hanging onto the ladder.when the ladder reached a position at or near the low point of the line between the two utility poles to which it was attached,one of the hooks came off the line,and the ladder twisted and came to an abrupt halt.unable to maintain his grip on the ladder,smith fell to the ground and was seriously injured.
lateral slides of ladders along cables were well recognized risks in the telecommunications industry,and smith,himself,had experienced several of these slides during his employment with longview.however,in the earlier slides smith had attached his safety belt to the ladder before the slide began and because he did not fall from the ladder he suffered no injury.
smith product liability suit against louisville sought recovery on three theories defective design,failure to warn,and breach of implied warranty of merchantability.following trial,the jury found in favor of smith on all three theories and after taking smith contributory negligence into account,awarded smith.the district court entered judgment on the verdict and denied smith motions.this appeal followed 
design defect 
smith focused most of his time and attention at trial on his theory that the louisville extension ladder with hook assembly was defective because of the hook ability to come off the cable during a slide.smith expert,packman,testified that when the hook disengaged from the cable near the end of smith slide,the ladder to which smith was clinging twisted more violently than it would had the hook remained attached to the cable and he concluded that this additional twist contributed to smith fall.packman introduced the concept of a simple latching device that,when engaged,would close the opening in the hook,encircle the cable and prevent the hook from disengaging from the strand.under packman concept,the latch remains disengaged until the hook is placed over the cable and the ladder is resting on the cable.the operator,from his position on the ground,would then remotely activate a spring loaded latch by pulling a line running from the latch to the bottom of the ladder.once the latch was engaged,the hook would no longer be open and in the event of a slide,the hook could not disengage from the cable.
louisville ladder argues that smith did not establish that the hook with packman latch was a safer alternative design within the meaning of the texas statute.to establish a design defect,section of the texas civil practice and remedies code requires a claimant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that l there was a safer alternative design and the defect was a producing cause of the personal injury property damage or death for which the claimant seeks recovery.subsection b states 
b in this section,safer alternative design means a product design other than the one actually used that in reasonable probability 
would have prevented or significantly reduced the risk of the claimant personal injury,property damage,or death without substantially impairing the product utility and 
was economically and technologically feasible at the time the product left the control of the manufacturer or seller by the application of existing or reasonably achievable scientific knowledge.
we found only one texas case discussing the proof necessary to establish a safer alternative design under this statute.in general motors sanchez,the plaintiff expert testified that his alternative design of the general motors transmission would prevent internal forces in the transmission from moving the gear selector toward reverse rather than park when the driver inadvertently leaves the lever in a position between reverse and park.according to plaintiff expert,his proposed design change would eliminate this spontaneous movement of the time.the court held that this testimony was sufficient to allow the jury to conclude that plaintiff had established a safer alternative design.id.at.
in our case,smith completely relies on packman evidence and testimony to establish a safer alternate design.packman testified that his spring loaded latch,by preventing the hook from disengaging from the cable,would make the jolt at the end of the slide less violent,and,therefore,the worker would have a better chance of hanging onto the ladder.he conducted videotaped experiments for the purpose of establishing this fact.in the first experiment,he placed a weight on a ladder with hooks like those found on the louisville ladder and then precipitated a slide to demonstrate the jerk that would occur when one of the hooks disengaged from the strand.for the second experiment,packman videotaped a slide involving hooks that encircled the cable this experiment demonstrated a less violent jerk at the end of the slide.
the only conclusion packman was able to reach was that his alternative design would result in a less violent jerk on the ladder at the end of the slide.unlike the expert who testified in general motors,packman was unable to quantify this reduction in force and was unable to say that smith or another worker could stay on the ladder in a slide where the hook was prevented from disengaging from the cable.the most packman could say was that his design alteration would diminish the possibility of the worker falling off because there was some reduction in the jerk.
furthermore,packman concept of the latching device to close the open end of the hook around the cable was a preliminary concept.at the time of trial he admitted that he had considered several possible ways a man on the ground or some distance up the ladder could operate the latch mechanism but had not settled on any particular method.he agreed that his design was preliminary and that he was not ready to recommend it to a manufacturer.in addition,packman conceded that a person climbing the ladder would find his proposed mechanism somewhat awkward and that using the mechanism could cause the ladder to get out of balance and slide.he was also questioned about a concern that the line to operate the latch mechanism running the length of the ladder has the potential of being a hazard to the person climbing the ladder.packman agreed that he never evaluated the risks associated with his proposed alternate design due in part to the fact that it was never completed.packman also conceded that he did not purport to conduct a analysis of his proposed redesign.
in addition to the texas supreme court interpretation of the statute in general motors,we look to decisions of this court considering whether such proof was adequate to satisfy a similar statutory burden imposed by louisiana.in lawrence general motors,cir,we considered whether the evidence was sufficient to satisfy a very similar louisiana statute and concluded that a declaration by the plaintiff expert that a proposed alternative design could have prevented the plaintiff accident was insufficient to establish the statutory requirement.we stated that this expert failed to elaborate on the actual likelihood of avoiding the probable damage through an alternative design,address the burdens or adverse utility effects of his proposed changes,or counter the defendant claim that these alterations would not have been compatible with the product in its current form.id.at.as a result,we held that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support a finding of design defect.id.see also,watkins telsmith,cir statute.
after careful review of the record,we conclude that no reasonable jury could have found from the evidence that the latching device packman proposed adding to the hook assembly was a safer alternative design as defined by the texas statute packman conceded that his proposed alternate design would not assist in preventing the hook from sliding on the cable.he also agreed that the only benefit a worker would derive from the alternate design was a reduced jerk at the end of the slide.he was therefore unable to say that his alternate design would have prevented smith fall.therefore,we conclude that the evidence fails to establish that the alternative design would have significantly reduced the risk of smith injury.
furthermore,packman conceded that he made no analysis including what additional hazards would be created in implementing his proposed alternative design.thus,packman testimony does not establish that his proposed design would not have substantially impaired the ladder utility.the jury finding of design defect,therefore,can not stand 
breach of implied warranty 
louisville ladder argues that smith breach of implied warranty claim fails for the same reason as his design defect claim smith failed to produce sufficient evidence that a safer alternative design of the extension ladder with cable hook accessory exists.as the above discussion reflects,our review of the record leads us to conclude that smith failed to establish a safer alternate design to the louisville ladder involved in this accident.texas civil practice remedies code,which requires a claimant to prove a safer alternative design,applies to all products liability actions whether brought as strict liability,as breach of implied warranty,or a combination of those theories.see.civ.practice remedies code.
the texas supreme court made this point clear in hyundai motor rodriguez.in that case,the plaintiff was injured in a crash of a hyundai.she sued on a theory that the vehicle was not and was defective for that reason.the trial court submitted the plaintiff negligence and design defect theories to the jury,but refused to submit the plaintiff breach of warranty theory on grounds that this was duplicative of the design defect theory.
although this case was tried before,the year was adopted,the court held that even under the law,the issues regarding the existence of design defect and breach of warranty were identical.consequently,the supreme court of texas concluded that the trial court had properly declined to submit the breach of warranty claim to the jury.
with respect to claims under,the court stated for cases tried since the effective date of chapter of the civil practice and remedies code,the findings required to establish a design defect claim are identical,regardless of the legal theory asserted.hyundai motor,at.civ.practice remedies code.
in sum,because smith failed to establish a safer alternative design for the ladder in use at the time of the accident,his claim predicated on breach of implied warranty must fail,along with his design defect claim.
louisville challenges the jury finding of marketing defect on the ground that it had no duty to warn of the risk of lateral cable slides and specific precautions to prevent such slides beyond the statements it provided on its ladder.the warning label on its ladder directed users to s ecure top and bottom of the ladder from movement where possible and that serious personal injuries could result from failure to follow instructions.louisville states that the ladder was marketed to users in the telecommunications industry who possessed special knowledge of slide hazards and expertise in stabilizing the ladder to avoid this hazard.
smith does not dispute that louisville ladders are marketed solely to the telecommunications industry,that he works in that industry,or that his profession has knowledge of the hazards of lateral cable slides.he argues that,nevertheless,the jury was entitled to find that workers in his industry do not have expertise relative to how these ladders can be secured to avoid the sliding during initial ladder ascent that is,before the worker reaches the strand and ties the ladder to the strand or to an adjacent utility pole.furthermore,smith asserts that louisville warnings were vague and failed to provide an answer to this problem.
even a product that is safely designed and manufactured may be unreasonably dangerous as marketed because of a lack of adequate warnings or instructions however,under texas law,there is no duty to warn when the risks associated with a particular product are matters within the ordinary knowledge common to the community,and a supplier may rely on the professional expertise of the user in tailoring its warning moreover,while industry knowledge is an objective inquiry it is a question of fact to be resolved by the jury in cases involving conflicting evidence on the issue 
the jury in this case was charged with determining whether louisville ladder warnings were adequate in light of the telecommunications industry knowledge of lateral cable slides and available techniques for avoiding such slides.smith does not dispute industry knowledge that such slides are a common hazard thus,the question narrows to whether the jury was entitled to find that the telecommunications industry was unaware of procedures to avoid this hazard during a user initial ascent of a cable extension ladder.we therefore turn to the record to assess whether,based on the evidence presented at trial,a reasonable jury could have found inadequate industry knowledge of this hazard and the appropriate precaution to avoid it.
louisville introduced extensive evidence bearing on industry expertise on this hazard the longview cable tv safety manual longview safety manual the society of cable television engineer health and safety manual book iii field and plant safety society safety manual two industry videotapes on ladder safety and the company standard,bell system practices manual for the use of extension ladders and attachments ladder manual.taken together,these documents and videos provide such compelling proof that smith industry had common knowledge of adequate stabilization techniques that no reasonable fact finder could have found to the contrary.
first,longview own safety manual has a section concerning ladder placement,which stresses the importance of proper positioning and indicates that it may be necessary to secur e the ladder with a rope during placement second,relevant portions of the society safety manual emphasize that n umerous accidents may occur each year due to the improper use of ladders,and,thus,employees are expected to use ladders carefully and deliberately,paying close attention to their own safety as well as the safety of others and w hen used on a strand,extension ladders should be securely lashed to the strand,or guarded by an employee at the bottom of the ladder.third,the two industry safety videos repeatedly underscore the importance of establishing appropriate ladder stability during positioning and illustrate numerous possible stabilization techniques that would have been applicable to smith accident for example,in ladder safety,the more cursory of the two videos,the narrator states that when placing ladders,users should make sure that they wo slip lash them if necessary,or get someone else to hold them during use furthermore,extension ladder training course,the more lengthy and thorough videotape,extensively deals with using hook extension ladders against cable strands and instructs operators to secure the ladder to the strand with the hooks alone only if the job does not require pushing,pulling,or excessive strain.otherwise,the video directs users to raise the ladder two or three rungs above the strand before climbing moreover,in a broader discussion of general ladder placement on slippery surfaces,this tape explains that ladders can be prevented from sliding by tying the base of the ladder to a stable structure or hav ing someone foot the ladder.finally,the manual strongly illustrates the prevalence of ladder stabilization techniques by cautioning operators to always remember to first make the ladder secure instructing them to make certain the ladder is placed on firm and level footing to prevent the ladder from twisting or sliding along the strand indicating that l adder strand hooks shall be used on lashed,and cable when the ladder is not lashed to the strand and most significantly providing the following explanation of how to prevent cable extension ladder slides 
when using a ladder on a strand having a fairly steep slope,secure the ladder with rope to prevent the top of the ladder from sliding along the strand.before raising the ladder,throw or place a handline over the strand and secure one end of the handline to the second rung from the top of the fly section.after placing the ladder on the strand,pull the other end of the handline taut and secure it to an adequate support on the uphill side of the ladder,such as a pole,tree,or digging bar firmly anchored in the ground.if no such anchorage is obtainable,secure the ladder to the cable strand by throwing the handline over the strand again,so the rope passes twice around the cable strand.then tie the rope securely to a rung on the base section of the ladder 
the overwhelming evidence of industry knowledge of the dangers of extension ladders sliding on a strand,leads us to question whether louisville was obliged to give any warning of this hazard.we need not decide whether a warning was required because louisville supplied a warning that was plainly adequate when considered in light of industry knowledge of this danger and how to avoid it.we conclude,therefore,that smith did not present sufficient evidence for the jury to find that louisville failed to adequately warn of this hazard.
for the above stated reasons,we conclude that smith failed to present sufficient evidence at trial to support any of his theories of recovery.the district court judgment is,therefore,reversed and judgment is rendered in favor of louisville.
reversed and rendered.
this diversity case was tried under texas products liability law to a correctly instructed jury that returned a million verdict for the plaintiff.applying texas substantive law and this circuit federal test for the sufficiency of evidence to create a jury question,the district court denied the defendant motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol and rendered judgment on the verdict for the plaintiff.on appeal,the defendant improperly asserts,for the first time,a new ground for a jmol defendant avers that,because no texas court has directly addressed the quantum of proof necessary to satisfy section of texas products liability act.civ.prac.ann.vernon hereinafter tpla,this court,in deciding whether the record contains sufficient evidence to sustain the jury verdict,should apply a standard of review based by analogy on section of the louisiana products liability act lpla.ann.west,and section f ii of the mississippi products liability act mpla,ann.f ii west,and two federal erie guesses as to those statutes substantive meaning.

i respectfully dissent.the majority approval of the defendant assertion of a ground for jmol that was not included in its motions for jmol in the district court is a constitutionally impermissible of the jury verdict.the majority adoption of the defendant assertion causes the court to disregard the controlling principles of texas and federal law.the constitution as interpreted by erie dictates that this court apply the law of texas defining the substantive rights and obligations of the parties as that state highest court would apply it,not louisiana substantive law as we determine how its highest court would apply that sister state law furthermore,it is firmly established that courts in this circuit,in diversity cases,employ a federal rather than a test to determine the sufficiency of evidence to create a jury question.boeing shipman,cir en banc it is well settled in this circuit that in diversity cases federal courts apply a federal rather than a state test for the sufficiency of evidence to create a jury question,overruled in part on other grounds,gautreaux scurlock marine,cir en banc see also,in re air crash disaster near new orleans,en banc vacated in part on other grounds sub nom.pan american world airways,lopez,d borel fibreboard paper products,cir.faithful adherence to the foregoing principles of federal constitutional and state law requires that we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the plaintiff,a cable television lineman,was thrown from the top of a ladder manufactured by the defendant,and suffered severe,disabling spinal injuries.he was hurled to the ground with great centrifugal force after the ladder,which was attached with open hooks to a cable near the one he was preparing to repair,slid sideways,causing one of the hooks to become unhooked.this in turn made the ladder twist forcefully at the end of its slide,causing the plaintiff to lose hold and be thrown violently to the street below.the district court,in denying the defendant motion for jmol,rejected defendant arguments that the evidence as a whole including circumstantial evidence,testimony of defendant witnesses,and plaintiff expert design engineer tests,explanations,and opinions was not legally sufficient to support the jury findings that there was a safer alternative closable cable hook design that would have reduced the risk of the personal injury,making the cable hook,as designed,unreasonably dangerous the defendant failed to adequately warn users of the danger that,during a ladder slide,the open cable hook could come loose from the cable,cause the ladder to twist violently,and hurl a user to the ground with force and the ladder cable hooks as designed were unfit to fulfill their ordinary purpose and use.
on appeal,the defendant asserts a new ground in support of its motion for a jmol,based on the louisiana and mississippi statutes,which was not included in its jmol motions in the district court.the majority deprives the plaintiff of his seventh amendment right to a jury trial by granting a jmol on a and ground not asserted in the district court.

before applying the federal test articulated by the supreme court in reeves for the sufficiency of evidence to create a jury question to the relatively few factual issues in dispute,the constitution,per erie,requires that we focus on the pertinent texas substantive law.contrary to the majority opinion,the texas jurisprudence on safer alternative design is richly developed.
the texas supreme court and appeals courts have drawn on common law,statutes,and the restatements in expounding the state products liability laws.the basic principles of section of the restatement second of torts govern claims of strict liability in tort by users or consumers for physical harm caused by a seller defective and unreasonably dangerous product.the american tobacco grinnell,mckisson sales affiliates.a product may be unreasonably dangerous because of a defect in marketing,design,or manufacturing.caterpillar,shears.
the alleged design defect of the defendant cable hook was causally related to smith being thrown from the ladder with centrifugally increased gravitational acceleration and not to the lateral slide that began the ladder accident.nevertheless,the same rules of strict liability govern cases in which the defect caused the initial accident and cases in which the defect caused or aggravated the injuries.boatland of houston,bailey,turner general motors.
in turner general motors,the texas supreme court discussed the strict liability standard of defectiveness as applied in design defect cases.the court held that,in a design defect case,evidence is admissible upon the factors of risk and utility,such as the product utility to users and to the public as a whole balanced against the likelihood and severity of injury from its use the availability of an alternative product that would fill the same need without being unsafe or unreasonably costly the ability to eliminate the product unsafe character without significantly impairing its utility or increasing its cost the consumer awareness of the product inherent dangers the avoidability of those dangers because of their obvious nature or because of warnings supplied by the manufacturer and the ordinary consumer expectations.at.however,the court also held that the jury must be instructed only in general terms to consider the utility of the product and the risks involved in its use,and that the jury should not be instructed to balance specifically enumerated factors.id.at.the court set forth an approved jury instruction for this purpose id.at.this requirement of the texas court regarding the factors to be considered in texas products liability cases has been recognized by this court.see shipp,at cir texas courts have advanced balancing criteria to which strict liability parties should direct their evidence,but as the district judge did here,have only required that the jury be instructed in general terms to consider the utility of the product and the risk involved in its use the texas supreme court has never explicitly made proof of each balancing factor a distinct element of a strict liability claim and certainly,that the jury is instructed in ultimate terms without detailing the criteria is at odds with the notion that proof of each is required.citations,footnotes and internal quotations omitted.
in boatland,the texas supreme court held that the jury in a design defect case may consider evidence of a safer design that would have prevented the injury.at citing turner and the factors listed therein.because defectiveness of the product in question is determined in relation to safer alternatives,the fact that its risks could be diminished easily or cheaply may greatly influence the outcome of the case.id.further,the boatland court stated 
a plaintiff may advance the argument that a safer alternative was feasible with evidence that it was in actual use or was available at the time of manufacture.feasibility may also be shown with evidence of the scientific and economic capacity to develop the safer alternative.thus,evidence of the actual use of,or capacity to use,safer alternatives is relevant insofar as it depicts the available scientific knowledge and the practicalities of applying that knowledge to a product design.this method of presenting evidence of defective design is not new to the texas law of product liability.

subsequent to the enactment of section,the texas supreme court,in expounding texas strict tort liability design defect law,has often relied upon other sources consistent with section,especially the restatement third of torts products liability.for example,in general motors sanchez,the court affirmed judgment upholding plaintiffs jury verdict based on an expert testimony as to an untested and unbuilt alternative design for the transmission of a pickup truck.relying in part on the new restatement,the court held 
t he plaintiffs did not have to build and test an automobile transmission to prove a safer alternative design.a design need only prove capable of being developed,quoting boatland,at.the restatement third of torts products liability takes the position that qualified expert testimony on the issue suffices,even though the expert has produced no prototype,if it reasonably supports the conclusion that a reasonable alternative design could have been practically adopted at the time of sale.

in uniroyal goodrich,the court adopted and applied restatement third of torts products liability cmt.l in affirming judgment holding a tire manufacturer strictly liable based on defective design,although there was evidence that the cause of the accident was mounting and inflating a tire in contravention of a warning on the product 
reasonable designs and instructions or warnings both play important roles in the production and distribution of reasonably safe products.in general,when a safer design can reasonably be implemented and risks can reasonably be designed out of a product,adoption of the safer design is required over a warning that leaves a significant residuum of such risks.for example,instructions and warnings may be ineffective because users of the product may not be adequately reached,may be likely to be inattentive,or may be insufficiently motivated to follow the instructions or heed the warnings.however,when an alternative design to avoid risks can not reasonably be implemented,adequate instructions and warnings will normally be sufficient to render the product reasonably safe.warnings are not,however,a substitute for the provision of a reasonably safe design.
at quoting restatement third of torts products liability cmt.l see also hernandez,at comparing with similar provisions of the restatement third of torts products liability b a product is defective in design when the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have been reduced or avoided by the adoption of a reasonable alternative design,and the omission of the alternative design renders the product not reasonably safe.

for all of the foregoing reasons,i believe that the texas supreme court would follow restatement third products liability and its comments with respect to design defects,especially when those provisions are consistent with and complementary to texas statutory and common law.in addition to those already adopted or followed by the texas supreme court,other provisions of the section comments have particular relevance in the present case.comment f,in pertinent part,provides 
subsection b states that a product is defective in design if the omission of a reasonable alternative design renders the product not reasonably safe.a broad range of factors may be considered in determining whether an alternative design is reasonable and whether its omission renders a product not reasonably safe a plaintiff is not necessarily required to introduce proof on all of these factors their relevance,and the relevance of other factors,will vary from case to case.
while a plaintiff must prove that a reasonable alternative design would have reduced the foreseeable risks of harm,subsection b does not require the plaintiff to produce expert testimony in every case.cases arise in which the feasibility of a reasonable alternative design is obvious and understandable to laypersons and therefore expert testimony is unnecessary to support a finding that the product should have been designed differently and more safely furthermore,other products already available on the market may serve the same or very similar function at lower risk and at comparable cost.such products may serve as reasonable alternatives to the product in question.
in many cases,the plaintiff must rely on expert testimony.subsection b does not,however,require the plaintiff to produce a prototype in order to make out a prima facie case.thus,qualified expert testimony on the issue suffices,even though the expert has produced no prototype,if it reasonably supports the conclusion that a reasonable alternative design could have been practically adopted at the time of sale.
a test that considers such a broad range of factors in deciding whether the omission of an alternative design renders a product not reasonably safe requires a fair allocation of proof between the parties.to establish a prima facie case of defect,the plaintiff must prove the availability of a technologically feasible and practical alternative design that would have reduced or prevented the plaintiff harm.given inherent limitations on access to relevant data,the plaintiff is not required to establish with particularity the costs and benefits associated with adoption of the suggested alternative design.

a seller bears responsibility to perform reasonable testing prior to marketing a product and to discover risks and measures that such testing would reveal.a seller is charged with knowledge of what reasonable testing would reveal.if testing is not undertaken,or is performed in an inadequate manner,and this failure results in a defect that causes harm,the seller is subject to liability for harm caused by such defect.

t he evidence that the defendant did or did not conduct adequately reasonable research or testing before marketing the product may be admissible but is not necessarily required regardless of whether the claim is based on negligence,strict liability,or implied warranty of merchantability.although a defendant is held objectively responsible for having knowledge that a reasonable seller would have had,the fact that the defendant engaged in substantial research and testing may help to support the contention that a risk was not reasonably foreseeable.conversely,the fact that the defendant engaged in little or no research or testing may,depending on the circumstances,help to support the contention that,had reasonable research or testing been performed,the risk could have been foreseen.

in view of the wealth of decisions by the texas supreme court and appeals courts,i am bewildered by the majority assertion that n o texas court has elaborated on the nature of the proof a plaintiff must produce to meet the burden placed on him by texas section.the texas courts have frequently expanded on the elements of proof and sufficiency of evidence required under section and other products liability rules of law.see,hernandez,at section was not intended to,and does not,supplant the analysis texas has for years employed in determining whether a defectively designed product is unreasonably dangerous.footnotes omitted sanchez,at qualified expert testimony on the issue suffices,even though the expert has produced no prototype,if it reasonably supports the conclusion that a reasonable alternative design could have been practically adopted at the time of sale.quoting and adopting restatement third of torts products liability cmt.f uniroyal goodrich,at the rule that expert testimony is generally not conclusive follows not because the testimony is from an expert,but because it is opinion testimony.unless the subject matter is solely for experts,jurors are capable of forming their own opinions from the record as a whole.mcgalliard,at holding that expert testimony is conclusive only where the subject matter is such that the jury or court can not properly be assumed to have or be able to form correct opinions of their own based upon evidence as a whole and aided by their own experience and knowledge of the subject of inquiry.boatland,at observing that feasibility is a relative,not an absolute,concept.coxson atlanta life ins,noting that expert testimony,although persuasive,is rarely conclusive proof sipes general motors,finding that lay testimony will often suffice in design defect case where design concept was simple and easy to grasp cited approvingly by volvo car,cir see also turner,at holding that design defect may be proved through circumstantial evidence citing darryl ford motor,pittsburg bottling works of pittsburg ponder,same ford motor gonzalez,same accord ayres sears,roebuck,cir observing that a texas design defect is provable by direct or circumstantial evidence,based on fact or opinion testimony,abrogated on other grounds,torres oakland scavenger,d.
equally perplexing is the majority seeming erie guess that the texas supreme court would depart from its own jurisprudence and embrace the lpla to decide the present case.the texas courts have looked to the second and third restatements of torts for guidance in products liability cases,but i have not found any texas case adverting to the lpla.such an event seems highly unlikely,considering that section is not declarative,by implication or otherwise,of the common law of texas with respect to any product.tpla e.
moreover,the lpla differs markedly from section in that the lpla requires a weighing of likelihood and gravity of the claimant damage against the burdens of the alternative design,not just economic and technological feasibility requires the claimant to show that the alternative design was capable of preventing,not just significantly reducing the risk of,the claimant injury and the lpla is the exclusive products liability law in its jurisdiction,not merely a partial,codification.
the majority most audacious claim,however,is that the texas supreme court would read the word elaborate in one of our opinions under the lpla as meaning mathematically quantify,that the texas supreme court in turn would read that meaning into the lpla,and that the texas supreme court would then follow that convoluted interpretation as its lodestar in developing and applying texas law in the present case.i eschew further comment.
the majority clearly errs in proceeding to decide this case as if,under texas law,the plaintiff in a design defect case is absolutely required to present an expert to mathematically quantify risk and utility evidence and to balance risk and utility factors.in a texas design defect case,evidence is admissible as to many factors,including risk and utility,such as utility of the product to the user,usefulness to the public,and the gravity and likelihood of injury from its use,availability of a suitable substitute product taking into consideration cost of production and any impairment to usefulness,public knowledge or obviousness of dangers of the product,suitable warnings,and expectations of the ordinary consumer.a plaintiff is not necessarily required to introduce proof on all of these factors their relevance and the relevance of other factors,will vary from case to case.see temple eastex,old orchard creek partners,restatement third of torts products liability,comment f accord shipp,at.moreover,under texas law,it is the jury function to weigh risks and utilities by deciding whether the product was defectively designed,taking into consideration the utility of the product and the risk involved in its use.turner,at accord shipp,at.the jury can be instructed only in general terms,however,and can not be required to balance specifically enumerated factors.id.at.the notion of mathematical quantification appears to be the majority own invention no texas case or law demands expert mathematical quantification of risk or utility factors as a sufficiency of evidence or proof requirement in a products liability case.in fact,texas applies a no evidence test for sufficiency of evidence,see,sanchez,at,an even more deferential review standard than the federal test that the majority displaces with its erroneous mathematical quantification standard.
the majority departs from texas law again in holding that the alternative design presented by packman was not valid because he had not introduced a model of a spring loaded cable hook.the texas products liability law does not,however,require the plaintiff to produce a prototype in order to make out a prima facie case.q ualified expert testimony on the issue suffices,even though the expert has produced no prototype,if it reasonably supports the conclusion that a reasonable alternative design could have been practically adopted at the time of sale.sanchez,quoting restatement third of torts products liability,cmt.f.
it is apparent here,as it was in reeves,that the defendant is not entitled to a jmol.see reeves.at.in this case,the relevant facts concerning the physical characteristics of the product,the environment of the accident,and the resulting injuries are not in dispute.the causation question is mostly undisputed.the open or unclosed cable hook did not cause the ladder to slide.but it is undisputed that if the hook had been closed in some manner it would not have become disengaged from the cable during the slide.and the evidence overwhelmingly supports the jury finding that the disengagement of the open cable hook during the slide caused an abrupt jerk and twist of the ladder that the resulting torsional force caused smith to loose his grip and be flung violently to the ground and that consequently he suffered much more severe injuries than he would have sustained in a less accelerated fall.the jury reasonably could have chosen not to credit the testimony of the defendant witness who opined that smith would have fallen off even if the cable hook had stayed hitched.none of the defense witnesses contested the conclusion of the plaintiff and his witnesses that a closed cable hook would have reduced the force of the ladder twist and jerk and in turn the acceleration of his descent.
paul packman,the plaintiff expert,has a bachelor degree in mechanical engineering,a master degree in metallurgical engineering and a in solid state science.he has investigated accidents for lockheed aircraft corporation acted as a senior resident fellow for the national academy of sciences investigated airplane crashes,battle fatigue,and other battle damage issues for the united states air force chaired the department of material sciences and metallurgical engineering at vanderbilt university chaired the civil and mechanical engineering department at southern methodist university and taught mechanical engineering design for thirty years at those universities and as an adjunct professor at georgia tech university.he is a professor of mechanical and materials engineering at southern methodist university and has published numerous articles on mechanical engineering and related topics.
packman testified that a safer alternative design could be devised by converting the open cable hook to a closable one by adding a spring latch to prevent disengagement of the hook from the cable during a lateral slide.packman conducted a series of three comparative tests with a ladder identical to the one involved in smith accident on the same type of cable and slope,with pounds of steel weights attached to platform atop the ladder simulating the inertia created by smith body.the first test was performed with an open cable hook like the one attached to the ladder when it was manufactured.as the ladder slid down the slope of the cable,the trailing hook came off the cable,causing the ladder to spin violently.the torsional force caused the weights to break loose and be thrown from the ladder.the second test was performed under the same conditions except that the open end of the cable hook was closed with a bolt.in the slide during this test the ladder twist and jerk was significantly reduced and the weights stayed in place on the ladder.the third test was a repeat of the first but also included a of the open cable hook disengagement from the cable during the slide.according to packman,the tests demonstrated that the torsion created by the cable hook disengagement caused smith to lose hold of the ladder and be flung to the ground.if the cable hook had been equipped with a closed spring latch during smith slide,packman testified,the prevention of its disengagement would have significantly reduced the risk of his injury by either enabling him to hang on or to prepare for a softer,more controlled landing.
the defendants counsel were present during packman tests,and defendants personnel and witnesses were able to review the of the tests prior to the litigation.the defendants witnesses did not criticize the fairness or accuracy of packman tests but had different opinions about what they showed.the defendant did not conduct any tests of its own regarding the design for purposes of the litigation.in fact,the defendant did not present any documentation or definite testimony showing that it had ever tested the ladder performance in a lateral slide at all.if the defendant was aware of the propensity of the open cable hook to become disengaged and cause the ladder to twist and jerk violently,it did not present any evidence to this effect or provide any warnings or instructions regarding that particular risk with the product.
based on the foregoing data,packman testified that in his opinion the alternative design that he proposed,consisting of a cable hook held closed during engagement by a spring latch,would have prevented or significantly reduced the risk of smith injury that the alternative design was feasible because the technology of the spring latch was simple,and had been in existence for a very long time that spring latches were readily,agreeing to the statement that they were available in hardware stores pretty much everywhere when the ladder was manufactured that its attachment to the cable hook would not have impaired the utility of the product significantly and that a latch was already incorporated into the ladder design by louisville ladder in the ladder mechanism,making the spring latch concept an absolutely obvious one of which the defendant was fully aware.van bree,the defendant representative,testified that louisville ladder did,indeed,incorporate the design into its mechanism,though it had not tested the idea of incorporating the concept into the cable hook.
in holding that the record contained insufficient evidence to sustain the jury verdict,the majority misapplie s the federal standard of review dictated by rule.reeves.at.the court disregards critical evidence favorable to the of the witnesses agreed that the closure of the cable hook would prevent its disengagement and reduce the force of the ladder twisting and jerk duri
