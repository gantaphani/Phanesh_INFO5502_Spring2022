this civil rights appeal stems from a racially motivated attack,during a high school football practice,resulting in a serious eye injury.eve priester,individually and as next friend of her son,terry priester,brought this action against the lowndes county school district,the new hope high school columbus,mississippi,the school district superintendent,and the high school principal and football coaches,in their individual and representative capacities,alleging that the defendant acts and omissions amounted to a conspiracy between the assailant and coaches to deprive the appellant of his federal rights under and various state tort laws.the defendants moved for summary judgment and the district court granted the motion upon a finding of an absence of state action.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,the facts are as follows.on september,terry an student at new hope high school,sustained a serious eye injury during football practice allegedly caused by a white teammate eli ward ward.leading up to the injury,ward slapped terry on the back of the head and derided him in the locker room and during drills on matters such as his weight and race.on previous occasions,the head football coach rick cahalane cahalane subjected terry to numerous racial epithets and derogatory comments concerning his weight after hearing such comments from cahalane,ward used the same derogatory terms toward terry.the day of the injury,ward also approached terry and,without provocation,hit him on the helmet with a rock.terry was also hit in a similar manner by another fellow player.cahalane allegedly heard the statements and witnessed the assaults,but he did nothing to protect terry or take the necessary actions that could stop or prevent the recurrence of the incident.terry mother witnessed these events and immediately informed the high school principal,who said he would handle the problem in the morning.
in the midst of a drill during football practice,the injury occurred subsequent to terry successful block of ward.in response,cahalane walked over to ward to get on to him about the previous play.while cahalane and ward talked,ward apparently looked at terry throughout the conversation.immediately following the conversation,ward told terry that he had something for him.on the next play from scrimmage,terry alleges that ward lunged toward him,thrust his hands through his helmet,and gouged his eye.terry injury resulted in permanent damage including a torn right lower eyelid,a laceration to his lower punctum and caniliculus tear duct,chronic tearing,and blurry vision.the school response was.first,upon interviewing the coaches and players,new hope high school principal mike halford compiled a report of the incident.in the report,however,no one admitted seeing anyone hit terry.second,the school declined to pay terry medical bills.
on january,eve priester,individually and as the next friend of her son terry priester,pursuant to section,filed suit in federal district court against lowndes county school district,sammy townsend,in his capacity as the superintendent of education of the lowndes county school district,new hope high school,mike halford,in his individual and representative capacity as principal,new hope high school,rick cahalane,dale hardin,kent farris,danny browning,and lundy brantly in their individual and representative capacities as coaches at new hope high school collectively,school officials priester alleged an agreement between ward and the coaches to deprive her son of his rights under the due process and equal protection clauses of the constitution fourteenth amendment additionally,she alleged claims of negligence and intentional torts resulting in emotional distress and physical injury.
on february,priester amended her complaint to include ward as a defendant,alleging that ward,motivated by racial animus,subjected priester to physical and verbal assaults.ward moved for a rule summary judgment to dismiss the claim.on august,ward was dismissed as a defendant by order of the district court because he was not a state actor under section and the statute of limitations tolled on september,for the applicable mississippi tort.
the remaining defendants moved for summary judgment arguing,inter alia,that priester failed to allege any state action to support her section claim.the district court granted the defendants motion finding no requisite fair attribution or special relationship between the school and priester,and thus,an absence of state action to support a section claim.the district court dismissed the remaining state law claims without prejudice.priester timely filed a notice of appeal.

discussion 
the issues raised on appeal are whether the district court erred in dismissing ward based on his state law statute of limitations for intentional torts erred in granting the school officials summary judgment motion under section based on a finding of no state action and abused its discretion in refusing to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.we will address each issue in turn.
dismissal of ward pursuant to state statute of limitations 
on appeal,priester contends that the district court erred in dismissing the former defendant ward under the statute of limitations for an intentional tort,rather than a theory of negligence.specifically,priester argues that the statute of limitations should apply,instead of a statute of limitations,because of both the civil rights nature of this case and the policy of not allowing states to circumvent section by adopting shorter statute of limitations standards.a close scrutiny of the record,however,reveals that priester has misconstrued the district court opinion dismissing the claims stemming from ward actions.the district court dismissed ward as a defendant on two theories the intentional tort claims were dismissed pursuant to the statute of limitations,while the section claims were dismissed for lack of state action.
intentional tort claims 
we find that the district court correctly construed priester amended complaint as stating a claim under an intentional tort theory rather than a negligence theory.priester complaint states that ward alleged actions,ward put both of his hands through priester helmet and planted his finger in terry priester eye and pulled it as hard as he could,are in the form of an intentional tort rather than negligence.under the applicable state statute,intentional torts have a statute of limitations period thus,the district court correctly found that priester claim stated an intentional tort,and that the applicable statute of limitations had run because the amended complaint was filed on february,well over a year from september,the date upon which the alleged injuries occurred during football practice.
section claims 
to state a cause of action under section the appellant must allege that the person who deprived him of a federal right was acting under color of law.cinel connick,cir.for a private citizen,such as ward,to be held liable under section,the plaintiff must allege that the citizen conspired with or acted in concert with state actors.mylett jeane,cir.
this court has held that a actor may be liable under if the private citizen was a willful participant in joint activity with the state or its agents.cinel,at.the plaintiff must allege an agreement between the private and public defendants to commit an illegal act and a deprivation of constitutional rights.id.allegations that are merely conclusory,without reference to specific facts,will not suffice.brinkmann johnston,cir.the district court correctly determined priester complaint failed to allege a conspiracy.the complaint alleges that the coaches either ignored or encouraged allowed ward behavior however,the complaint does not allege an agreement between ward and the coaches to commit an illegal act,nor does it allege specific facts to show an agreement.therefore,we uphold the district court dismissal of ward for failure to state a claim under rule b.
ii.dismissal of school district officials under section 
priester also argues that under section,the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants on two accounts.first,priester alleges that the school officials failure to protect priester from violence during a school activity violates the due process clause second,priester contends that the school officials use of racial epithets and their refusal to both pay for her son medical expenses and respond to her complaints of racial harassment deprives priester of his clearly established rights,and thus,violates the equal protection clause 
substantive due process 
pursuant to the due process clause,priester argues that the district court erred in summarily dismissing her claim as failing to have the requisite state action.to state a claim under section,a plaintiff must allege a violation of rights secured by the constitution of the united states or laws of the united states and demonstrate that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.mckinney irving.sch,cir.as for the first prong of mckinney,priester allegations indicate that her complaint falls under the substantive component of the due process clause.see leffall dallas indep.sch,cir finding a substantive due process claim when the plaintiff alleged that the state had a duty to provide students protection from injury at a school dance.thus,the district court correctly construed priester allegations that the coaches and school officials failed to protect priester from the attack,as essentially a claim under the substantive component of the due process clause.
as for the second prong of mckinney,because the fourteenth amendment protects liberty and property interests only against invasion by a state,a section plaintiff,alleging the deprivation of due process under the fourteenth amendment,must also show that state action caused his injury.bass parkwood,cir.in such cases,the under color of law and state action inquiries merge into one.id.this court has consistently held that the right to be free of damage to a person bodily integrity is protected by the f ourteenth a mendment guarantee of due process.doe taylor.sch,cir petta rivera,cir finding that a constitutional right under the due process clause requires more than merely a harm to give rise to a constitutional tort.considering that the bodily integrity of terry was indisputably damaged by ward act,he suffered an unquestionable harm to his property.the issue in this case,therefore,is whether the harm to terry property was caused by state action.
as a general rule,the state failure to protect an individual from private violence does not violate the due process clause.deshaney winnebago county dep of social,d holding that nothing in the language of the due process clause itself requires the state to protect the life,liberty,and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors.this court has clearly held,that absent certain limited circumstances,substantive due process does not confer an entitlement to governmental aid as may be necessary to realize the advantages of liberty guaranteed by the clause.walton alexander,cir.therefore,for priester to overcome the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants,she must show that the alleged harm to her son fits one of those certain limited circumstances.
special relationship exception 
priester contends that the coaches were effectively state actors because a special relationship exists between students and teachers,and thus,the coaches were cloaked with a certain public trust and responsibility to protect her son from harm.we have recognized that when the special relationship between the person and the state imposes upon the state a constitutional duty to protect that individual from known threats of harm by private actors,this circumstance constitutes an exception to the general rule that a state has no affirmative duty to protect an individual from private violence.walton,at see also mckinney,at stating that the special relationship exception only arises when a person is involuntarily confined or otherwise restrained against his will pursuant to a governmental order or by the affirmative exercise of state power.
the special relationship exception,however,has been narrowly construed when applied to school sponsored activities.this court has held that no such special relationship exists between a school district and its students during a school sponsored activity held outside the time during which students are required to attend school for activities.leffall,at.in leffall,an student,named dameon steadham,was fatally shot by random gunfire in the parking lot of a public high school after a school dance.id.at.the court reasoned that no special relationship existed between the student and the school,because although the student may have been compelled to attend school during the day,any special relationship that may have existed lapsed when compulsory attendance ended.id.at.in other words,the state does not become the permanent guarantor of an individual safety by having once offered him shelter.deshaney,at.
in the present case,priester claim that lack of supervision during football practice is gross negligence wrongfully rests upon a characterization of the state as a permanent guarantor of a student safety.it is undisputed that terry injuries did not occur during regular school hours,when students are arguably compelled to attend public schools.rather,terry injury occurred after regular school hours during football practice,and thus,at the time his injuries occurred,no special relationship existed between him and the school.moreover,priester fails to show that her son was compelled or restrained against his will.high school football practice is a voluntary activity,and thus,priester can not claim that her son was in anyways compelled by the school to participate.priester has cited no relevant case law which supports her special relationship claims.therefore,because no special relationship exists between a school district and its students during a football practice held outside of the time during which students are required to attend school for activities,the district court did not err in finding no requisite state action under section.
ii.danger exception 
in her initial complaint,priester also argued that the school officials were deliberately indifferent to her complaints and the incidents she witnessed previously,we have clearly stated that this court has neith
