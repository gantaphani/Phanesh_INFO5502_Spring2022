after winning their disabled client an million personal injury settlement that will pay for his care for the rest of his life,the attorneys in this case saw their compensation slashed by the district court from the percent provided in their contingency fee agreement to a mere three percent.while a district court does possess discretion in approving fee awards,particularly when its power to protect minors or the disabled is involved,we hold that the court here abused that discretion by improperly applying the standards we have established for determining whether an attorney fee is reasonable.as a result,we vacate and remand.
on new year eve in raleigh,north carolina,year old mark pellegrin was struck by a truck driven by his friend,kelly mckiernan,who had been drinking.pellegrin hit his head on the pavement,and paramedics found him unconscious and unable to breathe as a result of his injuries.the bleeding,swelling,and lack of oxygen that resulted caused permanent,severe brain damage.pellegrin spent days in the hospital and can no longer walk,talk,or even roll over.he is completely dependent on others for feeding,dressing,washing,and toileting.he is,however,partially conscious and can communicate through facial reactions.if pellegrin lives to full life expectancy,his future care and medical expenses are estimated to cost approximately million.
at the time of his injury,mark pellegrin worked for kci technologies as a crew leader for communications tower inspections,and mckiernan was one of his crew members.because the tower inspections frequently required travel,kci provided company trucks to many of its employees,including mckiernan.kci had a written policy prohibiting employees from operating its equipment while intoxicated.
on december,pellegrin asked mckiernan to come to his house to check equipment for an upcoming inspection.mckiernan drove his kci truck to pellegrin home.after working for a while,pellegrin and mckiernan began drinking to celebrate new year eve.eventually mckiernan decided to leave but was prevented by pellegrin,who told him he could not drive.when pellegrin left the room,however,mckiernan said that he 
took the keys and ran.i was just trying to get out of there.and that when i walked down to the truck.basically,i put it in reverse,went to a stop and put it in drive.of course i got to mess with the radio why could i see him and i i i hit him.i sure he was just coming down to tell me,you know,man,what are you doing.kelly,you drunk,dude.
mckiernan called,and when police arrived he told them to just put me in handcuffs.you know,i drunk.i accidentally hit my buddy who was just trying to stop me from leaving.police officers found human hair on the truck front grill.mckiernan later pled guilty to driving while intoxicated and has never denied that he was responsible for the accident.
pellegrin father,jerry,was appointed as his son general guardian in north carolina some two months after the accident and remains pellegrin primary caregiver.because the pellegrins are from louisiana,jerry pellegrin retained attorney charles bourque of the louisiana law firm martin,williams and bourque to attempt to recover for his son injuries.the retainer agreement jerry pellegrin signed agreed to pay bourque firm percent of any gross recovery,plus litigation expenses with jerry pellegrin consent,bourque then retained the north carolina firm of abrams abrams,agreeing to split any contingency fee equally.
before jerry pellegrin even signed the agreement,kci insurer,national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh,pennsylvania,transmitted a reservation of rights letter to mckiernan,denying coverage for the accident.although kci carried million in insurance,national union claimed it was not obligated to pay because mckiernan violated kci internal rules by driving while intoxicated.
the insurance policy,however,did not incorporate kci internal rules,and pellegrin counsel believed that north carolina courts had already rejected a similar defense in united services automobile association rhodes.in that case,an insurance company was required to cover expenses arising from an accident involving a rental car driven by an intoxicated driver,even though the rental agreement prohibited drunk driving.id.at.pellegrin counsel thus filed suit in north carolina court against kelly mckiernan on july,after some six months of investigation.
national union not only again disclaimed any coverage but also refused even to defend mckiernan.under north carolina law,if an insurer improperly refuses to defend a claim,it is estopped from denying coverage and must pay any reasonable settlement even if it made an honest mistake in its denial.see pulte home am.ins,bruce terminix zurich ins.because pellegrin counsel drafted their complaint against mckiernan to state only that mckiernan negligently struck mark pellegrin with a kci vehicle he was operating with the company knowledge,consent and permission,the complaint triggered national union duty to defend the suit,which is based on facts alleged in pleadings and is broader than the duty to indemnify.waste mgmt.of carolinas,peerless ins.
without national union,mckiernan could not afford counsel and instead defended himself.several depositions were taken and a trial date set,but mckiernan did not appear at trial.as a result,the district court entered a million judgment against him.mckiernan obviously lacked the funds to satisfy such a judgment,and counsel filed a second complaint against national union within the thirty day time limit provided in north carolina law to alter or amend a judgment.that complaint contained a description of the mckiernan suit and attached a copy of the judgment.it sought a declaration that national union was liable for the full million judgment against mckiernan because of its insurance coverage and its failure to defend the earlier suit,and it designated pellegrin as a beneficiary.
at this point,national union removed the suit to federal court,invoking federal diversity jurisdiction.a mediation took place on august,at the end of which national union agreed to pay million to resolve all claims.of that amount,million went into a special needs trust designed to supplement pellegrin care.the next million purchased a structured annuity that was guaranteed to make monthly payments for pellegrin support for at least thirty years and would continue to pay after that point for the duration of his life.over the first thirty years,the annuity was guaranteed to pay million,and if pellegrin lived to,his life expectancy if he were healthy,it would pay million.the final million was to be paid outright and used to satisfy the retainer agreement.there is no dispute that the settlement agreement will provide amply for pellegrin throughout his life.
because pellegrin was incompetent,national union and jerry pellegrin jointly moved for court approval of the settlement.the district court questioned pellegrin attorneys about their work,demanding to know how many hours they had spent on the case.at first,douglas abrams of abrams abrams,replied that the firm did not keep hourly records because it only took contingency cases.when pressed,he guessed that our firm alone has a thousand hours and that bourque firm has at least a thousand hours.bourque estimated his firm time as something well in excess of a thousand hours.no other evidence about hours was presented.
at the close of the hearing,pellegrin father and guardian addressed the court.he said 
i like to state that i not a big fan of lawyers myself.however,these people abrams,chuck bourque,have shown me and my son more compassion and help and i do not begrudge them anything.i think they earned everything.i was proud of them and we all tired and ready for this to be over.
in spite of this request,the district court reduced the lawyers compensation from million to,or from percent down to three percent of the settlement.pellegrin union fire ins,d.the million balance reverted to pellegrin.the court reached this number by taking what it termed counsel pure speculation as to the number of hours worked and multiplying it by a per hour rate that it believed was a high hourly rate for a lawyer in north carolina.id.at.this appeal by pellegrin counsel followed.we appointed amicus counsel to defend the district court fee decision as national union had no stake in the outcome on appeal 
in this case,w e review a district court award of attorney fees for abuse of discretion.grissom v.the mills,cir.as an initial matter,the district court in this case properly noted that courts evaluate attorney fees under a reasonableness standard.pellegrin lawyers contend that they are entitled to have their contingency fee agreement enforced unless the resultant fees are clearly excessive.as they see it,only agreements that are so excessive that no ethical attorney could sign them should be cast aside.that standard presents its problems,however,because it allows approval of fees that are unreasonable and excessive just so long as they are not clearly so.
the simpler standard of reasonableness is one that congress and many courts have adopted.for instance,in the context under b,which applies to certain civil rights suits,a court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee.b emphasis added.see also barber kimbrell,cir evaluating attorney fee for reasonableness.nor is the reasonableness standard limited to the context.as we noted in bergstrom dalkon shield trust in re robins,the law of this circuit has long been clear that federal district courts have inherent power and an obligation to limit attorneys fees to a reasonable amount,cir.in particular,t he district courts supervisory jurisdiction over contingent fee contracts for services rendered in cases before them is.allen,cir.here too the review of fee arrangements is for reasonableness.
indeed,it is difficult to imagine why any different standard would be warranted.in a case like this involving a minor or disabled individual,a district court plainly enjoys discretion to protect those who come in front of it.in general,infant s and other incompetent parties are wards of any court called upon to measure and weigh their interests.dacanay mendoza,cir.as a result,i t has long been established that the court in which a minor claims are being litigated has a duty to protect the minor interests.salmeron,cir.this duty is intended to protect those who may be especially vulnerable to manipulation or who may be unable to protect themselves.id.
integral to this protective judicial role is ascertaining whether attorney fee agreements involving minors or incompetents are reasonable.independent investigation by the court as to the fairness and reasonableness of a fee to be charged against a minor estate or interest is required.dean holiday inns,cir cappel adams,cir same noting the obvious possibilities of unfair advantage.moreover,the public reputation of the profession would deservedly suffer if attorneys were seen to be gouging those least able to fend for themselves.consistent with this charge,the local rules of the eastern district of north carolina state that in approving a settlement,the court shall approve or fix the amount of the fee to be paid to counsel for the minor or incompetent parties.c.
the parties spend a great deal of time and energy debating whether the review of attorney fees is a federal or state question,whether north carolina or louisiana law applies,and what exactly the laws of each jurisdiction may or may not be.we are not convinced,however,that the law of either state is so different from the federal standard as to make a difference,see mitzel westinghouse,cir ruling that attorney fee determination in contingency case is federal procedural question but holding that analysis would be the same even under state substantive law.and we are persuaded that the virtues of simplicity and straightforwardness counsel against adopting different standards with different shades and nuances in different contexts.the district court therefore did have the discretion to review the settlement here,including the contingency fee,for reasonableness.
the district court discretion is by no means unguided,however.district courts should look at the twelve factors first set forth in johnson georgia highway express,cir,and adopted by this court in barber,at,and allen,at.in allen,we stated the factors as follows 
the time and labor required in the case,the novelty and difficulty of the questions presented,the skill required to perform the necessary legal services,the preclusion of other employment by the lawyer due to acceptance of the case,the customary fee for similar work,the contingency of a fee,the time pressures imposed in the case,the award involved and the results obtained,the experience,reputation,and ability of the lawyer,the undesirability of the case,the nature and length of the professional relationship between the lawyer and the client,and the fee awards made in similar cases.
id though barber upheld an award in a truth in lending act case under a,allen was a contingency fee case and noted that t hese factors apply even where the fee request is based on a private fee agreement.allen,at.
although the district court correctly recognized that some factors may not have much,if anything,to add in a given case,pellegrin,d at citing bergstrom,at,the factors that do apply should be considered.we can not afford effective appellate review unless we have before us the district court reasons for finding a particular award appropriate.barber,at.particularly when such a steep and indeed drastic reduction from the fee provided in the retainer agreement was ordered,some care in explanation might be expected.the district court here neglected to consider several critically important factors in its analysis.for example,it failed to adequately address the contingency of the fee factor,the award involved and the results obtained factor,and the fee awards made in similar cases factor.we consider these factors in turn.
the chief error in the district court analysis was its failure to recognize the significance of the contingency fee in this case.the court obviously knew that a contingency fee was involved,but it did not give that fact the weight it was due in the decisional calculus.after quoting language from allen stating that contingency agreements are subject to supervision by courts for reasonableness,at,the court merely stated that it must consider the other relevant barber factors in order to determine the reasonableness of the contingency fee requested by plaintiff counsel.pellegrin,d at.it then proceeded to apply an hourly rate calculation based on dubious estimations of the applicable hours and rates with no further consideration of the relevance of the contingency fee agreement.id.at.fixing a lodestar fee in this contingency case was error and threatens to nullify the considerable advantages of contingency arrangements.
as an initial matter,contingency fees provide access to counsel for individuals who would otherwise have difficulty obtaining representation.sadly,a plaintiff sometimes has little to offer a lawyer other than his personal plight.as an advocate before the kentucky supreme court noted as early as,in the absence of contingency fees a client may not have any thing else to give,and without the aid of the matter in the contest,he can never sue for his right,not having otherwise the means to employ counsel.rust larue,litt,quoted in peter karsten,enabling the poor to have their day in court the sanctioning of contingency fee contracts,a history to,depaul.
nor has that rationale changed with time.the second circuit has explained that,m any claimants can not afford to retain counsel at fixed hourly rates yet they are willing to pay a portion of any recovery they may receive in return for successful representation.ignoring reasonable contingent fee agreements or automatically reducing them would impair claimants ability to secure representation.wells sullivan,cir.while the various amici in this case debate whether contingency fees encourage or discourage insubstantial suits where the chance of recovery is slight,that ongoing argument is beyond the power of this court to resolve.the point remains that contingency fees are an acknow
