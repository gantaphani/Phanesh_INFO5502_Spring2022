this case began with two suits filed by respondent walter himmelreich,a federal prisoner.he first filed suit against the united states,alleging that a severe beating he received from a fellow inmate was the result of negligence by prison officials.the government treated the suit as a claim under the federal tort claims act ftca,which allows plaintiffs to seek damages from the united states for certain torts committed by federal employees,b,s ubject to the provisions of chapter of title.but an exceptions section of the ftca dictates that the provisions of chapter and section b of this title shall not apply to certain categories of claims.the government moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the claim fell into the exception for a ny claim based upon the exercise or performance of a discretionary function,namely,deciding where to house inmates,a.while the motion was pending,himmelreich filed a second suit a constitutional tort suit against individual bureau of prison employees,again alleging that his beating was the result of prison officials negligence.ordinarily,the ftca would have no bearing on that claim.but after the dismissal of himmelreich first suit,the individual employee defendants argued that himmelreich second suit was foreclosed by the ftca judgment bar provision,according to which a judgment in an ftca suit forecloses any future suit against individual employees.agreeing,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the individual prison employees.the sixth circuit reversed,however,holding that the judgment bar provision did not apply to himmelreich suit.
held the judgment bar provision does not apply to the claims dismissed for falling within the exceptions section of the ftca.
a the ftca explicitly excepts from its coverage certain categories of claims,including the one into which himmelreich first suit fell.if,as the government maintains,chapter judgment bar provision applies to claims in that exceptions category,it applied to himmelreich first suit and would preclude any future actions,including his second suit.on himmelreich reading,however,the provision does not apply and he may proceed with his second suit.
b himmelreich is correct.the ftca exceptions section reads t he provisions of this chapter chapter shall not apply to a ny claim based upon the exercise or performance of a discretionary function or duty.a.the judgment bar is a provision of chapter.the exceptions section plain text thus dictates that the judgment bar does not apply to cases that,like himmelreich first suit,are based on the performance of a discretionary function.because the judgment bar provision does not apply to himmelreich first suit,his second suit against individual prison employees should be permitted to go forward.nothing about the exceptions section or the judgment bar provision gives this court any reason to disregard the plain text of the statute.
c united states smith,does not require a different result.there,the court found that the exclusive remedies provision of chapter which prevents a plaintiff from suing an employee where the ftca would allow him to sue the united states instead,see b applied to a claim for injuries sustained at a hospital in italy,even though that claim fell within the category of a ny claim arising in a foreign country,one of the exceptions to which the provisions of chapter shall not apply,k.smith outcome,the government argues,forecloses a literal reading of the exceptions provision,but smith does not control here.first,smith does not even mention the exceptions section shall not apply language.second,the exclusive remedies provision at issue there was enacted as part of the federal employee liability reform and tort compensation act of,which also contained a mechanism to convert tort suits against government employees into ftca suits subject to the limitations and exceptions applicable to those actions.at quoting d emphasis in smith.by taking note of those limitations and exceptions,the smith court reasoned,the liability reform act was intended to apply to the exceptions categories of claims.nothing in the text of the judgment bar provision compels the same result here.
d the government remaining counterargument is a parade of horribles that it believes will come to pass if every provision of chapter shall not apply to the exceptions categories of claims,but it raises few concerns about the judgment bar provision itself.if the government is right about chapter other provisions,the court may hold so in the appropriate case,see smith,at,but the reading adopted here yields utterly sensible results.had the district court in this case issued a judgment dismissing himmelreich first suit because,the prison employees were not negligent,it would make sense that the judgment bar provision would prevent a second suit against the employees.but where an ftca claim is dismissed because it falls within one of the exceptions,the dismissal signals merely that the united states can not be held liable for a particular claim it has no logical bearing on whether an employee can be liable instead.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
the federal tort claims act ftca allows plaintiffs to seek damages from the united states for certain torts committed by federal employees.b.many of the ftca procedural provisions are contained in a single chapter of the united states code,chapter.see.but an exceptions section of the ftca dictates that the provisions of chapter shall not apply to certain categories of claims.at issue in this case is whether one of the provisions of chapter the judgment bar provision,might nonetheless apply to one of the excepted claims.we conclude it does not.
this case began with two suits filed by walter himmelreich.in each,himmelreich alleged that he had been severely beaten by a fellow inmate in federal prison and that the beating was the result of prison officials negligence.at the time of the beating,himmelreich was incarcerated for producing child pornography.his assailant had warned prison officials that he would smash a pedophile if given the opportunity but was nonetheless released into the general prison population,where he assaulted himmelreich.app.
himmelreich filed a first suit against the united states.the government treated this first suit as a claim under the ftca and moved to dismiss the action,arguing that the claim fell into one of the exceptions to the ftca for a ny claim based upon the exercise or performance of a discretionary function,namely,deciding where to house inmates.a.the district court granted the government motion to dismiss.neither party here challenges the outcome of that first suit.
but before the district court dismissed that first suit,himmelreich filed a second suit,this one a constitutional tort suit against individual bureau of prison employees rather than against the united states.ordinarily,the ftca would have nothing to say about such claims.but after the dismissal of himmelreich first suit,the individual employee defendants argued that himmelreich second suit was foreclosed by the ftca judgment bar provision,according to which a judgment in an ftca suit forecloses any future suit against individual employees.see.as relevant here,the district court agreed and granted summary judgment in favor of the individual prison employees.
himmelreich appealed that ruling.the sixth circuit reversed,holding that the judgment bar provision did not apply to himmelreich suit.himmelreich federal bureau of prisons et,per curiam.
we granted certiorari to resolve a circuit split on whe
