donald macdermid appeals from the magistrate judge dismissal of his claims on the pleadings and at summary judgment.see macdermid discover fin,wl.may.macdermid alleges that his wife,who suffered from a severe form of bipolar disorder,committed suicide as a consequence of discover financial harassing of the couple over worth of purchases that she had made,but not paid for,on a discover credit card.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
the facts of this case were aptly set forth by the magistrate judge in his summary judgment order 
in august,nina kay macdermid,using the family computer located upstairs in the home which she shared with her husband,donald macdermid,went to the discover card web site and filled out an application requesting a credit card.she provided her personal information as well as personal information of her husband,like his social security number.she submitted the application for her husband as the primary card holder and herself as an authorized buyer.
subsequently,macdermid went again in august and then in september and applied for two more discover cards in her husband name,providing discover with his personal information and requesting that the cards be issued with him as the primary card holder and her as an authorized buyer.in order to be able to receive these credit cards from discover without her husband knowledge,she obtained a post office box in linville,tennessee.these cards were subsequently issued to her and she was able to intercept them and use them without her husband knowledge.
macdermid made numerous purchases using her discover cards.these purchases ranged from every day necessities such as gas and computer products to exotic cats.
unbeknownst to discover,macdermid had a long history of mental illness.she had been diagnosed in the early as having bipolar disease and being manic depressive.she underwent drug and alcohol counseling at parthenon pavilion a nashville psychiatric hospital in the early.according to her husband,she continued to struggle with drug and alcohol problems into their marriage.
macdermid also had a history of manic spending sprees.she had previously run up credit card debt requiring her to file personal bankruptcy in the late.after her discharge from bankruptcy,her husband,who had helped her by paying off some of her debts,forbade her from having any credit cards.
after her bankruptcy,macdermid was on a cash only basis.she was not working,and her husband would provide her with money for purchases which he felt were warranted.hence,she surreptitiously obtained not only these three discover cards,but also cards from american express,household bank,and chase,among others.according to macdermid,his wife obtained all of these credit cards essentially the same way that she did the discover cards,without his knowledge,and in his name,using his personal information.
on february,macdermid intercepted checks which had been sent to his residence by discover.macdermid confronted his wife about these checks and she denied having any knowledge of them.he admits that he was angry.in his notes concerning the incident,macdermid states that he had a stressful confrontation with his wife.he explained in his deposition that,it was,you know to my knowledge,i confronted her with it and that would be stressful to her,very stressful,under the circumstances.
two days later,macdermid found his wife in bed in a near death condition.macdermid was admitted to maury regional hospital on february,where she remained for five days until her discharge on february.the medical records list her discharge diagnosis as acute narcotic overdose and anoxic brain injury.the records also indicate that she had battled bipolar disease for about a decade.
shortly after his wife was admitted to the hospital,macdermid went through his wife stuff when he got back home from the hospital.he found a number of credit cards and statements showing that she was delinquent on a number of different credit cards.after macdermid found these credit cards he cancelled them.he called each one and cancelled them and wrote letters to each one.
on march,macdermid wrote a letter to discover financial services this letter states in pertinent part as follows 
this is to confirm that the credit cards noted above,or any other credit instrument in my name to you,is not and has never been authorized nor requested by me.i was unaware of the cards,or you listing me as cardholder.i have not used them.i have not benefited from it in any way,to the best of my knowledge.
in this letter,macdermid also states that i have never signed any request,authorization to open,or authorization for anyone else to obtain or use your cards.macdermid does not dispute the fact that his wife obtained these discover cards and purchased goods with them.he also admits that she was ultimately responsible for paying them.
after macdermid was released from the hospital,she was under the care and supervision of psychiatrist john koomen.on wednesday,june,two days before she committed suicide,she visited with koomen.sometime around that visit,she purchased a handgun.on june,macdermid used this handgun to commit suicide.
macdermid hand wrote a note for her husband,which macdermid found after she had killed herself.this note,which is undated,states as follows 
the pressure just got the best of me.i got to where i could not even function any more.i am so sorry i let the house go,and everything,please forgive me.i really do love you,but i just can not take this kind of pressure,and humiliation any longer.i am so sorry for all the worry i have caused you don,i just wish we were back at the old church once again.i really do love you.i am so sorry to do this to us,but i am not me any more don.i do not want to take your money either.we should have spent more time together,some vacations,and not all work.i stayed here by myself way too much.i feel like i am having a nervous breakdown.i keep the shakes all the time,and numbness all through my body and paranoid,that is no way to live.i will always love you,your wife kay.
macdermid testified that he was shocked and surprised by his wife suicide.he testified that she did not act any differently in the weeks leading up to her suicide.macdermid did notice that his wife was perhaps a little more relaxed.she did not have any conversation with him that,in hindsight,he thinks was out of character,or that indicated she was contemplating suicide or trying to say goodbye.macdermid plainly admitted that i did see it coming.i put it that way,in my own perspective.macdermid did not think that her friends or family foresaw that she was going to commit suicide.he testified that certainly if his wife mother thought that she would commit suicide,then her mother would have done something about it.
macdermid was not specifically warned by koomen,his wife treating psychiatrist,that suicide was an imminent threat.koomen did not tell macdermid to take any specific precautionary measures to prevent his wife from taking her own life.macdermid had a number of guns,including handguns,in the house,all of which were fully accessible to his wife.koomen did not suggest to macdermid that he should not have guns in the house.
in addition,macdermid had full access to all of her medication and was administering all of her medication herself,even though she had been hospitalized in february for an acute narcotic overdose.macdermid stated that he was really looking for a suicide.macdermid further explained,nobody saw it coming to the extent that they would,you know,overtly do something about it,which would be saying,you know,hey,you in danger.i did see it.nobody else did.
the last contact that macdermid had with anyone from discover was probably a phone call at least a week or two weeks prior to the suicide.although he was not positive,macdermid thought that the last contact that either he or his wife had with discover was some time in may.
plaintiff has submitted the affidavit of koomen,which states in pertinent part as follows 
as my attached notes indicate,macdermid was primarily concerned by the recent allegation by a credit card creditor that she had been guilty of credit card fraud.that reference appears on pages one and two of the initial psychiatric assessment conducted by me at the commencement of my evaluation and treatment of macdermid which is dated.during my initial interviews with macdermid and in the ensuing weeks through april and may of,macdermid voiced apprehension over the allegations against her by the credit card company which was accusing her of credit card fraud.she was terrified at the prospect of going to jail and causing further embarrassment to her family,particularly her husband.while i did not discuss the specifics of the threats of jail with macdermid,i note that she was preoccupied with the allegations of credit card fraud,and that it appeared to be the primary stressor which contributed to the deterioration of her emotional and mental condition in april and may of.subsequent to her selfinflicted gunshot death on june,it was reported to me by don macdermid,her husband,that she had just been threatened with immediate jailing by credit representatives of discover card,and that her fear and embarrassment related to the threat of incarceration appeared to be paramount in the voiced fears which led to her suicide.
based upon my review of the psychiatric records of nina kay macdermid,my personal involvement in her psychiatric care from march of through the date of her death in june,and upon the history of the threat of immediate jailing by collection agents for discover card,it is my opinion that it is more probable than not,within reasonable medical certainty,that the significant precipitating factor in the causation of the death of nina kay macdermid were the threats of criminal fraud prosecution and incarceration by the collection representatives.in the absence of the threats of arrest and incarceration,i believe that it is more probable than not,within reasonable medical certainty,that macdermid could have maintained her rational thought processes,and the condition could have been stabilized,as it had many times in the past,through continued counseling and appropriate medication.my office provided appropriate care,supervision,and treatment to nina kay macdermid throughout our relationship with macdermid.all care provided by my office,and under my supervision,was consistent with the local standard of care in the columbia,maury county,tennessee medical community.
macdermid,wl,at.
on october,macdermid filed the instant action in federal court,alleging wrongful death,negligence on the part of discover in causing macdermid suicide intentional infliction of emotional distress,based on discover actions in attempting to collect the debt purportedly owed it violation of the tennessee consumer protection act,ann.et fraud civil extortion violation of the federal fair debt collection practices act,et credit and violation of the federal truth in lending act,et.the parties consented to have all proceedings conducted by a magistrate judge.
the above claims were largely dismissed by the magistrate judge upon discover motion to dismiss on the pleadings,but two claims were allowed to proceed to discovery wrongful death and credit defamation.the magistrate judge subsequently granted discover motion for summary judgment on these two remaining claims,thus disposing of the case.macdermid now appeals as follows first,the b dismissal in favor of discover as to a intentional infliction of emotional distress,b violation of the tennessee consumer protection act,c violation of the federal fair debt collection practices act,and d violation of the federal truth in lending act and second,the summary judgment ruling in favor of discover on his wrongful death claim.

claims dismissed on the pleadings 
i intentional infliction of emotional distress 
tennessee state courts recognize the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress,although they typically refer to this tort as outrageous conduct.see bain wells,intentional infliction of emotional distress and outrageous conduct are not two separate torts,but are simply different names for the same cause of action.regardless of chosen moniker,however,the elements of the tort are clear the conduct complained of must be intentional or reckless the conduct must be so outrageous that it is not tolerated by civilized society and the conduct complained of must result in serious mental injury.see also medlin allied inv.both parties agree that the second,whether or not discover conduct was so outrageous is primarily at issue in the instant case.
macdermid argues that discover conduct,as depicted in his complaint,was at least sufficient to state a claim for outrageous conduct under tennessee law.in particular,macdermid asserts that because discover was on notice of his wife fragile mental status,the company crossed the line between excessive but permissible pressure tactics and outrageous conduct which is intended to cause harm that is disproportionate to the creditor right to seek payment.discover counters by noting that tennessee courts have been very reluctant to find that a creditor objectionable collection methods constitute outrageous conduct.this is especially true,argues discover,in situations where,as here,the creditor is actually owed the debt in question,and where the has actually committed credit card fraud by unlawfully submitting her husband personal information over the internet to obtain the credit cards.the magistrate judge sided with discover.
we can not agree with this dismissal of the outrageous conduct claim at the b stage.while discover is correct that it was actually owed the debt in question,we disagree with its contention that macdermid was necessarily criminally liable for credit card fraud.as such,macdermid has at least stated a claim for outrageous conduct based on discover threats of criminal prosecution for failure to pay a purely civil debt.macdermid amended complaint states as follows 
the conduct,threats and statements described herein as having been made by the defendant were persistent and increasing in frequency throughout the spring of and were made to both plaintiff and decedent.as a direct and proximate result of the defendant conduct,threats and statements as described herein,the decedent required psychiatric hospitalization only a few weeks before her untimely death on june.the plaintiff will show that during telephone conversations with the defendant collection agents throughout the spring of,and culminating in the time around the decedent death,the plaintiff repeatedly warned the defendant agents of the very severely debilitated mental and physical condition of the decedent and that the condition was caused by those collection efforts,specifically the implicit and,at times,explicit threat that decedent would be jailed if the subject debt was not quickly paid.during several of the telephone calls,but at least several weeks or months prior to the decedent death,the plaintiff warned defendant agents that their continued collection efforts,including threats of criminal prosecution,would lead to the decedent death or would otherwise kill her because of the decedent debilitated mental and physical condition.
macdermid also related in his complaint a telephone conversation that he had on april,with adonica gilmore,a discover employee.because macdermid had taped the conversation,he was able to describe it in some detail in his complaint 
that she adonica gilmore had checked with the local district attorney office and had spoken with a lady named harriott who had told her that,under the facts described above,macdermid is legally liable for his wife charge card and 
that she had filed a report with the giles county sheriff office and 
that harriott barkly of the giles county district attorney office,advised her that because the macdermids were married,and because macdermid was aware of his wife problem,he should keep a better eye on her and should keep her away from the internet and 
that adonica gilmore stated about macdermid,i do think you want her going well you know and 
that there was no need for him to talk to a lawyer,because,even though there was no signature,and it was procured on the internet,macdermid application is binding on macdermid,and he is definitely liable and 
that adonica gilmore stated,if the matter could not be resolved,i just call harriott and have the authorities take a little trip out to your house.
emphasis added.
the tennessee supreme court has stated that with respect to interactions,t he general rule is that a creditor has a right to urge payment of a just debt,and to threaten to resort to proper legal procedure to enforce the obligation.hence,the creditor is not liable for a mental or emotional disturbance,or for a bodily injury or illness,as a result of his mere attempt,by reasonable means,to collect.moorhead penney,emphasis added.nevertheless,improper methods used to collect a debt may be the basis for the maintenance of an action for a mental or emotional disturbance produced thereby,or for a bodily injury or illness resulting from such mental or emotional disturbance,especially where the circumstances attending the effort to collect the claim are such as to invoke the general rule that one who wilfully or intentionally causes great emotional distress,without justification,is liable for such injuries.id.emphasis added.
macdermid leans heavily on moorhead to argue that his claim should have survived dismissal.in that case,a married couple maintained a charge account with defendant penney company.at.upon returning a piece of merchandise,the couple was assured that they would receive a credit in the sum of,and yet their next monthly statement included a charge,not a credit,for.id.the couple repeatedly called penney to point out the error,and yet they continued to receive,on an almost daily basis,threatening letters from penney and from penney collection agency demanding payment.id.at.in all,the couple received threatening letters and numerous abusive phone calls,some threatening lawsuit and others falsely impugning the husband financial reputation.id.at.in finding that penney conduct constituted outrageous conduct,the tennessee supreme court found particularly galling the fact that the letters and phone calls had continued long after defendant had acknowledged that its accounts were in error and that plaintiffs owed it nothing.id.at.the court also regarded as significant several other factors in the case the long duration of penney conduct,which was alleged to have persisted for over one year the volume of threatening letters and the threats to deliberately injure the plaintiff credit reputation and jeopardize their job security.id.much like in moorhead,macdermid argues that in this case it is difficult to conceive of any justification for a creditor threat to pursue the jailing of a mentally ill person if either she or her husband failed to pay the debt.appellant br.at.
the problem with macdermid reliance on moorhead,however,is that there the creditor was clearly without justification in pursuing collection of the debt.in fact,there was no debt at all,but rather a credit.in the instant case,in contrast,even macdermid admits that discover had a least pursue payment of the charges that macdermid had accrued.he simply alleges that they went too far in their efforts,by threatening criminal penalties for a purely civil debt,by threatening in the manner they did even when put on notice of macdermid condition,and by holding him jointly liable for the debts even though he was wholly unaware of what his wife had done.this places the instant case more squarely in the realm of cases in which a defendant creditor or collection agency was either justified in collecting the debt or at least appeared to have a reasonable as a delay in the mails or a computer error in why it continued to pursue collection of the debt.see,potts first peoples bank of jefferson county,wl.july,unreported patterson prof l adjustment,dismissing plaintiff outrageous complaint for failure to state a claim even though defendant attempted to collect a small balance through harassment,coercion,and intimidation medlin,at dismissing plaintiff outrageous conduct complaint even though mortgage lender mistakenly sent two notices of foreclosure and was abusive and insulting to plaintiffs over the telephone.
although moorhead does not provide macdermid with the firm footing he might have hoped,his claim has another,stronger leg to stand on.namely,because his complaint alleges false threats by discover employees of criminal,words to the effect of,if you do pay up i have the district attorney take a little trip to your house his case may be distinguished from most of the tennessee authorities regarding creditors attempts to collect a debt,justified or unjustified.discover maintains that criminal prosecution of macdermid was warranted because in his complaint,plaintiff admits that decedent committed credit card fraud by unlawfully submitting plaintiff personal information to obtain the credit cards from discover via the internet.appellee br.at.yet a wife submission of her husband name and social security number to obtain a credit card which appears to have been all that was required in this instance,even if she does so without his permission,does not necessarily constitute fraud.it would seem that something beyond the pleadings is required for discover to show that macdermid had in fact committed fraud against the example,via a copy of the application and an explanation of the material misrepresentations contained therein.alternatively,if discover is somehow alleging that macdermid committed fraud on her husband as opposed to the company,then we do not see how discover could reasonably suggest to macdermid that criminal fraud charges would be pursued against macdermid on his behalf,unless of course he had consented to such action 
to be sure,tennessee outrageous conduct standard,as in many states,is a formidable one.to qualify as outrageous,conduct must be so outrageous in character,and so extreme in degree,as to go beyond all bounds of decency,and to be regarded as atrocious,and utterly i ntolerable in a civilized community.doe roman catholic diocese of nashville,quoting medlin,at.t he outrageousness requirement is an exacting standard which provides the primary safeguard against fraudulent and trivial claims.id.quoting miller willbanks.nevertheless,given the allegations in macdermid complaint,and given the fact that we must construe them liberally and in a light favorable to the plaintiff,we reverse the magistrate judge b dismissal of macdermid outrageous conduct claims and remand for further proceedings.
ii violation of the tennessee consumer protection act 
the tennessee consumer protection act tcpa,ann.et,serves in part t o protect consumers and legitimate business enterprises from those who engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce in part or wholly within tennessee.messer griesheim indus.cryotech of kingsport,quoting ann.in his complaint,macdermid asserted that discover practice of soliciting,and processing,purported binding credit applications by the internet,with no mechanism for obtaining a signature of all purported obligors,causes confusion and deception to the consumer and is an inherently deceptive practice in violation of tennessee law.in its motion to dismiss,discover countered that its application method is expressly permitted by the tennessee uniform electronic transactions act,ann.et,and the federal electronic signatures in global and national commerce act,et.because the tcpa does not apply to a cts or transactions required or specifically authorized under the laws administered by,or rules and regulations promulgated by,any regulatory bodies or officers acting under the authority of this state or of the united states,ann.a,discover reasoned that it should not apply to a case where,as here,the company internet application process expressly complied with both state and federal law.
on appeal,macdermid does little to rebut discover argument as to this claim.indeed,nothing on the face of his complaint suggests that discover internet application process ran afoul of the state and federal laws governing such transactions.his conclusory allegation that the application process is inherently deceptive is not enough to survive b dismissal.see mezibov allen,cir c onclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss.macdermid also appears to insert in his brief a different allegation from that appearing in his,that it was not merely discover deceptive conduct,but also its threatening conduct,that violated the tcpa.regardless of the merits of this new argument,however,it comes too late.macdermid can not at this stage in the litigation add new allegations to his complaint,especially when he has not properly sought leave to amend the complaint as to this particular allegation.see,harvey great seneca fin,cir the appropriate method for adding new factual allegations to a complaint is not via an appellate brief,but by filing an amended complaint.
we therefore affirm magistrate judge b dismissal of macdermid tcpa claim.
iii violation of the federal truth in lending act 
the federal truth in lending act tila aims to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit,and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices.a.macdermid alleges in his complaint that discover efforts to impose civil liability on him,as well as its statement s to merchants and other persons affirming the validity of the debt,violated tila because he never signed,or reviewed,any application which contained the federally mandated disclosures.the magistrate judge quickly dismissed this tila claim because macdermid aver red that he did not apply for,accept,authorize,or utilize the credit card.mag,at.accordingly,the judge reasoned,he was not properly a consumer under thus unable to avail himself of any private cause of action under he was not party to the credit transaction.
macdermid now maintains that because he was treated by discover as a debtor on the basis of his wife credit card action,he must therefore also be a consumer under tila and afforded all of its protections.even if macdermid is correct,however,his argument asks too much,and he provides not a single case to support it.to be sure,tila requires credit card providers to disclose as terms and conditions,fees,and annual percentage the person to whom the credit is to be extended.a emphasis added.these disclosures must be made at various times at the point of application or solicitation for the credit card,c at the point of account opening,a at the of each billing cycle,b and at the point of card renewal,d.
although it appears from the record that the application listed macdermid as the primary cardholder and macdermid as an authorized buyer,joint app x at,the exact contours of their contractual obligations to discover whether individually or as a couple remain somewhat unclear to us,at least at this stage in the proceedings.regardless of the exact scenario,however,nothing in tila would seem to require a credit card company to investigate the legitimacy of an address provided in an application,especially where the two people listed on the application are in this case,indeed of the same household.we can not expect discover to have known that macdermid had schemed,unbeknownst to her husband,to create a box to which the credit card and disclosures were to be sent.macdermid certainly makes no allegation that the proper disclosures were not sent to this box.he simply alleges that discover violated tila because he did not personally receive the proper disclosures.unfortunately,this discover violated tila because it could not divine his actual no support in any law that we can discover 
we therefore affirm the magistrate judge b dismissal of macdermid tila claim 
iv violation of the federal fair debt collection practices act 
the purpose of the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa is to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors.e.the term debt collector has a particular meaning,however it refers only to persons attempting to collect debts due another.see id.a the term debt collector means any person who regularly collects or attempts to collect,directly or indirectly,debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another.see also stafford cross country bank,d,considering it that a creditor is not a debt collector for the purposes of the fdcpa and creditors are not subject to the fdcpa when collecting their accounts.
based on the fdcpa definition,discover is clearly not a debt collector rather,it is the very party to whom the debt is due.on appeal,macdermid asserts that his fdcpa claim should at least be allowed to proceed to discovery so that the exact structure and relationship of the discover representatives may be determined.this argument strikes us as logically incoherent.even if discovery were to reveal that the persons alleged to have engaged in outrageous conduct in the collection of the macdermids debt were not discover employees,but rather employees of some collection company,that would not change the fact that neither discover nor its employees are debt collectors under the fdcpa.macdermid could theoretically maintain an fdcpa action against these yet unnamed collectors,but any fdcpa action against discover would still be properly dismissed.and macdermid should probably be careful what he wishes for after all,if it were determined that discover employees were not in fact on the other end of the phone line,then most of his more colorable as wrongful death and intentional infliction of emotional not be against discover,but against the collector.macdermid only hope against discover on these facts would then be on a theory of respondeat superior liability.
we therefore affirm the magistrate judge b dismissal of macdermid fdcpa claim.
claims dismissed on summary judgment wrongful death claim 
macdermid wrongful death claim was premised on a theory of negligence in its motion for summary judgment as to this claim,discover argued not only that it owed no duty of care to macdermid,but more importantly,that macdermid suicide constituted an intervening cause serving to cut off any reasonably foreseeable link between discover actions and her untimely death.discover supported its motion with excerpts and exhibits from the deposition of macdermid,and with macdermid medical records.macdermid challenged discover intervening cause defense,relying largely on case law and the in the facts section john koomen,macdermid treating psychiatrist in the months preceding her death 
in tennessee,o ne of the rules of law that will relieve a negligent actor from liability is the doctrine of independent intervening cause.rains bend of the river.this doctrine is premised on the concept that the independent intervening cause breaks the chain of legal causation between the original negligent actor conduct and the eventual injury.id.and as the rains court noted,foreseeability is the touchstone of the independent intervening cause inquiry,because no person is expected to protect against harms from events that he or she can not reasonably antic
