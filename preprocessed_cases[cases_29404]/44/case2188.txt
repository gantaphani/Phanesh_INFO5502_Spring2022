ryan demonstrated profound injuries at birth and had an extremely low ph level of for his blood for the first ten days of his life,ryan was in a coma.ryan continued to demonstrate signs of severe damage throughout his time at the hospital until his release to his parents on april.
in may of,ryan father filed a request for champus benefits and,in that form,charles morton,chief of developmental pediatrics at wilford hall medical center in san antonio,indicated that ryan was at a high risk for spastic quadriplegia cerebral palsy and severe developmental disorders.on june,eltman,a neurologist who had been treating ryan,wrote a letter in support of the dickersons request to the air force that ryan father be assigned to an installation that could support ryan needs.in that letter,eltman gave a prognosis that ryan would suffer from mental retardation,cerebral palsy and visual impairment as well as a high likelihood of seizures as a result of his neurological injury.

the administrative damages cap in ftca cases 
the standard of review for factual determinations in a ftca case is whether the district court findings are clearly erroneous.a low united states,cir ferrero united states,cir in ftca cases the clearly erroneous standard governs our review of factual determinations,including damages.a trial court findings are clearly erroneous when,after reviewing the entire evidence,the court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.ferrero,at.
the government asserts that the dickersons claims should have been limited by b,which states 
action under this section shall not be instituted for any sum in excess of the amount of the claim presented to the federal agency,except where the increased amount is based upon newly discovered evidence not reasonably discoverable at the time of presenting the claim to the federal agency,or upon allegation and proof of intervening facts,relating to the amount of the claim.
under the above section,claimants under the ftca can not claim more than asked for in their administrative claims unless it is justified by newly discovered evidence.the government contends that the dickersons failed to meet the standard for newly discovered evidence set out in low united states,cir.

now turning to the question of whether the amount in the claim limits the dickersons recovery,in low,this court held that the question of whether damages could be increased under b presented a twofold issue.low,at.first,did the district court err in finding that the evidence as to the extent of the injuries,the prospects of recovery,the extent of recovery,and of the life expectancy could not have been discovered at the time the plaintiff filed its administrative cla
