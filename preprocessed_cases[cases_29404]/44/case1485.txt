in a case of mistaken identity,michael dwayne durham was charged and jailed in southwest virginia for more than three months before the prosecutor realized and rectified the error.as a result,durham initiated this civil action in the western district of virginia against,inter alia,officer david horner,alleging a fourth amendment claim under,plus a state law claim for malicious prosecution the district court awarded summary judgment to horner on the basis of qualified immunity,and durham appeals.see durham horner,cv,the opinion as explained below,we affirm.
in,horner was a police officer in big stone gap,virginia,and a member of the regional drug task force in performing his task force duties,horner arranged for three controlled drug buys in late through a confidential informant the ci on november,about an hour prior to the first drug buy,horner received a telephone call from the ci,who disclosed his plan to purchase illegal drugs from a man named michael dwayne durham.see opinion.the ci described the drug dealer as an old man who drove a jeep with a stolen tennessee license plate,number unknown.see.horner relayed the name michael dwayne durham to the task force office which,in turn,provided a social security number and a big stone gap post office address associated with that name.although the task force generally sought photographs of suspects,it did not secure a photo of the drug dealer 
horner used accurint,an internet investigative tool available to law enforcement agencies,to query the name michael dwayne durham,inputting the social security number obtained by the task force.the accurint report listed durham age as and his physical description,from tennessee dmv records,as,pounds,with brown hair and hazel eyes.the report reflected the big stone gap address where durham received mail from to.accurint identified other addresses for durham,including memphis,tennessee,between and,smithfield,virginia,in and between and,and a current address horn lake,mississippi,where he had moved in september.according to accurint,durham owned a jaguar,and he had been arrested once for driving while intoxicated.the report cautioned that b efore relying on any data this system supplies,it should be independently verified.
after obtaining the accurint report,horner checked vcin,another internet resource for law enforcement agencies,where he acquired durham criminal history record in mississippi.that record,from the state department of public safety,described durham as and pounds,with state convictions for possession of drug paraphernalia in february,and for public drunkenness and possession of drug paraphernalia in july.
with respect to the ci first drug buy,horner completed a csi tracking sheet,identifying the target as mike durham with the big stone gap address.he also completed a laboratory examination request for eight yellow pills believed to be percocet purchased from durham,michael dwayne on november.id.at.horner submitted the csi tracking sheet and the laboratory request to the task force for processing.
the ci two other drug buys occurred in wise county on december and.on both occasions,the ci identified the drug dealer as michael dwayne durham.the ci purchased eight yellow pills in the second drug buy and two packs of white powder believed to be methamphetamine during the third.officer horner submitted a csi tracking sheet and laboratory request to the task force for each of the latter two drug transactions.when the laboratory results confirmed that the ci had,in fact,purchased drugs in each of the three incidents,horner told the task force to go ahead and indict durham.from that point on,horner had no involvement in durham arrest and prosecution.
on may,task force agent larry mullins testified before the grand jury in wise county.an excerpt of those grand jury proceedings shows the following exchange

the juror now when you say one unit is that 
on may,the grand jury returned three indictments against michael dwayne durham relating to the three drug transactions with the ci charging him with felony drug distribution offenses.see id.as a result,the circuit court issued three separate bench warrants directing horner,or any other authorized law enforcement officer to arrest michael dwayne durham.see id.at.
nearly six months later,in november,durham,who was living in memphis,tennessee,received a letter from the social security administration notifying him that his disability benefits would be terminated due to an outstanding arrest warrant in wise county,virginia.as a result,david byard,one of durham friends,contacted the wise county sheriff department to inquire about the warrant and explain that durham had not lived in virginia for more than ten years.byard was told that durham should surrender to the authorities in memphis,and they would straighten it out.see.in december,durham surrendered to the memphis authorities,waived extradition,and was transported to the southwest virginia regional jail at duffield,virginia.
on december,durham appeared before a virginia magistrate and informed the court,inter alia,that they got the wrong person because he had never sold drugs.see.the magistrate responded,w ell,we got your address where you lived in big stone gap,virginia.id.durham replied,y es,sir,that right but what does that prove id.although the court fixed durham bail at secured,he was unable to post bond.see id.at.on december,durham appeared before the wise county circuit judge and the court appointed counsel.durham lawyer,however,waited for two months,until february,to contact his client.meanwhile,durham did not raise any mistaken identity issues with the regional jail authorities because,according to durham,they would have believed him.see id.at.when durham lawyer finally talked to his client,durham apparently explained the situation.durham remained in the regional jail for another month,however,until march,when his lawyer presented durham cell phone records to the commonwealth attorney and argued that the wrong person had been indicted and arrested.the prosecutor agreed with the defense lawyer and dismissed the three indictments against durham later that same day.
nearly two years later,on march,durham initiated this federal court civil action against the commonwealth attorney,the sheriff,and horner.the only alleged claims to survive the initial round of dispositive motions in the district court were durham claim and a state law malicious prosecution claim against horner,each predicated on an asserted violation of his fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure.horner moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity,and,on december,the district court granted judgment in his favor.in rejecting durham attempts to show factual disputes concerning horner investigation and the resulting prosecution,the court explained that,at bottom,
q ualified immunity does not protect only those police officers who are never mistaken.to have probable cause does not mean to have proof sufficient to convict.it is clear from the present record that horner acted in good faith in accord with the information available to him.that his investigation led to the very unfortunate circumstance portrayed in this case is highly regrettable,but under the law,these facts do not permit the officer to be subject to a trial for money damages.
opinion.durham has timely appealed from the district court qualified immunity ruling,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review de novo an award of summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.see lefemine wideman,cir.summary judgment is proper only if taking the evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,there is no genuine dispute of material fact,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see henry purnell,cir.
durham contends on appeal that horner was not entitled to qualified immunity because he relied on and utilized unverified information to set forth a chain of events that would lead to the indictment and arrest of the wrong individual.br.of appellant.durham emphasizes that horner knew from the accurint report that durham had not had a big stone gap address since that horner never obtained the tennessee license number to confirm whether the jeep belonged to durham that horner had not secured a photograph of durham to show the ci and confirm the drug dealer identity that horner believed the dealer was approximately sixty years old,and not,like durham,in his and that horner admitted by deposition that he was not a hundred percent certain that he had the correct michael durham.accordingly,durham maintains that horner actions were plainly incompetent,arguing that whether or not horner acted reasonably is a jury question.id.at.
as we have recognized,q ualified immunity protects officers who commit constitutional violations but who,in light of clearly established law,could reasonably believe that their actions were lawful.henry purnell,cir.hence,our qualified immunity defense involves a inquiry,asking first whether a constitutional violation occurred and second whether the right violated was clearly established.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
put succinctly,durham malicious prosecution claim fails the first step of the qualified immunity inquiry although it is not entirely clear whether there is a separate constitutional right to be free from malicious prosecution,if there is such a right,the plaintiff must demonstrate both an unreasonable seizure and a favorable termination of the criminal proceeding flowing from the seizure.snider seung lee,cir citations omitted.thus,what has been inartfully termed a malicious prosecution claim is simply a claim founded on a fourth amendment seizure that incorporates the elements of the analogous common law tort of malicious prosecution.id.internal quotation marks omitted.more specifically,we have required that the defendant have seized plaintiff pursuant to legal process that was not supported by probable cause and that the criminal proceedings have terminated in plaintiff favor.burrell virginia,f d,cir quoting brooks city of winston salem,cir alterations and emphasis omitted.
durham is unable to establish a constitutional violation because,although the underlying criminal proceedings were terminated in his favor,the prosecution was plainly supported by probable cause,as conclusively established by the three indictments.it has long since been settled by the supreme court that an indictment,fair upon its face,returned by a properly constituted grand jury,conclusively determines the existence of probable cause.gerstein pugh,internal quotation marks omitted costello united states,recognizing that grand jury indictment valid on its face,is enough to call for trial of the charge on the merits.notwithstanding the conclusive effect of the indictments,our precedents instruct that a grand jury decision to indict will not shield a police officer who deliberately supplied misleading information that influenced the decision.see,goodwin metts,cir quoting favorably jones city of chicago,cir,overruled in part by,albright oliver,see also miller prince george,f d,cir observing that the constitution did not permit a police officer with reckless disregard for the truth,to make material misrepresentations or omissions to seek an arrest warrant that would otherwise be without probable cause.
the primary problem that durham faces in this proceeding is that he was indicted by a wise county grand jury before which horner did not even testify.agent mullins was the only law enforcement officer to testify before the grand jury and,in that circumstance,horner could hardly have been the instrument of its misapprehension.indeed,we have no basis for concluding that horner tainted the grand jury process,because,other than the excerpt from agent mullins testimony referenced above,the record does not disclose the evidence that the grand jury heard and considered.nor has durham put forward any evidence to show that horner acted maliciously or conspired with agent mullins to mislead the grand jury as a result,the grand jury probable cause determinations and its three indictments were the proximate cause of durham arrest and detention,which by operation of law constituted a reasonable seizure.brooks,at recognizing that,where untainted facts support officer assessment of probable cause,seizure rendered reasonable by virtue of a probable cause determination by a neutral and detached magistrate is reasonable and break s the causal chain between the application for the warrant and the improvident arrest see also jennings patton,cir upholding award of qualified immunity to public official,despite assertion that he tainted grand jury process,because,inter alia,official did not testify before grand jury anthony baker,cir affirming verdict in favor of officer who assisted in investigation but did not testify before grand jury as there was no evidence that he conspired to taint the probable cause determinations.
even if we were disposed to look behind the indictments in this case,we would agree with the district court that horner was not plainly incompetent in assessing the probable cause issue.as we have recognized,f or probable cause to exist,there need only be enough evidence to warrant the belief of a reasonable officer that an offense has been or is being committed evidence sufficient to convict is not required.brown gilmore,cir analyzing false arrest claim under fourth amendment unreasonable seizure framework.put simply,there was ample evidence for a reasonable law enforcement officer to believe that durham was involved in the three drug transactions namely,the ci had on three occasions identified the drug dealer as michael dwayne durham durham had a big stone gap address the drug dealer had a vehicle with tennessee license plates durham had a tennessee driver license and durham criminal history included two convictions.contrary to durham assertions,horner was not required to exhaust every potentially exculpatory lead or resolve every doubt about durham guilt before probable cause was established.see miller,at internal quotation marks omitted.nevertheless,even if the existence of probable cause were a close question,the qualified immunity standard gives ample room for mistaken judgments.henry,at internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,qualified immunity protects public officials from bad guesses in gray areas.maciariello sumner,cir.
in sum,durham is unable to establish that his seizure was pursuant to legal process that was not supported by probable cause,burrell,at,and he has not shown the essential constitutional violation underlying a claim because there was,as a matter of law,probable cause for durham arrest and detention,his state law malicious prosecution claim fails as well.see lewis kei,affirming dismissal of state law malicious prosecution claim where plaintiff failed to allege essential element of lack of probable cause.
pursuant to the foregoing,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
when viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,the evidence in this case could support a finding that,as a result of officer horner failure to perform his duties competently and thoroughly,michael dwayne durham durham was wrongfully indicted,arrested,and incarcerated.because i would find that officer horner mistaken conclusion regarding durham identity can not be deemed objectively reasonable as a matter of that,by turn,he is therefore not entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law i must respectfully dissent.
