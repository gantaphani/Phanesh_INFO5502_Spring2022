this appeal comes to the court after what the district court described as a rather long and tortured factual history.several orders are on appeal dismissal grant of summary judgment denial of a motion pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e and denial of a motion pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.as explained in greater detail below,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand with instructions.
according to the complaint,in the hours of july,police officers assaulted marqus stevenson,gary barnett,and christopher howard collectively,appellants outside of a nightclub in prince george county,maryland the county.appellants claim that the attack was unprovoked.among the officers present at the altercation were officer lavance lowery of the city of seat pleasant,maryland seat pleasant,and officer rickie adey of the county.officer lowery was the only seat pleasant officer present,but there were multiple county officers present.although none of appellants were able to identify which individual officers assaulted them,it is undisputed that officer lowery arrested stevenson.the merits of that arrest,however,are contested.
on july,appellants sued officer adey and officer lowery in their official and individual capacities and the county and seat pleasant on the theory of vicarious liability.although appellants complaint mentions other unidentified police officers when describing the events surrounding the assault,those officers were not named as defendants.the complaint contained six counts excessive brutality excessive force,battery,intentional infliction of emotional distress,false arrest,a count under for deprivation of civil rights,and a count under articles and of the maryland constitution.the defendants each moved for partial or total dismissal of the counts against them,which appellants did not oppose after dismissal,the following counts remained as to officer adey,excessive force and battery as to the county,the maryland constitutional count and as to officer lowery,the count.all counts against seat pleasant were dismissed.as is relevant for purposes of this appeal,the count states as follows 
plaintiffs further allege that defendants lowery and adey,with deliberate indifference to and reckless disregard for the safety and of the plaintiffs,and in violation of the and amendments to the constitution,did on july,commit or allow to be committed an unreasonable seizure which deprived the plaintiffs of their constitutional rights without affording them due process of law.
as a direct and proximate result of the unreasonable actions of defendants lowery and adey,marqus stevenson was subjected to an unlawful seizure when he was arrested without probable cause and all of the plaintiffs were subjected to an unreasonable seizure when they all were subjected to unreasonable and unwarranted force.
officer adey,officer lowery,and the county collectively,appellees subsequently moved for summary judgment,which appellants opposed.the district court held a hearing on the motions on december,at which time it granted appellees motions in their entireties except as to the count against officer lowery by stevenson.as to the other counts,the district court determined that there was no credible evidence to show that officer adey and officer lowery assaulted any of appellants and,absent such a showing with respect to officer adey,the county could not be liable on the theory of vicarious liability.finally,the district court stated the following at the summary judgment hearing with respect to appellants theory of bystander liability 
bystander liability was not pled in this case.there was no pleading indicating that an officer who had control of the situation observed people in violation of the recognition of that as a cause of action and failed to do something about it.and to allow this to be pled and asserted for the first time in response to a summary judgment motion,when it has been pled and has been explored in discovery,is not going to be considered by the court.
following the hearing,the district court entered a written order on december,respecting summary judgment.
on january,appellants moved pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e to alter or amend the district court ruling on summary judgment.specifically,appellants contended that,inter alia,they had sufficiently stated a cause of action for bystander liability.the district court denied appellants motion on may.in doing so,the court stated that it does not dispute that bystander liability is a cognizable theory under.however,appellants utterly failed to plead this theory or otherwise provide fair notice to appellees that they sought liability on this theory.
a jury trial was held from may to june,on the sole count of stevenson claim against officer lowery.officer lowery moved for judgment at the end of stevenson presentation of the case and again after he presented his own case,and the district court reserved judgment on both motions.then,during the rebuttal closing argument,stevenson attorney mentioned bystander liability,and officer lowery attorney objected.the district court allowed the reference to bystander liability,and the case was submitted to the jury.during deliberations,the jury submitted the following question to the court does excessive force require contact or if a police officer does not intervene in the use of excessive force is that consider ed excessive force the court then brought the jury back into the courtroom,instructed the jury on bystander liability,and allowed officer lowery to stevenson argument.the jury ultimately found that officer lowery violated stevenson constitutional rights by using excessive force and awarded to stevenson damages in the amount of.
after the trial,officer lowery moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b on the grounds that bystander liability had not been pleaded and was improperly injected into the case at closing argument.the district court held a hearing on officer lowery motion on january,at which time the court determined that paragraphs and of the complaint did sufficiently state a cause of action for bystander liability,thus changing course from its ruling at summary judgment.the court stated 
with the vision of hindsight,i believe that i probably overstated things in my may ruling in concluding that appellants utterly failed to plead bystander liability because they did indicate in the relevant paragraph of the complaint that the defendants,with deliberate indifference to and reckless disregard for the safety and of stevenson did,on july,commit or allow to be committed an unreasonable seizure i think with the vision of hindsight i would have to say that bystander liability was pled.
i believe that i have made an error,and i would rather fix it myself than have the fourth circuit do it.
although officer lowery did not ask for a new trial in his motion,the district court granted officer lowery motion and ordered a new trial pursuant to its authority under rule b.the court stated that,at the new trial,the theory of bystander liability will be front and center.prior to a second trial,however,officer lowery and stevenson reached a settlement agreement.
on may,appellants moved pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b to vacate the district court may,order as it pertained to bystander liability.appellants argued that,in light of the district court determination that they had sufficiently pleaded bystander liability,each of appellants was entitled to a trial for bystander liability against officer adey and the county,and howard and barnett were also entitled to a trial for bystander liability against officer lowery.the district court denied appellants rule b motion on the grounds that there is no mistake or injustice that justifies vacating the may,order and because the rule b motion was not timely filed.on this latter point,the district court ruled that the rule b motion was effectively a motion to vacate the written summary judgment order dated december,and that the limitations period applicable to rule b motions had expired.
on august,the district court entered an order respecting officer lowery and stevenson settlement agreement and dismissing all claims.appellants subsequently timely filed a notice of appeal pertaining to the district court grant of appellees unopposed motions to dismiss the grant of summary judgment to appellees the denial of appellants rule e motion and the denial of appellants rule b motion.this court has jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to.
before reaching the merits of the several orders on appeal,we must first sort out what issues remain before the court.because none of the orders on appeal either adjudicated all the claims or the rights and liabilities of all the parties or included an express determin ation that there was no just reason for delaying final judgment,each of the orders listed in appellants notice of appeal did not become ripe for appeal prior to the district court august,order dismissing all claims against officer lowery thus,each order is properly before the court from a procedural standpoint.see.b see also fox balt.city police dep t,cir we lack jurisdiction to review a district court order unless that order constitutes a final judgment ordinarily,a district court order is not final until it has resolved all claims as to all parties.
appellants,however,presented no arguments in their brief against the district court order granting appellees and seat pleasant unopposed motions for partial and total dismissal.accordingly,even though appellants listed the february,dismissal order in their notice of appeal,appellants waived any challenge regarding the dismissal of all counts against seat pleasant,all counts but the count against officer lowery,all counts but the excessive force and battery counts against officer adey,and all counts but the maryland constitutional count against the county see canady crestar mortg,cir issues raised in notice of appeal but not briefed on appeal are deemed waived.
the remaining three orders on appeal summary judgment,the denial of appellants rule e motion,and the denial of appellants rule b motion present a host of issues that we consider in turn,beginning with the sufficiency of the complaint with respect to bystander liability.although the standards for reviewing the aforementioned orders are different,compare henry purnell,cir en banc decision on summary judgment reviewed de novo,with robinson wix filtration,cir decision on rule e motion reviewed for an abuse of discretion,and eberhardt integrated design,cir decision on rule b motion reviewed for abuse of discretion,appellants notice of appeal evinced a clear intent to review the summary judgment order itself,and thus our review is de novo.see brown french,cir d esignation of a postjudgment motion in the notice of appeal is adequate to support a review of the final judgment when the intent to do so is clear.
this court recognizes a cause of action for bystander liability premised on a law officer duty to uphold the law and protect the public from illegal acts,regardless of who commits them.randall prince george,cir.to succeed on a theory of bystander liability,a plaintiff must demonstrate that a officer knew that a fellow officer was violating an individual constitutional rights ha d a reasonable opportunity to prevent the harm and cho se not to act.id.at footnote omitted.as quoted in its entirety above and stated in relevant part here,paragraph of the complaint alleges that officer lowery and officer adey did on july,commit or allow to be committed an unreasonable seizure which deprived the plaintiffs of their constitutional rights without affording them due process of law.emphasis added.appellants maintain on appeal that this language sufficiently states a cause of action for bystander liability,whereas appellees contend that the district court erred in determining,that bystander liability had been sufficiently pleaded the entire time and that they were put on notice of appellants claim.
in general,whether a complaint sufficiently states a claim upon which relief can be granted is governed by the supreme court plausibility pleading framework.see ashcroft iqbal,d bell atl.twombly,d.both iqbal and twombly,however,pertain to whether a complaint contains sufficient factual matter to proceed beyond dismissal.see iqbal,at a claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.twombly,at w e do not require heightened fact pleading of specifics,but only enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.here,none of appellees moved to dismiss the count of the complaint for insufficient factual detail.rather,officer lowery answered the count officer adey moved to dismiss the count on the theories that the arrest of stevenson was lawful and that the fifth amendment applies to the federal government only and not to state governments or political subdivisions and the county moved for dismissal on the theory that,pursuant to monell department of social services,d,municipal governments can not be held vicariously liable for constitutional violations committed by their employees unless the employees were acting pursuant to a policy or custom,and the county does not endorse a policy or custom whereby its employees violate others constitutional rights.
further,appellees did not raise the sufficiency of the pleading in the count with respect to bystander liability until their reply to appellants opposition to the motions for summary judgment.and even then,appellees did not argue that the complaint contained insufficient factual matter rather,in written reply and at the summary judgment hearing,appellees contended only that they were never put on notice of appellants legal theory of bystander liability.accordingly,the factual pleading framework of is largely inapplicable here,as appellees argument is that appellants failed to connect the dots in their complaint not that the complaint itself contains insufficient factual information from which to draw reasonable inferences.
appellees raise two principal arguments against the district court ruling that bystander liability was sufficiently pleaded in the count paragraphs and of the complaint.we address these arguments in turn,reviewing the district court ruling de novo.see teachers ret.hunter,cir standard of review regarding the legal sufficiency of a complaint.
appellees first challenge to the complaint sufficiency with respect to bystander liability is that the phrase bystander liability appeared nowhere in the complaint.appellants,however,were not required to use any precise or magical words in their pleading.see,sansotta town of nags head,cir we see no reason why the plaintiffs needed to use any special phrasing in their complaint,as this complaint gave the defendant fair notice of the plaintiffs claims.du pont de nemours kolon,cir rejecting the argument that a cause of action for price discrimination had not been sufficiently pleaded because the counterclaimant did not use the phrase price discrimination in its counterclaim see also okoli city of baltimore,cir s sexual harassment complaints need not include magic words such as sex or sexual to be effective.citing cases labram havel,cir legal labels characterizing a claim can not,standing alone,determine whether it fails to meet the standard for notice pleading pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a.our sister circuits have reached the same conclusion regarding whether precise or specific words must be present to sufficiently state a cause of action.see,segal fifth third bank,cir courts may look to they must look to the substance of a complaint allegations otherwise,statutory enforcement would be reduce d to a formalistic search through the pages of the complaint for magic words united states davis,cir plaintiff need not have used the magic word declaratory judgment in its pleading to put the defendants on notice that its claims could be resolved with a grant of declaratory relief.
