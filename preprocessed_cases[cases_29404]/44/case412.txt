this case is part of a lengthy dispute between diva,diva,an adult entertainment bar located in bangor,maine,dianne,the owner of diva,and appellee city of bangor,maine.also involved in the instant action are various bangor government officials in their official and individual capacities collectively,individual appellees.we decide today an appeal from two district court orders which together dismissed all of appellants claims,affirming in part and reversing and remanding in part.
statutory background 
there are several ordinances and statutes involved in this dispute.the first is bangor city code bangor code chapter on public morals.chapter contains a provision that regulates the location of commercial establishments offering nude dancing.see bangor code.that section provides that establishments offering nude entertainment can only be located in certain zoned districts,and that operators of a commercial establishment offering nude entertainment must obtain a certificate of occupancy,which will not be granted if the establishment is located within feet of a litany of establishments including another nude entertainment establishment,an establishment licensed to sell alcohol,a church,school,public park,public library,or district diva can not obtain a certificate of occupancy without a variance as it is located within feet of a church chapter also regulates the operation of nude establishments by prohibiting such establishments from serving alcohol.see bangor code c.
the second provision of the bangor code at issue here applies to establishments that sell alcohol in conjunction with the provision of entertainment.see bangor code chapter.a liquor licensee desiring to have live entertainment,that is,dancing or music performed by something other than a mechanical device,must apply for a special amusement permit pursuant to article ii of chapter of the bangor code although an applicant may properly seek a special amusement permit for dancing,the dancing can not be nude entertainment,as defined by bangor code chapter.this means,in essence,that female dancers in an establishment that serves alcohol must,in addition to not violating the provisions of chapter,have their buttocks and the areola area of their breasts covered with an opaque covering 
with this background in mind,we turn to the history of diva.
ii.factual 
diva opened as nude dancing establishment and juice bar in.in,bangor amended chapter of the bangor code to add,inter alia,the provision prohibiting nude entertainment establishments from being located within feet of a church.because diva is located next to a church,it is unable to obtain a certificate of occupancy without being granted a variance diva challenged the ordinance in the maine superior court and lost.diva appealed the superior court decision,but entered into a settlement agreement settlement agreement before the appeal was decided.in the settlement agreement,the city of bangor gave diva the right to continue to operate as a nude dancing establishment,essentially in violation of the new section,until may.in return,diva agreed to withdraw the appeal,cease nude dancing on its premises on or before may,and to never challenge the constitutionality or validity of bangor code chapter as written at the time of the settlement in any forum.
in anticipation of the may,deadline,diva began the process of converting into a bikini lounge that is,an establishment that would serve alcohol in conjunction with dancing diva applied for a liquor license and special amusement permit which would allow it to provide live dancing and musical entertainment in conjunction with the provision of alcohol.
on may,as part of the permitting process,the city council of bangor city council held a public hearing.although the city council approved the permit for the liquor license,it denied the special amusement permit.as entitled by statute,diva requested a written explanation of the reasoning for the denial of the special amusement permit,and the city council responded by stating in writing that it was concerned that the bikini lounge would soon revert back to a nude dancing establishment in violation of sections and of the bangor code,and that granting the permit would negatively affect public health,safety and welfare.
in response,diva and appealed the decision of the city council to the bangor board of appeals and filed a federal lawsuit against the city of bangor in the united states district court for the district of maine federal district court.on june,the bangor board of appeals reversed the decision of the city council and on june,issued an order granting the special amusement permit for the bikini lounge.
one day later,on june,diva and invited the public to witness an act of civil disobedience.when the invitees arrived,they observed the diva dancers performing in pasties and underwear,in violation of bangor code section for liquor licensees because the dancers exposed their buttocks.
the city of bangor responded by filing a civil enforcement action against diva in the state of maine district court state district court for violating bangor code sections and.diva moved to dismiss,arguing,inter alia,that bangor code sections and as written violated the first and fourteenth amendments to the federal constitution.on august,the maine district court denied diva motion.
diva and subsequently were permitted to amend their federal complaint amended complaint to include as defendants the mayor of bangor and the city council members who voted against granting diva a special amusement permit.the amended complaint also asserted a facial challenge to the constitutionality of bangor code section and several claims under collectively,count one a state law breach of contract claim alleging that the city of bangor had violated the settlement agreement by denying the special amusement permit count two a claim alleging tortious interference with diva and ability to contract with talent,support staff and vendors count three a claim that appellees had conspired to violate diva and constitutional rights in violation of count four and an intentional infliction of emotional distress claim on behalf of individually count five.the claims requested monetary,declarative,punitive and injunctive relief.
the city of bangor and the individual appellees moved to dismiss,and,while the motion to dismiss was pending in federal court,trial was held on october,in the state court civil enforcement action against diva.the state district court decided in favor of the city of bangor,and diva appealed the decision to the supreme judicial court of maine.on december,the federal district court dismissed diva and claims contained in counts two breach of contract,three tortious interference,four section conspiracy,and five intentional infliction of emotional distress.the district court also dismissed appellants section claims contained in count one against the individual appellees in their individual capacities,and determined that lacked standing to pursue individually the section claim portion of count one.this left only diva and facial challenge to bangor code section and diva section claim against the city of bangor and the individual appellees in their official capacities.
as to diva and challenge to the facial constitutionality of bangor code section,the federal district court raised the issue of abstention sua sponte,and concluded that principles of comity dictate that it should abstain from deciding the facial constitutionality of the bangor code section because there was an ongoing state proceeding against diva to enforce that provision.the court also found that comity dictated that it refrain from deciding whether diva had given up the right to challenge the facial constitutionality of the bangor code provisions by signing the settlement agreement the court then dismissed the facial challenge portion of count one.
as to diva section challenge portion of count one against the city of bangor and the individual appellees in their official capacities,the federal district court issued a stay pending the maine supreme judicial court decision in the state court enforcement proceeding.
on april,the maine supreme judicial court issued its decision in the enforcement action upholding the constitutionality of bangor code sections and,and finding diva liable for violation of those provisions.see city of bangor diva,me.on april,the federal district court issued an order requesting the parties to file a short written submission discussing the effects of the state court decision on the remaining section challenge against the city of bangor and the individual appellees in their official capacities.the city of bangor and the individual appellees filed a submission,but diva declined to do so.
on june,the federal district court dismissed the remaining portion of count one.in ruling on that motion,the federal district court stated that plaintiff federal free speech claim can succeed only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues before it,and t he doctrine prohibits district courts from ruling on federal claims where the ruling would effectively defeat or negate a state judgment to which the federal claimant was a party.the federal district court went on to state that diva had ample opportunity to pursue its fourteenth amendment objection to the licensing procedures before the state court,and because it did not present its claims in the state court proceeding,the doctrine also precludes federal court review.
judgment entered in favor of appellees on june,and diva and filed this timely appeal of both the december,and june,orders of dismissal.
ii.analysis 
we engage in plenary review of the district court allowance of a motion to dismiss,accepting all facts as true and making all reasonable inferences in favor of the appellants.rockwell cape cod,cir.we begin our review with the district court order of dismissal dated december,leaving that order discussion of count one for last,and then conclude with our review of the dismissal of the remainder of count one as contained in the june,order.
count two breach of contract 
the substance of the appellants breach of contract claim is that it was a breach of the settlement agreement for the city of bangor to deny diva application for a special amusement is,that the appellees breached their obligation not to frustrate,retard,or disallow the plaintiff ability to practice her art form,consistent with the terms of the agreement.on appeal,the appellants raise only a procedural challenge to the district court order of dismissal they argue that the district court improperly dismissed their breach of contract claim because the second amended complaint pled all the elements necessary to state a claim for breach of contract and that the court transcended the applicable scope of review when it considered the settlement document in rendering its decision on the motion to dismiss.the appellants are incorrect.
the city of bangor attached a copy of the settlement agreement to its motion to dismiss.and,although o rdinarily,a court may not consider any documents that are outside of the complaint,or not expressly incorporated therein,unless the motion is converted into one for summary judgment,alternative energy,paul fire marine ins,cir,u nder first circuit precedent,when a complaint factual allegations are expressly linked admittedly dependent document the authenticity of which is not challenged,then the court can review it upon a motion to dismiss.id.at quoting beddall state bank trust,cir.here,the appellants claim that the appellees breached the settlement agreement is dependent on the scope of the settlement agreement,and thus,that document was properly considered by the district court.furthermore,the settlement agreement provides only that the city of bangor would permit diva to operate as a nude entertainment establishment until may,in violation of the amended bangor code section.there is nothing in the settlement agreement that explicitly or implicitly creates a contract between the parties with regards to a special amusement permit.the appellants have failed to state claim for breach of contract.
counts three and five state tort claims 
appellants next challenge the dismissal of the two state tort claims against the city of bangor and the individual appellees count three alleging tortious interference with diva and contracts with talent,support staff and vendors and count five,alleging,on behalf of only,intentional infliction of emotional distress.we do not address the substance of either claim,however,because the district court correctly determined that all of the appellees enjoy immunity under the maine tort claims act.see,b.the maine tort claims act provides statutorily created absolute immunity for the city of bangor and individual appellees from suit for claims which result from u ndertaking or failing to undertake any judicial or act,including,but not limited to,the granting or refusal to grant a permit.id.the district court dismissal of the state tort claims is affirmed.
count four violation of 
appellants next allege that appellees conspired to violate their first and fourteenth amendment constitutional rights in violation of.section creates a private cause of action for injuries occasioned when two or more persons conspire for the purpose of depriving,either directly or indirectly,any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws,or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws.burns state police ass of,cir quoting.in griffin breckenridge,d,the supreme court clarified that in order to state a claim under section,the plaintiff must,among other requirements,allege that the conspiratorial conduct of which he complains is propelled by some racial,or perhaps otherwise,invidiously discriminatory animus.aulson blanchard,cir quoting griffin,at.
the district court,in dismissing appellants section claim,found that plaintiffs fail to state animus on the part of defendants,and indeed,the court does not perceive any class into which the plaintiffs might fall.the district court went on to find that even if it were to assume,arguendo,that plaintiffs had claimed that they belonged to a class of purveyors of adult entertainment for purposes,that class would be fatally indeterminate in that it is,at best,a vague and amorphous grouping of individuals.on appeal,appellants do not advance the argument that their class is one of purveyors of adult entertainment,and therefore we deem that argument waived.see van haaren state farm mut.auto.ins,cir a rguments neither presented to the district court nor presented in appellant opening brief on appeal are deem ed waived.instead,appellants state in their opening brief that 
the complaint alleges that cormier is a woman.women are a protected class of persons under.because the court is obliged to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants,the court erred in finding that the plaintiff fatally excluded reference to a protectable class.
citation omitted.in support of this argument against dismissal,appellants cite to paragraph of their amended complaint,which states that 
the plaintiff enjoys a right to free speech and expression in the presentation and performance of her art form of dancing recognized under the first amendment to the united states constitution,and erie pap,tbda kandyland,d.
emphasis added.we presume that it is appellant contention that by using the feminine possessive pronoun her in paragraph of the amended complaint,she has alleged that the state animus she has suffered is a result of her being a member of the class of women in general we find this argument unpersuasive.
first,even under the most liberal of pleading standards,using a possessive pronoun that signals that the appellant is a woman is insufficient to set forth an allegation that she suffered animus because she belongs to the class of women.second,appellant has failed to allege in her complaint any facts that the individual appellees conspired against her because she was a woman as opposed to her being,for example,a purveyor of nude entertainment,regardless of her gender.appellants have failed to state a claim under section.
count one section and facial challenge 
as previously mentioned,the district court construed the appellants count one as being comprised of two separate counts a section claim and a challenge to the facial constitutionality of section of the bangor code.in its december,order,the district court addressed first whether count one of the complaint stated a claim under section against the individual appellees in their individual capacities,and concluded in the negative.the district court next addressed whether appellant had standing in her personal capacity to pursue a claim against the city of bangor and the individual appellees in their official capacities,and similarly concluded in the negative.this left only diva section claim against the city of bangor and the individual appellees in their official capacities and its facial challenge to the constitutionality of the bangor code section.
the district court then raised the issue of younger abstention sua sponte and dismissed the facial challenge to the bangor code under principles of comity as to the remaining claim,diva section claim attacking the propriety of the city council denial of its permit application,the district court,in its december,order,raised the issue of colorado river abstention sua sponte and stayed its decision of that claim pending the outcome of the state enforcement action.the appellants do not challenge on appeal the district court decision to abstain from deciding the section claim until after the state court decision,and make no mention of the district court decision to exercise younger abstention and dismiss the facial challenge to section.thus,we review de novo the district court december,decision to dismiss the claims against the individual appellants in their individual capacities dismiss as a plaintiff for lack of standing and its june,decision to dismiss the remaining section claims under the doctrine.we treat as waived any challenges appellants may have to the district court dismissal of the facial challenge to section under principles of younger abstention and the district court decision to stay its decision on the section claim until the maine supreme judicial court decided the city of bangor enforcement action against diva.see,smilow southwestern bell mobile,cir issues raised on appeal in a perfunctory manner or not at all are waived.
individual appellees in their individual capacities 
the district court found that the individual appellees enjoyed both absolute and qualified immunity for their actions during the permitting process.the district court justification for finding absolute immunity was that the city council members had acted in both a and legislative capacity.we agree that the officials enjoy absolute immunity from personal liability because they were acting in a capacity when they denied the special amusement permit,and thus,we do not need to determine whether the officials are qualifiedly immune for their actions or whether they are absolutely immune because their actions were also legislative in nature.
we must take a functional approach to determining whether the city council members are absolutely immune from suit for their denial of the special amusement permit.see destek group,state of pub.util.comm n,cir.and,even though the city council members at various times may perform legislative,executive and judicial functions,each of which may entitle the official to a different level of immunity,the functional approach to immunity requires that actions taken in the performance of a particular function are to be accorded the level of immunity appropriate to that function.bettencourt bd.of registration,cir citing scott cent.me.power,emphasis in scott.
in bettencourt,at,we described the analysis for determining whether an official has engaged in a act 
proper analysis involves answering three questions,each designed to determine how closely analogous the adjudicatory experience of a board member is to that of a judge.first,does a board member,like a judge,perform a traditional adjudicatory function,in that he decides facts,applies law,and otherwise resolves disputes on the merits free from direct political influence second,does a board member,like a judge,decide cases sufficiently controversial that,in the absence of absolute immunity,he would be subject to numerous damages actions third,does a board member,like a judge,adjudicate disputes against a backdrop of multiple safeguards designed to protect the complaining party rights 
here,first,the council members performed an adjudicatory function when they reviewed and voted on diva special amusement permit they held a hearing,heard testimony,asked questions,discussed the matter,made their decision,and then provided a written explanation of their reasoning.second,the act of denying a special amusement permit can be controversial,and can prompt litigation,as it did in this case.without the proper protection from personal liability,it would be extremely difficult to get people to serve as city council members.bogan,d t he threat of liability may significantly deter service in local government,where prestige and pecuniary rewards may pale in comparison to the threat of civil liability.lastly,there are procedural safeguards that operate to protect a special amusement permit applicant from the violation of its constitutional rights.indeed,this case presents a perfect example diva exercised its statutory right to request a written explanation of the reasons justifying the council denial of the special amusement permit,see bangor code,and appeal the decision to the bangor board of appeals,see bangor code.as a result of the appeal,the faulty decision of the city council was reversed,and diva received its special amusement permit.the process worked.and,if diva had lost its appeal to the bangor board of appeals,it had recourse to the maine state courts,see bangor code.
to the extent that the appellants amended complaint raises a claim against the individual appellees in their individual capacities,the district court was correct to grant their motion to dismiss,because the city council members are absolutely immune in their personal capacities from a suit arising from their denial of the special amusement permit.
lack of standing 
the district court next dismissed as a plaintiff in the remaining section claims.article iii of the constitution confines the federal courts to deciding actual cases and controversies.cotter city of boston,cir.in order to establish article iii standing,a plaintiff must have a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy.baker carr,d.and,a ctions to enforce corporate rights or redress injuries to a corporation can not be maintained by a stockholder in his own name even though the injury to the corporation may incidentally result in the depreciation or destruction of the value of the stock.pignato dein host,cir quoting brictson woodrough,cir.this standing rule applies even when there is only one shareholder in a corporation.see id.and,although we have not yet had the opportunity to explicitly state,we join the circuits who have already addressed the issue to hold that this standing requirement also applies to actions brought to redress injuries to a corporation under section.see potthoff morin,cir holding that the shareholder standing rule applies to civil rights actions brought pursuant to flynn merrick,cir holding that filing suit under does not diminish the requirement that the shareholder suffer some individual,direct injury.gregory mitchell,cir extending shareholder standing rule to civil rights actions under erlich glasner,cir finding nothing in the civil rights act which would permit a to circumvent the rule that even though a stockholder owns all,or practically all,of the stock in a corporation,such a fact of itself does not authorize him to sue as an individual.
here,appellant does not allege any injury,separate from the injury to diva,resulting from her claim that the appellees violated section when they acted under color of state law to deny diva the special amusement permit in violation of the first and fourteenth amendments.as the district court correctly determined,once it dismissed all but the section claim of the second amended complaint,appellant no longer had ar
