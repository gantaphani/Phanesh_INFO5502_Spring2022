this suit presents a novel but flawed legal theory applied to admittedly tragic facts.robert johnson,a prison guard in bishopville,south carolina,was shot multiple times in his home.the ensuing investigation revealed that the attack was ordered by an inmate at the prison where johnson worked using a contraband cell phone.johnson survived the attack and,with his wife,later brought suit.the johnsons did not,however,sue the typical defendants,the shooter or any prison inmate or employee.rather,the johnsons sued several cellular phone service providers and owners of cell phone towers.according to the johnsons,these defendants are liable for johnson injuries because they were aware that their services facilitated the illegal use of cellphones by prison inmates and yet failed to take steps to curb that use.
in this appeal by the johnsons,we address two issues whether the district court properly concluded that it had federal jurisdiction over the johnsons claims and if so,whether the district court properly dismissed the johnsons claims on the merits.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment.
captain robert johnson was an employee of the lee correctional institution in lee county,south carolina.as a correctional officer,johnson was responsible for seizing cell phones and other contraband from inmates.
in march,an assailant entered johnson home and shot him six times in the chest and stomach.his wife,mary johnson,witnessed the attack.johnson survived but underwent eight surgeries and months of rehabilitation.
the attorney for the district of south carolina concluded after a thorough investigation that a group of inmates ordered the attack in retaliation for johnson prior confiscation of their contraband cell phones and other goods the attorney further found that an unnamed inmate had used a cell phone to communicate with the shooter,sean echols.that inmate also paid echols.echols eventually pleaded guilty to conspiracy to use interstate facilities in under a.united states echols,cv jfa,judgment of the district court.
in february,the johnsons filed suit in south carolina state court seeking to recover under negligence and loss of consortium theories.they seek to recover against two groups of defendants wireless service providers and owners of towers that lease space to those providers for the provisions of wireless service the johnsons alleged that both sets of defendants were aware of the illegal use of cellphones by inmates using signals emitted and received at the defendants towers and that this use created an unreasonable risk of harm to others.appellants br.at.the johnsons sought compensatory and punitive damages.
the defendants timely removed the case to federal court,asserting both federal question jurisdiction under and complete diversity under.in april,the johnsons moved to remand the case to state court.the district court denied the johnsons motion on two grounds.first,the district court concluded it had federal question jurisdiction because the federal communications act communications act completely preempted all of the johnsons state law claims.second,the district court found that it had diversity jurisdiction because the only defendants were fraudulently joined and the amount in controversy exceeded.
on june,the district court consolidated the defendants motions to dismiss and granted the motion under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.it did so for three reasons the johnsons claims were barred by express and conflict preemption south carolina law did not impose a duty on defendants to prevent inmates from illegally using their cell phone services and the johnsons claims were implausible and so did not meet pleading standards.this appeal followed.
the johnsons contend that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over their state law claims,and thus erred in denying their motion to remand.we review questions of subject matter jurisdiction de novo,including questions related to the propriety of removal.lontz tharp,cir.as set forth below,we find that the communications act does not completely preempt the johnsons claims.accordingly,the district court erred in finding the existence of federal question jurisdiction.nevertheless,because the district court properly exercised jurisdiction on the basis of diversity of citizenship of the parties,however,we affirm the district court denial of the johnsons motion to remand.
we first consider whether the district court correctly found federal question jurisdiction.the district court determined it had jurisdiction on this basis because the johnsons claims were completely preempted by the communications act.in doing so,the district court relied on three provisions of the act section,the act preemption provision and sections and,which when read in conjunction allow private parties to recover damages resulting from a common carrier breach of its obligation to ensure that all practices for and in connection with communication service are just and reasonable.b.this was error.
at the outset,we note that complete preemption only applies in a very narrow range of cases.marcus v.at t,cir.the limited applicability of the complete preemption doctrine is evidenced by the fact that the supreme court has only approved its use in three areas,none of them pertinent to the communications act.id.in fact,we have recognized a presumption against finding complete preemption.lontz,at citing custer sweeney,cir.this presumption of course a rebuttable one exists,in part,because f ederalism concerns strongly counsel against imputing to congress an intent to displace a whole panoply of state law in a certain area absent some clearly expressed direction.custer,at quoting painters of phila.dist.council welfare fund price waterhouse,cir.
the foundation of the district court complete preemption finding is of the communications act.see c a n o state or local government shall have any authority to regulate the entry of or the rates charged by any commercial mobile service or any private mobile service farina nokia,cir the fcc jurisdiction extends to wireless telephone service,and fcc authority over the technical aspects of radio communications is exclusive.citations omitted.as set forth in section,infra,we agree that section expressly preempts the johnsons claims on the merits.but complete preemption and express preemption are different animals.
complete preemption and ordinary preemption on the merits are not as close kin jurisprudentially as their names suggest.lontz,at.unlike ordinary preemption,which does not create federal subject matter jurisdiction,complete preemption has the effect of transform ing a cause of action into one arising under federal law because congress has occupied the field so thoroughly as to leave no room for causes of action at all.caterpillar williams.put differently,complete preemption is a jurisdictional doctrine,while ordinary preemption simply declares the primacy of federal law,regardless of the forum or the claim.lontz,at.complete preemption applies only when congress has clearly manifested an intent to make causes of action removable to federal court.metro.life ins.taylor.
as we have repeatedly recognized,the sine qua non of complete preemption is a federal cause of action that can be brought in the district courts in re blackwater sec.consulting,llc,cir quoting lontz,at.indeed,the supreme court has emphasized that for the purposes of complete preemption,the preempting statute must provide the exclusive cause of action for claims in the area that the statute preempts.beneficial bank anderson,emphasis added.the district court relied on and of the communications act,which,in the district court view,provide a federal cause of action that is the exclusive remedy for the johnsons claims,we disagree.
as an initial matter,and allow recovery only against common carriers.under the communications act,common carriers are entities that must provide transmission service s to the public without discrimination and are heavily regulated by the fcc.pinney nokia,cir citation omitted.the parties do not contend that the tower owners provide any wireless service,and we therefore conclude that these defendants can not be treated as common carriers.as a result,they can not be sued under sections and.
on the other hand,the wireless service provider defendants are common carriers and so can be sued under and.but nothing suggests that congress intended these sections to provide the exclusive remedy for the johnsons claims against those defendants.see beneficial bank,at.rather,the communication act savings clause suggests just the opposite.nothing in this chapter contained shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute,but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies.as we have held,this savings clause counsels against a finding that congress intended to sweep aside all state claims in a particular area.pinney,at.this conclusion is consistent with that of other courts addressing this issue.see in re nos commc ns,mdl,cir stating that the communication act savings clause is fundamentally incompatible with complete field preemption if congress intended to preempt the entire field of telecommunications regulation,there would be nothing for section to save and the provision would be mere surplusage citing marcus,at accord smith gte,cir.consistent with these decisions and our precedent in pinney,we hold that the communications act does not wholly displace state law in this area because it explicitly preserved remedies.beneficial bank,at.
as the district court noted,pinney concerned wireless devices,not wireless service in our view,however,this is a distinction without a difference.the savings clause applies to the entirety of chapter of the communications act,including the section at issue here regarding wireless service.the savings clause demonstrates that congressional intent to completely preempt this area of law is neither clear nor manifest accordingly,we hold that the district court erred in its reliance on complete preemption principles when it denied the motion to remand 
we now turn to diversity jurisdiction.the johnsons named two defendants in their complaint charleston north charleston msa and farmers telephone cooperative.normally,this would defeat removal on the basis of diversity jurisdiction under because complete diversity of citizenship meaning a plaintiff can not be a citizen of the same state as any defendant is necessary for a federal court to exercise diversity jurisdiction.mayes rapoport,cir.the district court,however,found it could properly retain subject matter jurisdiction under the fraudulent joinder doctrine.under that doctrine,naming defendants does not defeat diversity jurisdiction.rather,the fraudulent joinder doctrine effectively permits a district court to disregard,for jurisdictional purposes,the citizenship of certain nondiverse defendants,assume jurisdiction over a case,dismiss the nondiverse defendants,and thereby retain jurisdiction.id.at.
the party alleging fraudulent joinder bears a heavy must show that the plaintiff can not establish a claim even after resolving all issues of law and fact in the plaintiff favor.hartley csx,cir.the removing party must show either outright fraud in the plaintiff pleading of jurisdictional facts or that there is no possibility that the plaintiff would be able to establish a cause of action against the defendant in state court.id.quoting marshall manville sales,cir.
the defendants in this action rely on the latter,no possibility formulation,in which a plaintiff claim against a defendant need not ultimately succeed to defeat removal only a possibility of a right to relief need be asserted.marshall,at.this standard heavily favors the johnsons,who must show only a glimmer of hope of succeeding against the defendants.mayes,at.moreover,when considering whether the johnsons have satisfied this standard,we must resolve all legal and factual issues in their favor.id.at.t his standard is even more favorable to the plaintiff than the standard for ruling on a motion to dismiss under.b.id.quoting hartley,at.even under this rigorous standard,however,we conclude that the johnsons have no possibility of succeeding against either of the defendants.
it is undisputed that the first defendant charleston msa limited partnership formerly the sprint cellular company of south carolina has no federal license to provide cell phone service in lee county,south carolina,where the prison is located because charleston north charleston msa could not have carried the alleged cell phone call ordering the attack on johnson,it could not possibly be liable under the johnsons legal theories there is thus no possibility that the johnsons could succeed against charleston north charleston.hartley,at.accordingly,the district court properly disregarded charleston north charleston msa for diversity purposes.
the johnsons claims against the second defendant,farmers telephone cooperative,present a more complex question on fraudulent joinder.farmers telephone cooperative farmers leases a tower to wireless carriers,who in turn place equipment on the tower to transmit wireless signals.the tower does not itself transmit signals.the district court found that the communications act preempts state law,and so the johnsons could not prevail on their claim against farmers as a matter of law.the johnsons therefore did not have a glimmer of hope of success against farmers in state court.
we agree that a finding of federal preemption would mean that the johnsons would have no possibility of success on their complaint against farmers.accordingly,we now turn to the federal preemption question underlying this case.in doing so,we conclude that the communications act preempts the johnsons claims against farmers.because farmers was fraudulently joined,the district court did not err in denying the johnsons motion to remand.
the supremacy clause of the constitution provides,the laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.const.art.vi,cl.preemption fundamentally is a question of congressional intent,and when congress has made its intent known through explicit statutory language,the courts task is an easy one.english,citation omitted.
here,congress made its intent known when in it amended the communications act of to provide,no state or local government shall have any authority to regulate the entry of or the rates charged by any commercial mobile service or any private mobile service.c a.the communications act also grants the fcc control over all the channels of radio transmission.id.see also farina,at the fcc jurisdiction extends to wireless telephone service,and fcc authority over the technical aspects of radio communications is exclusive.citations omitted.
we have acknowledged that in amending the communications act,congress preempted state laws that not only regulate market entry,but also state laws that obstruct or burden a wireless service provider ability to provide a network of wireless service coverage.pinney,at citing bastien v.at t wireless,cir.state law is taken here to include tort duties.riegel medtronic,c liability is premised on the existence of a legal duty,and a tort judgment therefore establishes that the defendant has violated a obligation.state duties,such as the one that the johnsons propose,that conflict with federal laws or regulations,are therefore preempted.gibbons ogden.
in pinney,we held that preempts state laws that obstruct or burden a wireless service provider ability to provide a network of wireless service coverage.pinney,f d at citing bastien,at.we find that the johnsons putative duty on farmers is consequently preempted by the express language of the communications act.a tort duty on the part of farmers would obstruct or burden a wireless service provider ability to provide coverage.cell phone tower owners would be forced to actively monitor wireless networks and prevent any calls,or perhaps only calls initiated on contraband devices,coming from inside a south carolina prison,limiting the provision of wireless service in those areas.pinney,at.
similarly,finding a duty on the part of the wireless service providers would ove
