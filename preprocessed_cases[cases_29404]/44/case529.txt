this is an appeal from a bench trial in a medical malpractice case brought under the federal tort claims act,b.kenyeda taft,on behalf of her minor son,melvin harrison,sued louis laz,her obstetrician and a federal employee,for injuries allegedly sustained by melvin during his birth.the complaint set forth two grounds for finding negligence failure to meet the standard of care and lack of informed consent.the district court,after a trial,concluded that laz was not negligent under either theory and concomitantly entered judgment for the defendant of record,the united states,melvin harrison,appeals the judgment on the informed consent claim.for the reasons discussed below,we vacate the judgment and remand to the district court judge.
in,kenyeda taft was pregnant with melvin harrison,her second child.in march of that year,taft,almost four months pregnant,began her prenatal care at the lynn community health center lynn chc with an initial screening visit conducted by a nurse practitioner.during this visit,taft provided a medical history,including the fact that her first child,due to her large size of pounds and ounces,suffered an injury during vaginal birth that resulted in erb palsy 
taft first met with louis laz,a obstetrician and gynecologist,at the lynn chc on april.taft informed laz that her first child suffers from erb palsy as a result of a shoulder dystocia due to the baby large size.at the time,laz general practice with patients who had had a prior large baby was to determine the estimated fetal weight by ultrasound at about weeks gestation.if the estimated weight was grams or more,laz would offer the patient an elective cesarean section.if the estimated weight was under this threshold,laz would recommend inducing labor at or weeks gestation.
in addition to her previous large child,taft presented with other risk factors that increased the likelihood that her second baby would also be large,and therefore more likely to suffer complications,such as a shoulder dystocia or brachial plexus injury,during a vaginal birth she was pregnant with her second child,and second children are usually larger than first the fetus was male,and males are generally larger taft was an obese woman at the time of her pregnancy taft experienced excessive weight gain during the pregnancy and her prior delivery resulted in an erb palsy injury.while laz recognized these risk factors,he considered them to be normal birth risks and therefore did not discuss them with taft.
after meeting with taft,laz obtained the delivery record for taft first child,keneisha taft,from salem hospital.at trial,laz testified that it was his general practice to request the hospital delivery notes for any patient who had a history of delivery complications.the delivery record of orkin,the treating obstetrician,indicated that keneisha birth occurred without any complications.laz,considering the obstetrician delivery notes to be the gold standard of what happened at that delivery,concluded that taft did not experience a shoulder dystocia during her first birth.therefore,laz believed that the erb palsy developed spontaneously,rather than as a result of a shoulder dystocia.although laz testified that he would have discussed an elective with a patient where there was documented evidence of a prior shoulder dystocia resulting in an injury,he did not do so in this case,since the delivery notes did not document such complication.
on september,at approximately weeks gestation,in accordance with laz general practice,taft had an ultrasound at union hospital to estimate the fetal weight.the ultrasound report estimated the fetal weight to be grams a little over pounds.because the estimated weight was under the grams threshold,laz determined that a vaginal delivery,as opposed to a,was the appropriate mode of childbirth.laz recommended to taft that labor be induced,but he did not discuss with her either the risks of vaginal birth or the possibility of a.
on september,taft,at weeks gestation,was admitted to beverly hospital for induction of labor.during labor,the baby head crowned,but the shoulders did not deliver.laz and the delivery team followed standard steps to attempt to resolve the shoulder dystocia.after these steps were unsuccessful,laz delivered the posterior right arm,which then allowed delivery of the baby at on september.the baby,melvin harrison,weighed grams pounds and ounces at birth and had a weakness of the right arm and hand,which was subsequently diagnosed as erb palsy.
the plaintiff filed suit against laz for medical malpractice in essex county superior court.however,since laz was a federal employee at the time he treated taft,the action was removed to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts,and the united states was substituted as the defendant.the plaintiff suit was premised on two grounds of negligence laz failure to meet the standard of care by not originally offering an elective and by not performing a during labor based on fetal heart monitorings and laz failure to obtain taft informed consent by not discussing the risks of vaginal birth and disclosing the alternative of a.a bench trial began on december.at the close of the plaintiff case,the district court granted the united states motion for judgment as a matter of law on the question of laz compliance with the standard of care during labor.
at the conclusion of the trial,the district court determined that laz did not fail to obtain the patient informed consent and entered judgment for the defendant.the court found that,although the risks of vaginal birth for the baby were something more than negligible,when these risks were balanced against the risks to the mother from a,a cesarean section to avoid brachial plexus injury was not a reasonable medical judgment.therefore,even though the court found that taft would have opted for a if informed of the possibility,the court concluded that laz was under no duty to afford taft the opportunity to have a cesarean section 
the plaintiff appeals the court judgment only on the informed consent claim,arguing that laz,because such information was material to her decision to deliver vaginally,did have a duty to inform taft of both the risks of vaginal birth and the availability of a as an alternative method of childbirth.
we review a district court factual findings for clear error.see.a la esperanza de,pérez y cía.de,cir.we deem a finding to be clearly erroneous only when,after reviewing the entire record,we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.la esperanza,at internal quotation marks omitted.questions of negligence decided in a bench trial are treated as questions of fact,or as mixed questions of fact and law,and are therefore evaluated under this deferential standard.see id.at.
however,when the district court factual findings are premised on an incorrect interpretation of the relevant legal principles,we do not owe the court the same level of deference.see united states bosworth,cir vinick united states,cir.instead,we treat the trial court conclusion as a question of law,vinick,at,and review it de novo.bosworth,at.
under the federal tort claims act,b,state law is the source of substantive liability.fed.deposit ins.meyer,d.to recover under a theory of informed consent in massachusetts,a patient must prove that the physician has a duty to disclose certain information and that a breach of that duty caused the patient injury.see halley birbiglia.to establish a breach of the physician duty of disclosure,the plaintiff must establish that a sufficiently close relationship exists the doctor knows or should know of the information to be disclosed the information is such that the doctor should reasonably recognize that it is material to the patient decision and the doctor fails to disclose this information.see id.in this case,only the materiality of the information to the patient is contested 
if a duty exists,a physician must disclose sufficient information to enable the patient to make an informed judgment whether to give or withhold consent to a medical or surgical procedure.harnish children hosp.med.failure to do so constitutes medical malpractice.see id.
there are two primary standards for determining the requisite scope of the physician disclosure in informed consent cases customary practice and materiality.see id.at canterbury spence.many jurisdictions require a physician to disclose whatever information a reasonable physician in similar circumstances would customarily disclose.see harnish,at canterbury,at.the commonwealth of massachusetts,however,has rejected the customary practice standard as providing insufficient protection for the patient autonomy,which is the very purpose of disclosure see harnish,at precourt frederick,balancing patient right to and desire to not unduly burden practice of medicine.instead,massachusetts has adopted the materiality standard,requiring the physician to disclose information he should reasonably recognize is material to the patient decision.harnish,at.
materiality may be said to be the significance a reasonable person,in what the physician knows or should know is his patient position,would attach to the disclosed risk or risks in deciding whether to submit or not to submit to surgery or treatment.id.at quoting wilkinson vesey.material information may include the nature of the patient condition,the nature and probability of risks involved,the benefits to be reasonably expected,the likely result of no treatment,and the available alternatives,including their risks and benefits.id.
whether a risk of injury is material to a patient depends upon the severity of the potential injury as well as the probability of its occurrence.see precourt,at.if the likelihood of an injury occurring is negligible,then the risk is not considered material,and the risk is insufficient to trigger the physician duty to disclose see feeley baer,holding that physician had no duty to disclose risk of serious infection because plaintiffs failed to prove that there was more than a negligible risk precourt,at noting that a risk of injury can not be considered a material factor if the probability of its occurrence is so small as to be practically nonexistent.similarly,if the severity of the potential injury is very minor,the risk is immaterial and need not be disclosed.precourt,at quoting lacaze collier,so d,internal quotation marks omitted.
in the case at hand,the plaintiff,citing to feeley,argues that any risk that is more than negligible automatically qualifies as a material factor that must be disclosed.see feeley,at stating that t he risk that must exist in order to invoke informed consent principles in this case is a more than negligible risk.the defendant,however,challenges the plaintiff understanding of the commonwealth informed consent law.the defendant argues that feeley and the other massachusetts informed consent cases indicate that materiality requires more than just.the defendant contends that feeley stands for the proposition that if a plaintiff can show evidence of only a negligible risk,then there is no duty to disclose,because such a risk is,as a matter of law,not material.see,at holding that there was no duty to disclose because plaintiff failed to show more than a negligible risk.
the district court seemingly adopted the plaintiff interpretation of the law by stating that the doctor must inform the patient where there exists more than a negligible risk of one or more serious consequences from the course of treatment that is being undertaken by the doctor.after hearing the evidence,the court found that laz was aware of the risk factors for a birth injury and that these risk factors were something more than negligible.however,the court then weighed the risks to the mother of a,which the court found to be more than normally associated with the birth of a child,against the risks to the child of a vaginal birth and found that laz was under no duty to afford taft the opportunity to have a cesarean section and on the particular circumstances of this case a cesarean section to avoid brachial plexus injury was not a reasonable medical judgment.
we believe that the district court erred in its interpretation of massachusetts law,thereby triggering de novo review of its finding that laz owed no duty to disclose the risks and alternative methods of childbirth.see bosworth,at vinick,at.as discussed above,harnish and precourt establish materiality as the standard for determining whether a physician has an affirmative duty to disclose.see harnish,at noting duty to disclose material information,but that this does not require the disclosure of all risks precourt,at recognizing duty to disclose material information,which does not include remote risks.however,precourt reserved the issue of how to determine when a risk need not be disclosed,except for indicating there is no duty to disclose negligible risks 
the development of our law concerning the distinction between risks that as a matter of law may be considered remote,and those that may be left to the determination of a fact finder,must await future cases.it is clear,however,that when,as in this case,the evidence does not permit the jury to draw an inference that the physician knew or reasonably should have known that the probability that a particular risk would materialize was other than negligible,the evidence is insufficient to warrant a finding that the physician violated his duty of disclosure.
feeley did not change this materiality approach to informed consent.in feeley,a mother sued for medical malpractice when her child died from streptococcus pneumonia five days after birth.see at.the mother alleged that the treating physician,who opted for spontaneous labor as opposed to inducing labor after her water broke,failed to disclose any risk of infection from this procedure.see id.the supreme judicial court of massachusetts,citing harnish and precourt,undertook a materiality analysis and concluded that t he evidence would not permit a finding that the risk to the child of serious infection was more than negligible.at.thus,because the severity of the potential injury was minimal,the court concluded that the information was not material,and the doctor,therefore,had no duty to disclose.see id.at.
the plaintiffs in feeley,similar to the plaintiff in this case,argued that there was more than a negligible risk and,as a result,that risk had to be disclosed.see id.on the particular facts,however,the feeley court determined that the risk was not more than negligible.see id.at.thus,the court stated that t he risk that must exist in order to invoke informed consent principles in this case is a more than negligible risk of one or more infections that will have serious consequences.id.this context clarifies that the court was merely negating any duty to disclose negligible risks.the court was not,as plaintiff argues,declaring an affirmative duty to disclose any risk that is more than negligible.thus,the caselaw stands for the proposition that there is no duty to disclose negligible risks,not that all risks are actionable if not revealed.
as a result,when the district court analysis focused on whether the risks were more than negligible rather than on materiality,the district court applied the incorrect legal standard.thus,we vacate the district court judgment and remand the case to the district court judge to assess the materiality of the risks of vaginal birth to a reasonable person in taft position 
moreover,the court made a second legal error by balancing the risks to the child from a vaginal birth against the risks to the mother from a and concluding that,because the presented a greater risk and was therefore not medically recommended,the doctor had no duty to disclose the risks of either procedure.the materiality standard for disclosure does not incorporate a balancing test by which the court can weigh the risks of alternate treatments in deciding what information is material to the patient.an obstetrician in the delivery room is in the unique situation of having to take into account the best interests of two individuals,mother and child,in rendering medical care.thomas ellis,holding that evidence could support finding of negligence where doctor external turning of fetus position,causing a separated pl
