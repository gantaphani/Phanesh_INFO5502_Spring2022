when khan discovered that stubbs had a condition that could inhibit blood clotting,he admitted stubbs to fgh.during the night,stubbs fell in the bathroom of his room.the next day,khan noticed a bump on stubbs head but allegedly ordered no specific tests to assess the extent of the injury.neither did khan return to examine stubbs before fgh discharged him that afternoon.the discharge papers,completed by fgh nurses,noted the bump on stubbs head,as well as a small puncture wound.

b.the ftca 
section of the ftca provides that a suit against the united states is the exclusive remedy for damages for injury or loss of property resulting from the negligent or wrongful conduct of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.the federally supported health centers assistance act of fshcaa extends ftca coverage to employees of the public health service phs.under the fshcaa,the phs may deem employees of qualified and eligible community health care centers as government employees entitled to immunity under the ftca once the phs deems an employee of a qualified community health care center to be a phs employee,the employee enjoys absolute immunity from common law tort claims,and an injured party exclusive remedy is against the government under the ftca in short,the fshcaa makes the ftca the exclusive remedy for actions against employees of the phs resulting from the performance of medical or related functions and protects commissioned officers or employees of the phs from being subject to suit while performing medical and similar functions by requiring that such lawsuits be brought against the united states instead.
once the phs deems the employee a federal employee,the government must determine whether the employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time out of which the incident arose,and must so certify if the employee is found to have been thus acting if scope certification is made,the ftca allows the government to remove the suit against the employee to federal court and substitute the government as the proper party defendant the dispute here concerns whether the government timely removed this action to federal court under section.mclaurin does not challenge the government determination that the health center is a qualified community health care center or that an employee of the health a federal employee for purposes of section.neither does mclaurin dispute that khan was acting within the course and scope of his employment at the time of the incidents alleged in her complaint.her sole complaint is timeliness.
mclaurin argues that the government waived its right to removal because khan failed to notify it promptly of mclaurin suit against him.mclaurin cites to section c as support for this proposition 
the attorney general shall defend any civil action or proceeding brought in any court against any employee of the government or his estate for any such damage or injury.the employee against whom such civil action or proceeding is brought shall deliver within such time after date of service or knowledge of service as determined by the attorney general,all process served upon him to his immediate superior and such person shall promptly furnish copies of the pleadings and process therein to the united states attorney for the district embracing the place wherein the proceeding is brought,to the attorney general,and to the head of his employing federal agency 
mclaurin argues that because section c requires that a federal employee promptly furnish copies of the pleadings and process to the government,and because khan failed to do so,thus the the right to remove this suit to federal court.in effect,mclaurin argues that section c is a condition precedent to removal under section d.
the government counters with the argument that section d merely requires removal before trial.the government relies on the language of section d 
upon certification by the attorney general that the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose,any civil action or proceeding commenced upon such claim in a state court shall be removed without bond at any time before trial by the attorney general to the district court of the united states for the district and division embracing the place in which the action or proceeding is pending.such action or proceeding shall be deemed to be an action or proceeding brought against the united states under the provision of this title and all references thereto,and the united states shall be substituted as the party defendant.this certification of the attorney general shall conclusively establish scope or office of
