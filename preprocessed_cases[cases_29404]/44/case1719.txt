pca and saqui both presented evidence as to whether mexico was an available forum.pca submitted an affidavit from octavio canton canton,an attorney licensed to practice law in mexico.canton affidavit stated that mexico has jurisdiction to adjudicate saqui claims,and that the laws of mexico provide saqui with a legal remedy.saqui countered canton opinion with that of henry dahl dahl,an expert in international law.dahl affidavit incorporated an affidavit from leonel pereznieto.pereznieto affidavit stated that there is preemptive jurisdiction anytime a court in the united states dismisses a case on fnc grounds in favor of a forum in mexico.preemptive jurisdiction allegedly requires the mexican court to reject jurisdiction over the case,even if the defendant agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of mexican courts.
pereznieto affidavit relied on a case where he was retained as an expert,pending in litigation mdl,as proof that preemptive jurisdiction is a real legal concept in mexico.pereznieto explained that when the plaintiff in that case,sofia lopez de manez manez,her case in mexico,the mexican court dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction.in in re,tires prod.liab.action,d,the mdl court dismissed manez claims on fnc grounds.on appeal,the seventh circuit reversed.the seventh circuit opined that the case would be an easy candidate for straightforward affirmance,but that manez had presented evidence that she filed the case in mexico after the district court dismissal and the mexican court had determined that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.in re,tires prod.liab.action,cir.the defendants asserted,however,that manez acted improperly because she failed to notify the defendants that she was filing suit and did not file suit in the mexican state where the underlying accident in the case occurred.id.at.thus,the seventh circuit remanded and instructed the mdl court to hold an evidentiary hearing on those issues.id.at.
the mdl court held an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the plaintiff actions were taken in good faith,and the mexican court decisions were entitled to recognition in the united states.in re,tires prod.liab,d.the mdl court explained that manez retained pereznieto to pursue her claim in mexican court.id.at.the mdl court found that manez appear ed to have contrived this adverse ruling by intentionally filing the case in a mexican court lacking jurisdiction,and when the dismissal came,those orders were submitted to the seventh circuit as proof that mexican courts severally were unavailable.id.at.furthermore,the mdl court sanctioned pereznieto,the apparent mastermind behind these frauds on the and mexican courts and ordered him to pay a personal sanction in the amount of.in re,tires product liab,d.
on february,the district court denied pca motion to dismiss.the court determined that pca and saqui experts,including pereznieto,were equally credible.the court did not mention the mdl court november or december orders,that found pereznieto to have committed fraud.
on july,pca filed a renewed motion to dismiss on fnc grounds.pca asserted that after investigating the manez case,it uncovered that pereznieto committed fraud and then took dahl deposition.dahl admitted that he relied heavily on pereznieto affidavit.dahl conceded that if the mexican court decisions he relied upon were obtained by a fraudulent manipulation of the mexican court to procure dismissals,they were weak authority for the proposition that a mexican court might not hear the instant case.dahl went on to concede that survivors,beneficiaries,and heirs have a remedy under mexico civil code for tort claims.finally,dahl agreed that an employee working for a mexican company on the continental shelf of mexico adjacent to the mexican shoreline,under contract to the mexican national oil company,is certainly within the reach of mexico laws.saqui opposed pca motion to dismiss.
while the instant case was percolating in the district court,pereznieto appealed the mdl court sanctions order against him.manez bridgestone firestone am.tire,llc,cir.on july,the seventh circuit held that the mdl court erred in awarding sanctions,because pereznieto did not receive constitutionally adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard in the proceedings that led to the fine and other sanctions against him.id.at.thus,the seventh circuit vacated the district court order and remanded for reconsideration in light of its opinion.
in this case,the district court referred pca renewed motion to dismiss on fnc grounds to the magistrate judge.on september,the magistrate judge issued its report and recommendation r r,conditionally granting pca motion to dismiss on fnc grounds.the r r noted that dahl concedes in his deposition testimony,that his opinion is based heavily on the opinion of pereznieto who,the c ourt now knows,was previously involved in perpetrating a fraud upon another united states district court.the r r determined that in light of this new information,it could not consider saqui experts to be credible.the r r then recognized that fifth circuit law has consistently held that when a defendant submits to the jurisdiction of an alternate forum,that renders the forum available for purposes of fnc analysis.thus,the r r found mexico to be an available forum.the r r did not reference the seventh circuit opinion vacating the mdl court sanctions against pereznieto.ultimately,the r r recommended that the district court grant pca motion to dismiss on fnc grounds if pca submitted to the jurisdiction of mexico courts.the r r also recommended that the district court resume jurisdiction if the mexican court did not accept the case.on september,the district court accepted the r r in its entirety.in doing so,it stated that it had given the matter de novo review under b c.
