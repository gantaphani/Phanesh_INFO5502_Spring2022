this civil rights case stems from the shooting death of michael newby by officer mckenzie mattingly in west louisville.it comes before us on an interlocutory appeal from the district court denial of the appellant motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity and immunity grounds.before the district court,angela bouggess,the administrator of newby estate,raised a fourth amendment claim under and various tort claims.to decide this case,we need only ask whether an officer who employs deadly force against a fleeing suspect without reason to believe that the suspect is armed or otherwise poses a serious risk of physical harm is entitled to either qualified immunity or immunity under the law of kentucky.we hold that he is entitled to neither.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
bouggess raises a fourth amendment claim under,a statute that provides a cause of action for redress against persons acting under color of law for deprivation s of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws of the united states.the supreme court has held that defendants in such suits are entitled to qualified immunity from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights.saucier katz,d.a plaintiff can overcome that immunity only by showing that the defendant violated his constitutional or statutory rights and the right at issue was sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would have understood that what he was doing violated that right.baranski fifteen unknown agents of the batf,cir en banc.
the availability of interlocutory appeal from the denial of qualified immunity is an exception to the general rule that an appeal can be taken only from a final judgment.but that exception is a limited one.we have jurisdiction to consider an interlocutory appeal only if that appeal raises a pure question of law.johnson jones,d.thus,we have jurisdiction to consider a defendant claim that the facts alleged by the plaintiff,if proven,would not show a violation of clearly established constitutional law,estate of carter city of detroit,cir,but not to consider a defendant claim that the district court erred in constructing its view of the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,johnson,at.at times in this appeal,mattingly could be taken to raise a mix of factual and legal arguments.to retain our jurisdiction under johnson,we consider only the legal issues and interpret mattingly appeal as conceding,for these purposes only,the facts as given by bouggess.
because this case comes to us on summary judgment,we construe the facts in the light most favorable to bouggess.c.if bouggess can prevail under those facts,the case is inappropriate for resolution on interlocutory appeal and must be remanded.as we have held,when the legal question of immunity is completely dependent upon which view of the facts is accepted by the jury,the jury becomes the final arbiter of a claim of immunity.brandenburg cureton,cir.
on the evening of january,officer mckenzie mattingly of the louisville metro police department was involved in a operation.he had planned to stage a drug transaction with some individuals in the parking lot of h s foods at and west market streets in louisville.mattingly had backup officers listening over a wire transmitter.officer thomerson was the eye of the operation.as mattingly waited in his vehicle,he was approached by a number of individuals who may have offered to sell him narcotics.michael newby was one of those individuals.mattingly did not think newby was armed 
during the operation,the other suspects on the scene reached into mattingly car and took some of mattingly money.they then ran away.mattingly thought at this point that none of the suspects remained near the car.he then got out of the car to see which way the suspects ran so that he could radio that information to his fellow officers.mattingly did not radio for help or in any way indicate to other officers that they should be concerned that any of the suspects including newby might be armed.
upon mattingly exit from the vehicle,he saw newby nearby,bending down to pick up a bill.mattingly sought to arrest newby,but a struggle ensued between the two men.no guns were drawn and no shots were fired during the struggle 
after the struggle,newby broke free from mattingly and ran directly away from mattingly toward three eyewitnesses in a car,and also within view of the h s foods manager.mattingly then drew his gun and fired at least three shots at newby according to the medical examiner report,three shots struck newby in the back.
newby,now struck three times by bullets from mattingly firearm,fled around a corner and sat down.mattingly and thomerson then approached newby.mattingly did not warn thomerson that newby might have a weapon.ja.another officer on the scene,with his gun holstered,then approached newby to handcuff him.mattingly did not warn that officer that newby might be armed.when newby struggled with the officers during handcuffing and following handcuffing,mattingly did not alert the officers that newby might be armed.newby died from his injuries soon after the shooting.
newby was,in fact,carrying a firearm in his waistband.ja.
viewing the facts as given above,the question is whether mattingly violated newby clearly established constitutional rights.
a pprehension by use of deadly force is a seizure subject to the reasonableness requirement of the fourth amendment.tennessee garner,d.this court assesses the reasonableness of a seizure in distinct stages.an officer prior errors in judgment do not make a shooting unreasonable as long as the officer acted reasonably during the shooting itself and the few moments directly preceding it.dickerson mcclellan,cir.in other words,whether the use of deadly force at a particular moment is reasonable depends primarily on objective assessment of the danger a suspect poses at that moment.the assessment must be made from the perspective of a reasonable officer in the defendant position.brosseau haugen,d.that objective assessment requires asking whether the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm,either to the officer or to others.garner,at.under that standard,if the suspect threatens the officer with a weapon or there is probable cause to believe that he has committed a crime involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious physical harm,deadly force may be used if necessary to prevent escape,and if,where feasible,some warning has been given.ibid.absent such probable cause,however,a police officer may not seize a fleeing felon by employing deadly force.id.at.
in applying garner probable cause standard,the sixth circuit has focused on the following list of factors the severity of the crime at issue whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others and whether the suspect is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.sigley city of parma heights,cir citing dunigan noble,cir quoting graham connor,d using those factors and other relevant facts,it is our task to determine whether mattingly had an objectively reasonable belief that newby posed an imminent threat of serious physical harm to him or to others.if mattingly did not have such a belief,then his use of deadly force violated the fourth amendment.saucier,at.
thus,the question in this case is whether,under the foregoing standard,mattingly had probable cause to believe that newby posed a threat of serious physical harm to mattingly or to others.garner,at.dickerson,at.the facts,when viewed in the light most favorable to bouggess,demonstrate that mattingly did not have such probable cause.
it is crucial for the purposes of this inquiry to separate officer mattingly and determine whether each of his particular decisions was reasonable.dickerson,at.officer mattingly made two decisions.first,he decided to arrest newby,and second,after newby broke free,he decided to shoot newby.it can not reasonably be contended and does not contend that merely arresting newby would have been a violation of the fourth amendment.see atwater city of lago vista,d.even under the facts as we must view them,mattingly had probable cause to believe newby was committing at least some crime.
the question of whether mattingly second decision was reasonable is the nub of this case.the relevant time for the purposes of this inquiry is the moment immediately preceding the shooting.dickerson,at.that is,we must focus whether officer mattingly had probable cause to believe that newby posed a serious danger to him or to others while newby was running away.ibid.see also estate of bing city of whitehall,cir.
after newby had broken free from mattingly custody and had run about ten feet from mattingly,did mattingly have probable cause to believe that newby posed an imminent danger of serious physical harm to him or to others examining the information available to mattingly at the time,precedent binding on this court,and viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the bouggess,it is clear that mattingly did not have probable cause sufficient to open fire.
under the facts properly viewed at this stage,mattingly did not know or suspect that newby had a firearm.too much evidence throws doubt on mattingly bare assertion that he suspected that newby had a weapon.moreover,mattingly arguments on this point amount to disputes over the factual inferences made by the district court on summary judgment as such,under johnson,we can not consider them on this interlocutory appeal.at.
newby only crimes,so far as mattingly suspected,were dealing crack and physically resisting arrest.if an officer seeks to arrest someone for dealing crack cocaine and the suspect resists,using his hands,and then flees,may the officer shoot him under the governing doctrine,the answer is clearly no.officers can not open fire in such circumstances absent more evidence that the suspect poses a danger to officers or to the public.garner,at.
newby first crime was dealing crack.on appeal,mattingly contends in his reply brief that trained police officers know that drug dealers,especially crack cocaine dealers,usually carry guns.reply br.of appellant,at citing united states swafford,cir.mattingly seems to imply that a general notion that crack dealers are dangerous,rather than a particularized and supported sense of serious danger about a particular confrontation,justifies the use of deadly force.the supreme court and this court have never accepted such a sweeping generalization.garner,at.dickerson,at.we will not do so today.
newby second crime was resisting arrest and fleeing the scene.it can not reasonably be contended that physically resisting arrest,without evidence of the employment or drawing of a deadly weapon,and without evidence of any intention on the suspect part to seriously harm the officer,could constitute probable cause that the suspect poses an imminent danger of serious physical harm to the officer or to others.garner,at.it is not better that all felony suspects die than that they escape.merely resisting arrest by wrestling oneself free from officers and running away would justify the use of some force to restrain the suspect.for example,this court has held that officers may tackle a suspect who resists.lyons city of xenia,cir burchett kiefer,cir.
however,while such action by a suspect justifies force,it does not justify deadly force,especially when the struggle has concluded and the suspect is in flight.garner,at.see also griffith coburn,cir denying qualified immunity when officer used a vascular neck restraint,a choke hold,to restrain an individual who posed no threat to the officers or to anyone else sigley kuhn,wl cir.lexis,at,unpublished denying summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds when deadly force was employed after a suspect tackled an officer and wrestled him to the ground because there was a disputed issue of fact as to whether the suspect tried to take away the officer gun cardona city of cleveland,wl cir.lexis,at unpublished denying qualified immunity where officer and suspect struggled,and the suspect was shot during the struggle,where there was a disputed issue of fact as to whether the officer and suspect struggled over a gun.donovan thames,cir holding that conviction for resisting arrest did not preclude the bringing of a action for excessive force in violation of the fourth amendment ewolski city of brunswick,cir determining that the officers employment of deadly force was reasonable because the suspect,in resisting arrest,had demonstrated that he would fire on any officers who entered the house.
finally,mattingly never warned newby that he might shoot,as required by garner when feasible under the circumstances.nothing indicates that a warning was infeasible.craighead,at denying qualified immunity,in part,because t he facts we are required to assume show that a warning was feasible but not given.moreover,nothing in the facts as they must be viewed at this stage indicates that newby ever threatened mattingly or anybody else in the area with serious harm.mattingly has offered only a hunch,a crack deal,a struggle,and a look in newby eyes to support his claim that his choice to shoot newby three times in the back was reasonable under the fourth amendment.other facts that mattingly has offered are disputed and must be read in the light most favorable to bouggess at this stage.as a result,it is clear under garner and its progeny that newby fourth amendment rights were violated.
to resist this conclusion,mattingly argues that newby struggled with him and thus that newby assaulted a police officer.that is a subject of dispute.a reasonable could conclude that mattingly tried to arrest newby and that newby merely resisted and ran away.we can not view the facts in the light most favorable to the defendant on this appeal.moreover,resisting arrest,without probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a serious danger to anyone,can not be enough to justify deadly force.garner,at.in any case,when mattingly began to fire,the resisting would have concluded and newby merely would have been in flight.a suspect flight on foot,without more,can not justify the use of deadly force.
mattingly also relies on several cases from this circuit that he claims support his position.in each case he cites,with one exception,this court either reversed the denial of qualified immunity or affirmed the grant of qualified immunity.to that extent,and to that extent alone,they support mattingly position.however,in each case,the suspect in question was both known by the police to possess a weapon and had indicated an intent to use that weapon against the police or others see gaddis redford township,cir describing the suspect possession of a knife and his swinging it violently at police officers boyd baeppler,cir they confronted him as a dangerous armed man who ignored their reasonable command to stop.that command obviously included the direction to stop pointing his gun at them,and this,too,was ignored.rhodes mcdannel,cir noting the suspect brandishment of a machete within four feet of officers and another individual.
the exception is brandenburg,at.in that case,an individual had fired six shots,at least two of which were into the air.he also told officers to leave his property or they would be killed.one officer opened fire on the individual when the individual moved to pick up his rifle again.in that case,we granted qualified immunity to two officers whose negligence in serving an arrest warrant arguably created the dangerous situation.however,we denied qualified immunity to the officer who fired the fatal shots because there was an issue of fact as to whether the suspect had pointed his gun at the other two officers just before the shooting.id.at.it is unclear to us why mattingly relies on brandenburg in his brief we believe that he has mischaracterized our opinion in that case.brandenburg illustrates quite clearly why mattingly is not entitled to qualified immunity on the facts as we must view them here.
one case decided by this court after briefing was complete in this case might provide support for mattingly claim that he did not violate newby fourth amendment rights.in livermore lubelan,cir,this court held that it was not a violation of the fourth amendment for a police sniper to shoot a suspect armed with a rifle during an armed standoff between the suspect and police.id.at.the suspect who was shot and killed had been present when an accomplice fired shots at a news helicopter.id.at.the suspect had set the farmhouses on fire and had sought to escape with his rifle through the woods.ibid.moments after aiming his rifle at police,he was shot by a police sniper.ibid.there were disputed issues of fact as to whether,at the exact moment when the sniper fired the shots,the suspect rifle was aimed at an exposed officer.
this case is distinguishable from livermore on at least two grounds,each pertinent to the garner excessive force standard.first,while in livermore the suspect was known by every officer on the scene to have a rifle,mattingly did not know newby had a weapon.second,the crimes committed by the livermore suspect go to the heart of garner standard crime s involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious physical harm.despite the disputed issue of fact about whether the livermore suspect was aiming at the police at the precise instant he was shot,he had aimed his weapon at them only moments before.he had set buildings on fire.he had participated in an armed standoff with the police in which shots were fired at a passing helicopter.none of those aggravating facts is present in this case.
we acknowledge that in challenges to official action,particularly police action in the heat of the moment,courts must be careful to avoid unduly burdening officers ability to make decisions.effective policing requires that courts accord police officers a certain latitude to make mistakes.there seems to be little doubt that mattingly was flustered and nervous.we might well have been nervous in his situation.the legal standard,however,is objective.even a decision,if sufficiently wrong,may not be protected by qualified immunity.
viewing the facts in the light most favorable to bouggess,mattingly lacked probable cause to believe newby posed a serious danger to him or to the public.on an interlocutory appeal of the denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds,our jurisdiction generally extends only to resolving issues of law.johnson,at.there are disputed issues of fact that go to the heart of this case.they should be reserved for the jury.sigley city of parma heights,at.
our next step is to determine whether the right at issue was clearly established on the date of the shooting.baranski,at quoting saucier,at.qualified immunity shields an officer from suit even when his action violates constitutional rights,as long as he reasonably misapprehends the law governing the circumstances.brosseau,at.it is designed to provide ample protection to all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.malley briggs,d.in other words,an officer will be denied qualified immunity if he violates a statutory or constitutional right that was so clearly established when the acts were committed that any officer in the defendant position,measured objectively,would have clearly understood that he was under an affirmative duty to have refrained from such conduct.dominque telb,cir.
the question in this case,therefore,is whether mattingly reasonably could have thought that he had probable cause to believe that newby posed a serious danger to mattingly or to others.under the facts viewed in the light most favorable to bouggess,newby was a present at a crack deal b uttered no threatening remarks toward mattingly or anybody else c never drew a weapon d struggled with mattingly in order to flee e did not reach for mattingly gun f did not fire mattingly gun at mattingly foot g broke free from mattingly and ran away,facing away from mattingly and h was shot three times in the back.
viewing the facts that way,no reasonable officer could have thought he had probable cause to use deadly force against newby.in garner,at,the supreme court wrote 
the use of deadly force to prevent the escape of all felony suspects,whatever the circumstances,is constitutionally unreasonable.it is not better that all felony suspects die than that they escape.where the suspect poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat to others,the harm resulting from failing to apprehend him does not justify the use of deadly force to do so.it is no doubt unfortunate when a suspect who is in sight escapes,but the fact that the police arrive a little late or are a little slower afoot does not always justify killing the suspect.
where the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm,either to the officer or to others,it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force.thus,if the suspect threatens the officer with a weapon or there is probable cause to believe that he has committed a crime involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious physical harm,deadly force may be used if necessary to prevent escape,and if,where feasible,some warning has been given.
certainly,garner statement of the governing law may be applied differently in particular sets of circumstances,and reasonable minds can disagree over precisely which circumstances justify the use of deadly force.
nevertheless,the supreme court has recognized that there are obvious cases in which an officer should have been on notice that his conduct violated constitutional rights,despite the generalized nature of that court pronouncements of constitutional standards.hope pelzer,d.our circuit and others have held that some cases can be so obvious under garner and governing circuit precedent that officers should be presumed to have been aware that their conduct violated constitutional standards.sample bailey,cir citing robinson bibb,cir and dickerson,at.see also craighead,at denying qualified immunity when an officer shot an individual holding a gun when testimony diverged as to whether the gun was pointed upward or at the officer.
this is such an obvious case.within this circuit,dickerson established,more than ten years ago,that conduct like that committed by mattingly violates the fourth amendment.in that case,there was uncontroverted evidence of serious danger to the officers stemming from the suspect clear possession of a weapon,his recent firing of his weapon,and his threatening language toward the police.nevertheless,examining the moment immediately preceding the shooting,the dickerson court determined that,because it was disputed whether the suspect was when he was shot,the officer was not entitled to qualified immunity.at.see also bibb,at holding that where an officer caught a suspect dismantling the officer car and then warned the suspect to stop,the officer was not entitled to qualified immunity for shooting and killing the suspect.
this case most closely parallels an unpublished decision issued by the court in.in sigley kuhn,wl.lexis,at,we denied qualified immunity to an officer who employed deadly force against a drunk driver whom he had pulled over.in sigley,it was an undisputed fact that,after the officer had administered field sobriety tests,the driver dropped to his knees and begged to be released.when the officer sought to bring the driver to his feet,the driver tackled him and the two began struggling on the ground.id.at.the officer claimed that the two men were struggling for the officer gun and that,when the officer prevailed in the struggle,he shot the driver twice.the driver claimed that he merely rolled away from the officer,whereupon the officer opened fire,shooting him twice in the back.id.at.that factual dispute required the denial of qualified immunity.
so it is in this case.mattingly and newby struggled,perhaps over a gun,perhaps not.newby fled,maybe posing a serious risk to mattingly or to others,maybe not.we can not resolve those doubts on an interlocutory appeal.johnson,at.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to bouggess,mattingly should have been aware that his actions violated clearly established constitutional rights.see,garner,at.dickerson,at sigley,wl.lexis at.
