linda mcgreevy,a school nurse,filed this civil rights action under,against defendants the bermudian springs school district the district gerald soltis,the district superintendent roger stroup,principal of the bermudian springs elementary school and kathleen tsosie,the assistant principal of the bermudian springs elementary school,claiming that defendants violated her first amendment rights by giving her a grossly unsatisfactory employment rating in retaliation for her advocacy on behalf of two disabled students and her reports to state authorities regarding perceived violations of state requirements.
the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania granted defendants motions for summary judgment on all but one issue.during trial,the court granted defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law on the remaining issue.mcgreevy filed a timely notice of appeal 
linda mcgreevy was employed as the school nurse at the bermudian springs school district elementary school beginning in.mcgreevy is a licensed professional nurse,a pediatric nurse practitioner,and a certified school nurse.she holds a school nurse certificate from millersville university,a masters of education from penn state university,a certified nurse practitioner degree from the college of medicine and dentistry of new jersey and rutgers and a bachelor of science nursing degree from fairleigh dickenson university.she is also qualified to be a school principal.between and,mcgreevy consistently received outstanding employment ratings,scoring or higher out of a possible points.under the district categories of ratings,is considered excellent,the highest possible category.
in,mcgreevy began to speak out on four issues which the district court concluded were constitutionally protected speech.she advocated on behalf of the mother of two orthopedically disabled children in order to gain them special assistance she criticized the school district employment of an unlicensed individual to conduct pesticide spraying which caused many students and teachers to become ill she communicated with the pennsylvania department of health regarding her incorrect listing as supervising middle school nurse and she filed two complaints with the state office for civil rights,one with respect to the district handling of the two children and the other regarding her employment rating of for the school year.
in advocating for the two disabled boys,mcgreevy contacted the bureau of compliance of the pennsylvania department of education and spoke with brenda tantow.the exact content of this conversation is in dispute.according to tantow,mcgreevy told her that the children were in danger of being physically injured,that the district kept two sets of records on the children,and that principal stroup was gathering information against the boys mother to release to children services in an effort to have them removed from their home.mcgreevy denied making the latter two statements there was a meeting involving mcgreevy,soltis,stroup and the former assistant superintendent of the district to discuss mcgreevy alleged statements to tantow.afterwards,soltis prepared a memorandum summarizing the meeting,which was placed in mcgreevy personnel file.
shortly after the conversation with tantow,mcgreevy informed the pennsylvania department of health that unlicensed pesticide spraying had occurred at the school and that,as a result,a number of students and teachers had become ill.mcgreevy information led to an investigation and ultimately the pennsylvania department of agriculture levied a fine on the district.soon after the spraying incident,mcgreevy learned that she was incorrectly listed as the middle school nurse and she so informed the department of health as a result,the pennsylvania department of the auditor general,office of special investigations,began an investigation of the school district and eventually ordered withholding of future reimbursements from the pennsylvania department of health for school nurse services.at the end of the school year mcgreevy received a rating of,her lowest rating to date.
according to mcgreevy,shortly after the auditor general began his investigation of the school district in december of,the school officials significantly increased their harassment of her.mcgreevy states that she was constantly criticized and berated by principal stroup,assistant principal tsosie and superintendent soltis.mcgreevy claims that because of this harassment,she suffered such constant and severe migraine headaches that she was compelled to take a leave and ultimately compelled to resign,which she attempted by letter dated march.
according to the district,mcgreevy march resignation was ineffective and hence not accepted.as a result,the district counsel sent mcgreevy a letter dated may,stating that if she did not return to work by may,she would be deemed to have abandoned her employment,her employment would be terminated and she would be replaced.mcgreevy did not return to work and was notified by letter,dated july,from the attorney for the school board that she was deemed to have abandoned her position and the district was determining whether to dismiss her.that letter also warned her about the possible loss of her rn license.
on june,mcgreevy received a copy of her official rating of for the school year.on november,the district informed the public school employees retirement systems that mcgreevy had been terminated as of november.on november,the school board sent her a written list of reasons for her dismissal and informed her that there would be a hearing to determine if she should be dismissed.it is mcgreevy position that her employment had been terminated the previous spring.
on august,mcgreevy filed a complaint under,alleging violations of her first amendment rights and unlawful taking of her intellectual property without due process of law.that complaint named as defendants the district and school officials soltis,stroup and tsosie in their official and individual capacities.mcgreevy filed a motion to amend her complaint on september,to add,inter alia,state law claims of libel,slander,tortious interference with contract,common law conspiracy,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.the district court denied mcgreevy motion as to her intentional infliction of emotional distress and takings claims,but permitted her to file an amended complaint asserting her first amendment claim,and her state law claims of defamation,tortious interference with contract and common law conspiracy.
following several motions,the district court issued a summary judgment order on march,dismissing mcgreevy claim against the district,stating that there was no evidence of any policy,practice or custom of its board of directors that violated mcgreevy first amendment rights.the same order dismissed mcgreevy complaint against all three officials in their individual capacities on the ground that they were entitled to qualified immunity.finally,the court dismissed all remaining claims asserted in the amended complaint.the sole remaining issue left for trial was whether defendant soltis,stroup and tsosie,acting in their official capacities,retaliated against plaintiff by giving her a out of on her june of employment evaluation.app.at.
trial commenced on september.at the close of mcgreevy case,the district court granted defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law,stating that p laintiff presented no evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that either the district or the school officials in their official capacities had a practice or custom of using these evaluations for a retaliatory purpose.app.at.
this appeal followed.
discussiona.standard of review 
we have plenary review over the district court grant of summary judgment and apply the same standard as the district court.blair scott specialty gases,cir.we must view the underlying facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion and decide whether there are any genuine issues of material fact such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the party.debiec cabot,cir citing.c.the standard of review for orders granting judgment as a matter of law is also plenary and we likewise apply the same standard as the district court.a motion for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule a should be granted only if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,there is no question of material fact for the jury and any verdict other than the one directed would be erroneous under the governing law.beck city of pittsburgh,cir internal quotations omitted.
individual capacity liability 
mcgreevy argues that the district court erred in holding that the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on her claim against them.the doctrine of qualified immunity shields government officials from civil liability as long as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.in considering a defendant motion for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity,our task is to first determine whether the facts,and inferences drawn therefrom,taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,establish that the official conduct violated a constitutional right.saucier katz,d.if so,we must next determine whether,as a legal matter,the right that the defendant conduct allegedly violates was a clearly established one,about which a reasonable person would have known.gruenke seip,cir.defendants are entitled to qualified immunity only if the constitutional or statutory violation alleged is not clearly established.
mcgreevy speech was protected by the first amendment 
although public employees do not relinquish their right to free speech by virtue of their employment,neither do they enjoy absolute first amendment rights.ceballos garcetti,cir.to determine whether a public employee speech is entitled to first amendment protection,we apply a test derived from the supreme court decisions in connick myers,d,and pickering board of education,d.first,we must determine whether the speech addresses a matter of public concern.see baldassare new jersey,cir citing connick myers,d.if it does,we then employ the pickering balancing test to determine whether an employee interest in the speech outweighs the state countervailing interest as an employer in promoting workplace efficiency and avoiding workplace disruption.see pickering,at.requiring courts to strike a balance between the interests of the employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of public services it performs through its employees.finally,if these criteria are met,plaintiff must show that the protected activity was a substantial or motivating factor in the alleged retaliatory action.see healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.a public employer can rebut an employee claim of retaliation by demonstrating that it would have reached the same decision,even in the absence of the protected conduct.baldassare,at.whereas the first and second step inquiries are questions of law for the court,the final inquiry presents a question of fact for the jury.
matter of public concern 
a public employee speech addresses a matter of public concern when it relates to an issue of political,social,or other concern to the community.connick,at.the supreme court has distinguished between employee speech addressing matters of personal interest,and speech which truly targets matters of public concern.in connick,the court held that an assistant district attorney solicitation of her colleagues views on office morale,the policy for transferring employees,the need for a grievance committee,and the level of confidence in supervisors was speech intended primarily to gather ammunition for another round of controversy in the individual personnel dispute.id.at.by contrast,the connick plaintiff speech regarding the issue of whether assistant district attorneys are pressured to work in political campaigns,is a matter of interest to the community upon which it is essential that public employees be able to speak out freely without fear of retaliatory dismissal.id.at.
in the case before us,it is undisputed that mcgreevy advocacy on behalf of the two disabled students,her notice to state officials that she was not a middle school nurse,and her objection to pesticide spraying by an unlicensed individual,were matters of true public concern.see,san filippo bongiovanni,cir stating that a rutgers university professor was speaking on matters of public concern when he made statements in a school newspaper criticizing the university for inadequate ventilation in the chemistry labs,testified in a grand jury regarding an investigation into the manufacture of illegal drugs in the university laboratories,criticized the faculty attempt to secure funding for a mass spectrometer by deceiving federal funding agencies,and voiced his dissatisfaction with senior members of his department over their efforts to obtain an inappropriate percentage of his federal grants zamboni stamler,cir finding that a civil service employee criticism of county prosecutor reorganization and promotion plan was constitutionally protected speech.defendants do not argue otherwise.
b.the pickering balancing 
although mcgreevy speech did concern matters of public interest,it is protected speech only if the court also finds that her interests in the speech outweigh the state countervailing interests in the efficiency and integrity in the discharge of official duties,and in maintaining proper discipline in the public service.connick,at.the more tightly the first amendment embraces the speech the more vigorous a showing of disruption must be made.hyland wonder,cir.
speech involving government impropriety occupies the highest rung of first amendment protection.swineford snyder county,cir.therefore,defendants in the present case bear a truly heavy burden.we agree with the district court that there is no allegation on the part of defendants that plaintiff conduct greatly disrupted the functioning of the bermudian springs elementary school.app.at.because no substantial countervailing administrative interest has been proffered,we hold that for summary judgment purposes,mcgreevy speech was protected by the first amendment.
retaliation 
finally,we also agree with the district court that mcgreevy has satisfied her prima facie burden of proof and it is for the jury to decide whether plaintiff constitutionally protected activity was a substantial or motivating factor in defendant decision to give plaintiff out of on her evaluation.app.at.defendants do not contest this finding.
the constitutional right was clearly established 
we part ways with the district court however,over its conclusion that the school officials are entitled to qualified immunity despite finding that mcgreevy was engaging in protected speech,the court nonetheless found that she ha d failed to come forward with case law that closely corresponds to defendants actions which would indicate that defendants should have been aware that what they were doing was unlawful.app.at.in arriving at this decision,the court relied heavily on decisions of our sister circuits which hold that because pickering constitutional rule turns upon a balancing test,it can rarely be considered clearly established for the purposes of the harlow qualified immunity standard.app.at citing guercio brody,cir melton oklahoma city,cir dartland metro.dade county,cir noyola texas of human,cir benson allphin,cir.
we are not convinced by the district court analysis.recent decisions many from the same circuits as the above cited cases have definitively held that where the pickering balancing factors weigh heavily in favor of the employee,the law is clearly established,and qualified immunity is therefore unavailable.ceballos,at see,kinney weaver,cir distinguishing the circuit prior holding in noyola,and stating that u nderscoring the fact that noyola does not purport to command a particular result,three of the four fifth circuit pickering cases that cite noyola deny the official claim of qualified immunity paradis montrose mem l,cir denying qualified immunity after pickering balancing because the case law clearly established that plaintiff speech was a matter of public concern and entitled to protection under the first amendment williams com.of,cir same.
as a general matter,a right is clearly established when the contours of the right are sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.saucier,at.to be clearly established does not mean that the very action in question has previously been held unlawful,hope pelzer,d rather it merely means that in light of preexisting law,the unlawfulness of the official conduct was reasonably and objectively apparent.wilson layne,d.indeed,the supreme court has made clear that officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances.hope,at.
in the case before us,the illegality of the officials actions was sufficiently clear that they can fairly be said to have been on notice of the impropriety of their actions.kinney,at.defendants have not proffered any legitimate countervailing interests in limiting mcgreevy speech,much less a countervailing interest which would outweigh mcgreevy interest in addressing matters of such weighty public concern.when the balance of cognizable interests weighs so heavily in an employee favor,our cases make plain that the law is clearly established.see,czurlanis albanese,cir holding that county employees speech at board meeting was constitutionally protected because it was a matter of public concern and because the county was unable to set forth a sufficient countervailing interest monsanto quinn,cir holding that internal revenue department employee speech was constitutionally protected because it was a matter of public concern and because no substantial disruption was alleged trotman bd.of,cir reversing motion to dismiss for defendants and holding that faculty member criticism of university president constituted core speech see also porter califano,cir reversing summary judgment for defendants in a suit by a suspended for writing a letter critical of her superiors because at a minimum,the state must clearly demonstrate that the employee conduct substantially and materially interferes with the discharge of duties and responsibilities inherent in such employment.
we therefore hold that qualified immunity must be denied and that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for the school officials in their individual capacities.
district liability 
mcgreevy also asserted a claim against the district as well as against stroup and soltis in their official capacities.the district court held that the district was entitled to summary judgment because plaintiff has failed to adduce evidence of any policy,practice,or custom of the bermudian springs school board of directors that violated her first amendment rights.app.at.the court held that only the school board was a final policymaker for purposes of.
in monell dep of soc,d,the supreme court established that a municipality can not be held liable under for the constitutional torts of its employees by virtue of respondeat superior.instead,a municipality may only be liable for the torts of its employees in one of three ways first,the municipality will be liable if its employee acted pursuant to a formal government policy or a standard operating procedure long accepted within the government entity,jett dallas independent school district,d second,liability will attach when the individual has policy making authority rendering his or her behavior an act of official government policy,pembaur city of cincinnati,d third,the municipality will be liable if an official with authority has ratified the unconstitutional actions of a subordinate,rendering such behavior official for liability purposes,city of louis praprotnik,d.
for purposes of deciding the present appeal,we need focus only on the second method by which liability may attach.the supreme court decision in pembaur makes clear that an official with policymaking authority can create official policy,even by rendering a single decision.as the court stated in that case,it is plain that municipal liability may be imposed for a single decision by municipal policymakers under appropriate circumstances.at.the court further explained that the power to establish policy is not the exclusive province of the legislature and held that monell language makes clear that it expressly envisioned other officials whose acts or edicts may fairly be said to represent official policy.id.at.quoting monell,at.accordingly,even one decision by a school superintendent,if were a final policymaker,would render his or her decision district policy.therefore,in order to determine if the district can be held liable for the school officials actions,in this case mcgreevy rating,we must determine whether superintendent soltis was a final policymaker,a question of state law.
the district court believed that under pennsylvania law,a school superintendent is not a final policymaker.instead,according to the court,the school board is the final policy maker for the district as to all employment decisions including employment ratings.app.at.the court then concluded that because the superintendent is not a final policymaker and because the plaintiff has failed to adduce evidence of any policy,practice or custom of the bermudian school board of directors that violated her first amendment rights,the district was entitled to summary judgment.app.at.
in holding that a school superintendent is not a final policymaker,the district court relied on.const.stat,of the pennsylvania code.under,a majority vote of the school board is required when d ismissing a teacher after a hearing.const.stat.similarly,states that the school board has the right at any time to remove any of its officers,employees or appointees for incompetence,intemperance,neglect of duty,violation of any of the school laws of this commonwealth,or other improper conduct.const.stat.according to the district court,these statutes demonstrate that the school board is the final policymaker with regard to all employment decisions,including employee ratings.in addition,the court further justified its decision by relying on which lists the duties of district superintendents but does not mention employment ratings.lastly,the district court relied on decisions of the courts of appeals for the seventh and eighth circuits which held that the school board and not the school superintendent has the ultimate responsibility for all school district policies.see springdale educ.ass springdale sch,cir duda franklin park sch,cir 
the fact that the pennsylvania code provides that the school board is the final policymaker regarding dismissal of employees does not mean that a school board action is a prerequisite for imposition of liability on the district.although dismissal by the school board may be based,in part,on the employee employment rating.const.stat.makes clear that the superintendent is the final policymaker over ratings determinations.section provides 
rating shall be done by or under the supervision of the superintendent of schools or,if so directed by him,the same may be done by an assistant superintendent,a supervisor,or a principal,who has supervision over the work of the professional employe sic or temporary professional employe sic who is being rated provided,that sic no unsatisfactory rating shall be valid unless approved by the district superintendent.
id.this section unambiguously gives the superintendent final policymaking authority with regard to employment ratings.
as we explained in kneipp tedder,cir,i n order to ascertain who is a policy maker a court must determine which official had final,unreviewable discretion to make a decision or take action.id.at internal quotations omitted.in this case,defendants argued,and the district court agreed,that under kneipp the school board is the final policymaker because the board would have had the power to review mcgreevy rating if she had appealed.we disagree.
mcgreevy did not appeal to the school board with respect to her rating,and she was not
