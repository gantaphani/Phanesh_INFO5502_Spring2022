emcasco insurance company emcasco filed a subrogation suit against american international specialty lines insurance company aislic to recover under aislic commercial general liability policy for monies emcasco paid in defense and settlement of an underlying suit against the two insurers mutual insured.after limited discovery,both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court granted aislic motion,denied emcasco,and dismissed the subrogation suit with prejudice.finding the need for further proceedings,we vacate and remand.
in february,jaime langston was driving down a paved,public country road with her young son when she skidded on a patch of slick mud,clay,sand.the car swerved off the road,striking a tree.langston suffered serious injuries,and her son died at the scene.
in april,the langstons sued,the operator of a sand pit located immediately adjacent to the accident site,in state court on the premise that,as part of its operation at the sand pit,hauled sand from the pit in trucks that it owned and operated.the original complaint alleged that because of heavy rains preceding the accident,trucks tracked mud onto the roadway when exiting a driveway leading away from the sand pit and that the mud on the road was the producing cause of the accident.
and sls had two different insurance policies covering their activities at the sand pit.specifically,emcasco issued a commercial auto liability policy to and sls,and aislic issued both companies a commercial general liability policy the cgl policy.emcasco commercial auto liability policy provides,in relevant part 
section coverage 
we will pay all sums an insured legally must pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies,caused by an accident and resulting from the ownership,maintenance or use of a covered auto.
aislic cgl policy,meanwhile,provides coverage as follows

a.we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this coverage applies.we will have the right and duty to defend any suit seeking those damages.however,we will have no duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking damages for bodily injury or property damage to which this coverage does not apply.we may,at our discretion,investigate any occurrence and settle any claim or suit that may result.
aislic policy also contains the following exclusion

bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership,maintenance,use or entrustment to others of any aircraft,auto or watercraft owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured.use includes operation and loading or unloading.
about seven weeks after the accident but a year before the langstons sued,emcasco hired defense counsel mike winchester to defend.in doing so,emcasco asserted its reservation of rights in defending the suit.in april,aislic hired its own defense counsel,chad parker,to represent interests in the langston suit.aislic also issued a reservation of rights letter in which aislic advised that,in its view,the existence of the auto exclusion provision in the cgl policy precluded coverage in the langstons suit.specifically,aislic stated 
while the plaintiff pleadings are ambiguous,we expect that it will come out during the course of this litigation that the only involvement of,was the fact that its autos,as defined by the policy,were going into and out of the sand in question for some weeks proceeding sic the accident,and liability for this would fall squarely under the above exclusion it appears that there will be no coverage for the damages claimed by the plaintiff by virtue of the above policy provisions.
after hiring parker,aislic agreed,in january,to settle the langstons claims against sls for.after the settlement,counsel for emcasco and personal counsel notified aislic that they believed the claims the langstons had remaining against still invoked aislic coverage.
it is at this point that the parties disagree as to the extent of the work performed by parker in aislic defense of.emcasco maintains that,after the sls settlement,parker never reappeared in the suit in defense.meanwhile,aislic argues that at the time it secured the settlement between the langstons and sls,the discovery and pleading deadlines relating to had passed under the terms of the docket control order.aislic acknowledges that parker did little or no work on behalf of after that time but insists that there was little substantive work to be done aside from actually trying the case.
emcasco thereafter demanded that aislic share equally in the cost of settling the case on behalf.aislic refused,citing the langstons pleadings,the evidence it assumed would be introduced at trial,and statements made by the langstons counsel as eliminating any liability that aislic might be exposed to under its cgl policy.
in effect,aislic maintained that only faced liability stemming from emcasco auto liability policy.the last version of the fourth amended complaint,however,circulated after sls settled,alleges that the unpaved exit that created from the sandpit to the public road caused a washing of mud onto the road during rainy weather and that the exit drive was not paved until after the accident.it also includes a separate claim for negligence per se because the defendant obstructed the road adjacent to its worksite,which is a violation of section of the texas penal code.
aislic did offer to contribute to a potential settlement in defense.emcasco refused the offer because aislic conditioned the money on the agreement that the parties would not later attempt to settlement costs.emcasco advised aislic that it would settle the claims against without aislic participation.emcasco then obtained a release of all claims against by settling with the langstons for.
emcasco sued aislic for subrogation,seeking to recover all or part of the it had paid the langstons in settlement.after limited discovery,emcasco and aislic simultaneously filed for summary judgment.
the district court granted aislic motion,finding that the langstons damages were covered by emcasco auto liability policy and were explicitly excluded by aislic cgl policy.it held that the washing of the mud from the unpaved roadway could not have been a separate and independent cause of the accident,which would have indicated that aislic policy also covered the accident.the court determined that the tracked onto the public road by necessarily involved the use of motor vehicles,triggering coverage under its auto policy with emcasco.emcasco appeals.

emcasco maintains the district court erred in interpreting the auto exclusion clause in aislic cgl policy,which precludes coverage for damages arising out of the ownership,maintenance,use or entrustment of any auto owned or operated by the insured,to eliminate aislic liability for monies recovered in the langstons suit.emcasco argues that the recovered damages did not arise out of the use of a vehicle it claims the clause is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation and thus,under texas law,should be construed to provide coverage for any not unreasonable construction.emcasco insists that the district court erred by not addressing the coverage issue against the backdrop formed by texas law regarding the construction of insurance contracts.
aislic,meanwhile,argues that,for three reasons,this court should not defer to the not unreasonable construction of the relevant coverage provisions.first,it contends the policies at issue contain no ambiguity that would implicate the method of contract construction favoring the insured.second,it insists that emcasco proposed reading of the policies does not favor the insured,because emcasco interpretation merely shifts the coverage for the underlying settlement from emcasco to aislic,yielding no benefit to.finally,aislic maintains that emcasco interpretation of the policies is unreasonable because it is inconsistent with texas law and relies on caselaw that is inapposite to the facts.
under texas law,whether an insurer has a duty to defend is governed by the eight corners rule whereby the allegations in the petition filed against the insured are compared against the insurance policy.king dallas fire ins.in reviewing the underlying petition,we focus on the factual allegations that show the origin of damages rather than on the legal theories alleged.union fire ins.merchs.fast motor lines,per curiam.any ambiguity in the coverage language should be read in favor of the insured.trinity universal ins.cowan.importantly,in a subrogation case such as this,texas law recognizes the right of one insurer to seek payment from a second insurer under the doctrine of equitable subrogation 
to recover damages,the plaintiff must show a causal relationship between the injury and the use of the auto.union,at.in union,the court found that the facts alleged in the pleadings did not suggest even a remote causal relationship between the truck operation and the plaintiff injury and concluded that the insurer auto liability coverage was not triggered the only facts alleged are that hart was operating a merchants truck when he negligently discharged a firearm injuring gonzalez.given their most liberal interpretation,these allegations do not suggest that gonzalez injury resulted from the use of the truck.id.at.
the langstons third amended petition states that a s to defendant,it is specifically alleged that the bodily injury,wrongful death,and property damage was caused by an accident resulting from the ownership,maintenance and use of the trucks hauling sand from the worksite in question.this language suggests that based on the pleadings alone,it can not be said that a causal relationship was not alleged between the use of the trucks and the injury.therefore,unlike the auto insurer in union,emcasco is not entitled,based on the pleadings alone,to a determination that there was no coverage.rather,the pleadings show that emcasco had a duty to defend.
the duties to defend and to indemnify are distinct and separate,however.see farmers.mut.ins.griffin.an insurer may initially have a duty to defend but,eventually,no duty to indemnify.id.therefore,we must determine whether there is a duty to indemnify.
in deciding whether such a duty to indemnify exists,texas courts use the complete operation theory,travelers ins.employers cas,under which the provision for use coverage extends to foreseeable consequences of what was done in connection with the use of the car,so long as the act or thing done by the insured employee which causes the accident arises out of the use of the insured car,red ball motor freight employers mut.liab.ins,cir.further,a rising out of are words of much broader significance than caused by.they are ordinarily understood to mean originating from having its origin in,growing out of or flowing from,or in short,incident to,or having connection with,the use of the car.id.at.
in red ball,we held that the act of the driver of a tractor in not closing the fueling valve,which proximately caused an explosion,was an act that arose out of the use of the truck because it was incident to,and having a connection with,the use of the truck.id.in doing so,we emphasized that fueling a truck for the journey was just as much a use of it as making the journey would be.id.in sum,the complete operation test has two distinct inquiries whether the insured act was an act incident to,and having a connection with,the use of the truck and whether that act proximately caused plaintiff injury 
with respect to the first inquiry,texas courts have read business auto policies to cover loading and unloading of the covered vehicle even if that is not specifically mentioned in the text of the policy further,loading and unloading has been interpreted to cover acts incident to making a commercial delivery this includes the entire process involved in the movement of the articles from the place where insured employees find the articles which are to be moved by truck,to the place where the employees of insured turn them over to the party to whom they are to make delivery.am.employers ins.brock,writ ref travelers,at.
under this expansive view of what constitutes an auto use,an insurer was liable for injuries sustained by a pedestrian who fell into an open sidewalk elevator shaft when employees in charge of the insured truck left the shaft doors open while obtaining cross bars to guard the shaft,notwithstanding that nothing had been loaded onto or unloaded from the truck at the time of the fall.am.employers,at.therefore,for insurance coverage to exist,the vehicle itself need not be in operation or in motion or an active participant in the plaintiff injuries 
the auto insurer also relies on the rule that there must be a causal relation or connection between the accident or injury and the ownership,maintenance or use of the vehicle.this does not mean that the accident must be caused by negligent operation of the vehicle or some defect therein.when a vehicle is being unloaded it is being used to the same extent as if it were being driven,and the person doing the unloading is entitled to the same protection as the owner or operator.
travelers,at.
it appears that texas courts have never decided whether mud,clay,sand,or other debris tracked by a truck tires or fallen from its cargo is incident to its use.we conclude,from the broad interpretation texas courts have given to what is incident to the use of an automobile,that such debris is indeed incident to the use of the vehicle.debris falling from a car cargo is incident to the transportation of that cargo it is inherent in the transportation of cargo that some of it may spill or fall unto the road similarly,the tracking of debris by the tires is incident to the operation of a vehicle on unpaved roads it is inherent in driving on unpaved roads that some sand,mud,or clay may attach to the tires 
further,because the plaintiff injuries need not be caused by the negligent operation of the vehicle,but instead by an act incident to its use,it is not necessary that the plaintiff injuries occur at the time of or immediately after the tracking of debris on the highway we thus reject emcasco contention that the causal standard mandated by the phrase arising out of,however broad,appears at least to require the contemporaneous use of the insured vehicle.the accident need not be contemporaneous with the use of the vehicle so long as it is a foreseeable consequence of an act incidental to the use of the vehicle,such as the tracking of debris.
this takes us to the second test for determining whether a duty to indemnify exists whether the tracking of mud onto the highway was the proximate cause of the injuries.the reasoning for this inquiry is plain if the factfinder determines that the insured act in connection with the use of the vehicle did not proximately cause the injuries,the insured is not liable,and the insurer has no duty to indemnify 
in this regard,the operation or driving of the vehicle need not be the proximate cause of the injuries this observation merely restates the notion we discussed earlier,that a vehicle need not be in active operation such as in a collision for insurance coverage to exist.rather,as this court has interpreted texas law in red ball,at,only the act incident to,or in connection with,the use of the vehicle must be the proximate cause of the injuries.
