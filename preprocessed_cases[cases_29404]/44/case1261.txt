appellant anna jensen is a letter carrier with the kingston,pennsylvania branch of the united states post office.in this action against her employer,she brings claims for retaliation and sex discrimination pursuant to title vii of the civil rights act of,et.the district court granted the postmaster general motion for summary judgment as to both claims,and jensen appealed.
we will reverse and remand.with respect to retaliation,the district court incorrectly held that coworker harassment can not violate a.as to sex discrimination,the record contains evidence sufficient to support a finding that the alleged retaliatory harassment was also discrimination because of sex.see a.
both jensen claims arise from a series of events that began with an unwanted sexual proposition.while at work on saturday morning,september,jensen received a phone call from supervisor carl waters.waters had the day off,and he asked if jensen knew the way to his home.when jensen said she did,he gave her directions.as he spoke,waters struggled with the pronunciation of certain street names.he apologized to jensen and attributed the slurred speech to an drinking binge.
after completing the directions,waters said now anna,i do care what obscenity you go in and tell those guys in the office,get out of there right now because i want to make love to you all day long.app.jensen declined,but waters persisted,asking her at least to join him for breakfast.jensen again said no,and waters responded anna,you put me in a compromising position.app.jensen made it clear that her decision was final,and the conversation ended.
the next day,jensen phoned kingston branch manager chris moss and reported the incident.a more detailed discussion occurred when jensen returned to work on tuesday the.waters continued to work at the kingston branch for two more days,but jensen and he did not interact.on thursday the,the postal service transferred waters to the ashley branch.an investigation followed,and in january waters was fired.
meanwhile,on september,supervisor rick honeychurch moved jensen workstation from moss office to a desk in an area of the post office called unit.jensen stay in moss office had begun after an injury required the use of crutches and the elevation of jensen leg.moss testified that he instructed honeychurch to move jensen for two reasons her leg had healed and he had confidentiality concerns about the pending waters investigation.for her part,jensen heard that moss feared being alone with her.whatever the reason,jensen new desk was the former workspace of carl waters,and her reception in unit was not friendly.
right away,letter carrier joe sickler began to pepper jensen with insults.on september,he referred to jensen as the obscenity who got waters in trouble.app.he then remarked within jensen earshot that she would have to get off her fat obscenity once a new supervisor arrived.the next day,jensen overheard sickler discussing a proposed petition to bring waters back.sickler also stated that waters should not have to apologize for anything.some time later,sickler crept up behind jensen and clapped two objects together.startled,jensen cringed with fright.she then reported sickler behavior to moss and asked to be removed from unit.moss said he would talk to sickler,but he declined to move jensen despite the availability of another workstation.when asked at his deposition to explain why he did not move jensen,moss answered because i did.app.sickler offensive comments continued at a pace of two to three times per week for about months.
besides sickler,letter carrier ed jones,a friend to jensen before she reported waters,now threatened her by driving toward her at a rapid pace.he also told jensen that he disagreed with the decision to terminate waters.approximately one year after the waters incident,unknown vandals twice scratched jensen car with a key,spit on the car,and spilled coffee on it.all the incidents occurred in the post office parking lot before the waters telephone call vandals had never victimized jensen.
in addition to her initial request to leave unit,jensen repeatedly complained to moss and honeychurch about her coworkers behavior.at some point during the relevant when is claims to have confronted sickler about his offensive comments.conditions did not improve,however,until months after jensen first complaint.at that time,jensen complained to a new supervisor,melissa white.white brought jensen into moss office,and jensen again detailed her treatment at the hands of coworkers.moss,white,and union officials then confronted sickler,and jensen troubles quickly abated.
during this period,jensen suffered panic attacks,she used sick time because of stress,and her asthma caused trips to the emergency room.she attributes these problems to working conditions at the post office.
based on these events,jensen brought two claims sex discrimination pursuant to a,and retaliation under a.the district court granted the defendant motion for summary judgment on both claims,and this appeal followed.our review is plenary,and we view the facts in the light most favorable to jensen.see united artists theatre circuit,twp.of warrington,cir.if a reasonable jury could find for her,we must reverse.neumeyer beard,cir.
jensen claims that her employer is liable for her coworkers actions under section a of title vii,a.that provision makes it an unlawful employment practice to discriminate against an employee because the employee has made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or hearing under title vii.the parties dispute both the scope of this prohibition and its application to this case.as a result,we must first clarify a meaning and then apply those principles to the record before us.
the threshold question is whether a retaliation claim predicated upon a hostile work environment is cognizable under a.jensen says it is,the postmaster says it is,and our sister circuits are split.a majority has held that the statute prohibits severe or pervasive retaliatory harassment.see noviello city of boston,cir von gunten maryland,cir ray henderson,cir richardson state dep t of corr,cir gunnell utah valley state,cir wideman stores,cir knox indiana,cir see also morris oldham county fiscal court,cir holding that retaliatory harassment by a supervisor is actionable but tak ing no position on whether an employer can be liable for coworkers retaliatory harassment.the fifth and eighth circuits,however,limit a to ultimate employment decisions,and thus do not view harassment to be within the statute reach.see manning metropolitan life ins,cir mattern eastman kodak,cir.
while our court has never addressed the precise question,the logic of our decision in robinson city of pittsburgh,cir,points toward the majority approach.in robinson,we held that r etaliatory conduct other than discharge or refusal to rehire violates title vii when it alters the employee compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,deprives him or her of employment opportunities,or adversely affect s his or her status as an employee.id.at quoting a alterations in original.put another way,a prohibits a quantum of discrimination coterminous with that prohibited by a.id.at see also von gunten,at rejecting the fifth circuit ultimate employment decision standard because conformity between the provisions of title vii is to be preferred internal quotation omitted.
under a,the cognizability of a discrimination claim founded upon a hostile work environment is.see,harris forklift,d sex meritor sav.bank,fsb vinson,d same caver city of trenton,cir race cardenas massey,cir national origin abramson william paterson coll.of new jersey,cir religion.the statutory basis for these claims is the notion that discriminatory ridicule or abuse can so infect a workplace that it alters the terms or conditions of the plaintiff employment.see meritor,at.if harassment can alter the terms or conditions of employment under,then robinson teaches that the same is true under.see robinson,at.we thus hold that both provisions can be offended by harassment that is severe or pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment.
in light of the consistency between the two provisions,our usual hostile work environment framework applies equally to jensen claim of retaliatory harassment.thus,jensen must prove that she suffered intentional discrimination because of her protected activity the discrimination was severe or pervasive the discrimination detrimentally affected her it would have detrimentally affected a reasonable person in like circumstances and a basis for employer liability is present.see weston pennsylvania,cir robinson,at.
the test first element concretely expresses the principle that title vii is not a general civility code for the american workplace.see oncale sundowner offshore,d.many may suffer severe or pervasive harassment at work,but if the reason for that harassment is one that is not proscribed by title vii,it follows that title vii provides no relief.this first step,therefore,requires us to identify what harassment,if any,a reasonable jury could link to a retaliatory animus.see farrell planters lifesavers,cir shaner synthes,cir aman cort furniture,cir.
in determining whether conduct was retaliatory,our cases have tended to focus on two factors the temporal proximity between the protected activity and the alleged discrimination and the existence of a pattern of antagonism in the intervening period.see abramson william paterson coll.of new jersey,cir quoting woodson scott paper,cir.timing alone raises the requisite inference when it is unusually suggestive of retaliatory motive,but even if temporal proximity is missing,courts may look to the intervening period for other evidence of retaliatory animus.krouse american sterilizer,cir.despite this focus,t hese are not the exclusive ways to show causation,as the proffered evidence,looked at as a whole,may suffice to raise the inference.farrell,at see also kachmar sungard data systems,cir the element of causation,which necessarily involves an inquiry into the motives of an employer,is highly.
this same principle applies in our hostile work environment cases under a.there,we have deemed it improper to isolate incidents of facially neutral harassment and conclude,one by one,that each lacks the required discriminatory animus.see,cardenas,at aman,at.because it is often difficult to determine the motivations of an action,the discrimination analysis must concentrate not on individual incidents,but on the overall scenario.andrews,at.
with these principles in mind,we turn to the summary judgment record before us.the prime antagonist in jensen retaliation claim is letter carrier joe sickler.shortly after waters transfer to the ashley office,sickler called jensen the obscenity who got waters in trouble he also stated that when a new supervisor came jensen would have to get off her fat obscenity.app.because these insults directly relate to jensen complaint against waters,they raise an obvious inference of retaliatory animus.andrews,at the intent to discriminate on the basis of sex in cases involving sexually derogatory language is implicit,and thus should be recognized as a matter of course.more important,these statements may provide a window into sickler thinking throughout the barrage of offensive comments.if sickler conduct were viewed in isolation,his motives would be unclear,but his earlier statements provide a reasonable basis for thinking that the later abuse resulted from latent hostility to jensen whistleblowing.thus,the record as a whole supports a finding that all of sickler harassment was based on a retaliatory animus.
jensen also alleges physical threats by letter carrier ed jones.like sickler loud and frightening clap,jones alleged assaults are facially neutral.nonetheless,the record contains other evidence from which a factfinder could infer motive.first,before the waters incident,jensen and jones were friends shortly after it,jones menaced her with heavy equipment.this temporal proximity between the protected activity and jones changed behavior is probative of a retaliatory intent.see abramson,at.second,the record contains evidence that jones expressed disagreement with the decision to remove waters.this statement,when combined with the sudden shift in behavior,permits an inference that jones newfound hostility resulted from jensen protected activity.
in addition to sickler habitual insults and jones threatening use of postal equipment,jensen alleges that vandals twice keyed her car,spit on it,and spilled coffee on it.standing alone,these acts of vandalism contain no indicia of retaliation.but as with the other events,the analysis changes significantly upon consideration of the overall scenario.see andrews,at.though the vandalism did not begin until approximately one year after jensen reported waters,sickler berating of jensen allegedly continued even months after the waters incident.if true,and we assume it to be so on summary judgment,this intervening antagonism tends to show that these seemingly unrelated incidents were components of an integrated pattern of retaliation.see abramson,at aman,at concluding that,in light of racially abusive remarks,a reasonable jury could infer that facially neutral acts like stealing time cards were part of a complex tapestry of discrimination.in sum,a reasonable jury could find that all the alleged coworker,sickler insults,jones physical threats,and vehicle damage caused by unknown the product of intentional discrimination because of jensen protected activity.
having identified the conduct that a reasonable jury could label retaliatory,our next task is to measure the harassment severity or pervasiveness.as stated earlier,this inquiry has both subjective and objective components.see faragher,at.we can quickly dispense with the subjective prong.at her deposition,jensen testified that her coworkers actions caused anxiety attacks,trips to the emergency room,and use of her sick leave.app.this evidence would support a finding that jensen subjectively viewed the work environment to be hostile.see harris,at.
of course,jensen subjective reaction to the discrimination is not enough.she must also show an objectively hostile work environment.two elements of our test relate to this question.the second prong requires severe or pervasive harassment the fourth requires discrimination that would have detrimentally affected a reasonable person.see ante at.when applied,they coalesce into a single inquiry did the plaintiff suffer retaliatory harassment severe or pervasive enough to alter the conditions of her employment and create an abusive working environment see meritor,at.robinson,at.
like the requirement of intentional discrimination,the need for an objectively abusive work environment further distinguishes title vii from a generalized civility code.oncale,at.the statute prohibits severe or pervasive harassment it does not mandate a happy workplace.occasional insults,teasing,or episodic instances of ridicule are not enough they do not permeate the workplace and change the very nature of the plaintiff employment.see faragher,at.harris,at.factors to be weighed include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.harris,at.no one factor is dispositive,and the analysis must focus on the totality of the circumstances.andrews,at.
while the severe or pervasive standard applies equally to and,it is especially crucial in the retaliation context.when one employee makes a charge under title vii against another,some strain on workplace relationships is inevitable.see von gunten,at.sides will be chosen,lines will be drawn,and those who were once the whistleblower friends may not be so friendly anymore.see noviello,at.but what the statute proscribes is retaliation,not loyalty to an accused coworker or a desire to avoid entanglement in workplace controversy.see also brooks city of san mateo,cir because an employer can not force employees to socialize with one another,ostracism suffered at the hands of coworkers can not constitute an adverse employment action.thus,while we must consider the totality of the circumstances
