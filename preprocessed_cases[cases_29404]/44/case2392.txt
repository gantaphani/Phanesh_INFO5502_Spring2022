this case arises from a tragic and deadly incident at the rural michigan home of the tanner family that occurred around on october.kirk and deanna tanner had taken in deanna sister cindy baker because she was involved in a domestic dispute with her husband keith baker baker.baker had appeared at the house the evening before both drunk and angry.the tanners called the police when he came again in the middle of the night.just as baker was backing out of the driveway,the police arrived.baker reacted by driving back up the driveway to the house,after which he got out of his vehicle,forced his way into the residence,shot kirk five times,shot deanna twice,shot and killed his wife cindy,and then committed suicide by shooting himself in the head.
the tanners fortunately survived their gunshot wounds.they subsequently brought suit against lenawee county,the officers who initially responded to the call,the county sheriff,and the incident commander of the emergency response team ert,a group that responds to dangerous situations in lenawee county at the request of local law enforcement.among other claims,the tanners alleged that they were deprived of their constitutional right to substantive due process based on the manner in which the defendants handled the confrontation with baker.the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on the basis that the tanners had failed to demonstrate that their constitutional rights were violated.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual.repeated visits to the tanner home by an intoxicated baker prompt a call 
the tanner family lives in a house at the end of a driveway in rural michigan.on the night of october,deanna sister cindy was staying there because of arguments that had ensued at cindy own home when she told baker that she wanted a divorce.baker,who was intoxicated and angry,had appeared at the tanner home on several occasions that night looking for cindy.the final visit came shortly before on october.as baker drove his vehicle up the tanners driveway,kirk told deanna to call.deanna did so at and told the operator that baker was drunk and armed.the operator told deanna that there were officers in the vicinity and to stay on the line.
baker made his way to the front door of the tanner house.after baker knocked on the door,kirk told him that the police were on the way.baker started kicking the door and yelling that he wanted to see cindy.kirk held the door to keep it from breaking open.baker left the front door and began pounding on the walls and windows of the house.at this point,deanna asked the operator where are the police where are they why are they here yet the operator replied stay on the line.they be there.
kirk saw a vehicle pass the house that he thought was a squad car,so he began turning the front porch light on and off to attract attention.baker returned to the front door and kirk again told him that the police were on their way.upon hearing this,baker walked to his vehicle.relieved,kirk stepped out onto the back deck to smoke a cigarette.
officers adams and hunt respond to the call 
officers adams and hunt were two to three miles from the tanner home when they received the dispatch that its occupants were in need of assistance.dispatch told the officers that t here was an individual there that they believed may have been intoxicated,that had stated they sic had a weapon,and may be trying to gain entry into the house.as the officers neared the tanner residence,they could not locate any address on the house or the mailbox.after driving by the house for the second time,the officers saw brake lights in the driveway and concluded that this must be the tanner home because there was no other activity at the surrounding residences at this hour.the officers turned around and pulled in the driveway just as a vehicle was starting to back up.deanna saw the officers pull in and mistakenly told the operator that it was her husband kirk,and not baker,who was currently backing down the long driveway.despite deanna mistake,the record does not indicate that this information was relayed to the officers.
as the officers drove up the driveway,the vehicle driven by baker stopped backing up and started moving towards the house.the officers followed the vehicle back up the driveway until it stopped in front of the garage.around this time,officer hunt concluded that the driver of the vehicle was the individual that they had been called to the tanner home to stop,but officer adams made no such deduction.there are several different versions of what happened next.
officer hunt testified by deposition that both he and adams exited their squad car as baker stepped out of his vehicle.hunt said that he had his hand on his gun while adams was yelling for baker to show his hands.baker turned towards the officers and then ran in the opposite direction as he pulled a handgun from his waist.when hunt saw baker pull his gun,he yelled gun,gun,gun and pulled out his own gun.hunt then started chasing baker on foot.just after baker disappeared into the darkness,hunt tripped over something and fell to the ground.as hunt got back up and tried to continue running,he heard gunshots.
officer adams testified by deposition that he exited the squad car just after baker stopped pulling forward.speaking loudly,adams told baker to stop and asked him to show his hands,but baker ran towards the house and pulled out a gun.adams then started chasing baker on foot,running as fast as he could.once adams saw baker weapon,he drew his own gun.baker disappeared into the darkness,causing adams to head back to the squad car to radio dispatch and to retrieve a rifle.
the sheriff office incident report states that adams,instead of running after baker as he said in his deposition,ran around the house in the opposite direction from hunt to try to head baker off.
kirk tanner testified by deposition that he looked out the window of his house and saw baker standing outside.baker then made a movement consistent with putting a clip of ammunition into his gun.kirk then saw baker walk around the house.contrary to the statements of the officers,kirk said that they were sitting in their squad car as baker headed towards the house.in a statement to police the day after the incident,however,kirk said that as baker ran around behind the house,t he cop was chasing him.
kirk christopher kc tanner,who was years old at the time,was also watching the scene unfold from a window.he testified by deposition that the officers did not say anything to baker as the latter ran towards the house.
in their second amended complaint,the tanners allege that adams and hunt ordered baker to stop and show his hands,but did nothing further to enforce their order after the assailant ignored their order.
baker shoots his way into the tanner house 
after baker made his way to the back of the tanner home,he shot through a sliding glass door,hitting kirk four times.kirk,gushing blood,retreated to the bedroom where his wife and son kc were,but baker followed and shot deanna.in response,kirk swung a piece of wood at baker and hit him in the head.baker then shot kirk for a fifth time while deanna and kc ran from the room.as they attempted to make their way out of the house,baker shot deanna again.kirk eventually fell to the floor in the living room,phasing in and out of consciousness.deanna ran out of the broken sliding glass door and around the house towards the officers and the squad car,but her son did not follow her.kc later ran through the broken sliding glass door as well.he joined his mother in the back of the squad car.
at this point,breanne tanner age was hiding in the closet of her room with her aunt,cindy baker.kyler tanner age was also in the room.both children saw baker pull cindy out of the closet and lethally shoot her.during the shooting,a stray bullet hit breanne in the leg.kyler took breanne out of the bedroom and into the living room.kyler then went back to the bedroom where he saw baker put a gun to his head,realize that it was not loaded,pick up a second gun,and shoot himself in the head.kyler got towels for his father and his sister.the two children then left the house through the broken sliding glass door and made their way to the police officers,who were standing behind kirk truck in the driveway.they told the officers that uncle keith had shot himself in the head.the officers could hear kirk moaning inside of the house.
adams and hunt did not enter the residence because they were instructed to await the arrival of cletus smith,the ert incident commander.the ert was dispatched to the scene at.when smith and sheriff larry richardson arrived,sheriff richardson ceded command to smith because smith was the ert incident commander.at,field interviews of the children were conducted.kc told the officers that his father had been shot at least four times and was lying on the floor in the living room.kyler told the officers that baker had shot himself in the head and that blood was gurgling everywhere.this information was conveyed to smith,but smith was not convinced that baker was dead.he said that kyler report that baker had shot himself in the head did not provide a sufficient degree of certainty regarding that fact.the ert proceeded on the assumption that baker was not dead.
although smith was the incident commander,ert commander michael creswell was the person in overall charge of the situation at the tanner home.at,creswell ordered the ert entry team to go into the tanner home and secure it.the team rescued kirk tanner,who was airlifted to a hospital.all of the tanners survived their gunshot wounds,but both cindy and keith baker died in the tanner home.
procedural background 
in their second amended complaint filed in the lenawee county circuit court in february of,the tanners alleged four causes of action that the individual defendants adams,hunt,richardson,and smith were both negligent and grossly negligent in a way that caused the tanners damages,that all of the defendants violated the tanners rights under the michigan constitution to security and protection by the state,that the individual defendants violated the tanners substantive due process rights under the united states constitution,and that the lenawee county sheriff department and lenawee county violated the tanners federal substantive due process rights by a having in place policies and procedures that provided them with inadequate protection,and b by failing to enact policies that would have provided the family with more protection.
the defendants removed the case to the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan.shortly thereafter,the district court remanded the tanners claims back to the lenawee county circuit court,leaving only the two federal constitutional claims pending in the district court.the lenawee county sheriff department was then dismissed on the stipulation of the parties because it is not a legal entity capable of being sued.
in august of,after extensive discovery,the defendants filed a joint motion for summary judgment.the motion alleged that there were no genuine issues of material fact,and that the defendants were entitled to a judgment as a matter of law under rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure.after concluding that the defendants did not owe the tanners any duty to protect or rescue,the district court entered a summary judgment in favor of the defendants.

b.the tanners claims as to adams and hunt 
to succeed on their claim brought pursuant to against officers adams and hunt,the tanners must show that a person,acting under color of state law,deprived them of a federal right.berger city of mayfield heights,cir.the only element at issue in this case is the the tanners have shown that adams and hunt violated the family substantive due process rights as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment.
in deshaney winnebago county department of social services,d,the supreme court held that a s a general matter,a state failure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the due process clause.there is an exception to this rule,however,when the plaintiff can demonstrate an affirmative act by the state which either created or increased the risk that the plaintiff would be exposed to an act of violence by a third party a special danger to the plaintiff wherein the state actions placed the plaintiff specifically at risk,as distinguished from a risk that affects the public at large and the state knew or should have known that its actions specifically endangered the plaintiff.cartwright city of marine city,cir.the tanners rely on this exception in an attempt to show that their substantive due process rights were violated.
according to the tanners,officers adams and hunt increased the danger to the family in three ways by responding to the call making their presence known to baker when they blocked him in the tanners driveway and pursued him up the driveway and t aking no further action by remaining in their vehicle as baker walked towards the tanner home with a loaded gun in sight.whether the officers in fact took no further action to protect the tanners is far from clear.as set forth above,there are several conflicting sources of evidence on this point.the district court concluded that the officers did yell at baker and pursued him on foot.in their brief,the tanners contend that the district court erred in making these factual determinations as to what actions adams and hunt took after pulling into the driveway.they argue on appeal that adams and hunt inexplicably simply sat and watched as baker approached the house with a loaded gun.
although there appears to be a genuine dispute as to whether adams and hunt simply sat and watched or whether they yelled at baker and pursued him on foot,a closer examination reveals that the question is not material to the resolution of this case.see anderson,at.only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment.factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted.even under the tanners version of the facts,we are of the opinion that they have failed to satisfy the requirements of the exception.
according to the tanners version of the adams and hunt simply sat and watched as baker approached the only affirmative acts that the officers performed were responding to the call and driving up the driveway.see cartwright,at holding that only affirmative acts of government officials can give rise to liability under the exception.these acts allegedly trapped baker in the driveway when he was otherwise leaving,causing the tanners to argue that the officers increased the risk that baker would harm the family.
the tanners argument fails for two reasons.first,the exception has never been extended to cover situations where the police simply respond to the scene of a call including pulling into the driveway.adams and hunt were dispatched to the tanner home because the tanners called and were in need of police assistance.in attempting to protect the family,the officers drove to the scene and entered the driveway as soon as they identified the correct address.from a policy perspective,imposing liability on the officers for acting in this manner would dissuade the police from responding expeditiously to calls.
the tanners,however,cite the unpublished decision of may franklin county board of commissioners.cir,for the proposition that responding to a call can give rise to a duty to protect the caller.in may,three separate calls wer
