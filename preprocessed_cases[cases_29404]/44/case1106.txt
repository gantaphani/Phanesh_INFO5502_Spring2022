opinion of the court 
md mall associates,md mall,appeals from the summary judgment entered against it by the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania on md mall claims that csx transportation,csx,a railroad,is liable for storm water flooding md mall property.for the reasons that follow,we will vacate the district court grant of summary judgment,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
a.the runoff problem 
md mall owns and operates the macdade mall the mall located in delaware county,pennsylvania.the mall is bounded on the south by a single railroad track owned by csx,and,interestingly enough,on the east by south avenue.csx property consists of the track and two drainage ditches,one running along either side of the track.houses located to the south of the track are at a higher elevation than the track,and the track is at a higher elevation than the mall.csx predecessor in interest designed and installed an earthen berm on the north side of the track to prevent storm water from flowing downhill onto the property occupied by the mall.the berm straddles the property line of the mall and the railroad,with the north side of it sloping down into the parking lot.the mall claims ownership of that slope up to the crest of the berm.
for many years after being built,the berm prevented storm water from discharging onto md mall property.in october,however,storm water breached the berm at a spot near south avenue,allowing water runoff and debris from csx property to flow down the slope and overwhelm a private storm water inlet located in the mall parking lot.an md mall representative sent two letters,dated october,and january,asking csx to contact him to discuss a resolution to the runoff problem.in response,csx road master responsible for that portion of the track inspected the site.based on the road master findings,a csx engineer wrote in an internal memorandum that,i nstead of the water flowing over the crossing at south avenue and down the road towards the storm drains,it is not reaching the crossing and is instead running towards the mall property.app.at.the engineer proposed that csx dig a d itch on csx property along the area and block the hill leading to the property,allowing the water to flow into the road and down to a public storm drain.app.at.he also raised the possibility of installing a culvert under south avenue to send the water to a nearby stream.in an email dated january,the engineer notified md mall that csx intended to implement the first option,which was less costly,and that it would complete the project in a timely fashion.app.at.
despite that assurance,csx did not go forward with that plan.instead,it began constructing a concrete spillway on the mall side of the berm to direct csx storm water into the mall private drainage inlet.csx workers cleared out a channel on the berm and set up wooden forms to create the spillway,all of which md mall asserts was done without its consent,while csx claims that md mall had consented to the installation in order to stop mud and debris from entering the mall property.
whether or not there had been consent,when the mall manager discovered what csx was doing,he immediately halted the work,demanding that the wooden forms be removed and that the mall side of the berm be restored to its original grade.csx agreed to halt construction of the spillway,but requested permission to install riprap in the cleared out channel.md mall granted consent in writing but insisted that csx provide a permanent solution to the runoff problem.when csx was not forthcoming with a permanent solution,md mall filed the present suit,invoking diversity jurisdiction in the district court.
procedural history 
md mall brought claims of negligence count i and continuing storm water trespass count ii against csx for failing to properly maintain csx property so as to prevent water on csx property from flowing over onto md mall property and causing damage app.at.although it initially sought compensatory and consequential damages,together with prejudgment interest and costs app.at,md mall later dropped its demand for damages and sought only injunctive relief that would require csx to remedy the runoff problem.
both parties moved for summary judgment.md mall had learned during discovery that,in march,csx had refurbished the relevant portion of the track,deploying approximately pieces of heavy equipment to replace railroad ties.based on that information,md mall argued in its motion for summary judgment that the substantial modifications to the tracks drainage system in led to the discharge of csx water onto the mall property and the noticeably deep property erosion by fall.supplemental app.at.for support,md mall cited the deposition testimony of its expert,frank browne,who identified the source of the water problem as csx alteration of the drainage system and the hydrological condition of the property.md mall also asserted that,for five years,csx had failed to clear out the ditch adjacent to the berm.
the fact that storm water had discharged from csx property onto md mall property was evidence,according to md mall,that csx had violated a federal regulation enacted pursuant to the federal railroad safety act the frsa or the act,which require s that csx manage and control the stormwater occurring on its property.supplemental app.at.that regulation provides that e ach drainage or other water carrying facility under or immediately adjacent to the roadbed shall be maintained and kept free of obstruction,to accommodate expected water flow for the area concerned.md mall argued that imposed on csx a duty to ensure that the earthen berm system that was designed to prevent water from flowing onto the mall property is properly maintained.supplemental app.at.given the erosion of the berm and the consequent flooding,md mall continued,csx is clearly not accommodating the expected water flow from its property,as required under section.supplemental app.at.as relief,md mall requested that csx be ordered to control and manage the water occurring on its property pursuant to a full engineering plan.supplemental app.at.
despite invoking,md mall asserted that its claims were not preempted by the frsa,even though that act expressly provides that a state may adopt or continue in force a law,regulation,or order related to railroad safety until the secretary of transportation with respect to railroad safety matters prescribes a regulation or issues an order covering the subject matter of the state requirement.a.in support of its position,md mall cited a amendment to that preemption provision,which serves as a c larification regarding state law causes of action.the clarification amendment or the amendment.the clarification amendment provides that n othing in the frsa shall be construed to preempt an action under state law seeking damages for personal injury,death,or property damage alleging that a party has failed to comply with the federal standard of care established by a regulation or order issued by the secretary of transportation.id.md mall argued that,under the amendment,its claims were not preempted.
the district court saw things differently.it granted csx for summary judgment,holding that md mall claims were blocked by the express preemption provision of the frsa.because md mall had asserted that csx was in violation of,the district court held that md mall had implicitly acknowledge d that the regulation is applicable to its claims app.at,and the court then determined that the claims were preempted 
the district court rejected md mall argument that its negligence and continuing storm water trespass claims were subject to the clarification amendment.while state law actions are permitted to proceed when they allege a failure to comply with a federal standard of care,the court held that the amendment is limited to cases seeking damages for personal injury,death,or property damage.app.at quoting b.because md mall appears to have disavowed any claim for damages and is instead seeking only equitable relief,the court determined that the amendment did not apply app.at.
md mall then filed this timely appeal.
waiver and judicial estoppel 
md mall has now discarded its previous position that sets the pertinent standard for measuring csx liability.it argues instead that the regulation does not even relate to,let alone cover,a railroad discharge of stormwater onto an adjoining property.md mall opening br.at.because md mall raises that argument for the first time on appeal,csx asserts that we should not consider it,as md mall either waived it or is judicially estopped from raising it now.we thus begin by addressing waiver and estoppel.
arguments that are asserted for the first time on appeal are deemed to be waived and consequently are not susceptible to review absent exceptional circumstances.birdman office of the governor,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,w hile waiver ordinarily bars raising new arguments for the first time on appeal,this rule is one of discretion rather than jurisdiction,and it may be relaxed whenever the public interest so warrants.barefoot architect,bunge,cir alteration,citations,and internal quotation marks omitted see also webb city of,cir waiver rule may be relaxed where the issue resolution is of public importance internal quotation marks omitted.csx acknowledges that this case is of public importance it argues that md mall claims,if allowed,could subject it and other railroads to similar claims by myriad other landowners with property near railroad tracks.conversely,if md mall claims are preempted,property owners may have no remedy for the discharge of storm water onto their land by a neighboring railroad.either way,md mall claims are of public importance,and we accordingly decline to apply the general rule of waiver in this case.
judicial estoppel 
csx also contends that md mall is judicially estopped from claiming that does not cover its claims.judicial estoppel is a doctrine that seeks to prevent a litigant from asserting a position inconsistent with one that it has previously asserted in the same or in a previous proceeding.macfarlan ivy hill snf,llc,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the doctrine exists to protect the integrity of the judicial process and to prohibit parties from deliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the moment.id.internal quotation marks omitted.that said,we have consistently stated that the doctrine should only be applied to avoid a miscarriage of justice.krystal cadillac oldsmobile gmc truck,motors,cir.
t hree factors inform a federal court decision whether to apply judicial estoppel there must be irreconcilably inconsistent positions adopted in bad faith and a showing that estoppel addresses the harm and no lesser sanction is sufficient.g i holdings,reliance ins,cir alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.however,judicial estoppel is generally not appropriate where the defending party did not convince the district court to accept its earlier position.id.csx insists that md mall did convince the court to accept its earlier position,because the court did accept the mall implicit acknowledg ment that the drainage regulation covers the subject of drainage in the areas implicated by this case.csx br.at quoting app.at.
as md mall correctly points out,however,the district court citation of md mall acknowledgment that covers its claims does not rise to the level of reliance necessary to trigger judicial estoppel.before determining that judicial estoppel bars relief,courts regularly inquire whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party earlier position,so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either the first or the second court was misled.new hampshire maine,d internal quotation marks omitted.because judicial estoppel generally prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,a bsent success in a prior proceeding,a party later inconsistent position introduces no risk of inconsistent court determinations and thus poses little threat to judicial integrity,id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
judicial estoppel thus does not apply here because md mall did not obtain a benefit from the arguments it made in the district court.the arguments it made did not prevail in any meaningful sense.the district court instead granted summary judgment to csx.in the decisions that csx cites to support its judicial estoppel argument,by contrast,judicial estoppel was found to bar relief because each estopped party had obtained an unfair litigation benefit as a result of its prior contradictory position.see new hampshire,at state barred from changing the location of a boundary to which it had agreed in a prior consent order approved by the court macfarlan,at plaintiff barred from seeking reinstatement to his former job when he had accepted disability benefits based on a purported inability to work krystal,at debtor estopped from asserting claim which he failed reveal to creditors so as to keep the recovery on the claim for himself.the doctrine of judicial estoppel should only be applied to avoid a miscarriage of justice.krystal,at.in this case,md mall did not benefit from its inconsistent position in the district court,and no miscarriage of justice would result from our entertaining the argument it now advances on appeal.thus,while we have no desire to encourage the kind of inconsistency manifested in md mall arguments,we decline to treat its new argument as judicially estopped.
express preemption under the frsa 
as already noted,the frsa provides that a state law,regulation,or order related to railroad safety shall be preempted by a regulation or order issued by the secretary of transportation with respect to railroad safety matters that cover s the subject matter of the state requirement.a.pursuant to the previously described clarification amendment to that express preemption provision,even though a federal regulation covers a state law related to railroad safety,a plaintiff may still bring claims seeking damages for personal injury,death,or property damage when the plaintiff alleg es that a party has failed to comply with the federal standard of care established by a regulation or order issued by the secretary of transportation.id.b a.

this case is different from zimmerman in that,on appeal,md mall has abandoned the argument that csx violated a federal standard of care and instead insists that the pertinent federal regulation,does not cover a storm water discharge dispute of the type before us now.md mall opening br.at.thus,md mall claims are only preserved from preemption if no federal regulation enacted pursuant to the frsa cover s the subject matter storm water runoff of the state requirement.a 
when interpreting the frsa preemption provisions,we apply a general presumption against preemption.bruesewitz,at.in areas of traditional state regulation,we assume that a federal statute has not supplanted state law unless congress has made such an intention clear and manifest.bates dow agrosciences,llc,d internal quotation marks omitted.the presumption is relevant even when there is an express clause.that is because when the text of a clause is susceptible of more than one plausible reading,courts ordinarily accept the reading that disfavors.thus,the presumption operates both to prevent and to limit preemption.franks inv.union pacific,cir quoting altria,good,d internal quotation marks omitted see also susquehanna ry.jackson,cir a federal law does not preempt state laws where the activity regulated by the state is merely a peripheral concern of the federal law alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.in the end,preemption applies only if it is the clear and manifest purpose of congress in enacting the law in question,csx,easterwood,d internal quotation marks omitted,because the purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone in every preemption case,wyeth levine,d internal quotation marks omitted.
beyond those general principles,the supreme court has determined that the frsa preemption provision displays considerable solicitude for state law.easterwood,at.for example,congress enacted the frsa to promote safety in every area of railroad operations and reduce accidents and incidents,and the secretary of transportation has authority to prescribe regulations and issue orders for every area of railroad safety,id.a,but the preemptive effect of the statute reaches only state laws covered by the statute implementing regulations.id.a.because the term cover is a restrictive term,preemption will not apply if the frsa regulation in question merely touch es upon or relate s to the subject matter of state law.easterwood,at internal quotation marks omitted.rather,will lie only if the federal regulations substantially subsume the subject matter of the relevant state law.id.
we accordingly held in strozyk norfolk southern,cir,that a regulation bare mention of limited visibility does not indicate an intent to regulate that condition,and that a suit against a railroad alleging a condition of poor visibility at a railroad crossing was not preempted.id.at.other courts have likewise concluded that a federal regulation dictating that v egetation on railroad property which is on or immediately adjacent to the roadbed shall be controlled so that it does not o bstruct visibility of railroad signs and signals,b,serves to preempt any claim regarding vegetative growth that blocks a sign immediately adjacent to a crossing,but it does not impose a broader duty under federal law to control vegetation so that it does not obstruct a motorist visibility of oncoming trains.shanklin norfolk ry,cir internal quotation marks omitted.thus a state law claim is not preempted if it alleges negligence in allowing vegetation to obscure safe lines of sight at a railroad crossing.see,peters union pac,d,vegetation in crossing and were not areas on or immediately adjacent to tracks and therefore claims that they obstructed sight lines were not preempted under the frsa murrell union pac,d,claims for failing to provide adequate visibility not preempted under the frsa anderson.cent.transp,d,claims of vegetation beyond the roadbed or immediately adjacent to it not preempted rushing kansas city ry,cir sound capacity safety regulation addresses only the capacity of the whistles and does not substantially subsume regulations on when whistles are sounded bradford union pac,d,failure to keep proper lookout and crew fatigue not preempted because regulations merely touched upon the subject and did not subsume them.
csx argues that,which by its terms requires that a railroad drainage facilities under or immediately adjacent to the track be maintained and kept free of obstruction,preempts pennsylvania law governing storm water runoff.as the railroad sees it,md mall claims must be dismissed because cover s the subject of drainage under and around the tracks and therefore preempts the mall claims,which concern precisely the same topic.csx br.at.although it has acknowledged that the limited purpose of is to keep water away from the tracks,that it supplemental app.at,csx has nevertheless taken the aggressive position that the railroad is thereby permitted to channel its rainwater onto a neighboring property.see,supplemental app.at the railroad can do whatever it needs to do to keep water away id.at section does say,you ca put it on your your neighbor land,it does say anything,it just says,keep it away from the tracks.
we reject that conclusion.first,to the extent csx is saying that,as long as a regulation involves the same general topic as a plaintiffs claim,such as water drainage,the regulation covers that claim,the argument is at odds with supreme court precedent.a regulation must do more than touch upon or relate to the subject matter of a state law claim it must substantially subsume it.easterwood,at.the railroad argument for preemption here has even less to recommend it than the argument in strozyk that a regulation requiring vegetation to be trimmed away from signs preempted a claim that overgrown vegetation created an unsafe crossing.stozyk,at.we can not read the silence of on a railroad duties to its neighbors when addressing track drainage as an express abrogation of state storm water trespass law.given that the frsa provides no express authorization for disposing of drainage onto an adjoining property,the presumption must be that state laws regulating such action survive,see easterwood,at noting that preemption is improper when the regulations provide no affirmative indication of their effect on negligence law emphasis added.
second,the type of harm sought to be avoided by is wholly different than the harm alleged by md mall.several courts interpreting the federal employers liability act fela,which protects railroad employees from railroad negligence have held that whether compliance with applicable frsa safety regulations precludes a finding that a railroad has been negligent depends in large part on whether the regulations in question directly address the type of harm that ultimately resulted.cowden bnsf ry,d,see also kansas city ry.nichols constr,d,t he types of dangers and precautions contemplated by a railroad safety regulation are determinative of whether or not a railroad compliance with regulations will shield it from liability.if the regulations do address the type of harm alleged,the compliance with those regulation s will preclude a finding of liability cowden,d at.on the other hand,if a plaintiff injuries come about in a way not contemplated by a safety regulation,then the railroad compliance with that regulation might not preclude its having failed to exercise a reasonable standard of care.nichols,d at.numerous courts have applied this general principle in finding that a given frsa regulation was or was not intended to prevent the harm the plaintiff suffered,and that the defendant railroad duty of care accordingly was or was not subsumed by the regulation.cowden,d at.compare lane sims,cir claim precluded by frsa regulations concerning speed limits,with tufariello long island,cir holding that a railroad employee could bring a negligence claim against his employer for hearing loss resulting from exposure to train horns because no frsa preclusion existed,as the frsa only prescribed minimum sound levels for warning devices on trains.
section is,by csx own admission,plainly intended to prevent water from pooling on or around railroad tracks and thus to avoid potentially dangerous conditions occasioned by standing water,such as the presence of debris on tracks,icing conditions,and compromised track integrity.there is no indication whatsoever that it was intended to address storm water discharge onto a neighboring property,which is the harm alleged by md mall again,csx pressed its understanding of at oral argument in the district court,saying that is a drainage regulation that essentially tells railroads to keep the water off the tracks because it dangerous to have water there,because it will deteriorate the track.supplemental app.at.csx represented that the intent of the drainage regulation is to keep water away from the tracks,that it.supplemental app.at.it is accordingly difficult to conclude that was intended to prevent the harm plaintiff suffered,storm water trespass,or that the defendant railroad duty of care with respect to state storm water trespass law was subsumed by the regulation.cowden,d at citations omitted.
finally,the position advocated by csx that because does not prohibit storm water discharge onto adjoining property it therefore permits it is troubling because,as the tenth circuit said in emerson kansas city southern railway,cir,it has no obvious limit,and,if adopted,could lead to absurd results.id.at.although emerson interpreted a question of preemption under the interstate commerce commission termination act the iccta,the tenth circuit observations about the limitless and absurd results occasioned by an expansive interpretation of an express preemption provision are pertinent here,especially in light of the frsa solicitude for state law.see easterwood,at noting that the frsa preemption provision displays considerable solicitude for state law.
the plaintiffs in emerson alleged that,when the defendant railroad replaced old,deteriorated rail ties,it regularly discarded the ties in a nearby drainage ditch.emerson,at.the ditch consequently became clogged,and the plaintiffs property flooded.id.the railroad argued that subjecting it to liability for discarding old rail ties would interfere with the iccta,which provides that remedies with respect to regulation of rail transportation are exclusive and preempt the remedies provided under federal or state law.b.the court rejected that argument,reasoning that i f the iccta preempts a claim stemming from improperly dumped railroad ties,it is not a stretch to say that the railroad could dispose of a dilapidated engine in the middle of main street a cheap way to be rid of an unwanted rail car.emerson,at.after all,the court continued,in this hypothetical the railroad is merely disposing of unneeded railroad equipment in a fashion.our holding rejecting the railroad demand for sweeping preemption interprets the iccta preemption clause such that this absurd result is avoided.id.
in line with that persuasive reasoning,we must take a sensible view of the frsa preemption provision,avoiding the carte blanche ruling the railroad seeks.longstanding state tort and property laws exist for a reason,and the frsa laudatory safety purpose should not be used as a cover to casually cast them aside.see easterwood,at noting that preemption is improper when the regulations provide no affirmative indication of their effect on negligence law.for if csx is free to negligently discharge its storm water onto its neighbor property,why should it not be allowed to do so intentionally it might simplify csx duties under if it could simply install drainage pipes that empty directly onto adjoining properties.judging by the testimony of csx road master,who stated that csx sole concern when conducting the track refurbishment was to ensure that storm water drained away from the track and that it was not concerned about storm water discharging onto the adjoining property,and given csx argument in the district court that allows a railroad to do whatever it needs to do to keep water away from the railroad track,including directing it onto a neighbor property supplemental app.at,and further given the attempt by the railroad in this case to build a spillway emptying directly into the mall storm drain,csx position is not far removed from that extreme.the constrained scope given to the frsa preemption provision by the supreme court in easterwood can not support such an understanding of 
accordingly,we hold that the frsa express preemption provision does not apply to md mall claims.
implied conflict preemption 
even though the frsa express preemption provision does not operate to extinguish md mall claims,the present lawsuit may be by implication because the principle it seek s to vindicate would conflict with federal law.freightliner myrick,d a court may find implied conflict where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal law,crosby foreign trade council,d,or where under the circumstances of a particular case,the challenged state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.id.alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.what is a sufficient obstacle is a matter of judgment,to be informed by examining the federal statute or regulation as a whole and identifying its purpose and intended effects id.the mere fact of tension between federal and state law is generally not enough to establish an obstacle supporting preemption,particularly when the state law involves the exercise of traditional police power.madeira affordable housing,cir.rather,t he principle is thoroughly established that the exercise by the state of its police power,which would be valid if not superseded by federal action,is superseded only where the repugnance or conflict is so direct and positive that the two acts can not be reconciled or consistently stand together.jones rath packing,d rehnquist,concurring in part and dissenting in part quoting kelly washington.internal quotation marks omitted.
conflict preemption thus embraces two distinct situations.in the easier but rarer case,compliance with both federal and state duties is simply impossible.see,southland keating,d state law requiring judicial determination of certain claims preempted by federal law requiring arbitration of those claims.in the second and more common situation,compliance with both laws is possible,yet state law poses an obstacle to the full achievement of federal purposes.
we can confidently conclude that this case is not of the former variety.as csx engineers suggested when studying the breakdown of the berm,the runoff problem is remediable,though at some cost to the company,and it is therefore not impossible for csx to comply both with pennsylvania storm water trespass law and.it would indeed be odd to conclude that dual compliance is not possible given that csx successfully did just that for a number of decades without difficulty.
we are less confident,however,in saying that pennsylvania law does not,under the circumstances of this particular case,stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.crosby,at internal quotation marks omitted.we do not know,because the district court made no findings of fact,whether and to what extent,if any,pennsylvania law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of railroad safety purpose.whether csx can employ reasonable means to comply with drainage requirements in this specific case while also complying with pennsylvania law regarding storm water trespass is a question of fact.see arizona united states,d scalia,concurring in part and dissenting in part arguing that i t is impossible to determine whether,under the circumstances of this particular case,the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress,without a factual record concerning the manner in which arizona is implementing state law james,federal preemption of state and local law legislation,regulation and litigation stating that conflict preemption analysis requires attention to the facts of each case.
it may be that,in the maintenance of the drainage facilities that are under and immediately adjacent to the portion of the track in question,csx is unable,through reasonable means,to prevent the flow of storm water onto md mall property.again,since the railroad managed for years to deal with its drainage without affecting the mall,one wonders how it can have become an unreasonable burden now,but we have virtually no factual record on the issue and so can not definitively address it.the district court is in a better position to make the necessary factual inquiry,and we will therefore remand for the developm
