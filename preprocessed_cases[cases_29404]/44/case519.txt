this appeal stems from linda gray suit in the district court charging genlyte group with liability under massachusetts law for sexual harassment.the jury returned a special verdict for genlyte,finding that gray had been subject to sexual harassment by a genlyte employee but not through conduct sufficiently severe or pervasive to warrant liability.gray now appeals,claiming errors in the instructions to the jury and in rulings on admissibility of evidence.
we begin with a brief synopsis of the evidence on both sides.in assessing claims,we normally only consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.rodowicz.mut.life ins,cir.however,for most other kinds of questions,admissibility,the appropriateness of jury instructions,plain or harmless error,evidence offered by either side or both may be pertinent.see id.
gray worked from to at genlyte lightolier plant in fall river,massachusetts.in her subsequent trial,she claimed that she was harassed in by jose hermenegildo,another genlyte employee,for a few weeks.in particular,hermenegildo allegedly stared at gray and made tongue gestures mimicking oral sex.gray did not report this conduct to genlyte.it ceased when her at the hermenegildo.
fourteen years later,in,the harassment resumed after her boyfriend moved to a different shift.according to gray,hermenegildo harassment included statements,do you like to kiss gestures grabbing his crotch,sexual tongue gestures and contact touching her hair one and shaking her while asking why she was avoiding him.gray testified that in other instances hermenegildo conduct appeared threatening.he watched her in the parking lot before and after work,approached her at work,stared at her,and once followed her and her children home in his car.
at trial,gray claimed that she had reported some or all of the harassment to her supervisor,joe pavao,and his supervisor,bill torrence,and nothing had been done.however,torrence said that she had told him only that hermenegildo was watching her and invited torrence to observe him on a specific occasion further,he said she later told him that she had taken care of the problem herself.
according to gray,hermenegildo misbehavior diminished in,but she began to fear him after learning in that year that he had beaten his wife.in,hermenegildo earlier alleged misconduct resumed and in august,gray reported it to her supervisor and also provided a laundry list of his conduct in and.
gray testified that following her detailed complaint in august,her supervisors took no significant action to investigate her claims or discipline hermenegildo.shortly after the meeting,gray suffered a severe panic attack and was treated for continuing emotional distress.she did not return to work for the rest of but retained a lawyer who wrote to the company.the company took no action.gray then filed a charge with the massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad.laws ch.
when gray returned to work in january,she said that hermenegildo howled at her and followed her in the parking lot.in august,gray and other workers testified about hermenegildo misbehavior at a workers compensation proceeding brought by gray.in september,hermenegildo allegedly made an offensive tongue gesture at gray and threatening gestures against another employee ray tisdale who testified at the august hearing.
gray testified that due to emotional distress,she had been unable to work at the plant or elsewhere from september onward.in march,she filed a criminal charge against hermenegildo based on his september tongue gesture and,in april,he was convicted of a misdemeanor for,with offensive and disorderly acts or language,accost ing or annoy ing gray at her workplace.ch.in october,she brought this diversity action against genlyte charging it with violation of ch,which inter alia forbids an employer from tolerating sexual harassment in the workplace.
genlyte evidence at the subsequent trial did not directly refute gray claims as to individual company did not call hermenegildo to it did raise doubts about gray claims on several fronts.on cross examination,gray acknowledged that she had not reported the incidents to the company that year and she gave conflicting accounts of whether she had ever reported some of the most serious subsequent conduct,hermenegildo grabbing his crotch and making lewd remarks.and torrence testified that gray complaint was far more limited in scope than she had claimed.
genlyte also adduced testimony from gray own treating social worker and a psychiatrist who testified as an expert for gray.based on their testimony,genlyte asserted that gray had suffered from emotional,psychological and social difficulties from her childhood onward,that she had personality disorders,and that her reactions to her treatment by hermenegildo were more extreme than they would otherwise have been.
finally,genlyte argued that most of gray charges against hermenegildo were uncorroborated by evidence from others at the plant.based on its own witness testimony,the company said that its supervisors had made reasonable and good faith efforts to investigate such complaints as gray had made to it,handicapped though they were by her delays and omissions.on this basis,it argued that even if the harassment alleged had all occurred,the company lacked sufficient notice to make it liable.
for its deliberations,the jury was given a verdict form with six special questions,of which only the first three were eventually answered.the first three read as follows 
was plaintiff,linda gray,subjected to sexual harassment,verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature 
was that conduct offensive unwelcome to plaintiff 
was that conduct sufficiently severe pervasive so as to alter the conditions of plaintiff employment by creating a work environment that a reasonable person would find intimidating,hostile,humiliating or sexually offensive 
after seven hours of deliberation,the jury submitted the following question 
we not going to reach a verdict tonight,as we are hung up on question.i would not characterize us as deadlocked,but we do need some more time to deliberate.the wording of question has us a bit concerned.sufficiently severe is fairly nebulous,and we are wondering if we could have some clarification.thank you very much.
both sides then submitted suggestions for supplemental jury instructions and the district court met with counsel to discuss them.
after hearing objections by gray counsel who had proposed numerous supplemental instructions,the district court delivered a single supplemental instruction,telling the jury that as to question it should consider the totality of the circumstances over the period in question including the frequency,severity,offensiveness of the conduct,whether it was physically threatening,whether it would reasonably interfere with a reasonable woman job performance,and whether it would undermine her ability to succeed at her job.
after further deliberation,the jury returned a verdict in genlyte favor.it answered yes to questions and but no to question.based on the verdict form,a no answer to question ended the case in defendant favor and spared the jury from having to consider the company knowledge of the harassment,the adequacy of steps taken to prevent it and the amount of damages to be awarded.this appeal followed.
on appeal,five of the eight claims of error advanced by gray concern the failure to give instructions or errors in the instructions that were given.such claims are reviewed de novo,failure to give an instruction or under an abuse of discretion standard,court choice of language.wilson maritime overseas,cir.however,casting a shadow over gray claims is genlyte contention that none of the objections to the instructions was adequately preserved,so they are reviewable only for plain error.we agree with genlyte.
insofar as the initial instructions are concerned,none of the errors or omissions now objected to was specifically identified by gray counsel after the instructions and before the jury first retired,even though the district judge warned that specific objections would be necessary to preserve the objections the only debatable case is discussed below.as for the requested supplemental instructions,the district court after giving its supplemental instruction asked for objections.gray counsel responded,just simply the ones i have already stated,your honor.this is not enough.
the governing rule provides that a party can not assign as error the giving of or failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict,stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.emphasis added.objection means to the instruction as given thus,even if the initial request is made in detail,the party who seeks but did not get the instruction must object again after the instructions are given but before the jury retires for deliberations.smith.inst.of,cir.further,it is not enough for counsel in renewing an objection merely to refer back generically to objections made before the charge 
this may seem harsh,but it accords with the language of rule,which requires that the objection state distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection,and we are in any event bound by a long line of precedents.see note,above.further,in many instances,the judge will not know just what it is in the instructions as given that has not satisfied counsel.it is easier to have a flat rule than try to decide case by case when the judge should have been warned more distinctly as to the concern,although there will always remain some cases posing hard questions.see wilson,at.
despite the unqualified language of rule,this court has allowed appellate review for plain error despite the lack of a proper objection,but plain error is confined to the exceptional case.toscano chandris,cir internal quotations omitted.we have followed the supreme court general formulation,first used in criminal cases,requiring the party claiming plain error to demonstrate that there was error,that it was plain,that it likely altered the outcome,and that it was sufficiently fundamental to threaten the fairness or integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceeding.united states olano,d.
of the five omitted instructions,only two come close to being error and neither is plain error.the most difficult one concerns the relationship between sexual harassment and intimidation.in a nutshell,gray argues that the district court effectively told the jury that it could not consider conduct but only conduct that was either explicitly sexual or had sexual overtones and that this altered the outcome of the case by excluding merely threatening conduct,following gray home.
section,like title vii,see,prohibits discrimination based on sex regardless of whether it is manifested by conduct that is sexual in character or is wholly but is motivated by gender.see,brockton mcad,denial of accrued sick leave benefits for disabilities thurber jack reilly,aff,cert.denied,d failure to promote employee because of her sex.thus gray could have charged genlyte,among other faults,with tolerating intimidation motivated by gender.but that is not what happened.
the massachusetts statute,unlike the federal statute,provides explicitly that d iscrimination on the basis of sex shall include,but not be limited to,sexual harassment and in the same provision states that the term sexual harassment shall mean 
sexual advances,requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when a submission to or rejection of such advances,requests or conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment or as a basis for employment decisions b such advances,requests or conduct have the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual work performance by creating an intimidating,hostile,humiliating or sexually offensive work environment.
gray complaint did cite section discrimination provision at the outset but the rest of the complaint phrased the claim,and did so repeatedly,in terms of sexual harassment.in other words,gray narrowed her claim to sexual harassment as defined by massachusetts law.the massachusetts definition addresses itself to sexual advances and requests and to verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.accordingly there is a basis for instructing the jury that,in cases where the charge is sexual harassment,all of the conduct used to prove sexual harassment must have some connection to sex.
still,acts of intimidation could comprise part of a pattern of sexual harassment,even though standing alone such acts might have no sexual connotation.consider a male employee who made a series of explicit sexual advances to a female and then,when rebuffed,lurked outside the victim home.massachusetts precedent appears to support this view,see dahms cognex,wl.rptr.conduct which is not specifically sexual in nature may nevertheless be evidence of hostile work environment sexual harassment.
in its original instructions to the jury,the district court came close to tracking the then went a bit beyond in gray favor 
sexual harassment is any conduct of a sexual nature,and it is actionable if it sufficiently pervasive in the place where it takes place or in the context of wherever it does take place.it can consist of sexual remarks,of ridicule,of intimidation,but it has to have sexual overtones.
in explaining just how severe the harassment had to be in order to create a hostile work environment,the district court used somewhat similar language,d ecide whether the totality of hermenegildo conduct was so severe,so pervasive that a reasonable woman would find the work environment to be hostile,humiliating,or intimidating as a result of that conduct.
in this case,some of hermenegildo conduct was overtly sexual remarks,the tongue gestures,crotch grabbing while other acts in our view were implicitly so in the context of the explicit conduct staring at gray,waiting for her in the parking lot,appearing at her work station,following her home.the jury may well have taken the district court reference to intimidation having sexual overtones to encompass this latter conduct but perhaps it thought that conduct could count only if in isolation it had sexual overtones.no one can be sure.
as to the proper reading of massachusetts law,our own view is that the sjc would construe the statute in accordance with dahms so we think that in the future the jury should be told where pertinent that acts of intimidation may be part of sexual harassment based on context alone.still,it is impossible to describe the district court own overtones charge as plain error since it tracks or is more favorable than the statute taken literally and there is little direct massachusetts precedent.and,since the jury may well have understood the instruction given to encompass all of hermenegildo reprehensible conduct,it is even harder to say that the ambiguity likely altered the result.olano,at.
gray brief makes four other objections to the instructions which are also respectable but in our view less powerful.we start with the one on which gray places greatest stress.gray says that she asked that the supplemental instruction tell the jury to consider the plight of a reasonable woman in gray position,that the district court failed to include the quoted language,and that consequently the supplemental instruction misled the jury into believing that it should consider the experience of women at the plant as a whole rather than gray own experience.
the problem arises primarily because the supplemental instruction which we reprint in full in an attachment told the jury inter alia that the severity issue boils down to this 
would the mythical reasonable woman that we talked about yesterday,that i described to you yesterday,neither overly sensitive nor overly hardened,would that mythical reasonable woman find the work environment at lightolier,as it has been described to you in the course of the trial,hostile,humiliating,or intimidating as a result of the sexual harassment that you found had occurred emphasis added.
this,coupled with the absence of language focusing the jury on gray own experience,taken in have misled the jury into thinking that the severity issue turned on the experience of the average woman in the plant.in fact,there was a limited amount of evidence at trial about the experience of other women.
nevertheless,we think it highly unlikely that,in the context of the trial as a whole,the jury misunderstood.first,the great bulk of harassment evidence at trial concerned harassment of gray.second,in a instruction on the third day of trial,the district court told the jury that the key question as to severity was whether the harassment was hostile or intimidating or humiliating to an objectively reasonable person in the plaintiff position the very words gray says were required.third,the closing arguments of opposing counsel both focused on the harassment of the experience of other women.finally,the three special questions answered by the jury,reprinted above,focused directly on the harassment to which linda gray had been subject 
in sum,the supplemental instruction might well be error if taken alone but in the context of the trial it is doubtful that the jury was misled.in all events,we are confident that the instruction in context does not meet a critical requirement for plain error,namely,that its correction would likely have altered the result.we add that the very ease with which any confusion could have been resolved,and the certainty that the district court failed to appreciate the inference created by the abstract wording of the instruction,underscores the need for counsel to make a distinct objection after the instructions.
next,gray argues that massachusetts case law makes clear that sexual harassment can be based not only on the impact of individual acts taken separately but also on the cumulative effect of such acts over a period of time,cuddyer stop shop supermarket.in both the original charge and the supplemental charge,the district court asked the jury to consider the totality of the circumstances over the period of time in question including its frequency,severity and offensiveness.
we will assume that totality might in some situations have a different and less favorable nuance for a plaintiff than cumulative,although this might be debated and vary from case to case.but while gray did request the word accumulated in her original instruction request and cumulative in her supplemental request,in neither case did she specifically call the court attention to the discrepancy after the charge,which is a perfect illustration of why rule demands specificity.if there was error,it was neither plain nor prejudicial under olano.
next,when the jury returned after its initial deliberation and asked the court to give it further guidance,gray counsel asked for an instruction telling the jury that c onduct is sufficiently severe and pervasive if it met any one of the following rubrics there then followed a list of eight characterizations,each with one exception matched by a citation to a massachusetts case or mcad ruling.two examples suffice if it would alter a reasonable woman work environment and if it went beyond the boundaries of typical workplace horseplay.
the district court declined to give this instruction.instead,the trial judge told the jury to consider whether the reasonable woman would find the work environment hostile,intimidating or humiliating,as a result of the sexual harassment conduct that had occurred and the court then continued,mentioning two of the eight factors that gray supplemental instructions had mentioned and describing them as matters to consider rather than as independent bases for liability 
now,in making that judgment,consider the totality of the circumstances over the period of time in question,that is,and,including the frequency of the conduct,its severity offensiveness,whether it is physically threatening,whether it would unreasonably interfere with a reasonable woman job performance or whether it would undermine her ability to succeed at her job.
the district court in explaining its refusal to give the supplemental instruction in the form sought by gray said that the list of slightly different formulations would be more confusing than helpful and on appeal genlyte accuses gray of nit picking in pursuing its objection.we do not agree that gray request is a minor quibble instead,we think the requested instruction was flatly wrong and would reject this claim of error even if it had been properly preserved by a specific objection,which it was not.
the idea of extracting from cases or mcad decisions a string of individual sentences and elevating them to independent bases for liability has an obvious potential for mischief.certainly,the full complement of conduct alleged in this case obviously would alter a reasonable woman work environment or so a jury might find but that would be true also of much milder misconduct that would not be sufficiently severe and pervasive.similarly,misconduct could go beyond the boundaries of typical workplace horseplay but not amount to sexual harassment.
the real vice of the requested instruction is that it takes out of the context of surrounding facts and legal discussion phrases that were almost certainly not intended as tests of liability.admittedly,a couple of the other examples in gray laundry list come closer to stating defensible tests,but the district court was not required to pare down a laundry list to the least objectionable quotations.see febres challenger caribbean,cir.and,of course,even if the list were pristine,the district judge would have been under no obligation to use those particular words.united states destefano,cir.
finally,so far as instructions are concerned,gray complains that the district court failed to correct a misstatement of law by genlyte counsel made in closing argument.genlyte counsel said the following in the course of closing argument 
t he biggest hurdle she got to get over is convincing you that a reasonable woman working out in that lightolier plant at the time would have felt that the conduct that she told us about was sufficiently severe and pervasive as to create a sexual hostile working environment.
obviously,the phrase that she told us about us meaning genlyte was inaccurate.if genlyte had not known and had no reason to know that one employee was harassing another,it would not be responsible,div.of interco,mcad,meritor savings bank vinson,d however,at trial gray was not limited to proving only episodes about which she had specifically complained to her employer of course,genlyte was entitled to argue,as it did,that the failure to report episodes cast doubt on gray credibility,but the quoted statement of defense counsel went too far,as genlyte brief more or less concedes.
the problem is that gray counsel did not complain about the statement after the closing arguments or in connection with the initial instructions.instead,after the instructions were given,gray counsel listed various specific objections and then ended by saying there was a misstatement of the law by the opposing counsel.the district judge said that she thought she had been and then went on to another topic.gray counsel could have but failed to identify the misstatement,and the district judge probably never knew what counsel was complaining about.
when the jury came back requesting further instructions on the severity issue,gray counsel for the first time did ask the court to instruct the jury that it should consider not only the actions for which gray had made a timely and adequate complaint but all actions she suffered.before the supplemental instruction was given,gray counsel sought to elaborate on this point,but the colloquy bogged down in a misunderstanding as to whether gray was complaining about what genlyte counsel had said or claiming that the affirmative instructions by the court were mistaken.in any event,the judge gave no further instruction on this issue and,as already noted,gray counsel failed to object after the supplemental instruction with the precision needed to preserve the point.
the question remains whether the failure to correct the misstatement of genlyte counsel was plain error.the difficulty for gray is that the district court own instructions,including its reference to totality of the circumstances,left the jury free to consider ep
