factual background 
mildred and elizabeth are citizens and residents of states within the continental united states.they are the surviving daughters of josé martínez,who died while undergoing treatment at hospital san cristóbal the hospital,a facility owned and operated by quality health services of puerto rico.
the events leading up to martínez demise are largely but not entirely uncontroversial.on november,martínez repaired to the hospital complaining that he had been vomiting blood.an emergency room physician examined him and ordered laboratory tests,an electrocardiogram,intravenous medications and fluids,and a blood transfusion.the doctor formed a preliminary diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding and ordered martínez admitted as a patient of his primary care physician,orlando torres.the admission order envisioned a consultation by nelson medina,a gastroenterologist.
at around the following morning,torres visited the hospital to examine his patient.although martínez seemed,he was alert and oriented.torres instructed the hospital staff once more to contact medina about the desired consultation.he also ordered a complete blood count,to be done after a second blood transfusion.finally,he directed the staff to notify him immediately when the results of the laboratory tests were available.
those results arrived at the hospital the same day around.they indicated a variety of abnormalities.the nurses notes reflect several unsuccessful attempts to relay these results to torres.although there is conflicting evidence on the point,we take as true torres avowal that the results were not conveyed to him during martínez lifetime.
as the hours went by,the patient condition deteriorated.by nightfall,torres still had not received any information about the laboratory tests.with martínez condition worsening,the nursing staff called the case to the attention of a resident physician.by then,the patient was in cardiorespiratory arrest.emergency resuscitation proved unsuccessful and martínez died shortly thereafter.
ii.travel of the case 
in due season,the plaintiffs brought suit for martínez wrongful death in puerto rico federal district court.their second amended complaint for present purposes,the operative pleading charged negligence on the part of medina who had never examined the patient,torres,and the hospital.this appeal is from a judgment entered in favor of the hospital.
during the course of pretrial jousting,the plaintiffs dropped their claims against medina.prior to the start of trial,the district court excluded two clusters of expert testimony,one proffered by the plaintiffs and the other by the hospital.we focus on the exclusion of testimony proffered by the plaintiffs.
the facts are as follows all dates are in unless otherwise indicated.the district court entered a order the cmo on march.the cmo set the initial scheduling conference for may and decreed that,on or before that date,the plaintiffs must identify any expert witnesses whom they planned to call at the trial and deliver their reports to the defense.each such report was to include,among other things,a complete statement of all opinions to be expressed by the expert and the basis for those opinions.the cmo warned that i f the report of the expert is not as described herein,the expert testimony will not be permitted on direct examination.
the district court convened the initial scheduling conference on may.a continuation of the scheduling conference took place on july.by then,the plaintiffs had designated benito colón as an expert witness and had furnished his report as required by the cmo.the report attributed most of the blame for martínez death to torres.it did,however,ascribe negligence to the hospital for granting torres admitting privileges.
the lower court issued a supplementary order on july that order listed colón report as part of the plaintiffs authorized documentary evidence.in the same order,the court warned that no other expert reports would be allowed,except upon written motion and for good cause shown.
at about this time,the plaintiffs reached a settlement with torres.that development left the hospital,for all practical purposes,as the sole remaining defendant the hospital took colón deposition on august.the doctor deviated dramatically from his report and testified extensively about negligent acts and omissions by hospital employees.that line of reasoning was conspicuously absent from his original report.
a few weeks later,the plaintiffs submitted what they euphemistically called a final addendum to colón report.the addendum altered the theory of liability against the hospital from negligence in accrediting torres who had by this time settled with the plaintiffs to negligence in its handling of martínez care.
the hospital did not take kindly to colón tergiversation.it asked the district court to preclude colón from testifying,arguing that this effectively introduced a new line of expert opinion into the case and,thus,transgressed the terms of the cmo.in the alternative,the hospital argued that the newly proffered testimony should be excluded because it failed to meet minimally acceptable standards of reliability.see daubert merrell dow,d.
although the plaintiffs objected strenuously,the district court granted the hospital motion to preclude.somewhat cryptically,the court stated that colón testimony was deemed inadmissible as this expert has lost all credibility before the court.
the plaintiffs proceeded to trial without their expert witness.they premised liability mainly on allegations that hospital personnel had failed to i contact medina as ordered by both the emergency room physician and torres and ii notify torres in a timely fashion of the abnormal results.both medina and torres testified as fact witnesses about the failures of communication.the latter also testified about martínez condition.
at the close of the plaintiffs case in chief,the hospital moved for judgment as a matter of law.the district court granted the motion.see martínez serrano quality health servs.of,slip op.at,unpublished.this timely appeal ensued.
iii.analysis 
on appeal,the plaintiffs maintain that the district court i abused its discretion in precluding colón expert testimony and ii erred in taking the case from the jury.we address these points separately.
expert testimony.
before considering the plaintiffs preclusion claim,we must deal with a procedural argument the hospital asserts that this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain this preclusion claim because the plaintiffs failed to designate the exclusionary order in their notice of appeal.this assertion lacks merit.
to be sure,a notice of appeal ordinarily must designate the orders or judgments to which the appeal is directed.see fed.c b.but this principle is not ironclad.one recognized exception concerns notices of appeal that designate the final judgment in a case as the appeal object.the case law is consentient that such a notice of appeal is deemed to encompass not only the final judgment but also all interlocutory orders that merge into it.see john,addison,cir.that is the situation here the preclusionary order challenged by the plaintiffs is of the type and kind that merges into the final judgment.see,united states ex rel.zembowski derobertis,cir see also wright,miller,cooper struve,federal practice procedure,at ed collecting cases.consequently,we have jurisdiction to resolve this assignment of error.
this brings us to the substance of the plaintiffs claim.it is a bedrock principle that federal trial courts possess authority to manage the conduct of litigation and,as a necessary corollary of that authority,to sanction litigants who fail to comply with deadlines.see tower ventures,city of westfield,cir.and when a failure of compliance occurs,the court may choose from a broad universe of possible sanctions.id.at.
the civil rules contain a number of provisions that are designed to assist trial courts in handling the peculiar subset of discovery problems associated with the selection,disclosure,and use of expert witnesses.see.b,a see also id.b b.this framework permits district courts,among other things,to set temporal deadlines for the identification of experts and the disclosure of their opinions.see.a c boston gas century indem,cir.
where,as here,a party aspires to present expert testimony but does not adhere to the district court temporal benchmarks,the court has a range of options.one of those options is if the court deems that option appropriate,we review its determination solely for abuse of discretion.macaulay anas,cir.
this standard of review obtains both as to the finding that a discovery violation occurred and as to the appropriateness of the sanction selected.see thibeault square d,cir.in the last analysis,then,a party striving to overturn a trial court exercise of discretion with respect to such matters faces a steep,uphill climb.see gagnon teledyne princeton,cir macaulay,at.
so it is here.the record reveals with conspicuous clarity that the plaintiffs attempted to reformulate their theory of liability and,thus,dramatically shift the focus of their expert opinion testimony once they settled with torres.that reformulation transpired after the time for filing expert reports had passed.the new allegations of negligence were not based on freshly discovered evidence,and the plaintiffs have not advanced any plausible justification for the belated emergence of these allegations.the shift amounted to the propagation of a theory,not merely a refinement of an existing theory.the prejudice to the hospital was palpable.given those circumstances,we think that preclusion was well within the ambit of the district court discretion see,macaulay,at.
in an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning,the plaintiffs seize upon the district court statement that the author of the precluded testimony had lost all credibility in the eyes of the court.building on this foundation,they suggest that this statement reveals a violation of the abecedarian tenet that a judge presiding over a jury trial does not have the right to exclude testimony merely because he finds it unpersuasive.see,blake pellegrino,cir.that tenet has no bearing here.
admittedly,the district court rationale for preclusion was not crisply expressed.but a reviewing court sometimes may be able to infer the district court reasoning from the record as a whole,cir.the more obvious the reasons for a choice,the less that needs to be explained.see united states,cir.
in this instance,the hospital presented two grounds for preclusion untimeliness and failure to cross the daubert threshold.of these two grounds,untimeliness was the more obvious and the more cogent ground.after all,the plaintiffs had flouted a clearly expressed discovery deadline without any apparent justification and under circumstances redolent of strategic behavior.
even though the district court statement is ambiguous,we think it is highly unlikely that the court bypassed this solid ground sub silentio and went out of its way to base its ruling on a ground not presented.viewing the court order in the full context of the arguments contemporaneously made and the record as a whole,we are confident that the court based its preclusionary order on the discovery violation.
this rationale is especially compelling because what the court said fits neatly with it.colón never attempted to explain his change in direction.given the convenient timing of that change,however,the district court may well have intended the quoted language as a rejection of what it regarded as an effort by the doctor to shape his testimony to fit the plaintiffs new priorities.
that ends this aspect of the matter.we hold,without serious question,that the order of preclusion constituted a fitting sanction for the discovery violation.consequently,there was no abuse of the trial court considerable discretion.
judgment as a matter of law.
a trial court confronted with a motion for judgment as a matter of law must scrutinize the evidence and the inferences reasonably extractable therefrom in the light most hospitable to the nonmovant wagenmann adams,cir.
in conducting that perscrutation,the court must refrain from differential factfinding that is,the court must not pass upon the credibility of the witnesses,resolve evidentiary conflicts,or engage in a comparative weighing of the proof.id.a motion for judgment as a matter of law may be granted only if the evidence,viewed from this perspective,adumbrates a result as to which reasonable minds could not differ.veranda beach club.sur,cir hubbard faros fisheries,cir.
when an appellant seeks to set aside a judgment entered following the allowance of such a motion,the court of appeals is constrained in precisely the same fashion as the district court.because the central question on appeal revolves around the sufficiency of the evidence,appellate review is plenary.salve regina coll.russell,d,teresa marie,ii,cir.
it is important to recall that this is a diversity action.thus,the substantive law of the forum state controls.see erie tompkins.for this purpose,puerto rico is treated as the functional equivalent of a state.see,mun y of san juan,cir.
the rule of decision that applies here is puerto rico law provides in pertinent part that a person who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.laws ann.tit.within this rubric,three elements coalesce to make up a prima facie case for medical malpractice a species of professional negligence.specifically,a plaintiff must establish the duty owed,the occurrence of an act or omission constituting a breach of that duty,and a sufficient causal nexus between the breach and some resultant harm.see lama borras,cir,at.
puerto rico holds providers to a standard of care.see oliveros abreu,offic.trans.accordingly,a provider has a duty to use the same degree of expertise as could reasonably be expected of a typically competent practitioner in the identical specialty under the same or similar circumstances,regardless of regional variations in professional acumen or level of care,at.a plaintiff bent on establishing a breach of this duty of care ordinarily must adduce expert testimony not only to delineate the minimally acceptable standard but also to show a failure to meet that standard.id.at.
against this backdrop,we turn to the particulars of the case at hand.with colón testimony barred,the plaintiffs were unable to present any expert opinion sufficient to establish either the hospital duty of care or a breach of the duty owed.
in an effort to trivialize this shortcoming,the plaintiffs draw a distinction between doctors and hospitals with respect to the duty owed in medical malpractice cases they posit that the puerto rico supreme court decision in oliveros established a duty of care that applies only to malpractice claims against physicians and that,as to hospitals,the duty owed is that of a reasonably prudent person the standard that typically applies in negligence cases outside the realm of medical malpractice.the evidence presented at trial,they assert,was sufficient,even without expert opinion testimony,to show a breach of the latter duty.
that distinction limned by the plaintiffs is of dubious validity.see,united states,cir defining the duty owed under puerto rico law in a malpractice case against a hospital in terms of the minimum standard of professional knowledge and skill required in the relevant circumstances marcano rivera turabo med.ctr,cir same,at same.in the end,however,we need not decide whether there is any legitimacy to the claim of differing duties.assuming for argument sake that the duty owed by a hospital is as the plaintiffs say and that the evidence of breach sufficed to reach the jury,the plaintiffs appeal nevertheless fails.we explain briefly.
as we have said,causation is an essential element of a claim for medical malpractice under puerto rico law.it was t
