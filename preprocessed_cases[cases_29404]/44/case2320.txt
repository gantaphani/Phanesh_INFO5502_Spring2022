thomas dolan,appeals from the dismissal of tort claims against the united states and bivens and common law conspiracy claims against individual defendants,guy blackwell,randall kizer,and bruce poston.the district court filed a memorandum opinion which may be found at wl.after careful review,we affirm.
the case involves several procedural and jurisdictional issues.
background 
as stated by the district court,the factual and procedural background of the case is as follows 
plaintiff is an engineer who held a faculty position with the university of tennessee center for industrial services.during the course of his employment there,plaintiff began working with frank prasil,an inventor who had developed a process for the recycling of ink.with plaintiff assistance,prasil applied for and received a research and development grant from the department of energy.
as one of the requirements for the grant,prasil needed to obtain matching funds from an independent source.he approached the east tennessee banking corporation etb and received a commitment for the necessary funding.prasil and plaintiff informed the tennessee department of environment and conservation,which was partnered with the department of energy in the grant program,of etb funding commitment.a short time later,however,etb notified plaintiff that it was withdrawing its financial support.
apparently,prasil was able to obtain the needed funding from another source.in the meantime,etb allegedly formed environmental ink,a company devoted to the development of processes that are similar to those invented by prasil.when prasil and plaintiff learned of environmental ink,they attempted to force the company to cease and desist from exploiting prasil research.
bruce poston,the president of both etb and environmental ink,sent a page letter to the department of energy asking for a formal investigation into the grant given to prasil.the letter outlined alleged irregularities in the grant application and questioned the use of grant funds.poston supposedly implicated plaintiff as the author of the most misleading information in the grant application.copies of the letter were sent to plaintiff employer and to the tennessee department of environment and conservation.plaintiff left his position at the university of tennessee and prasil grant was withdrawn.
the department of justice conducted an investigation to determine whether there was any truth in poston allegations.in august,plaintiff and prasil were charged with making false statements to the department of energy and mail fraud.united states thomas dolan.varlan.the case was delayed until,due to health problems of plaintiff,prasil.in early may,the united states began preparation for trial.it was discovered that the evidence establishing the mailing and venue for the false statements could not be found by state officials.without the evidence,the united states was unable to prove the allegations in the indictment beyond a reasonable doubt,and the charges against plaintiff were dropped.
on may,plaintiff,through counsel,initiated an action pursuant to in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee against the united states of america guy blackwell,the federal prosecutor who brought the charges against the petitioner randall kizer,a special investigator for the department of justice and bruce poston,the president of etb and environmental ink.the complaint alleged seven claims for relief 
blackwell suppressed exculpatory evidence in violation of the plaintiff right to due process 
blackwell denied the plaintiff due process when he knowingly fabricated evidence 
kizer denied the plaintiff due process when he knowingly fabricated evidence 
blackwell,kizer and poston formed an agreement to fabricate evidence against the plaintiff in an effort to deny him due process 
kizer violated the plaintiff fourth amendment right to be free from unlawful seizure when he maliciously fabricated evidence which was used as a basis for establishing probable cause to bring criminal charges 
blackwell violated the plaintiff fourth amendment right to be free from unlawful seizure when he maliciously fabricated evidence which was used for establishing probable cause to bring criminal charges and 
the defendants knowingly conspired to violate the plaintiff sixth amendment right to a fair trial by suppressing favorable and requested evidence from the plaintiff.
defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action in the middle district.judge trauger granted the motion on february,finding that because the alleged misconduct occurred in the eastern district of tennessee,the middle district was not the proper venue for resolution of plaintiff claims.
the present civil suit was filed by plaintiff on june,and it replicates the previous civil suit filed against the defendants in the middle district.
the defendants,united states of america,guy blackwell,and randall kizer,moved pursuant to rules and of the federal rules of civil procedure for an order dismissing plaintiff claims against the united states and the claims against blackwell and kizer or,in the alternative,for summary judgment in defendants favor on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction,failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,failure to meet traditional pleading standards,statute of limitations,failure to personally serve the individual defendants,absolute immunity,qualified immunity,and substitution of the united states for any common law claims.
a time line will be of assistance in understanding the issues.

this timely appeal followed.
the district court dismissed the claims against the united states for lack of jurisdiction,because plaintiff had not complied with the federal tort claims act.a.it dismissed the claims because such claims must be based on state action.it dismissed the claim on the basis of sovereign immunity and because plaintiff made no allegation that the alleged conspiracy was motivated by a animus.it dismissed the common law claims against the individual federal defendants because of the certifications that these defendants were acting in the course of their employment with regard to all allegations of the complaint.under the westfall act,the united states was substituted as a defendant instead of these individuals.finally,it dismissed the bivens claims against the individual federal defendants because the statute of limitations had run.plaintiff challenges only the final two rulings in his brief herein,and only they need to be discussed.
ii.analysis
