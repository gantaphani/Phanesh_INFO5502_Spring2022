for over half a century,this court has been the final interpreter of virgin islands law.in that role,we have made an incalculable number of rulings and have issued hundreds of decisions.but our role changed in with the founding of the supreme court of the virgin islands.we must now decide whether and when that nascent supreme court may reject our pre interpretations of virgin islands law 
lenroy phillip and timothy defoe worked together at an oil refinery in the united states virgin islands.on october,phillip was driving a vehicle near the refinery when it struck defoe.phillip received a citation from their employer for inattentive driving.
while recovering from his injuries,defoe filed a claim and received benefits under the virgin islands workers compensation act,et.he also sued phillip for negligence in the superior court of the virgin islands.the superior court granted summary judgment for phillip.it relied on our decision in tavarez klingensmith,cir,in which we held that the workers compensation act prevents injured employees from suing their coworkers.id.at citing.the superior court therefore rejected defoe negligence claim.
defoe appealed to the supreme court of the virgin islands.the supreme court reversed,concluding that the act immunity provision does not prevent suits against coworkers.defoe phillip,wl,at,per curiam.before reaching that conclusion,the supreme court declared that it was no longer bound by this court pre decisions on virgin islands law even while acknowledging that the superior court remains bound by those decisions until the supreme court says otherwise.id.at see also people murell,wl,at may,stating that the supreme court need not follow two of our precedents on questions of local law.the supreme court then rejected our holding in tavarez and remanded to the superior court to determine whether phillip actually was negligent.
phillip turned to us.we granted phillip certiorari petition to decide w hether the supreme court of the virgin islands has the authority,under,to disregard precedent set by the third circuit court of appeals during a time when the third circuit court of appeals was the only source of binding authority construing territorial law.see order granting pet.writ cert.at,defoe phillip,cir.may,citing pet.writ cert.at.we also directed the parties to address whether this court has jurisdiction over the petition pursuant to.id.before resolving these questions,a review of the virgin islands court system is in order.
congress laid the groundwork for the current virgin islands court system nearly sixty years ago.see generally revised organic act of,et.the revised organic act enabled the virgin islands legislature to create its own court system,including trial courts and an appellate court.id.b.
in addition,the act established the district court of the virgin islands an article iv court and gave it original jurisdiction over local claims.id.a,b.it also gave the district court concurrent jurisdiction over any local crimes that are sufficiently similar to federal crimes.see callwood enos,cir citing c.until recently,the district court served as more than a trial court.the appellate division of the district court also heard all appeals from local courts.a.in turn,our court had appellate jurisdiction over appeals from the appellate division.id.c.such review was a matter of right.
congress changed this system in by amending the revised organic act.this amendment enabled the virgin islands legislature to vest original jurisdiction over local actions exclusively in local courts.parrott gov t of virgin islands,cir citing a,b.the virgin islands exercised that power,vesting exclusive jurisdiction over local actions in the territorial court of the virgin islands now known as the superior court of the virgin islands.v.after this amendment,the district court continued to hear appeals from local trial courts,and it retained concurrent jurisdiction over local crimes that are similar to federal crimes.see callwood,at.
the next major change came in.fifty years after receiving authority to do so,the virgin islands legislature established its own appellate court the supreme court of the virgin islands.see.the supreme court,composed of three justices,began exercising its judicial authority on january.it handed down its first decision later that year.it continues to hear all appeals from the superior court of the virgin islands.see id.a.
the founding of the virgin islands supreme court altered the relationship between the federal judiciary and the virgin islands court system.going forward,the district court of the virgin islands no longer has appellate jurisdiction over any local decisions see a indicating that the district court appellate jurisdiction ends once the virgin islands legislature creates its own appellate court.instead,as set out in,we have certiorari jurisdiction over the virgin islands supreme court 
f or the first fifteen years following the establishment of the appellate court authorized by section a of this title,the united states court of appeals for the third circuit shall have jurisdiction to review by writ of certiorari all final decisions of the highest court of the virgin islands from which a decision could be had.
our certiorari jurisdiction will last for a maximum of fifteen years.after that,the virgin islands supreme court will have the same role as the highest court of any state it will be the final authority on virgin islands law.the united states supreme court will review its decisions on federal law,and we will no longer have appellate jurisdiction over its decisions.in the meantime,we have established rules that govern the process of granting certiorari petitions.see,third circuit local appellate rule a review on writ of certiorari is not a matter of right,but of judicial discretion,and will be granted only when there are special and important reasons therefor.
the period established by is merely a default.the statute requires our court to submit a report to congress every five years after the creation of the virgin islands supreme court the purpose of the report is to evaluate whether it has developed sufficient institutional traditions to justify direct review by the supreme court of the united states from all final decisions.
earlier this year,a committee from the third circuit prepared the initial report see judicial council of the court of appeals for the third circuit,report on the virgin islands supreme court,available at.the committee reviewed the supreme court decisions,practices,facilities,and operations.it concluded that the supreme court of the virgin islands has developed sufficient institutional traditions to justify direct review by the supreme court of the united states.id.at quoting.the committee recommended that congress eliminate our certiorari jurisdiction.id.still,congress must act for that recommendation to take effect for now,we retain certiorari jurisdiction over final decisions of the virgin islands supreme court.
we first address the question of appellate jurisdiction.during our interim certiorari period,we have authority to review by writ of certiorari all final decisions of the highest court of the virgin islands from which a decision could be had.the question is whether the virgin islands supreme court order reversing the superior court and remanding for further proceedings satisfied the final decisions requirement in.we conclude that it did.
we recently considered the meaning of the term final decisions.see virgin islands john,cir.under john,a decision is final only if it is final within the meaning of the united states supreme court certiorari jurisdiction statute.id.at citing final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a state may be reviewed by the supreme court by writ of certiorari.in general,a judgment is final under the supreme court certiorari statute only if nothing further remains to be determined by a state court,no matter how dissociated from the federal issue that has finally been adjudicated by the highest court of the state.cox broad.cohn,quoting radio station wow,johnson,quotation marks omitted.here,the virgin islands supreme court remanded to the superior court,and the superior court still needs to decide whether phillip was negligent.this posture suggests that the supreme court decision was not final.
yet the definition of a final decision is not so absolute.the united states supreme court has recognized four exceptions to the finality rule 
in the first category are those cases in which there are further proceedings even entire trials yet to occur in the state courts but where for one reason or another the federal issue is conclusive or the outcome of further proceedings preordained 
second,there are cases in which the federal issue,finally decided by the highest court in the state,will survive and require decision regardless of the outcome of future proceedings 
in the third category are those situations where the federal claim has been finally decided,with further proceedings on the merits in the state courts to come,but in which later review of the federal issue can not be had,whatever the ultimate outcome of the case 
lastly,there are those situations where the federal issue has been finally decided in the state courts with further proceedings pending in which the party seeking review here might prevail on the merits on nonfederal grounds,thus rendering unnecessary review of the federal issue by this court,and where reversal of the state court on the federal issue would be preclusive of any further litigation on the relevant cause of action rather than merely controlling the nature and character of,or determining the admissibility of evidence in,the state proceedings still to come.in these circumstances,if a refusal immediately to review the state court decision might seriously erode federal policy,the court has entertained and decided the federal issue,which itself has been finally determined by the state courts for purposes of the state litigation.
id.at.when one of these exceptions applies,the supreme court will review a state court ruling on a federal issue even when additional issues await resolution in the lower courts.in such instances,immediate rather than delayed review would be the best way to avoid the mischief of economic waste and of delayed justice.id.at quoting radio station wow,at quotation marks omitted.
we conclude that the cox exceptions apply to the finality requirement in our certiorari statute albeit with one difference.the supreme court reviews state decisions only on questions of federal law.see.by contrast,we review decisions of the virgin islands supreme court on questions of both federal and local law.see pichardo com r of labor,cir.as a result,we apply the exceptions by examining the federal or local issue that the supreme court has decided again,even though additional issues might await resolution.in effect,we apply the language from cox by replacing the phrase federal issue with the phrase federal or local issue.
according to phillip,this case fits within the third and fourth exceptions we disagree at least with respect to the third exception.if we remand for lack of jurisdiction,we could still review the supreme court decision after the losing party filed another petition.phillip argues that res judicata would prevent us from granting certiorari.this argument is based on a misunderstanding of res judicata,which prevents parties from making the same claim in separate actions not from making the same argument on separate appeals in a single action.see united states unlabeled boxes,cir noting that res judicata applies only if there was a final judgment on the merits in a prior suit emphasis added.
that leaves the fourth exception.subsequent supreme court cases have confirmed that the exception applies if three requirements are met the appellant might prevail at trial on separate grounds reversing the state court would end the litigation on the claim and failing to review the decision might seriously erode federal policy.florida thomas,fort wayne books,indiana.
this case meets the first two requirements.phillip might prevail at trial on separate grounds for example,the superior court might conclude that he was not negligent or that defoe assumed the risk of injury.and if we reversed the supreme court by concluding that tavarez still applies,our decision would effectively reinstate the superior court grant of summary judgment and thus would end the litigation.the question,then,is whether this case meets the third requirement that is,whether failing to review the supreme court decision might seriously erode federal policy.
this question requires a inquiry.in florida thomas,the united states supreme court concluded that a suppression motion did not invoke sufficient federal policy concerns.at here the state can make no claim of serious erosion of federal policy that is not common to all decisions suppressing evidence in criminal trials.by comparison,in fort wayne books indiana,the court concluded that an indiana case met this requirement because the case held that a specific application of the indiana racketeer influenced and corrupt organization statute was unconstitutional.a challenge to the constitutionality of the use of rico statutes to criminalize patterns of obscenity offenses calls into question the legitimacy of the law enforcement practices of several states,as well as the federal government.at.it also pointed out that a djudicating the proper scope of first amendment protections has often been recognized by this court as a federal policy that merits application of an exception to the general finality rule.id.
this case also meets the third requirement.our court has had a significant role in overseeing the virgin islands supreme court.see pichardo,at w e are entrusted with the task of overseeing the development of the virgin islands supreme court institutional traditions.quotation marks omitted.we have certiorari jurisdiction over the supreme court decisions both on questions of federal law and on questions of local law.see pichardo,at.and,by law,we are required to submit regular reports to congress evaluating the supreme court progress.having chosen to invest in us this oversight role by statute,congress has declared a specific federal policy,the relevant federal policy for cox purposes.we believe that if we failed to review the supreme court defoe decision at this time,we would weaken our oversight role and in doing so,would seriously erode federal policy.after all,by not reviewing that decision,we would leave the precedential posture of our pre territorial cases undecided.to prevent such uncertainty and to avoid shirking our oversight role we conclude that we have jurisdiction under.
we now consider whether the virgin islands supreme court may reject our pre decisions on local law.upon its establishment,the virgin islands supreme court became the final authority on local law subject to a qualification discussed below.we recognized that the supreme court would assume this role even before its creation.see ba props.gov t of virgin islands,cir the virgin islands supreme court would essentially have the final word on the interpretation of local virgin islands law.and we reaffirmed this conclusion five years later when the virgin islands legislature actually created the supreme court.see edwards hovensa,llc,n cir noting that g oing forward,now that the virgin islands has established an insular appellate court it will begin developing indigenous jurisprudence emphasis added.
as a result,when the district court faces a novel question of virgin islands law,it must predict how the supreme court will resolve that question.id.and we must make similar predictions.a few years ago,we interpreted a virgin islands statute prohibiting unauthorized individuals from carrying firearms,a.before doing so,we noted the absence of controlling virgin islands precedent.gov t of virgin islands lewis,cir.we were mindful,of course,that the authority to interpret the statute lies centrally with the newly created supreme court of the virgin islands.id.and we confirmed that our decision did not preclude the supreme court of the virgin islands from offering its own interpretation.id.
consequently,our relationship with the virgin islands supreme court is much like our relationship with other state courts we generally defer on questions of local law.such deference is consistent with the text of,which assumes that the virgin islands supreme court will have the freedom to create its own institutional traditions.the relations between the courts established by the constitution or laws of the united states and the courts established by local law shall be governed by the laws of the united states pertaining to the relations between the courts of the united states and the courts of the several states in such matters and proceedings.
but our relationship with the virgin islands supreme court is different in at least one important respect.we have certiorari jurisdiction over the virgin islands supreme court.and unlike the united states supreme court certiorari statute,is not limited to decisions on federal law.we also have the discretion to review the virgin islands supreme court decisions on local law.see pichardo,at noting that unlike the united states supreme court review of decisions,o ur review is not limited to cases that implicate the united states constitution or federal law.
because of this difference,we concluded in pichardo that i t is,subject to our review for manifest error,the role of the virgin islands supreme court to say what the law of the territory is.we will reverse a decision of the supreme court that is based upon territorial law only if it is inescapably wrong.id.at.in other words,the supreme court has assumed our erstwhile role as the final authority on territorial law,though with an important limitation its decisions must not be manifestly erroneous or inescapably wrong.
the ninth circuit adopted this standard nearly a decade ago.haeuser dep t of law,cir.by statute,the ninth circuit once had the same relationship with the guam supreme court as the one we now enjoy with the virgin islands supreme court at the time,the ninth circuit concluded that it would review local decisions of the guam supreme court for manifest error.id.noting that the degree of deference owed to the guam supreme court does not allow us to reverse the guam supreme court decisions on matters of local law unless clear or manifest error is shown.
the ninth circuit did not create the manifest error standard.instead,the united states supreme court first articulated this standard in.the supreme court concluded that the first circuit which once had a similar role in supervising the supreme court of puerto rico should generally defer to local decisions of that territorial court.for to justify reversal in such cases,the error must be clear or manifest the interpretation must be inescapably wrong the decision must be patently erroneous.sancho texas.
all of this is settled law.pichardo requires us to affirm the decisions of the virgin islands supreme court that are based on territorial law unless those decisions are inescapably wrong.in phillip mind,however,this deferential standard does not apply when the supreme court disregards one of our pre decisions on territorial law.instead,as his argument goes,we should conclude that the supreme court is bound to our pronouncements from days gone by.
as for our post precedents,we have already rejected this argument.we stated in lewis that the authority to interpret a virgin islands statute lies centrally with the newly created supreme court of the virgin islands.we do not mean by our decision today to preclude the supreme court of the virgin islands from offering its own interpretation of the statute.at citation omitted.the supreme court may disregard our post decisions on territorial law again,as long as the court does not manifestly err in doing so 
we see no reason to adopt a different standard for our pre precedents.section does not distinguish between cases handed down before and after the supreme court founding,nor do our precedents such as pichardo and lewis.in fact,allows the virgin islands supreme court to develop its own institutional traditions.this assumes that the supreme court will have the freedom to create its own legal precedent.pichardo,at quoting haeuser,at.the supreme court would have far less freedom to do so if it remained bound to our pre cases.
more to the point,courts adopting the precedents of past courts typically have the freedom to overturn those precedents.for example,the eleventh circuit branched off from the fifth circuit in.although the eleventh circuit relies on pre fifth circuit cases,it is free to overrule them.see bonner city of prichard,cir en banc the decisions of the former fifth circuit,adopted as precedent by the eleventh circuit,will,of course,be subject to the power of the eleventh circuit sitting en banc to overrule any such decision.the supreme court of guam has similarly claimed the authority to reject ninth circuit precedents from a time when it provided the final word on local law 
t his court does not recognize the decisions of the appellate division of the district court of guam as controlling our construction of law.we consider its opinions as precedent that is binding upon the trial courts of guam,but these decisions,like those of the ninth circuit court of appeals,are considered persuasive authority when we consider an issue it should be underscored that the creation of the supreme court of guam did not erase case law.precedent that was extant when we became operational continues unless and until we address the issues discussed there.
guam quenga,no,wl,at guam may.
we therefore conclude that the virgin islands supreme court may reject our local decisions that predate its establishment.of course,just as the supreme court of guam was subject to a standard of review during the ninth circuit certiorari period,the virgin islands supreme court is subject to the same standard of review during our certiorari period.this standard certainly limits the supreme court freedom to reject our decisions.but it does not force the supreme court to follow us in.
in a effort,phillip contends that local appellate rule a binds the supreme court to our pre local decisions.this rule states that when deciding whether to grant certiorari,we will consider whether t he supreme court of the virgin islands has decided a question in a way that conflicts with applicable decisions of this court or the united states supreme court.according to phillip,this rule is an assertion that the supreme court must follow our pre precedents.but the rule makes no such assertion it states that we will consider granting certiorari when the supreme court disagrees with us,nothing more.
the final question is whether the supreme court decision to reject tavarez was manifestly erroneous.phillip argues that any disagreement with our precedents meets this standard such that no additional inquiry is necessary.if we reject this absolute rule,phillip also argues that the supreme court decision to reject tavarez in particular was manifestly erroneous.we reject both arguments.
first,however,we consider what it means for a decision to be manifestly erroneous or inescapably wrong.we have yet to conclude that a decision of the virgin islands supreme court meets this standard.for its part,the ninth circuit only once concluded that a decision of the supreme court of guam was manifestly erroneous.in haeuser,the ninth circuit overturned the guam supreme court for failing to apply a rule that it had adopted in the same opinion.at t he supreme court was required,under the very standard it announced earlier in its opinion,to review the record in its entirety,and then apply the law to the facts.quoting haeuser dep t of law,no,wl,at guam.
according to the united states supreme court,to reverse under this standard,it would not be sufficient if we merely disagreed with that interpretation.nor would it be enough that the tribunal chose what might seem,on appeal,to be the less reasonable of two possible interpretations.sancho,at.to warrant reversal,then,the virgin islands supreme court must commit an egregious error for example,by issuing an opinion with a significant internal inconsistency or by blatantly ignoring the plain text of a statute.more than mere disagreement is necessary.
we refuse
