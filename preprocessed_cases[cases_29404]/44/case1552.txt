harald bakkebo appeals the million judgment entered against him,in the southern district of west virginia,on claims of fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud against the first national bank of keystone keystone,or the bank this civil action was initiated and pursued by the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic,the receiver of keystone.on appeal,bakkebo contends that the district court erred in denying his december,motion for judgment as a matter of law,for a new trial or,in the alternative,for a remittitur the motion.specifically,bakkebo contends that the court should have ordered a new trial because it erred in admitting evidence of his earlier indictment on charges unrelated to the conduct alleged in this civil action,and because it made a remark during the trial proceedings that was incurably prejudicial to him.bakkebo also asserts that the court should have awarded him judgment as a matter of law because the trial evidence was legally insufficient to show that he and his made fraudulent misrepresentations to keystone,and also to establish that keystone reliance on their representations was justified.finally,bakkebo maintains that the court should have ordered a new trial or a remittitur because the jury award of million in damages to the fdic was against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.as explained below,we reject each of these contentions and affirm.
in the,bakkebo and several induced keystone to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in a financial enterprise known as loan securitization,in which keystone purchased thousands of subprime home loans from the lenders that had originally made the loans or from other entities that had previously acquired the loans,then resold the rights to most of the loans proceeds in the form of special securities keystone loan securitization transactions were orchestrated by dan melgar,a close friend and business associate of bakkebo.melgar held himself out as an expert in loan securitization and persuaded keystone to pursue it as a lucrative alternative to the bank traditional local lending business.neither keystone officers nor its directors who were businessmen and professionals living in or around keystone,the southern west virginia town in which the bank was based had experience with loan securitization,and melgar effectively exercised sole control over the securitization program in which keystone engaged.he established the prices that keystone paid for loans and the prices at which it sold securities.significantly,he provided projections of future loan performance on which keystone relied in making its foray into loan securitization.also of importance,melgar selected the entities with which keystone would do business in each securitization sellers from which keystone would purchase loans,the loan servicers that would be paid to administer the loans after keystone purchased them,and the various financial services firms that were needed to facilitate each securitization.
melgar directed much of keystone securitization business to two entities controlled by bakkebo prime financial corporation prime and clearview capital corporation clearview.acting on melgar advice,keystone purchased hundreds of millions of dollars in at premium clearview,and also hired prime to service loans worth several hundred million dollars.keystone was unaware,however,that prime and clearview were paying melgar hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees that nominally were for consulting services,but for which melgar performed no work.neither melgar nor bakkebo disclosed to keystone that melgar had a financial incentive to assist bakkebo companies in obtaining business.
keystone loan securitization program quickly ran into trouble.the bank conducted four securitizations in and,and all four performed much worse than melgar had predicted.the loans that keystone had purchased proved to be of low quality,and by the end of keystone had not earned a single dollar return on its enormous investment in loan securitization.in december,contifinancial conti,a new underwriter responsible for placing the securities that keystone sold,terminated its relationship with keystone.in so doing,conti advised bakkebo,melgar,and keystone that the quality of the loans keystone had securitized was so poor,and that the administration of the securitization program had been so lacking,that conti foresaw only further losses if it continued to underwrite keystone deals.
melgar,however,advised keystone that conti had misrepresented its reason for ending its relationship with keystone,and that conti actually had withdrawn as underwriter because it wanted to compete with keystone in the loan securitization business.melgar further asserted,in a january,memorandum to keystone vice president terry church,that the quality of the loans clearview and prime were selling had improved substantially and with the improved quality the deals sic performance should improve.thus advised,keystone engaged in six more loan securitizations in and,involving approximately million in loans.despite melgar assurances that the quality of the loans keystone was securitizing had improved,these six deals,like the and securitizations,were near complete failures.the loans involved performed far below melgar projections,and keystone incurred massive losses as a result.
in january,bakkebo was indicted in a louisiana federal court on insurance fraud charges unrelated to keystone securitization program the indictment.bakkebo indictment jeopardized prime license,issued by the department of housing and urban development hud,to service title i type of subprime mortgage partially guaranteed by hud.a substantial part of the loans prime was servicing for keystone were title i loans,and so the possibility of prime losing its title i servicing license threatened keystone securitization business.keystone responded by seeking to transfer its title i loans from prime to another servicer,but bakkebo refused to release the loans as keystone having no legal basis for retaining control of keystone loans.instead,he insisted that keystone purchase prime from him as a way of ending the association between him and prime,and thereby removing the threat to prime ability to service title i loans.
keystone initially resisted bakkebo demand.soon thereafter,however,prime performance in servicing keystone loans began to decline,worsening the loan securitization program already disappointing performance and placing keystone under even greater pressure to regain control of the loans prime was servicing.in september,keystone offered to purchase prime for million.on october,prime countered with an offer to be acquired by keystone for million.rather than compromising during the ensuing negotiations,prime raised its demand.finally,on october,keystone agreed to acquire prime for million in cash,plus substantial additional compensation,including the forgiveness of several loans keystone had made to bakkebo.
in,after incurring further substantial losses from loan securitizations,keystone collapsed.the fdic,which had insured keystone deposits,was appointed as receiver for the bank.on august,the fdic initiated this civil action against bakkebo as well as numerous other defendants in the southern district of west virginia the fdic complaint alleged that bakkebo had engaged in fraud,as well as civil conspiracy to commit fraud,against keystone.
at the time the fdic filed its complaint,bakkebo was in norway,having fled the united states in january to avoid prosecution for the insurance fraud scheme alleged in the indictment.because of bakkebo location,he and the fdic agreed that he would submit a sworn narrative statement in this civil action the written statement in lieu of giving a deposition.on july,the district court entered a consent order regarding the written statement admissibility that barred the fdic from objecting to the admissibility at trial of this sworn narrative statement on the basis of authenticity,hearsay or the fact that it is in narrative form.in the written statement,bakkebo discussed the indictment,indicating that it was the motivation for his flight to norway and the reason for keystone purchase of prime.
on november,a jury trial commenced on the fdic claims against bakkebo.the trial lasted six days,and resulted in the verdict underlying this appeal.bakkebo appeal focuses on five factual aspects of the trial proceedings,which we summarize in turn.
the first and potentially the most problematic of the pertinent procedural facts is the district court decision to admit evidence of the indictment.on november,the trial first day,the court ruled such evidence admissible.on december,the court explained that the evidence was admissible because,in submitting the written statement,bakkebo had waived any objection to keeping out of evidence his fugitive status and indictment.the court thereafter instructed the jury,following the close of the evidence on december,that the indictment evidence could be considered for the limited purposes of determining whether bakkebo had any intent to defraud the first national bank of keystone,and for assessing his credibility.trial tr.vol.in its september,order denying the motion,the court reiterated two reasons for admitting the indictment evidence first,bakkebo had opened the door by discussing the indictment in his written statement and,second,the indictment evidence was admissible under federal rule of evidence b to show bakkebo motive,intent,and plan to defraud keystone.
the second procedural aspect of the trial with significance for this appeal was a question asked by the district court during the fdic direct examination of church,keystone vice president.on december,the trial fourth day,the fdic questioned church regarding keystone purchase of prime and,in particular,the difficulty keystone experienced in regaining control of the loans prime was servicing.with regard to that difficulty,the court initiated the following exchange 
the court i curious about something.can i ask a question here 
fdic counsel absolutely,judge.
the court this may be a dumb question,but you tried to terminate prime for the misconduct.why did you just fire them for the funny business and misconduct 
the witness we tried to,sir.
shortly thereafter,defense counsel objected to the court use of the term funny business in questioning church the funny business question and requested a curative instruction to correct it.the court complied with counsel request,and immediately instructed the jury as follows 
ladies and gentlemen,i going to instruct you to disregard the wise crack i made about funny business with regard to the loans.that was improper for me to use that term,and i should not have done it,and you instructed to completely disregard it.
then,on december,after a weekend recess,bakkebo moved for a mistrial based on the court funny business question.the court denied this motion from the bench.subsequently,at the trial conclusion,the court included the following instruction in its charge to the jury 
during the course of this trial,i had occasion to ask questions of a witness.no question,or for that matter,no statement or ruling which i have made during the course of this trial was intended to indicate my opinion as to how you should decide the case,or to influence you in any way in your determination of the facts.
trial tr.vol.
in the motion,bakkebo asserted that a new trial was warranted because of the prejudicial effect of the funny business question.the district court rejected bakkebo contention in this regard in its september,order.
bakkebo appeal also calls attention to several aspects of the evidence the fdic presented at trial.first,with respect to misrepresentations made by bakkebo and his to keystone,the fdic presented two general categories of evidence evidence that melgar had misrepresented the general financial performance of keystone securitization program,and evidence of bakkebo and melgar misrepresentations on the more specific subjects of clearview and prime.
on the general performance of the securitization program,the fdic presented evidence that melgar had advised keystone,in october,that residuals from the securitizations the bank had conducted up to that time were worth million.church testified,however,that this valuation had been false,and that by,when the bank collapsed,the residuals melgar had valued at more than million had produced no more than in income for keystone.in addition,the fdic offered the testimony of wendy pack,a former keystone employee,that melgar had advised keystone that the securitization program was making money.but andrew davidson,an expert in securitizations,testified that such a representation by melgar would have been knowingly false.the fdic also presented evidence that melgar had consistently advised keystone that it could expect to profit from the securitization program,and contrasted this evidence with davidson expert testimony that melgar would have known the program was a complete failure.
with regard to melgar specific representations about clearview and prime,church testified that melgar had advised keystone that the loans being purchased from clearview were of high quality and had good scores from debtrating services.the fdic also showed that melgar had represented,in a january memorandum,that clearview and prime were key to the success of the securitization program,that the quality of clearview loans had improved substantially,and that the program performance would improve as a result of keystone continued involvement with clearview.
the fdic also provided evidence,in the form of testimony from church and pack,that the loans keystone had purchased from clearview were actually of extremely low quality,with high rates of default and delinquency.milton drageset,a former employee of bakkebo who had worked at both prime and clearview,also testified that the loans sold to keystone by prime and clearview were unsound.drageset explained that the reason for the loans poor quality was that prime and clearview disregarded compliance and credit guidelines,simply making and acquiring as many loans as possible because keystone would purchase them regardless of their quality.drageset further testified that bakkebo had been aware of these practices,and that both bakkebo and melgar had known of the poor quality of clearview loans.
in addition,the fdic offered the evidence of shannon doyle,a former employee of prime,that bakkebo had personally made payments on delinquent loans that were to be sold to keystone,and had caused negative information to be purged from the files on those loans,so that they would appear current.doyle testified that bakkebo had taken these actions after discussions with melgar on how to dispose of the delinquent loans.
in support of its contention that keystone justifiably relied on the representations at issue,the fdic presented church testimony that melgar held himself out as an expert on loan securitization,and that he buttressed that assertion with his ability to involve sophisticated financial firms,such as conti and lehman brothers,in keystone securitization program.church also testified that none of keystone officers,nor any of its board members,had any experience with loan securitization before melgar persuaded them that keystone should pursue it.
finally,in support of its position on damages,the fdic presented expert testimony from harry potter,a forensic accountant.potter testified that the total losses keystone incurred from the securitization transactions it conducted in and were approximately million,and that the bank losses from its purchase of prime were approximately million.potter also testified that these losses were caused by the actions of bakkebo and his.
on december,after deliberating for approximately three hours,the jury returned a verdict in which it found for the fdic and awarded damages of million against bakkebo.shortly thereafter,on december,bakkebo filed his motion.the district court denied the motion by its order of september.bakkebo has appealed the judgment against him,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
