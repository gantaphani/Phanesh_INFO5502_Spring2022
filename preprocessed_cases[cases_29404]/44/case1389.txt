plaintiffs jan eshow and fadwa safar were arrested,and safar briefly incarcerated,for an allegation of fraud that was mistakenly reported and almost immediately retracted.they brought suit under and state tort law against the police officer and prosecutor who,at different stages of the criminal process,learned that no crime had occurred and yet failed to take steps to withdraw an arrest warrant.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the grants of immunity to the police officer and prosecutor on the claims.as to the state law claims,however,we remand with instructions to dismiss the claims without prejudice to plaintiffs right to proceed in state court.
this case is an appeal from a rule b dismissal,which requires us to accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint.owens baltimore city state attorneys office,cir.to survive a motion to dismiss,the complaint must state a plausible claim for relief that permit s the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct.ashcroft iqbal.
what began as a simple exercise in bargain shopping took an unfortunate turn.plaintiffs eshow and safar are married residents of alexandria,virginia.in september,eshow purchased around of home flooring from costco in pentagon city,virginia.shortly thereafter,while browsing another costco store,he saw that the same flooring was on sale.after learning that he could take advantage of the sale price at the store of purchase,on october,eshow returned to the pentagon city costco to get the discount.store personnel explained that he should purchase the identical flooring at the current markdown and then immediately return it,using his initial sales receipt as the basis for the refund.eshow followed these instructions and obtained a refund on the joint account he shared with safar.
a few hours later,costco called the arlington county police department to report mistakenly that eshow and safar had fraudulently secured a refund on goods they never purchased.officer stephanie rodriguez,along with another colleague,responded to the report and reviewed a video showing eshow seeking the refund.rodriguez filed an affidavit requesting arrest warrants for both plaintiffs,and a magistrate judge issued the warrants.
the next day,costco representatives contacted rodriguez and notified her that the allegations against eshow and safar were unfounded no fraud had in fact occurred.rodriguez did not take any steps to correct her affidavit or withdraw the arrest warrants.
eight months went by without incident until eshow was pulled over for speeding in fairfax county,virginia.based on the outstanding arrest warrant,the police officers handcuffed eshow in front of his family and placed him under arrest.on july,eshow appeared before the arlington county general district court to contest the fraud charge.at the hearing,a costco representative explained to rodriguez and lisa tingle,the assistant commonwealth attorney,that the charge was erroneous and should be dropped.tingle moved for nolle prosequi and the court dismissed the case against eshow.
both rodriguez investigative notes and tingle case file indicated that identical charges were pending against safar,but neither took any action to withdraw her arrest warrant.rodriguez and tingle had previously been trained in the standard procedures for withdrawing warrants from statewide law enforcement databases.in particular,an attorney for the commonwealth may at any time move for the dismissal and destruction of any unexecuted warrant or summons issued by a magistrate.code ann.west.
in late,eshow and safar applied for american citizenship.after passing her citizenship test,safar turned to the next requirement and sought clearance letters from local police in counties where she previously resided.on december,safar reported to the police headquarters in prince george county,maryland to get a clearance letter.upon reviewing her file,an officer informed her that she was under arrest pursuant to an active warrant.safar was incarcerated in maryland,and a magistrate advised her that a transfer to arlington,virginia could not be arranged until the county judges returned from the holiday.
as part of the incarceration process,safar was strip searched and inspected for smuggled contraband.she was the primary caregiver for three young children at the time and was denied the opportunity to use a breast pump.safar remained in jail for three days until december,when she was transferred to arlington,virginia and released.the following day the case against her was dismissed nolle prosequi by a different assistant commonwealth attorney.
plaintiffs filed a complaint against rodriguez and tingle in federal district court.eshow and safar asserted claims of unconstitutional arrest under.they also alleged,according to virginia tort law,that the failure to withdraw safar arrest warrant was grossly negligent.
rodriguez and tingle moved to dismiss all claims,and on april,the district court granted their motions.first,the district court rejected plaintiffs claims against rodriguez.neither the fourth amendment nor the due process clause provided a basis for relief,the court reasoned,and rodriguez was entitled to qualified immunity in any event.turning to the claim against tingle,the court found that she was shielded by absolute prosecutorial immunity.finally,the court held that plaintiffs failed to state a claim for gross negligence under virginia law.this appeal followed.
the bulk of plaintiffs complaint alleges claims under.section,of course,is not an independent source of substantive rights,but simply a vehicle for vindicating preexisting constitutional and statutory rights.see graham connor.the first step in any such claim is to pinpoint the specific right that has been infringed.see baker mccollan.
plaintiffs contend that rodriguez and tingle failure to withdraw the arrest warrants after learning that the charges were erroneous constituted an unconstitutional arrest.they assert that the alleged omissions breach two constitutional guarantees the fourth amendment and the fourteenth amendment due process clause.
as an initial matter,we are mindful of the supreme court injunction that the due process clause is not the proper lens through which to evaluate law enforcement pretrial missteps.compared to the more generalized notion of due process,the fourth amendment provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against unreasonable seizures and arrests,graham,at,and define s the process that is due for seizures of persons or property in criminal cases,gerstein pugh.consequently,a police officer who withholds exculpatory information does not violate the fourteenth amendment unless the officer failure to disclose deprived the plaintiff of the right to a fair trial.taylor waters,cir.further,insofar as plaintiffs claims sound in generic negligence,the due process clause is simply not implicated by acts of official carelessness.daniels williams.the fourth amendment,then,is the only actionable ground for relief.
having identified the constitutional right at issue,we now turn to the precise scope of the fourth amendment guarantee and defendants respective claims for immunity.
rodriguez contends that any cognizable fourth amendment claim against her is barred by the doctrine of qualified immunity.qualified immunity takes cognizance of human imperfections,west murphy,cir,and protects government officials from liability for bad guesses in gray areas,braun maynard,cir.quoting maciariello sumner,cir.the doctrine strikes a balance between two key societal interests the need to hold public officials accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and the need to shield officials from harassment,distraction,and liability when they perform their duties reasonably.pearson callahan.determining whether qualified immunity applies therefore presents a inquiry whether the facts make out a violation of a constitutional right and whether the right at issue was clearly established at the time of defendant alleged misconduct.id.at.we may address either prong of the analysis first.see id.at.
the animating principle here is one of fair notice.because police officers,like private citizens,have a right to fair warning,the defense operates to ensure that before they are subjected to suit,officers are on notice that their conduct is unlawful.hope pelzer.courts thus inquire whether the contours of a plaintiff asserted right were sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.anderson creighton.for a right to be clearly established,existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.ashcroft.and it is a longstanding principle that clearly established law should not be defined at a high level of generality.white pauly,per curiam quoting ashcroft,at.rather,the clearly established law must be particularized to the facts of the case so as to avoid transforming qualified immunity into a rule of virtually unqualified liability.id.quoting anderson,at.before concluding that an officer has breached a clearly established right,then,we must identify a case where an officer acting under similar circumstances was held to have violated the fourth amendment.id.
in rodriguez case,such legal notice was lacking.for starters,this suit does not cleanly fall within an established category of fourth amendment claims.the claim does not challenge an officer action,which is standard fourth amendment fare,but a failure to act which is much more.deshaney winnebago cty.dep t of soc,declining to impose on officials an affirmative duty to prevent harm and thus convert the constitution into a sword rather than a shield against government interference.plaintiffs can not state a false arrest claim,since rodriguez took no part in the actual seizure and the arresting officers acted pursuant to a facially valid warrant.see porterfield lott,cir.a claim for false arrest may be considered only when no arrest warrant has been obtained.nor do plaintiffs make out a failure to investigate claim,which tests an officer effort to establish probable cause before seeking a warrant.see wadkins arnold,cir.
here the complaint presupposes an altogether novel duty after a magistrate issued the arrest warrants based on probable cause,rodriguez had the duty to take steps to withdraw the warrants upon learning that the charges were meritless.by no means do we diminish the dreadful ordeal that rodriguez might have averted by seeking to retract the warrants.but that is a different matter from holding that rodriguez had an affirmative duty in law to do so.we need not decide whether such a duty exists the critical point is that the proposed duty was certainly not clearly established.
tellingly,plaintiffs fail to note what exactly the duty was or where in the law the obligation was to be found.they do not sketch out the procedures officer rodriguez was supposed to follow,identify the point in the criminal process when such steps should have been taken,or explain why it was her responsibility to have the warrants revoked.moreover,a virginia police officer does not ha ve the authority to unilaterally withdraw or dismiss a lawfully issued arrest warrant.op.att y,wl.only an attorney for the commonwealth may move the court for dismissal.see.code ann.and while rodriguez might have raised the issue with a supervisor or relayed her concerns to a prosecutor,we are unaware of a nebulous duty requiring police officers to follow some undefined procedure whenever they come across further information that casts doubt on an active arrest warrant.after all,in a situation in which a warrant has issued upon probable cause,a police officer is not called upon either to exercise discretion or to weigh the proof.brady dill,cir.see also id.at i t is the magistrate and not the policeman who should decide whether probable cause has dissipated to such an extent following arrest that the suspect should be released.
this is no abstract point.although plaintiffs assure us that this is an exceptional circumstance where probable cause had completely dissipated,we must be careful not to make bad law out of an ostensibly easy case.t he intuitively sensed obviousness of a case induces a rush to judgment,in which a convenient rationale is too readily embraced without full consideration of its future ramifications.town court nursing,blackmun,concurring in the judgment.to say that an affirmative duty attached here fails to emphasize the limits of such an obligation and how it might function in practice.probable cause is fluid after an arrest warrant is sworn out there often comes to light additional evidence that may be more or less exculpatory.sometimes a victim may recant,as costco did here.or perhaps a complaining witness offers new or conflicting testimony.in either case,an officer is forced to make a discretionary call about whether the subsequent information undermines a magistrate finding of probable cause and,if so,how best to proceed.
given the vagaries of these evidentiary judgments,courts should not lightly enter the business of micromanaging police investigations and impose a categorical duty on officers governing the termination of allegedly stale arrest warrants.indeed,if every failure of a police officer to act in some unspecified way on the basis of new information gave rise to liability,we would invite a legion of cases urging us to an officer decision about whether to a magistrate finding of probable cause.
in any event,to the extent that plaintiffs struggle to define a fourth amendment right,they face an even bigger obstacle demonstrating that such a duty was clearly established.plaintiffs frame the constitutional right at the highest level of generality,asserting that centuries of law forbid a state official from knowingly caus ing or permit ting the arrest of an innocent citizen.app.br.at.that is certainly true,as far as it goes.but what plaintiffs fail to do is identify a case where an officer acting under similar circumstances was held to have violated the fourth amendment.white,at.
the absence of controlling cases suggests that rodriguez did not have a clearly established affirmative duty to take steps to revoke the arrests warrants.in fact,all the indications from our case law point to the opposite conclusion.in taylor waters,cir,for instance,we held that a police investigator did not violate the fourth amendment when he declined to terminate proceedings after hearing from the plaintiff roommate that the plaintiff was not involved in the alleged drug offense.see id.at.once a neutral magistrate finds probable cause and issues an arrest warrant,we reasoned,the fourth amendment does not impose any further requirement of judicial oversight or reasonable investigation to render pretrial seizure reasonable.id.at.accordingly,an officer failure to act upon allegedly exculpatory evidence does not render the continuing pretrial seizure of a criminal suspect unreasonable under the fourth amendment.id.at.
so too in brooks city of,cir,we rejected a similar fourth amendment claim alleging that an arresting officer did not attempt to halt the criminal proceedings after learning that the plaintiff had not committed the suspected offenses.see id.at.once again,we took notice of the initial process provided by a neutral magistrate and in the continuing ability of judicial proceedings to test the strength of a case against those detained.thus,when a pretrial seizure has been rendered reasonable by virtue of a probable cause determination,any continuing pretrial seizure of a criminal defendant is also reasonable.id.at.any other rule would subject those in law enforcement to the prospect of suits for an endless variety of supposed pretrial failures or omissions.
we do not require that a prior case be identical to the case at bar to advance a civil suit.see ashcroft,at.but despite their assertions to the contrary,plaintiffs can not marshal a settled fourth amendment principle that would have put rodriguez on notice that she was violating the constitution.see white,at.given the absence of an established duty to act,we award qualified immunity to rodriguez on the claims.
tingle asserts for her part that she is entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity.it is well settled that prosecutorial activities that are intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process are absolutely immune from civil suit.imbler pachtman.recognizing that harassment by unfounded litigation could cause a deflection of the prosecutor energies from his public duties and lead the prosecutor to shade his decisions instead of exercising the appropriate independence of judgment,the supreme court in imbler determined that the protection afforded by qualified immunity was inadequate.id.at.a prosecutor,the court explained,inevitably makes many judgments that could engender colorable claims.id.at.in light of the substantial danger of liability even to the honest prosecutor that such suits pose when they survive the pleadings,the immunity that a prosecutor enjoys is absolute.id.
at the same time,the imbler court was careful to note that absolute immunity may not attach when a prosecutor is acting as an administrator and investigative officer rather than as an officer of the court.id.at.although the court had little difficulty concluding that initiating a prosecution and presenting the state case are prosecutorial activities,id.at,it acknowledged that d rawing a proper line between these functions may present difficult questions,id.at.going forward,courts should apply a functional analysis that considers whether the reasons for absolute immunity apply with full force to the conduct at issue.id.at.
in the decades following imbler,the supreme court began to plot the point at which a prosecutor begins to function as an advocate in judicial proceedings.the line between the investigative and advocacy phase typically turns on the difference between the detective role in searching for the clues and corroboration that might give him probable cause to recommend that a suspect be arrested and the advocate role in evaluating evidence and interviewing witnesses as he prepares for trial.buckley fitzsimmons.accordingly,the supreme court has held that a prosecutor is not entitled to absolute immunity when providing advice to police during a criminal investigation,see burns reed,or when acting as a complaining witness rather than a lawyer in support of a warrant application,see kalina fletcher.but when a prosecutor appears in court to present evidence in support of a search warrant,burns,at,or decides to seek an arrest warrant based on an evaluation of probable cause,see kalina,at,absolute immunity kicks in.
the supreme court again considered the boundary between administrative and advocacy activities in van de kamp goldstein,holding that a prosecutor performing an ostensibly administrative task still enjoys absolute immunity if the act is done in service of an advocacy function.see id.at.the court drew a distinction based on the activity proximity to the conduct of a trial certain kinds of administrative obligations are directly connected with the prosecutor basic trial advocacy duties,id.at,and require legal knowledge and the exercise of related discretion,id.at,whereas others such as workplace hiring,payroll administration,and the maintenance of physical facilities are more tangentially related if at all to a trial,id.as such,a district attorney and his chief assistant were absolutely immune from liability related to training staff prosecutors on impeachment material and managing a information system.see id.at.
a prosecutor decision to seek an arrest warrant is protected by absolute immunity,see kalina,at,but it remains an open question whether a prosecutor receives absolute immunity when she fails to withdraw an arrest warrant after learning that no crime had been committed.because a prosecutor decision whether to withdraw an arrest warrant is intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process,imbler,at,we conclude that tingle is entitled to absolute immunity.
plaintiffs contend that retracting a stale warrant is merely a ministerial duty and thus can not be protected by absolute immunity.this argument misses the mark.to the extent a decision to revoke an arrest warrant can be cast as administrative,it is directly connected with the prosecutor basic trial advocacy duties,van de kamp,at,and require s legal knowledge and the exercise of related discretion,id.at.under virginia law,a prosecutor does not have unilateral authority to withdraw an arrest warrant and must first file a motion to dismiss with the appropriate court.see.code ann.filing and arguing motions in court is trial work that falls comfortably within a prosecutor core advocacy duties.see dababnah,cir.failure to grant a prosecutor immunity for actions taken in open court in pursuit of a court order would be a portentous step.the decision to file a motion to rescind,moreover,generally involves the exercise of substantial discretion.a prosecutor is not bound to withdraw a warrant every time a victim purports to recant or conflicting information comes to light.rather,prosecutors engage in the familiar task of evaluating evidence and determining whether to retain the warrant based on a revised assessment of probable cause.buckley,at.consequently,we find that the choice to move the court for withdrawal is an extension of the prosecutor fundamental judgment of whether and when to prosecute.imbler,at see also kalina,at.
moreover,deciding whether or not to withdraw an arrest warrant is one of those advocacy functions to which the reasons for absolute immunity apply with full force.imbler,at.if absolute immunity does not insulate prosecutors for their refusal to withdraw an arrest warrant,it would work an end run around kalina and give rise to an anomalous regime where criminal defendants could mount civil suits against prosecutors for the maintenance of arrest warrants even though those same defendants could not challenge the initial decision to seek a warrant.given the frequency with which prosecutors come across new information after a warrant is sworn out,we are hesitant to open the door to all manner of collateral attacks on what at bottom is a prosecutor appraisal of probable cause.
we recognize,of course,that safar case,at least as alleged in the complaint,presents a stark scenario where the charges have been wholly discredited.but absolute immunity does not exist to help prosecutors in the easy case it exists because the easy cases bring difficult cases in their wake.van de kamp,at.in the mine run of cases,which generally turn on thorny factual questions,prosecutors should not be subject to the constant dread of retaliation for the maintenance of arrest warrants.imbler,at.as the supreme court recognized in imbler,allowing such suits to proceed would trammel an advocate independence of judgment,id.at,and might pose substantial danger of liability even to the honest prosecutor,id.at.
there are also existing safeguards that deter egregious prosecutorial misconduct in this arena.prosecutors remain subject to criminal sanction for willful acts of abuse.id.at.and t he organized bar development and enforcement of professional standards for prosecutors provides a and pervasive mechanism for controlling official malpractice.malley briggs,accord imbler,at a prosecutor stands perhaps unique,among officials whose acts could deprive persons of constitutional rights,in his amenability to professional discipline by an association of his peers.protections such as these obviate the need for damages actions to prevent unjust results.mitchell forsyth.
we acknowledge that granting absolute immunity leaves safar,who was genuinely wronged by tingle oversight,without civil redress under.imbler,at.yet the overall value of prosecutorial discretion may require that we accept the possibility that such discretion might be abused in the occasional case.as justice powell observed,the alternative of qualifying a prosecutor immunity would disserve the broader public interest by prevent ing the vigorous and fearless performance of the prosecutor duty that is essential to the proper functioning of the criminal justice system.id.at.
although the federal side of this case has come to a close,the fact that immunity may preclude a federal suit does not mean all avenues of redress are unavailable.section,for one,is not a font of state tort law that subjects every malfunction to correction by the federal judiciary.see paul davis,baker,at section imposes liability for violations of rights protected by the constitution,not for violations of duties of care arising out of tort law.our constitution deals with the large concerns of the governors and the governed.daniels,at.it does not purport to supplant traditional tort law in laying down rules of conduct to regulate liability for injuries that attend living together in society.id.
our federal system instead contemplates a scheme of shared responsibility whereby state governments retain authority over conventional tort remedies.compared to the blunter instrument of constitutional law,states are better positioned to experiment and fashion duties and remedies whether through the legislature,courts,or private bar that address local needs as they arise.such questions are fundamentally one of resource allocation,which involve a host of policy choices that must be made by locally elected representatives,rather than by federal judges interpreting the basic charter of government for the entire country.collins city of harker heights.
which brings us to plaintiffs remaining gross negligence claims.with respect to the state tort claim against tingle,the district court held that she was protected by absolute immunity under imbler.likewise,the court dismissed the claim against rodriguez because it concluded that virginia does not recognize a cause of action based on negligent investigations or prosecution.see safar tingle,supp.
it may be that virginia does not recognize a claim for gross negligence.but given the dearth of state law on negligent investigations,we think the definition of legal duties under the law of tort is best left for the state courts to resolve.accordingly,because all federal claims have been found wanting,we instruct the district court on remand to dismiss the state law claims without prejudice to plaintiffs right to advance their case in state court.see taylor,at declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over remaining state law claims and dismissing without prejudice see also fox custis,cir.whether plaintiffs allegations will ultimately prove to be correct we can not tell.at this stage,however,the truth of their pleadings must be assumed,and the horrific sequence of events they have alleged makes us reluctant to foreclose any prospect of relief.
the district court correctly held that plaintiffs claims were barred by qualified or absolute immunity.we think,however,that the better course in this particular instance is to allow plaintiffs the opportunity to press their state tort claims in state court.we thus affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand so that the dismissal of the state claims shall be without prejudice.
affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded 
i agree with the majority ultimate resolution of this case on qualified immunity grounds.however,because this case raises concerns for me regarding this court fourth amendment case law,and because i question the manner in which the majority disposes of the state law claims,i find it necessary to write separately.
the majority rightly concludes that there is no clearly established law which officer stephanie rodriguez could be said to have violated.thus,she is entitled to qualified immunity under our familiar sequence where we determine whether there has been a violation of a constitutional right,and whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged misconduct.pearson callahan,citing saucier katz.the majority reaches this conclusion by taking the analysis out of order which courts are permitted to do and does not ultimately decide whether there has been a violation of a constitutional right.
although i agree with the majority conclusion,its analysis reveals aspects of this circuit fourth amendment case law that cause me great concern.as is familiar and by the supreme court,the fourth amendment ultimate touchstone is reasonableness.brigham city stuart,citations omitted.the seizures that occurred when plaintiffs jan eshow and fadwa safar were arrested strike me as manifestly unreasonable.the affiant for their warrants,officer rodriguez,was aware that probable cause for their arrests had entirely dissipated yet,she did nothing to initiate any recall of the arrest warrants or to inform the commonwealth attorney office that the information on which she relied to obtain the warrants was entirely undermined.i believe that the fourth amendment mandates that when probable cause for an outstanding arrest warrant wholly disappears and the affiant is aware,the affiant has a duty to take steps to rescind the warrant.
my belief that a seizure pursuant to a warrant for which probable cause has entirely dissipated is unreasonable under the fourth amendment is not novel.multiple justices of the supreme court have recognized this point,albeit in opinions that have no binding force of law,as have several of our sister circuits.
in united states watson,the supreme court addressed the constitutionality of a statute authorizing a warrantless arrest even in the absence of exigent circumstances.in a concurring opinion,justice powell acknowledged that permitting only arrests and warrantless arrests limited to exigent circumstances would be problematic.id.at powell,concurring.he explained that officers attempting to meet such a standard who procur ed a warrant as soon as they had probable cause and then merely held it during their subsequent investigation would risk a court decision that the warrant had grown stale by the time it was used.id.emphasis added.justice powell further noted that in some cases the original grounds supporting the warrant could be disproved by subsequent investigation which would cause the warrant to be stale because it was based upon discredited information.id.at emphasis added.
justice marshall,joined by justice brennan in dissent,also recognized this problem,stating that probable cause to arrest,once formed,will continue to exist for the indefinite future,at least if no intervening exculpatory facts come to light.id.at marshall,dissenting emphasis added.although justice marshall noted that it is virtually impossible for probable cause to become stale between procurement of a warrant and arrest,id.at,he explained that it should be obvious that when the probable cause supporting a warrant no longer exists,the warrant is void and the suspect can not be arrested,id.at.
other supreme court justices have also recognized the possibility of an arrest warrant becoming stale due to exculpatory evidence coming to light before the execution of the warrant.see payton new york,white,dissenting,joined by burger,and rehnquist.
our sister circuits,in both published and unpublished opinions,have also recognized this possibility.see united states bizier,cir.noting that probable cause would grow stale only if it emerges that it was based on since discredited information,but reasoning that the opposite happened in the case at bar citing watson,at powell,concurring russell devereaux,app x,cir.noting that probable cause to make an arrest grows stale only if it emerges that it was based on since discredited information in rejecting a claim that probable cause was stale because nearly a year had passed between investigation and arrest quoting bizier,at united states henderson,cir.noting similarly,but finding no intervening exculpatory act united states,cir.if probable cause is established at any early stage of the investigation,it may be dissipated if the investigating officer later learns additional information that decreases the likelihood that the defendant has engaged,or is engaging,in criminal activity.a person may not be arrested,or must be released from arrest,if previously established probable cause has dissipated.united states edwards,cir.holding that i f the police learn information that destroys their probable cause to arrest a defendant,the arrest may become illegal,but finding police had sufficient evidence to believe an offense had occurred.the tenth circuit has recently reaffirmed its belief in this position.
