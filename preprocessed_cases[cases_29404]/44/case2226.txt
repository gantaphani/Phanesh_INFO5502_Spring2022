background and procedural history 
factual history 
plaintiff is the father and personal representative of vernard jones,jones,now deceased,a former inmate at muskegon county jail.jones was held at the jail as a pretrial detainee from september,until may.at the start of jones incarceration,his weight was pounds,and his height was.on jones inmate intake form,he indicated that he had a disease,but otherwise reported no health problems.approximately one month later,jones completed a health survey form in which he likewise did not report any significant medical issues.within the next few months,however,jones began to experience significant weight loss and serious problems.
beginning in november of,plaintiff maintains that jones had been complaining of abdominal pain and stopped eating his meals.around this time,plaintiff further contends that jones regularly requested medical assistance by submitting medical request forms kites.these kites,according to plaintiff,were repeatedly ignored by prison officials and the nursing staff.plaintiff supports these assertions primarily through the submission of affidavits from five former inmates maurice poole poole,zackee lawson lawson,lawrence dowdell dowdell,ronnie caviness caviness,and diana yager yager.these inmates assert that jones kites were routinely ignored,that the prison officials did not assist jones when he was visibly ill and not eating meals,and that prison personnel were overheard stating that jones was faking his illness and that inmates were not supposed to feel good.the affidavits of lawson,yager,and james ring ring,another former inmate,also claim inaction on the part of the prison staff in attending to their own serious medical needs.
defendants,on the other hand,assert that no prison officials were aware that jones was ill between november and the end of march,and that when it became known that jones needed medical care,medical assistance was provided.on march,jones was taken to the jail medical department for the first time where his condition was assessed by the nursing staff,which consists of two nurses,william yonker and sherry malenko,and one nurse,nancy mastee.according to yonker note in the medical chart,jones weighed pounds,having lost forty six pounds over a period.yonker ordered a blood test and a test for an ulcer,and referred jones to the prison doctor,david deitrick.deitrick examined jones on march,suspected that he was suffering from obstipation,and therefore provided him with a laxative.
on april,jones was examined again by the nursing staff,this time by nurse malenko.according to malenko entry in the medical chart,jones complained of sharp abdominal pain and weighed pounds,seven pounds less than he weighed just nine days earlier and pounds less than he weighed at the start of his detention.malenko treated jones with pepto bismol and scheduled a meeting with deitrick for the following day.on april,deitrick saw jones and scheduled a ct scan,liver profile,and kidney profile.
from april through april,the jail medical personnel continued to see jones for complaints of persistent stomach pain.on april,jones condition became dire,and he was transported to hackley hospital.numerous doctors at the hospital described his condition as emaciated,cachectic,and clinically dehydrated.exploratory surgery was performed on april,and a large cancerous mass was found.the doctors determined that they should not attempt to remove the mass.on april,jones was discharged from hackley hospital and returned to the jail with instructions that he be placed on hospice care.during the late evening hours of may and early morning hours of may,jones colostomy bag broke,and he was found lying on his cell floor,at which time an ambulance was called.jones was pronounced dead at on may.
procedural history 
on april,plaintiff,on behalf of jones,filed suit against defendants,asserting the following three claims violation of civil rights pursuant to gross negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress.the parties stipulated to the dismissal of the claims against deitrick.defendants,thereafter,filed separate motions for summary judgment.on august,the district court granted summary judgment on all counts for each of the defendants.with regard to the section claims,the district court stated that plaintiff failed to present evidence demonstrating that any defendant was deliberately indifferent to the serious medical needs of jones.specifically,the court found that plaintiff claim against deitrick failed because it was beyond dispute that the doctor had provided medical assistance to jones.the court noted that regardless of how ineffective that assistance may have been,his medical care was not so woefully inadequate as to amount to deliberate indifference.as to the nurses and corrections officers,plaintiff claims were primarily supported by the affidavits of former inmates.the district court found that these affidavits did not create a genuine issue of material fact,stating that 
while the court does not find the averments in these affidavits so devoid of merit or inadmissible that they should be discounted in their entirety,they are nevertheless lacking in specificity as to time,context and conduct such that they provide no basis for finding that particular officers,or the officers generally,had sufficiently culpable minds in denying jones medical care.
jones muskegon county,dist.lexis,at.according to the court,the affidavits were similarly insufficient to establish the requisite culpable state of mind with respect to the nursing staff.id.at.lastly,the court found that the county was not liable because the several affidavits that plaintiff provided from other inmates about their medical treatment were insufficient to prove a policy or custom of deliberate indifference.id.at.therefore,the court granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants on plaintiff claim.
the district court similarly concluded that summary judgment was warranted in defendants favor on plaintiff claims.the court reasoned that because plaintiff could not show conduct amounting to deliberate indifference in connection with his section claim,plaintiff failed to show any genuine issue of material fact with respect to the gross negligence claim.it lastly held that plaintiff could not satisfy the standard for intentional infliction of emotional distress because t he allegations against defendants do not rise to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct.jones,dist.lexis at.
ultimately,it was the court view that,although there may have existed serious deficiencies in the medical care provided by muskegon county jail and its employees,it was undisputed that some modicum of care was provided.in the court view,the failures in moral responsibility that may have taken place with respect to the care provided to jones and other inmates were simply not enough to give rise to legal liability.on november,plaintiff instituted the current appeal.he argues that the district court erred in dismissing his case because he provided sufficient evidence to give rise to a genuine issue of material fact with regard to each of his claims against defendants.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.monette electronic data,cir.pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c,summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings together with depositions,answers to interrogatories,admissions on file,and affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.the moving party bears the burden of showing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact as to at least one essential element on each of plaintiff claims.see celotex catrett.the party,on the other hand,must present sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably find for him.see anderson liberty lobby.the court then must determine whether the evidence presents sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.id.at.in making this determination,the court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.see,smith,cir.
iii.law and analysis 
count claim 
section establishes a cause of action for deprivation under color of state law,of any rights,privileges or immunities secured by the constitution or laws of the united states.horn madison county fiscal court,cir.to prevail on this claim,a plaintiff must demonstrate the deprivation of a right secured by the constitution or laws of the united states caused by a person acting under the color of state law.dominguez corr.med,cir quoting sigley city of parma heights,cir.however,u nder the doctrine of qualified immunity,government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability from civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights which a reasonable person would have known.id.citations omitted.thus,qualified immunity in any given case is determined by a inquiry first,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,has the plaintiff shown that a constitutional violation has occurred second,was the right clearly established at the time of the violation id.citations omitted.
in the instant case,plaintiff contends that jones was subjected to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment to the constitution.the eighth amendment forbids prison officials from unnecessarily and wantonly inflicting pain on an inmate by acting with deliberate indifference toward his serious medical needs.blackmore kalamazoo county,cir quoting estelle gamble.jones,as a pretrial detainee,is analogously protected under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.id.citing bell wolfish.
a section claim asserting a constitutional violation for denial of medical care has objective and subjective components.id.the objective component requires the existence of a sufficiently serious medical need.farmer brennan,citation omitted.such a medical need has been defined as one that has been diagnosed by a physician as mandating treatment or one that is so obvious that even a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor attention.harrison ash,cir citations omitted.the subjective element requires an inmate to show that prison officials have a sufficiently culpable state of mind in denying medical care.blackmore,at quoting brown,at.officials have a sufficiently culpable state of mind where officials act with deliberate indifference to a serious medical need.farmer,at citations omitted.the supreme court has defined deliberate indifference as being more than mere negligence but less than acting with purpose or knowledge.id.at.instead,the prison official must have acted with a state of mind similar to recklessness.id.at.thus,to prove the required level of culpability,a plaintiff must show that the official subjectively knew of a risk to the inmate health,drew the inference that a substantial risk of harm to the inmate existed,and consciously disregarded that risk.id.at see also cooper county of washtenaw,app x,cir brooks celeste,cir.
in the instant case,the parties agree that plaintiff has met the objective element of a sufficiently serious medical need because jones was diagnosed with colorectal cancer and died as the result of his illness.the central issue,therefore,is whether plaintiff presented evidence to establish the subjective component that each defendant acted with deliberate indifference toward jones serious medical needs.
defendant corrections officers 
plaintiff claims that correction officers were deliberately indifferent to jones serious medical needs.he claims that these officers worked in the area where jones was housed,were aware of his serious medical condition,yet failed to render medical assistance.to support this contention,plaintiff relies on a chart listing the days each of the officers worked from november to may and a daily staff work station,which lists the officers assigned to jones area from february to may.plaintiff asserts that the guards listed in these charts are those who would have received jones kites and who would have observed him not eating his meals and his subsequent weight loss.
plaintiff also submitted the affidavits of lawson,poole,yager,and dowdell,who contend that they witnessed jones deteriorating condition,his failed attempts to obtain medical assistance,and conversations among guards evincing knowledge of and indifference to jones condition.specifically,in dowdell affidavit,he states that he was housed in a cell near jones for at least one and months and that jones was left on up until his death.he also claims that jones would tell the officers that he needed to see a nurse,that they would respond that he should write up a kite,and that he would explain that he had previously done so without any response.dowdell also states that jones did not eat anything for weeks and that the guards were there when the food was delivered and would know that he was not eating.according to the affidavit of yager,she overheard officers beal,gutowski,and morris stating that jones was complaining of stomach pain,that jones thought he might have cancer,and that he had been sending kites out every day.she claims that the officers agreed that jones was faking his condition.in poole affidavit,he stated that he observed jones sending kites for medical attention several times a week and they were never answered.he also stated that,when jones would complain to the guards,different guards would respond that they would get to him when we get to him.lawson also stated that he noticed that jones was repeatedly sending out medical kites and that while the kites would be gone,he was not called down to see a nurse.
these affidavits,along with the officers assignment charts,are insufficient to establish plaintiff section claim against the corrections officers.the affidavits refer to guards in a general sense or to several guards engaged in a conversation about jones without specifying wrongdoing attributable to any particular defendant.the affidavits do not specify which officers were making comments,which officers ignored his requests for medical care,or which officers observed him not eating food for weeks.instead,plaintiff seeks to implicate all named guards through the affiants generalized statements regarding the guards.additionally,the assignment charts do not assist in identifying which guards purportedly engaged in wrongful conduct.instead,they merely indicate which officers were around his cell during the relevant period.none of the evidence is such as to implicate any specific officer.as such,it does not raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the liability of any officer.
furthermore,as recognized by the district court,neither the affidavits nor the assignment charts indicate whether it was in fact the guards who were responsible for jones lack of medical attention.the parties agree that it is the guards responsibility to deliver the medical kites to the nursing staff,and it is the nursing staff responsibility to call the inmate to their office for medical attention.although these affidavits could plausibly demonstrate that jones medical kites were being ignored,they do not demonstrate to whom the failure was the guards for not delivering them,or the nurses for not calling him to the medical center.the affidavits do not indicate that the guards failed to deliver the medical kites to the nurses.they indicate only that jones was not being called for medical treatment.as such,these affidavits and the assignment chart fail to create a genuine issue of material fact with regard to plaintiff section claim against defendant corrections officers.
plaintiff does,however,specifically identify the purported wrongful conduct of one officer.he claims that officer laura lewis was deliberately indifferent to jones serious medical needs on the date that he died.plaintiff cites statements from officer lewis deposition,in which she admitted that she left jones in his cell despite his deteriorating condition without immediately calling an ambulance.this evidence,however,is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact because lewis went on to state in her deposition that she believed the decision whether to call an ambulance did not rest with her but with command.furthermore,a report filed by officer lewis on may,which describes her interaction with jones in the hours before his death,indicates that prior to his death,officer lewis attended to jones medical needs and made efforts to make him more comfortable.accordingly,we find that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the corrections officers on plaintiff section claim.
defendant jail nurses 
plaintiff claims that the three jail nurses,mastee,yonker,and malenko,were deliberately indifferent to jones serious medical needs.plaintiff asserts that these nurses were aware of jones medical condition for five months prior to march,and yet ignored his medical requests,and were further deliberately indifferent in the manner in which treatment was provided to jones from march,until his death on may.according to the district court,t here is no evidence that the nurses were aware of jones condition until march,and the generalized averments in the inmate affidavits are insufficient to establish the requisite culpable state of mind with respect to any particular nurse.jones,dist.lexis,at.
the district court,however,did not fully consider the affidavit of diana yager,which,construed in a light most favorable to plaintiff,would support a finding of deliberate indifference by nurses mastee and yonker.in her affidavit,yager asserts that,while she was in the medical department,she overheard a conversation between nurses mastee and yonker.according to yager,t hey talked about how vernard had been sending medical kites complaining of abdominal pain,and how vernard thought that he might have cancer.both younkers sic and nurse nancy mastee agreed that he was faking it,and lying,and looking for attention and an easier way at the jail.yager maintains that this conversation took place sometime between november,and december,before yager was relocated to a different facility.
this affidavit,construed in a light most favorable to plaintiff,shows that nurses mastee and yonker received kites from jones indicating that he was suffering from abdominal pain and that he suspected he had cancer.they chose to ignore these requests,concluding instead that he was faking it.the affidavit further indicates that they received these medical kites by december,at the latest,yet failed to respond to these kites or call jones down to the jail medical facilities for a consultation or examination until march of,three months later.contrary to the district court decision,this evidence is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether nurses mastee and yonkers knew of the risk to jones health,yet consciously disregarded this risk.although it is undisputed that jones was eventually called down to the medical department and was examined by deitrick,this evidence is insufficient to insulate these two nurses from liability.their extended delay is sufficient to establish a factual issue regarding this claim.see blackmore kalamazoo county,cir when prison officials are aware of a prisoner obvious and serious need for medical treatment and delay medical treatment of that condition for reasons,their conduct in causing the delay creates the constitutionality infirmity.accordingly,the court concludes that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of nurses mastee and yonker on the section claims.the decision of the district court is reversed.however,since yagers affidavit does not implicate nurse malenko,this court hereby affirms the decision of the district court on plaintiff claims against her.
defendant jail doctor,deitrick 
plaintiff claims that deitrick was deliberately indifferent to jones serious medical needs during two periods first,from march,when he first treated jones,until april,when jones was transferred to hackley hospital and second,from april,until may,when jones was returned to the jail.plaintiff claim during the first period is that deitrick treated jones for constipation and ordered routine tests despite the obvious severity of his condition.similar to the analysis of defendant nurses,the district court stated that the notion that deitrick assessment of jones medical condition was inadequate or incorrect is insufficient to establish a constitutional claim of deliberate indifference.jones,dist.lexis,at.instead,the district court determined that deitrick did offer jones medical attention and that despite the fact that it may have been inadequate,it was not so woefully inadequate as to amount to no treatment at all.id.at quoting westlake lucas,cir.
the district court correctly asserted that courts are generally reluctant to second guess the medical judgment of prison medical officials.graham ex rel.estate of graham county of washtenaw,cir citation omitted.however,the sixth circuit has also recognized that 
p rison officials may not entirely insulate themselves from liability under simply by providing some measure of treatment.indeed,deliberate indifference may be established in cases where it can be shown that a defendant rendered grossly inadequate care or made a decision to take an easier but less efficacious course of treatment.
mccarthy place,app x,cir quoting terrance northville reg l psychiatric,cir.generally,courts find deliberate indifference where there is evidence tending to establish that the physician is present while the inmate is in distress,that distress is communicated to the physician,and the physician purposefully ignores the distress knowing that an adverse outcome is likely to occur.see,gibson moskowitz,cir upholding the jury finding of deliberate indifference where the psychiatrist knew that plaintiff medication would elevate his temperature,knew the room he was in was degrees and did nothing about it,causing inmate to die of dehydration mccarthy,app x at reversing the district court judgment in favor of the and finding an issue of fact with regard to deliberate indifference where the prison dentist saw the inmate who expressed significant pain due to a cavity and treated him only with ibuprofen for seven months instead of filling the tooth as he had performed for other inmates.
in this case,deitrick first examined jones on march.by that time,he had lost nearly fifty pounds,complained of sharp stomach pain,noted that he had been having small loose stools,and stated that he had not had a bowel movement in two days.in his medical chart,deitrick stated i think this is obstipation severe constipation not completely give dulcolax a laxative.he also noted that he encouraged jones to drink plenty of water.on april,one week later,deitrick met with jones who continued to complain of sharp stomach pains,stated that he had stopped taking the medication b
