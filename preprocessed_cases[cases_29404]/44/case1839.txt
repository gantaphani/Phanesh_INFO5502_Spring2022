in this case we granted an interlocutory appeal by union pacific railroad union pacific under b to determine whether the district court erred in defining the term facility for purposes of the claims brought by consolidated companies,conco under the resource conservation recovery act rcra,et,and the louisiana environmental quality act leqa,louisiana revised statutes,et.finding no error in the district court ruling,we affirm.
conco owns a parcel of property located on the southeast evangeline thruway in lafayette,louisiana conco tract.conco purchased the conco tract in from the predecessor in interest of union pacific,the southern pacific company southern pacific.prior to that time,the conco tract,along with several other contiguous parcels of property,composed southern pacific railroad yard former railroad site railroad activities were conducted on this site for approximately thirty years,ceasing in the.union pacific later merged with southern pacific and,for purposes of this case,assumed the obligations and liabilities,if any,of southern pacific.
conco operates a food warehouse and distribution facility on the conco tract.in,conco discovered contamination,including fuel oil,on the conco tract,which it alleges is the result of the prior railroad operations.conco brought suit against union pacific,pleading causes of action under the rcra,the leqa,and various theories.conco sought monetary damages and injunctive relief directing union pacific to clean up contamination on the entire former railroad site.initially,the allegations in conco complaint only related to the conco tract.however,conco was later permitted to amend its complaint to include allegations and requests for relief addressing the entire site.
upon agreement of the parties,the district court held a bench trial under federal rule of civil procedure b on the limited issue of whether the contiguous parcels of property that make up the former railroad site can constitute a single facility for purposes of conco claims under the rcra and the leqa.for purposes of this limited trial,union pacific stipulated that contamination from railyard operations is present on the conco tract and that conco can bring suit under the rcra and the leqa with respect to that tract.however,union pacific argued that conco did not have standing to include in its suit the other contiguous tracts that compose the former railroad site and are not owned by conco and under the rcra and the leqa,a facility can not be composed of the entire former railroad site but instead must be limited to the conco tract.
in its interlocutory judgment filed after the conclusion of the bench trial,the district court made several findings of fact,including that the former southern pacific railroad site included a gallon and a gallon above ground fuel oil tank and that oil,fuel,and dynamite were stored throughout the site that numerous pipelines,wells and drains traversed the site during its active use as a railyard that a preliminary subsurface investigation on the conco tract in the area of the gallon fuel oil tank revealed fuel oil contamination in the subsurface soil and the groundwater,which is undoubtedly linked to the operations of the railroad yard that other contamination related to or arising out of the railroad operations,including contaminants,pollutants,hazardous wastes hazardous substances as defined by law,has been discovered throughout the former railroad site at various times by various consultants and as early as or,union pacific was aware of the presence of hazardous wastes hazardous substances at,on,or under the former site and in the groundwater at various parcels further,the district court held that conco has constitutional standing to bring its claims under both the rcra and the leqa and the entire former southern pacific railroad site can constitute a single facility for purposes of conco rcra and leqa claims.union pacific filed a petition to appeal the interlocutory order under b,which was granted by this court.
on appeal,union pacific renews its arguments that conco does not have standing to bring its claims under the rcra and the leqa because it has not demonstrated an injury in fact sufficient to meet the requirements of article iii,of the united states constitution and that the district court erred in holding that the entire former railroad site can constitute a single facility for purposes of conco rcra and leqa claims.
union pacific first argues that conco does not have standing to bring its claims under the rcra and the leqa because it has not demonstrated an injury in fact sufficient to meet the requirements of article iii,of the united states constitution.as union pacific correctly notes,the citizen suit provisions of the rcra and the leqa do not,in and of themselves,satisfy the requirement of article iii.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.in order to demonstrate standing,a plaintiff must show that it has suffered an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and the likelihood that the injury can be redressed by a favorable decision.friends of the earth,laidlaw environmental services toc,d citing lujan,at.an injury in fact must be both concrete and particularized and must be either actual or imminent.friends of the earth,at.
we find that conco has demonstrated an injury in fact sufficient for purposes of constitutional standing.conco has produced evidence that contaminants are present in the soil throughout the entire former railroad site,including the conco tract.union pacific has conceded that these contaminants are present due to the former railroad activities conducted by its,southern pacific.further,based on the presence of these contaminants,conco is currently under louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq orders to monitor the area bordering the georgia pacific tract.conco has already incurred and continues to incur costs for its performance of these required monitoring efforts.recovery of these costs is one of conco objects in its suit against union pacific.these injuries are clearly actual,concrete,and particularized.id.
union pacific argues that conco injuries only give it standing to bring suit based on the parcel of the former railroad site that conco owns.however,union pacific has not provided any compelling legal basis for so limiting conco standing.conco injuries,as reflected in the district court factual findings,arose out of the railroad activities that were conducted throughout the entire former railroad site.further,conco has introduced evidence demonstrating that the contaminants on the tracts may pose further threatened harm to conco.an expert witness testified that the contaminants on the tracts may have already migrated to the conco tract or may so migrate in the future.the supreme court has consistently held that threatened harm can constitute an injury in fact.see lujan,at.
additionally,conco has submitted evidence showing that the city of lafayette water supply,the chicot aquifer,lies beneath the land surface at issue.an expert witness testified that the toxic contaminants located throughout the former railroad site may have migrated into the water supply.conco employees,like the citizens of lafayette generally,drink the water supplied by this aquifer and,therefore,have been or will be injured by any pollution of the aquifer given this evidence,we hold that conco injuries,both actual and threatened,are sufficiently related to the former railroad site so as to give conco standing to bring claims implicating the site in its entirety.see id.at.
union pacific also argues that the district court erred in holding that the entire former railroad site can comprise a single facility for purposes of conco claims under the rcra.union pacific contends that only the conco tract can legally be considered as a facility under the rcra.conco brings suit under a b,commonly referred to as the citizens suit provision of rcra,which provides that any person may commence a civil action on his own behalf,thereby empowering a plaintiff to act,in effect,as a private attorney general on behalf of citizens.see prisco carting.cir.in order to prevail und
