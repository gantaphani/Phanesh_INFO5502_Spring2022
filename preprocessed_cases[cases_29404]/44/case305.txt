yomar lost her leg after being hit by a car,driven by josé,while using an atm machine.she sued the bank,on whose property her injury occurred,claiming that the design of its atm facility was negligent.she also sued toro and his wife and insurance company for his negligent driving.a jury found for vázquez and awarded her nearly six million dollars in damages.the bank appeals that judgment.toro has not appealed the judgment against him.
despite our reluctance to disturb jury verdicts,we conclude that the district court erred in denying the bank rule motion for judgment as a matter of law because vázquez did not present sufficient evidence of negligent design to permit the jury verdict.given this outcome,the in which both the bank and toro appear as,challenging the district court denial of attorney fees,necessarily fails as to the bank we affirm the district court denial of fees assessed against toro and his.
factual background 
we recount the facts,which are largely undisputed,in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.banco popular de puerto rico bppr owns and operates a branch facility on villa street in ponce,puerto rico.the villa street branch includes a single,building,a banking area comprised of three lanes for vehicular traffic,a parking lot,and an outdoor atm,located on an exterior wall of the building facing the a car using the enters from villa street,follows the lane as it makes a left turn,stops at the teller station,and then follows the lane as it turns left again before exiting onto villa street.a car stopped at the teller station in the middle lane is directly behind a person using the atm,at a distance of approximately fifty feet about ten of which is comprised of the elevated sidewalk in front of the atm.other than a curb painted traffic yellow,there is no barrier or fence between the roadway for the area and the sidewalk in front of the atm.
on the day of the accident,vázquez was using the atm machine,with her back to the,while defendant toro was using the middle lane of the upon completing his transaction,toro shifted the car into gear he testified that the car then accelerated,despite the fact that he did not press the accelerator pedal.he stated that the car moved so quickly that he did not have time to apply the brakes,turn the steering wheel,or honk the horn to alert vázquez.in a matter of seconds,toro car jumped the curb,hit the wall of the bank,and pinned vázquez against the atm.vázquez testified that she heard the sound of a car accelerating,similar to the noise made when a car engine revs,but that she had no time to react before being hit.the car hit with such force that at least one airbag deployed.
vázquez right leg was crushed by the front bumper of toro car,requiring its amputation above the knee.her rehabilitation and recovery processes were long and painful,and the loss of her leg has caused her continual difficulties.
a little more than a month after the accident,toro car was examined by an insurance inspector.the inspector was unable to tell whether the car had been repaired or altered in any way since the accident.nonetheless,the inspector reported that both the acceleration system and the brake system of the car were in satisfactory working condition.he could identify nothing that would explain toro account of the car acceleration.
the trial commenced in march,after the district court denied the defendants motions for summary judgment.vázquez claimed that bppr was negligent in four respects it installed the atm in a location vulnerable to vehicle penetration by cars exiting the it failed to install the atm at a safer alternate location it installed the atm in a location where users would face away from the cars using the and it failed to install guardrails,barriers,or other devices to protect atm users from the vehicular traffic at the.
vázquez presented these four theories to the jury through her own testimony,and that of her relatives,defendant toro,and an acquaintance who was at bppr with her on the day of the accident but did not see toro car hit her she did not offer the testimony of any engineering experts,and she successfully objected to bppr attempt to present evidence about the absence of prior similar accidents.therefore,vázquez ultimately argued that the testimony of a handful of fact witnesses and photographs of the villa street facility were sufficient to demonstrate bppr negligence.
bppr argued that toro was solely responsible for the accident,and that it had not been negligent because it could not have reasonably foreseen the sort of negligence that caused vázquez injuries.on the final day of trial,bppr presented the testimony of rolando,a transportation systems engineer.garcía testified that he had participated in the design of about thirty facilities involving pedestrian and vehicle traffic and about twelve bank facilities.he was admitted as an expert without voir dire or objection from vázquez.
in his direct examination,garcía testified that the design of the bppr property complied with all relevant industry codes and regulations.he described a series of factors that an engineer would consider in designing a facility like this one,including the driver based on an average driver,this includes the driver visual capacity,capacity of movement,and other factors that might affect his behavior,the type of vehicle likely to use the facility including such factors as the vehicle turning radius,size,weight,and rate of acceleration or braking,the physical properties of the site including level and condition of terrain,and weather conditions.applying all of those factors to the bppr facility,garcía concluded that the area was properly and safely designed.he specifically pointed to the turning path for vehicles exiting the,the ample room for a vehicle to come to a stop between the teller station and the atm,the design speed or the average speed at which users of the facility are likely to drive,the presence of an elevated and painted curb,and the sidewalk in front of the atm.
at a sidebar conference during garcía testimony,plaintiff counsel commented that he had not expected some of the testimony.the district court explicitly invited the plaintiff to call her own engineering expert in rebuttal.vázquez ultimately called no rebuttal witnesses.
at the close of trial,bppr moved for judgment as a matter of law,under federal rule of civil procedure,arguing that vázquez had failed to carry her burden because her claim was premised on a theory of negligent design and she had not presented any evidence showing that the accident at issue was foreseeable.the district court rejected this argument plaintiff is not going to argue design,because this is not a design case it a foreseeability case,upon the facts as presented in this trial.the court explained that foreseeability would be a question for the jury and that the evidence presented describing the layout and measurements of the and atm facility was sufficient for a jury to conclude that an injury like vázquez was foreseeable.
the jury ultimately decided that both bppr and toro were negligent,with bppr percent responsible for vázquez injuries and toro percent responsible.the district court entered judgment for the plaintiff,holding the defendants jointly and severally liable,and issued a written opinion explaining its denial of bppr renewed rule motion.
the court again rejected the defendants contention that this was a negligent design case,viewing it instead as a generic negligence case,and held that vázquez was not obligated to present an expert witness because the safety of the atm facility was not beyond the competence of lay determination.the court stated that the jury was free to substitute its own judgment as to foreseeability for that of the expert in part or in whole.with that framework in place,the court summarized the plaintiff four theories of liability and concluded that there was a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find bppr negligent.
bppr filed a timely appeal,and vázquez,arguing that the district court erred in denying her an award for attorney fees.toro did not appeal the jury verdict,but appears before us as a on the attorney fees issue.

we must determine the nature of vázquez claim before considering whether she presented sufficient evidence to prevail.
nature of vázquez claim 
under article of puerto rico civil code,recovery of tort damages requires a showing that the defendant by act or omission cause d damage to another through fault or negligence.laws ann.tit.the three essential elements for general tort claims are evidence of physical or emotional injury,a negligent or intentional act or omission the breach of duty element,and a sufficient causal nexus between the injury and defendant act or omission in other words,proximate cause.see torres kmart,d,citing gómez.as is true in most jurisdictions,foreseeability is a central issue in these cases,as it is an element of both breach of duty and proximate cause.see hyatt hotels of,aff,cir stating that foreseeability is a component of breach of duty and proximate cause marshall,cir in puerto rico,just as in the common law jurisdictions,foreseeability is the touchstone of extracontractual liability.
breach of duty has,as its name implies,two duty and breach.in most cases,the duty is defined by the general rule that one must act as would a prudent and reasonable person under the circumstances.see ortiz levitt sons of,offic.trans.foreseeability is a component of the breach because a defendant only breaches his duty if he acted or failed to act in a way that a reasonably prudent person would foresee as creating undue risk.see pacheco pietri ela,no,june,alonso,dissenting t he negligent act is defined as a breach of the duty imposed or recognized by law,to act,as would a prudent and reasonable man,in order not to expose to foreseeable and unreasonable risks of damages,as a result of the actor behavior,those persons who a prudent and reasonable man would have foreseen would be exposed to the unreasonable risk created by the actor.quoting brau,los daños y perjuicios extracontractuales en puerto rico ed in other words,a person breaches the duty of reasonable care when his actions create reasonably foreseeable risks.a plaintiff,then,must show the foreseeable risks created by defendant acts or omissions in order to carry his burden as to this element of a tort claim 
in particular,claims based on allegedly dangerous conditions on commercial property premises liability claims require a showing that the defendant knew of or should have foreseen the risks created by the condition.
when it comes to business establishments,the general rule is that although a business owner is not the absolute insurer of the safety of its patrons,the business owner has a duty to keep said establishment in a safe condition so that the clients do not suffer harm or damage.however,liability is only imposed in situations that involve risky conditions inside the business premises that the owner knew or should have known existed.in other words,a plaintiff must prove that the defendant had actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition that most likely than not caused the damage.
torres,d at internal citations omitted.cases premised on the existence of a dangerous condition often arise from a,caused by a wet or slippery floor,and involve a claim that the business owner was negligent in permitting the condition to remain because it is foreseeable that a wet floor is likely to cause injury.similar claims include stairway railings in disrepair,exterior or security lights in a dangerous area,and unsturdy or unstable floors.in any of these circumstances,the property itself,if it were in pristine condition,would be safe,but some act or omission by the owner has created dangers or risks to the property visitors.
claims arising from allegedly dangerous properties may,alternatively,take the form of a defective design or negligent design case.the essential elements of a negligent design case are the same as other tort claims injury,breach of duty,and proximate cause.however,in a design case,the plaintiff also bear s the burden of establishing the applicable standard of care,prado alvarez reynolds tobacco,d,aff,cir.whereas a typical tort claim involves the generic reasonably prudent person standard of care or duty and requires the plaintiff to present no evidence about the defendant duty a plaintiff in a design case must present evidence as to the specific duty or standard of care applicable to the design of the product or property at issue.
negligent design cases involve a claim that the property was unsafe from its very conception the risks to patrons stem from the layout of or the nature of improvements on the property.the flaws alleged might include excessively steep stairways,united parcel,d,a balcony without a fence or guardrail,perez united states,aff,cir,or a busy intersection without stop signs or lights to direct traffic,hwys,d.in such cases,the property encountered by the plaintiff existed in the state intended by its owner it was not in disrepair or altered by some external force or action.therefore,the alleged defect,or negligence,is inherent in the property design,and the jury must evaluate the defendant actions with some understanding of what would,or would not,constitute a reasonably safe design.in most design cases,a plaintiff will only meet her burden of proof if she presents evidence as to the applicable standard of care,because the jury must be sufficiently familiar with that standard to evaluate whether the defendant design complied with it.
vázquez argued that this case was not based on a theory of negligent design and instead asserted that bppr atm facility was an unsafe condition,much like a wet floor,which was readily foreseeable to a person with.although the district court accepted her view,it did not explain its reason for approaching the case as one of premises liability rather than design defect.
the four theories of negligence alleged by vázquez in her complaint and reiterated throughout the litigation,all relate to the placement and design of the atm,relative to the teller stations.there is no dispute that the placement of the atm and the failure to construct a barrier were intentional decisions made by bppr or an architect or engineer,acting as its agent,as part of the design of the property.it is view these allegations as stating a claim based on premises liability,which would address the failure to remedy conditions that the property owner neither intended nor desired.
indeed,vázquez recognized that her claims hinged on bppr design of its atm and facility in her arguments at trial.her counsel closing argument included numerous statements indicative of a defective design claim,such as banco popular did get to be what it is today without planning and without foresight.consider,if you will,the planning and foresight that went into the design,the placement of the nine poles surrounding the tellers.or you heard garcia pacheco tell you how wide the sidewalk is in that picture,how wide the traffic lanes are.you remember he told you that there something called a turning radius and how the pavement at that spot is graded,it banked so that cars can flow naturally towards the exit,the banking effect,i think he called it.ladies and gentlemen,all of that means planning.somebody sat down and thought about using that,and about making it just that way and not some other way.or how foreseeable is it that a car can go out of control they call it an unexpected event that this happened on that day after so many years that the machine was in place we do know what happened other days.we know what happened this day,and that what we asking you to consider,what happened that day.there is no question about banco popular planning this area,designing this.in addition,vázquez also conceded in argument before us that her claims were based on bppr design of the property.when pressed,counsel agreed that the essential allegation of negligence was that bppr located and designed the atm facility in an unsafe and unreasonable way.therefore,we turn to the merits of bppr rule motion with the understanding that this is a negligent design case.
legal framework for negligent design claims 
there is no dispute in this case that vázquez suffered serious injuries the two disputed elements of her tort claim were breach of duty and proximate cause.see torres,d at enumerating three elements of a tort claim.bppr claims that she failed to show that the bank had a duty to design its property so as to prevent extraordinary accidents caused by customers,and hence she necessarily also failed to show that such a duty was breached by the actual design of the facility 
evidence of the standard of care in a negligent design case 
the vast majority of design defect cases from puerto rico involve products,rather than structures or buildings.the doctrine of strict liability applies to defective products,mendoza cervecería corona,but not to services such as construction or engineering,in re reinforced earth.while the instant case remains firmly within the scope of article of the civil code of puerto rico,meaning that liability is contingent on a showing of negligence,we draw on puerto rico law of products liability to understand how commonwealth courts would approach a negligent design claim such as this.
puerto rico has generally followed the example set by california for defective product design claims,toyota motor,finding that the puerto rico supreme court has repeatedly cited to and followed california decisions in products cases,allowing a plaintiff to prevail under either of two standards the product failed to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner,id.quoting barker lull eng g,cal d,or the product design proximately caused the plaintiff injury and the defendant fails to prove,in light of the relevant factors,that on balance the benefits of the challenged design outweigh the risk of danger,inherent in such design,id.omission in original.these two alternative approaches to a product design case are referred to as the two prongs of the barker test.under either prong,expert testimony is necessary to define the standard of care whenever the design of the relevant product is beyond the experience or knowledge of an average lay person.puerto rico courts,and federal courts applying commonwealth law,have applied this rule in a number of product design defect cases.
for example,in a series of cases against cigarette manufacturers,in which plaintiffs claimed that cigarettes were defectively designed,the claims were dismissed because plaintiffs could not carry their burden of proof without expert testimony.see philip morris,no.civ,wl,at,plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing the applicable standard of care and proving that defendant acted below that standard.plaintiffs have not named an expert on cigarette design who could testify that defendant was negligent in the design of its cigarettes nor have they identified what was the standard of care to which the defendant failed to conform plaintiffs having failed to present materials of evidentiary quality to demonstrate that the defendant cigarettes were defective ly designed,their claim for damages on this theory fails.internal citations and footnotes omitted prado alvarez,d at holding that summary judgment was appropriate where plaintiffs have not named an expert on cigarette design who could testify that defendant was negligent in the design of its cigarettes,because plaintiffs in a negligent design case bear the burden of establishing the applicable standard of care,and proving that defendants acted below that standard cruz vargas reynolds tobacco,d,aff,cir same.
although there have been only a handful of reported negligent design cases in puerto rico outside the products context,it appears that commonwealth courts would impose the same requirement for specific evidence,usually in the form of expert testimony,of an objective standard of care and breach thereof to cases involving structures or buildings.for example,in perez.at,parents of a minor child filed suit after the child fell from the balcony of a public housing project,alleging,inter alia,that the design of the balcony was defective because it was too low and should have had a higher handrail.the case was dismissed because the plaintiffs failed to present evidence of an objective standard against which the court could measure the accuracy of plaintiff contention.id.specifically,the court pointed to plaintiff failure to identify any statutes or ordinances that could bolster the claim of an unreasonable or unsafe design.id.
foreseeability 
the particular design defect alleged in this case is the failure to design in anticipation of driver error at the bank.in other words,vázquez alleged that bppr had a duty to foresee that some customers using its facilities would drive in a negligent,or even grossly negligent,manner.in,the district court of puerto rico held that foreseeability,as an element of proximate cause,could not be established through the simple fact that an accident occurred.in that case,a hotel guest sued the hotel after she was bitten by a rabid mongoose while laying near the hotel pool.id.at.the plaintiff alleged that the hotel could,and should,have foreseen an attack by a wild animal,even if not specifically an attack by a mongoose,because of the hotel proximity to a wooded,undeveloped area.she further claimed that the hotel placement of a food storage cart in the pool area and the commencement of nearby construction work,which might disturb the wildlife living in the wooded area,ought to have put the hotel on notice as to the need to protect guests from wild animals.id.at.rejecting these arguments,the court emphasized the critical nature of the foreseeability inquiry,noting that t he norm of foreseeability is that the risk that must be foreseen must be based on probabilities and not on mere possibilities.id.at alteration in original quoting brau,los daños v perjuicios extracontractuales en puerto rico ed.based on this principle,the court granted summary judgment for the hotel defendants,because the plaintiff failed to provide evidence of foreseeability.the court stated that the primary method for such proof would be prior similar incidents,but that some other sort of evidence tending to show that the incident was foreseeable would also have been acceptable.id.at.in the absence of any such proof,the mere fact that the accident occurred could not serve as evidence that it was foreseeable ex ante.id.
we affirmed the district court decision,hyatt hotels of,cir,and reiterated the centrality of foreseeability to a successful tort claim.id.at the requirements for a tort claim can not be satisfied unless the plaintiff proves,inter alia,that the injury was reasonably foreseeable and,thus,could have been avoided had the defendant acted with due care.we concluded that the district court got it right.id.at.in the absence of any evidence showing that the accident was foreseeable,the plaintiff could not prevail.id.
discerning puerto rico law 
from these cases discussing puerto rico law on the evidence of the standard of care and foreseeability,we distill these principles 
in a defective or negligent design case,where the design is beyond the common experience or knowledge of an average lay person,the plaintiff must present evidence,usually through an expert witness,as to the relevant standard of care for the design and the w
