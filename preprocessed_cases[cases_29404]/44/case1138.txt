opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on appeal from the district court march,order implementing a comprehensive opinion granting motions that certain defendants,now the appellees in this appeal,brought seeking summary judgment.see lomando united states,wl.appellant ines lomando lomando,as administratrix ad prosequendum of the estate of her daughter,laura lomando laura,brought this medical malpractice and wrongful death action against parties involved in laura health care that culminated in her death on september.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings with respect to one defendant.
ii.factual and procedural history 
on august,august,september,and september,laura sought and received treatment at the parker family health center parker health,a free new jersey nonprofit health clinic,for an area of swelling on the left side of her neck.three volunteer physicians at parker health,zaven ayanian,lynn helmer,and timothy sullivan,none of whom has been a party in this case,cared for laura during these visits.effective in january,and during all periods that laura received treatment from parker health,the united states department of health and human services deemed those physicians to be public health service phs employees pursuant to a provision of the public health service act phsa,as amended,o.by virtue of that designation,the physicians fell within the scope of the federal tort claims act ftca,which precluded a suit against them individually for their services at parker health and substituted a suit against the united states as the exclusive remedy for their alleged malpractice.
in september,laura also sought treatment for her swollen neck and other symptoms at the riverview medical center emergency room department,a facility where the physicians did not enjoy the phsa and ftca protections from litigation shielding the parker health physicians.specifically,laura visited riverview on september,and,where theresa biedenbach,a physician assistant,and stephanie reynolds,trevor talbert,and david hyppolite evaluated her.laura september visit to riverview would be her last,for the next day she died of spontaneous tumor lysis syndrome caused by an underlying condition of lymphoma.
lomando filed suit under the ftca and new jersey law in the district court on august,and filed an amended complaint on september,she named the following defendants in the action the united states,parker health,riverview medical center,reynolds,talbert,and hyppolite,and emergency physician associates of north jersey,emergency physician associates,the employer of the three individual defendants and biedenbach.lomando,however,did not include biedenbach as a defendant,an omission that,as we shall see,had significant consequences in this litigation.
on february,the district court granted parker health unopposed motion for summary judgment predicated on its claim of immunity under the new jersey charitable immunity act,which we discuss at length below.inasmuch as lomando is not challenging this disposition parker health is not participating in this appeal.on march,the district court granted summary judgment to all remaining defendants except hyppolite who did not seek summary judgment,but in the exercise of its discretion the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims against him and therefore the action was terminated in the district court 
the district court had different reasons for granting the contested motions for summary judgment to different defendants.the court granted summary judgment to riverview medical center because lomando failed to provide expert testimony against riverview as required to establish a prima facie case of liability for medical malpractice under new jersey law.we,however,are not concerned with this disposition as lomando does not challenge it on this appeal.thus,riverview,like parker health,is not participating in this appeal.
the district court addressed two distinct but related questions in dealing with lomando ftca claim against the united states.the united states contended that because a provision of the ftca,provides that the united states shall be entitled to assert any defense based upon judicial or legislative immunity which otherwise would have been available to the employee of the united states whose act or omission gave rise to the claim,the united states was entitled to claim any immunity available to the volunteer physicians of parker health.in support of this claim of immunity,the united states invoked the volunteer protection act of vpa,a,which immunizes volunteers of nonprofit organizations and governmental entities from claims alleging negligence based on acts committed within the scope of such volunteerism,and the new jersey charitable immunity act njcia,stat.ann.a west,which immunizes charitable nonprofit entities and their volunteers from liability for negligence in similar circumstances.lomando countered that did not permit the united states to rely on immunities available to the volunteer physicians at parker health because under the ftca the u nited states stands in the shoes of the nonprofit health center and may assert only those immunities available to such centers under federal and state law.lomando,wl,at.
the parties contentions thus raised the independent but intertwined questions of first,whether under the ftca the united states assumes the role of a private employer or stands in the shoes of the immunized employee,and,second,whether under the ftca the united states can assert its employees immunities and defenses.the district court dealt with these questions first by citing variant case law that illustrated that the united states has been equated to both a private employer and an immunized employee in ftca cases.shifting its analysis,the court then examined section,and stated that the text strongly suggests that it permits the united states to assert immunities available to its employees.id.at.ultimately,however,the court did not rule on either issue,but,instead,held that under the njcia both parker health,as a nonprofit health center,and ayanian,helmer,and sullivan,as volunteer physicians at parker health,are immune from suit accordingly,the court concluded that pursuant to section the united states is entitled to the immunity from suit that the njcia granted,regardless of whether it derived that immunity from the immunity of parker health or the individual physicians 
the district court held that reynolds and talbert,physicians who evaluated laura at riverview,were entitled to summary judgment because lomando experts qualifications failed to meet the requirements of stat.ann.a west with respect to witnesses in medical malpractice actions.that statute ordinarily requires that in cases alleging medical malpractice by a health practitioner in a specialty where the care at issue involved that specialty,a plaintiff must offer expert testimony from a practitioner in that same specialty.in this regard,the court held that because reynolds and talbert are specialists in emergency medicine,a specialty that the american board of medical specialties recognizes,and laura care involved emergency medicine,lomando was required to produce expert testimony from specialists in emergency medicine.thus,statements that lomando experts,mark fialk and james hayes,neither of whom is an emergency medicine specialist,submitted were insufficient to satisfy stat.ann.a.
finally,the court concluded that emergency physician associates was entitled to summary judgment because lomando had not produced any expert statements alleging that it had deviated from the applicable standard of care,apart from the testimony against reynolds and talbert that the court had rejected in granting emergency physician associates summary judgment,the court declined to consider statements that lomando experts submitted alleging deviations from the applicable standard of care by emergency physician associates employee,biedenbach,because lomando ha d not named biedenbach as a defendant.lomando,wl,at.
lomando asserts that the district court erred in holding that the united states is immune from suit under the njcia,as she contends that the physicians at parker health were not volunteers for purposes of the njcia because they were employees of the public health service and the decision permitting the united states to avail itself of the njcia immunity conflicted with the scheme that the ftca envisioned and thus created a conflict between state and federal law.lomando also argues that the court erred in its conclusion that stat.ann.a applies to the present case,and contends that reynolds and talbert provided care that did not involve the practice of emergency medicine.alternatively,lomando asserts that even if that statute applies,fialk qualifications were sufficient for him to give expert testimony in this case.finally,lomando challenges the court decision not to consider treatment that biedenbach provided to laura in support of lomando claims against emergency physician associates.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction over lomando ftca claims pursuant to b,and over her state law claims pursuant to a.we have jurisdiction under.
we exercise plenary review over the order granting appellees summary judgment,applying the same standard that the district court applied.see knopick connelly,cir azur chase bank,usa,ass n,cir.in this plenary review,we can affirm the summary judgment only if there wa s no genuine issue as to any material fact and the prevailing defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a see also melrose,city of pittsburgh,cir.a genuine dispute is one that may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.anderson liberty lobby,d.a material fact is one that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.id.at.at.we must view the record in the light most favorable to lomando as the party,and we must draw all reasonable inferences that the record supports in her favor.see kaucher cnty.of bucks,cir.to the extent that the district court opinion contains conclusions of law,our review is de novo.see azur,at.
iv.discussion and analysis 
whether the district court erred as a matter of law in determining that the united states is immune from suit under the njcia,stat.ann.a a,and a the role of the united states under the ftca and o 
under c a,the government may make grants to public and nonprofit private entities for projects to plan and develop health centers which will serve medically underserved populations.as the court described in wilson big sandy health care,cir,i n part due to the relatively high cost of obtaining malpractice insurance for treatment of patients the efforts to provide necessary medical care in underserved areas initially faced significant roadblocks.in response,congress passed the federally supported health centers assistance act of act,stat.codified as amended at.
the act created a process by which public and nonprofit private entities receiving federal funds pursuant to c a and health practitioners that such entities employ shall be deemed to be employees of the public health service.g a.this treatment of health care centers receiving section funding and practitioners at them is highly significant,for an action against the united states under the ftca is the exclusive remedy for persons alleging personal injury,including death,resulting from the performance of medical or related functions by public health service employees acting within the scope of their employment.a see also g a reiterating subsection a exclusivity clause.
in in an effort to expand access to health care services to individuals in medically underserved areas,at,reprinted in,congress conferred the same deemed employee status and attendant ftca coverage on a second and distinct category of persons health practitioners who volunteer at free clinics.see health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa,stat,codified as amended at o.congress did not condition the award of this immunity on the government making grants to the clinics.under the hipaa,volunteer health practitioners who at free clinics provide a qualifying health service shall in providing services for the free clinic,be deemed to be employees of the public health service.o the hipaa likewise made explicit that an ftca action against the united states is the sole remedy through which medical malpractice and similar claims may be brought on account of the services of such volunteers.see o.in this case,the physicians who treated laura at parker health were deemed employees of the public health service pursuant to o because parker health is a free clinic and the physicians there provided their services as volunteers see app.at letter from department of health and human services to volunteers in health,deeming parker health physicians employees of phs pursuant to o.
subject to exceptions not at issue in this case,the ftca waives the sovereign immunity of the united states in its district courts for tort claims caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,under circumstances in which the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.b.section contains two basic principles that govern ftca claims.
first,the ftca does not itself create a substantive cause of action against the united states rather,it provides a mechanism for bringing a state law tort action against the federal government in federal court.in re orthopedic bone screw prod.liab,cir see also cna united states,cir the cause of action in an ftca claim must come from state tort law.accordingly,the extent of the united states liability under the ftca is generally determined by reference to state law.in re orthopedic,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also santos ex rel.beato united states,cir noting that substantively the ftca follows state liability law.the parties agree that because laura treatment and death were in new jersey,the law of that state is applicable here.
second,the united states is liable only to the extent that in the same circumstances the applicable local law would hold a private person responsible.b.congress reiterated that precept in,which provides that the united states is answerable under the ftca in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.see also united states olson,d our cases have consistently adhered to this private person standard.the ftca provision that the united states shall be liable to the same extent as a private person or private individual does not specify whether the united states is liable to the extent that a private employer would be liable or to the extent its employee if not an employee of the federal government would be liable.seemingly,this omission has engendered the variant case law that the district court cited.
we addressed this distinction between employer and employee in mcswain united states,cir,in which we clarified that the united states occupies the role of a private employer under the ftca 
under the federal tort claims act,b,the united states is liable for injury caused by the negligent act of a government employee to the same extent a private employer would be liable.such liability for the acts or omissions of a civilian or military federal employee is determined by the law of respondeat superior of the state in which the act or omission occurred.
citing williams united states.see also matsko united states,cir distinguishing plaintiff claim that united states failed to protect him from an intentional tort by a government employee from traditional ftca respondeat superior claim for the government employee actions 
the supreme court likewise has described the united states role under the ftca as equivalent to that of an employer answering under respondeat superior liability.in gutierrez de martinez lamagno,d,the court observed that where the united states certifies in response to an ftca claim that an employee was acting within the scope of his employment with respect to his actions concerning the claim,the united states,by certifying,is exposing itself to liability as would any other employer at common law who admits that an employee acted within the scope of his employment.citing restatement second of agency emphasis added lamagno,at.at generally,ftca cases unfold much as cases do against other employers who concede respondeat superior liability.see also laird nelms,d congress intended to permit liability essentially based on the intentionally wrongful or careless conduct of government employees,for which the government was to be made liable according to state law under the doctrine of respondeat superior.
looking to the text of the ftca,we note that the act shadows precisely the common law of respondeat superior liability,providing that the united states is subject to suit for the negligent acts of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.b emphasis added see speiser,krause,gans,the american law of torts,i t is hornbook law that the doctrine of respondeat superior renders an employer or master vicariously liable for a tort committed by his employee or servant while acting within the scope of employment.restatement third of agency an employer is subject to liability for torts committed by employees acting within the scope of their employment.thus,the plain language of the ftca,which treats the united states as liable for the tortious actions of its employees,creates a remedial scheme under which the united states would be liable as an employer in like circumstances.see also note the united states,through the federal tort claims act,is responsible to injured persons for the common law torts of its employees in the same manner in which the common law historically has recognized the responsibility of an employer for torts committed by its employees within the scope of their employment.emphasis added.
in sum,the ftca provides that the united states will be liable to the extent that a private employer would be liable in similar circumstances in the same locality.in this case,then,the united states stands in the shoes that a private employer of the physicians,a free health center,would stand and answers for the allegedly tortious conduct of the united states deemed employees,the volunteer physicians at that health center we turn now to the question of what defenses the united states may invoke in that position.
b the defenses of the united states under the ftca 
in,congress clarified the terms of the united states waiver of sovereign immunity under the ftca through the federal employees liability reform and tort compensation act of westfall act,stat.codified as amended at scattered portions of the united states code.the westfall act provided for absolute immunity to federal employees in the wake of westfall erwin,d,by making suit against the united states under the ftca the exclusive remedy for negligent or wrongful acts by federal employees committed within the scope of employment as significant to this case,the westfall act also added the following provision to the ftca 
with respect to any claim under the ftca,the united states shall be entitled to assert any defense based upon judicial or legislative immunity which otherwise would have been available to the employee of the united states whose act or omission gave rise to the claim,as well as any other defenses to which the united states is entitled.
the text of section is straightforward,and its import clear.see united states gregg,cir if the language of the statute expresses congress intent with sufficient precision,the inquiry ends there and the statute is enforced according to its terms.the united states as the employer may assert any defense rooted in judicial or legislative immunity which would have been available to its employee had he not been a deemed employee of the phs and,instead,had been a defendant in the action at hand.in this case,section thus allows the united states to avail itself of any judicially or immunity to which the individual physicians its employees for purposes of the ftca would have been entitled if they were the defendants.this provision for immunity is superimposed on congress intent in enacting the ftca to position the united states for liability purposes in the position of a private employer.
it is important to note that section does not state exhaustively those defenses to which the united states is entitled rather,it reserves explicitly the united states right to assert any other defenses to which it is entitled.the other defenses to which the united states is entitled include not only those defenses the united states may invoke independently,but also any defenses available to a private employer answering for the alleged torts of its employee.in this vein,congress clarified in the report accompanying the westfall act that the specific designation of these immunities does not imply that traditional common law defenses are not available o rdinary tort defenses,such as contributory negligence,assumption of risk,estoppel,waiver,and res judicata,as applicable,continue to be available to the united states,at,reprinted in,see also,at,at would authorize the united states to utilize all of the defenses to which it is independently entitled.defenses available to a employer may be rooted in the common law,or they may be created statutorily,as in the case of the immunity conferred on charitable nonprofit entities and their volunteers under the njcia.of course,the actual availability,vel non,of these defenses generally will depend on the law of the state in which the allegedly wrongful act occurred because the applicable state law defines the scope of the united states liability under the ftca.see,rodriquez united states,cir new jersey law on comparative negligence established extent to which recovery by plaintiffs against united states could be limited in ftca case.
having determined the scope of the defenses available to the united states in an action under the ftca,we decide now whether the njcia provides an immunity defense in this case.the njcia,stat.ann.a,confers immunity on nonprofit entities organized for a charitable purpose as well as on the volunteers of those entities.the act reads,in pertinent part 
no nonprofit corporation,society or association organized exclusively for charitable purposes or its volunteers shall be liable to respond in damages to any person who shall suffer damage from the negligence of any agent or servant of such corporation where such person is a beneficiary,to whatever degree,of the works of such nonprofit corporation 
stat.a a.a further provision of the njcia provides similarly that no person who provides volunteer service or assistance for any nonprofit corporation shall be liable in any action for damages as a result of his acts of commission or omission arising out of and in the course of his rendering the volunteer service or assistance.stat.a b 
lomando concedes that if the volunteer physicians were not deemed federal employees and if they were named defendants in a state court action for the injuries involved in this case they would be immune from liability under the njcia.appellant br.at nevertheless,lomando contends that once the volunteer physicians are deemed federal employees,they should no longer be viewed as volunteers.id.at.lomando bases this argument on the theory that the definition of an employee is directly contrary to that of a volunteer,with the former expecting some form of compensation and the latter rendering his or her services without such an expectation.id.lomando asserts,as well,that a decision applying the statutory immunity derived from the njcia in this case would contravene the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,const.art.vi cl,because the njcia provides an immunity defense that is inconsistent with the remedial scheme of recovery in and the ftca.id.at.we find both of these contentions unpersuasive.
lomando fundamentally misapplies the effect of the physicians deemed employee designation.under o,a volunteer physician is deemed to be an employee of the public health service but only f or purposes of.section does not provide for remuneration for employees of the phs rather,that section addresses only c ivil actions or proceedings against commissioned officers or employees of the phs,and provides that an action under the ftca is the exclusive basis for such suits.see a.accordingly,persons deemed to be employees of the phs under o are not federal employees receiving compensation for their work by the federal government to the end that they are no longer rendering their services as volunteers at a free clinic.to the contrary,the employee designation is a legal construct effective only for the purposes of section.in addressing the status of health care practitioners at clinics receiving section funding who similarly are deemed phs employees,we have noted that h ealth care workers at private clinics,even ones receiving some federal aid,are not federal employees in the usual sense.after all,they do not perform a traditional government function or work in a government building,and they are not on the federal payroll.santos,at quoting santos ex rel.beato united states,d,internal quotation marks omitted 
lomando contention that the supremacy clause abrogates the njcia in the context of this case likewise fails.the supremacy clause invalidates state law that interferes with or is contrary to federal law.free bland,d citing gibbons ogden,wheat.federal law can supersede state law in three ways express preemption,field preemption,and conflict preemption.farina nokia,cir citing hillsborough cnty.automated med,d.lomando bases her supremacy clause argument on conflict preemption,which nullifies state law inasmuch as it conflicts with federal law,either where compliance with both laws is impossible or where state law erects an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.farina,at quoting hillsborough,at.at.lomando urges that under a congress intended to provide a means of financial recovery for tort victims injured by volunteer physicians and r ecoveries that are allowed under s ection a should not be immunized by state law,because that immunization leaves victims without a remedy.appellant br.at.
it is true that congress has waived the sovereign immunity of the united states for tort actions against volunteer physicians deemed federal employees under o,and thereby has provided that a claim against the united states under the ftca is an injured party exclusive remedy in such circumstances.however,which permits the united states to invoke the defense provided by the njcia,circumscribes that waiver.see united states jicarilla apache nation,d the government consents to be liable to private parties and may yield this consent upon such terms and under such restrictions as it may think just.quoting murray lessee hoboken land improvement,how.section clearly expresses congress objectives in this regard,and that intent is made all the more forceful by the legislative history surrounding the enactment of o.in addressing subsection o,congress stated 
the committee is aware that each of the states have passed laws to limit the liability of volunteers in a variety of circumstances.this provision does not preempt those laws beyond the preemption provided in the federal tort claims act.instead,the united states shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual in the same circumstances under state law.
at,at emphasis added.
application of the njcia coupled with the exclusive force of the ftca preclude lomando from making a recovery from the united states predicated on the alleged malpractice of the parker health volunteer physicians.contrary to lomando contentions,however,this outcome is not at all inconsistent with congress objectives.see,at,at the exclusive remedy provision of the ftca is intended to substitute the united states as the solely permissible defendant therefore,suits against federal employees are precluded even where the united states has a defense which prevents an actual recovery.emphasis added see also united states smith,d congress recognized that the required substitution of the united states as the defendant in tort suits filed against government employees would sometimes foreclose a tort plaintiff recovery altogether.accordingly,in upholding the district court decision applying the njcia to bar this action against the united states,we are not making a ruling in any way contrary to the terms or intent of o or the ftca.therefore,the supremacy clause does not bar the result we reach in this case.
in summary,we hold that the district court did not err in holding that the united states was immune from this suit.the united states is entitled to the protection of the immunity the njcia provides because a private employer would be entitled to that defense and the united states deemed employees in this case,the individual physicians,would be entitled to that defense as well 
whether the district court erred in deciding that the treatment provided to laura by reynolds and talbert constituted emergency medicine such that stat.ann.a applies if the court did not so err,did one of lomando experts,fialk,satisfy stat.ann.a 
to state a prima facie case of medical malpractice in new jersey,ordinarily a plaintiff must present expert testimony establishing the applicable standard of care a deviation from that standard of care and that the deviation proximately caused the injury.gardner pawliw,citations omitted.as part of an effort at comprehensive tort reform and to counter a severe increase in medical malpractice liability insurance premiums,in the new jersey legislature enacted the new jersey medical care access and responsibility and patients first act access and responsibility act,stat.ann.a to west.among other things,the access and responsibility act provides more detailed standards for a testifying expert,generally requiring the challenging expert to be to the defendant.ryan renny,
the legislature set forth these standards in stat.ann.a,which provides,in relevant part 
in an action alleging medical malpractice,a person shall not give expert testimony on the appropriate standard of practice or care unless the person is licensed as a physician or other health care professional in the united states and meets the following criteria 
a if the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered is a specialist or subspecialist recognized by the american board of medical specialties abms or the american osteopathic association aoa and the care or treatment at issue involves that specialty or subspecialty recognized by the abms or aoa,the person providing the testimony shall have specialized at the time of the occurrence that is the basis for the action in the same specialty or subspecialty,recognized by the abms or the aoa,as the party against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is offered,and if the person against whom or on whose behalf the testimony is being offered is board certified and the care or treatment at issue involves that board specialty or subspecialty recognized by the abms or the aoa,the expert witness shall be 
a physician credentialed by a hospital to treat patients for the medical condition,or to perform the procedure,that is the basis for the claim or action or 
a specialist or subspecialist recognized by the abms or the aoa who is board certified in the same specialty or subspecialty recognized by the abms or the aoa,and during the year immediately preceding the date of the occurrence that is the basis for the claim or action,shall have devoted a majority of his professional time to either 
a the active clinical practice of the same health care profession in which the defendant is licensed,and if the defendant is a specialist or subspecialist recognized by the abms or the aoa,the active clinical practice of that specialty or subspecialty recognized by the abms or the aoa or 
b the instruction of students in an accredited medical school,accredited health professional school,accredited residency program or research program in the same health care profession in which the defendant is licensed,and,if that party is a specialist or subspecialist recognized by the abms or the aoa one of the aforementioned programs in the same specialty or subspecialty recognized by the abms or the aoa or 
stat.ann.a b also governs the scenario in which the defendant provider is a general practitioner.thus,t he statute sets forth three distinct categories embodying this rule those who are specialists in a field recognized by the abms or aoa but who are not board certified in that specialty those who are specialists in a field recognized by the abms or aoa and who are board certified in that specialty and those who are general practitioners.buck henry.
reynolds and talbert are specialists in emergency medicine,a specialty that the abms and the aoa recognize lomando submitted statements by two experts,fialk and hayes,neither of whom is a specialist in the field of emergency medicine,in the district court.lomando contended,however,that stat.ann.a did not apply to her claims against reynolds and talbert because they provided care that did not involve their specialty of emergency medicine.the court rejected this argument,finding that they rendered care on september,and that constituted the practice of emergency medicine,as the abms and american board of emergency medicine abem define that field lomando contends that the court erred in making this finding,and argues that the physicians treatment of laura on september and involved the general skill and knowledge of a physician and did not require the specialized training of an emergency department physician.appellant br.at 
lomando now raises an additional argument that she did not present squarely to the district court.lomando contends that because fialk is board certified in oncology and has hospital appointments to treat patients with cancer and because the basis for lomando claim is the failure to diagnose lymphoma,fialk qualifications satisfy stat.ann.a a.appellant br.at.we address these arguments in turn 
a the care provided by reynolds and talbert involved emergency medicine.
the abms defines the specialty of emergency medicine as 
the immediate decision making and action necessary to prevent death or any further disability in both the setting by directing emergency medical technicians and in the emergency department.this special ty involves immediate recognition,evaluation,care,stabilization and disposition of a generally diversified population of adult and pediatric patients in response to acute illness and injury.
lomando,wl,at see also buck,at referencing the abms definition of emergency medicine.the abem describes the practice of emergency medicine as begin ning with the recognition of patterns in the patient presentation that points to a specific diagnosis or diagnoses.pattern recognition is both the hallmark and cornerstone of the clinical practice of emergency medicine,guiding the diagnostic tests and therapeutic interventions during the entire patient encounter.lomando,wl,at emphasis in original deleted bearing in mind these definitions of emergency medicine,we agree with the district court that reynolds and talbert provided laura with care involving the practice of emergency medicine.
on september,laura arrived at riverview medical center emergency department complaining of the acute symptoms of chest pain and tightness,nausea,diarrhea,and shortness of breath.in response,reynolds examined laura,ordered that she be given medication intravenously for her chest tightness,and instructed her to stop taking certain medication,the consumption of which coincided with the advent of laura chest tightness,nausea,and diarrhea.during the examination,reynolds became aware that laura left lymph node was swollen.once laura nausea and chest pain improved,she was discharged from the hospital with a working diagnosis of reaction to medication,muscle strain,and a swollen salivary duct.in line with the abms definition of emergency medicine,laura symptoms on this visit were largely acute,and reynolds engaged in the task of evaluation and stabilization of laura in response to those symptoms.
on september,laura presented to riverview emergency department with a history of epstein barr syndrome,a fever,and showing signs of dehydration.laura incoming patient report notified riverview that she was suspicious for meningitis,had neck pain,and an enlarged lymph node on the left side of her neck.upon examination,talbert observed that laura had left anterior adenopathy.talbert ordered that fluids and medication be given to laura to treat her dehydration and fever,and ordered that she be given a mononucleosis test.once laura fever decreased and she was in stable condition,she was discharged from the hospital.again,consistently with the abms definition of emergency medicine,talbert engaged in the immediate decision making and action necessary to care for and ultimately stabiliz e laura.further,based on laura pattern of symptoms at that visit,talbert ordered the diagnostic test for mononucleosis.
though we do not hold that treatment provided in an emergency room necessarily involves the practice of emergency medicine,the care that reynolds and talbert provided was emergency medicine and falls within the practice of emergency care as the applicable certifying bodies define that field.accordingly,the district court correctly concluded that stat.ann.a a applied.
b fialk qualifications do not satisfy stat.ann.a a.
we turn now to lomando contention,that even if stat.ann.a a applies,fialk qualifications meet the requirements of stat.ann.a a.as stated,reynolds and talbert are specialists in emergency medicine thus,lomando was required to provide testimony prepared by experts who met the requirements imposed on experts who testify against specialists.there is a question,however,as to what those requirements may be.in lomando view,an expert offering testimony against a specialist need not share that specialty,but rather the expert only must satisfy the hospital appointment mandate of stat.ann.a a or the board certification plus clinical or instructional experience requirements of stat.ann.a a.in this regard,lomando contends that because fialk has hospital appointments to treat patients with cancer,appellant br.at,his qualifications satisfy the mandates of stat.ann.a a.
the supreme court of new jersey has observed that stat.ann.a is far from a model of clarity.buck,at.in ryan,however,that court had provided its interpretation of the statute,describing it thusly 
w here the defendant is a specialist or subspecialist,the person providing the testimony against him shall have specialized at the time of the occurrence that is the basis for the action in the same specialty or subspecialty.stat.ann.a a.further,where the defendant is board certified,the witness against him must also be board certified in the same specialty or subspecialty,here,the court inserted the following footnote alternatively,the witness shall be a physician credentialed by a hospital to treat the condition or perform the procedure that is the basis of the claim.stat.ann.a a,and during the year immediately preceding the date of the occurrence that is the basis of the claim or action,shall have devoted a majority of his professional time to active clinical practice or teaching of the specialty or subspecialty.stat.ann.a a.
at original emphasis omitted and current emphasis added see also buck,at labeling the requirements imposed by stat.ann.a a and a as additional qualifications an expert witness must meet beyond those delineated in stat.ann.a a new jersey state bar ass state,adopting the same formulation for stat.ann.a.thus,the supreme court of new jersey has construed stat.ann.a a to require that an expert offering testimony against a specialist share that specialty and meet the requirements of either stat.ann.a a or a.in this way,the court made clear that the hospital credential provision of stat.ann.a a is an alternative to the board certification plus teaching or clinical practice requirements of stat.ann.a a,but it is not an alternative to the specialization requirement of stat.ann.a a.
accordingly,fialk may not offer testimony against reynolds or talbert regarding the care provided by those physicians to laura because he is not a specialist in the field of emergency medicine.
whether the district court erred in refusing to consider the treatment biedenbach rendered for purposes of lomando claim against biedenbach employer,emergency physician associates if the court so erred,does stat.ann.a apply to testimony concerning biedenbach 
a lomando was not required to name biedenbach as a defendant.
the district court stated that it would not consider the treatment provided by biedenbach in connection with emergency physician associates summary judgment motion solely because lomando ha d not named biedenbach as a defendant.lomando,wl,at.lomando contends that the court refusal to consider treatment that biedenbach provided in support of lomando claim against her employer,emergency physician associates,was legal error,and we agree.
new jersey courts apply the common law principle of respondeat superior liability,and thus in that state an employer can be found liable for the negligence of an employee causing injuries to third parties,if,at the time of the occurrence,the employee was acting within the scope of his or her employment.carter reynolds,citing lehmann toys r us.new jersey law,however,does not include a requirement that a litigant include the allegedly negligent employee as a defendant in an action seeking to impose respondeat superior liability on an employer.see zukowitz halperin,the judge erred in dismissing plaintiff common law claim based upon vicarious liability for the negligence of defendant employees.see,printing mart morristown sharp elecs.whether the employees were named as defendants is legally irrelevant to defendant liability for their conduct under the doctrine of respondeat superior.see mcfadden turner.marion borough of manasquan,in cases not involving the tort claims act,stat.ann.west in which a plaintiff seeks recovery on the theory of respondeat superior,there is no requirement that the plaintiff join as a defendant the individual upon whose act or failure to act vicarious liability is predicated.indeed,the plaintiff has the option to sue the party vicariously liable for the conduct of an agent in one law suit and thereafter,pursue the agent in a separate suit.in such cases,the concept of mandatory joinder does not apply.citing mcfadden,at moss jones,we conclude that a person injured by the negligence of an agent or servant may sue the agent or servant and the principal or master in one suit,or may proceed against them in separate suits see also great northern ins.leontarakis,the rationale of the rule that plaintiff is entitled to pursue all those who are independently liable to him for his harm until one full satisfaction is obtained is equally applicable whether the liability is actual or vicarious.quoting mcfadden,at furthermore,i t is that federal rule of civil procedure does not require the joinder of joint tortfeasors n or does it require joinder of principal and agent.nottingham am.commc ns,cir per curiam citations omitted see also temple synthes,d it has long been the rule that it is not necessary for all joint tortfeasors to be named as defendants in a single lawsuit.
accordingly,we hold that the district court erred when it excluded from consideration the care that biedenbach provided in assessing lomando claim against emergency physician associates.the court was not precluded from taking into account biedenbach care in considering lomando claim against her employer notwithstanding biedenbach status.
b stat.ann.a does not apply to physician assistants.
we now reach the final issue in this appeal,which also relates to biedenbach whether stat.ann.a applies to expert testimony offered to evaluate the care she provided.lomando contends that stat.ann.a does not apply to,while appellee emergency physician associates asserts that the statute encompasses physician assistants.because the question of whether stat.ann.a applies to biedenbach is a potentially dispositive legal question in this case,we will address the matter.
to the best of our knowledge,the new jersey supreme court has yet to confront explicitly the question of whether stat.ann.a applies only to physicians,or whether its scope is broader in the absence of a controlling decision by the new jersey supreme court,we must predict how it would rule if faced with the issue.see spence esab,cir.in making this prediction,we look to decisions of state intermediate appellate courts,of federal courts interpreting that state law,and of other state supreme courts that have addressed the issue,as well as to analogous decisions,considered dicta,scholarly works,and any other reliable data tending convincingly to show how the highest court in the state would decide the issue at hand.id.at quoting norfolk ry.basell usa,cir.
of course,in interpreting a statute,we first examine its text as the supreme court of new jersey would do in any case of statutory interpretation diprospero penn,our analysis begins with the plain language of the statute.citing miah ahmed.if the language is plain and clearly reveals the statute meaning,the court sole function is to enforce the statute according to its terms.frugis bracigliano.if the statute suggests more than one interpretation,the broader legislative scheme,its history,and relevant sponsor statements may also inform the court interpretation in light of the statute overall policy and purpose.id.in interpreting a statute,the new jersey courts overriding goal must be to determine the legislature intent.frugis,at quoting cornblatt,barow,see also diprospero,at the legislature intent is the paramount goal when interpreting a statute.
stat.ann.a a applies to biedenbach only if she is a specialist or subspecialist recognized by the abms or the aoa and the care or treatment at issue involves that specialty or subspecialty recognized by the abms or aoa.stat.ann.a the abms is made up of member boards,including the abem,which are responsible for certify ing physicians.aspx.similarly,the aoa oversees specialty certifying boards,which certify doctors of osteopathic medicine.http.thus,it would seem that stat.ann.a a applies only to persons offering testimony against specialized or licensed physicians.in this vein,we reject emergency physician associates argument that stat.ann.a a applies because biedenbach practices in emergency rooms and because biedenbach care and treatment of laura involved the abms recognized specialty of emergency medicine.appellee br.at it may be that biedenbach practices emergency care as the general public understands that term,and it may be that the care she provided to laura involved that practice however,it can not be said that biedenbach is a specialist in emergency medicine as the abms or aoa define that field or that the treatment she rendered to laura involved that recognized specialty because those entities define and recognize specialties applicable only to physicians.
concededly,stat.ann.a includes some text in tension with our reading of the statute.paragraph a a provides that an expert must be engaged in the active clinical practice of the same health care profession in which the defendant is licensed,and paragraph a b provides similarly that the expert must have participated in the instruction of students in the same health care profession in which the defendant is licensed.emphasis added.this language,of course,gives rise to the inference that the statute encompasses more than one type of health care profession.nevertheless,these provisions apply only in the circumstance that the defendant is in a specialty that the abms or aoa recognizes,and as explained above,those entities recognize specialties only for physicians 
considering the text of the statute as a whole,we conclude that stat.ann.a a applies only to physicians.we note that this conclusion is in line with the new jersey legislature purpose in enacting the access and responsibility act.in new jersey state bar ass state,the superior court extensively recounted the legislative history of the access and responsibility act,and described the purpose thusly the overarching concern that came out of the hearings on the act and the problem the bill aimed to solve as noted in t
