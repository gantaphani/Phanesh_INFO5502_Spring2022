appellant schramm,contracted with shipco transport,to transport a mobile drilling rig from the port of baltimore,maryland,to the port of arica,chile.when the vessel carrying the rig stopped at an intermediate port in charleston,south carolina,the ship master ordered for security reasons that the rig be offloaded so that it could be restowed on a lower deck.while the rig was dockside during the course of restowage,it was severely damaged.the district court found that shipco was liable for the damage,but it limited appellants recovery to pursuant to the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa.see app.
we affirm.cogsa liability limitation continued to apply when the cargo was being restowed at charleston.even though the rig was damaged while on land,the restowage operation at the intermediate charleston port was a customary activity in the carriage of goods at sea and did not constitute a discharge from the vessel under cogsa.in addition,the parties bill of lading did not otherwise limit cogsa applicability.
in october,schramm sold a mobile drilling rig to perforaciones san rafael of cochabamba,bolivia.the drilling rig consisted of a large drill and the truck on which it was mounted.the total cost of the rig was,which included freight and insurance charges.
schramm arranged to have shipco transport the rig from the port of baltimore,maryland,to the port of arica,chile,via an vessel.shipco is a common carrier,which is a common carrier that does not operate the vessels by which the ocean transportation is provided,and is a shipper in its relationship with an ocean common carrier.app.b.thus,shipco never actually handles the cargo,but instead subcontracts with other parties to carry the cargo and deliver it to its destination.here,shipco contracted with the owner of the csav guayas to transport the rig from the united states to chile.
shipco issued a clean bill of lading to schramm to cover transport of the rig.the bill of lading designates schramm as the shipper and shipco as the carrier.in a paragraph entitled package or shipping unit limitation,the parties agreed that shipco liability was limited to per package wherever cogsa was applicable,unless a declared value has been noted by the parties.a space was provided on the front of the bill of lading for shippers declared value,where schramm was entitled to avoid cogsa liability limitation of and declare the value of its goods in order to receive greater protection.however,schramm left this space blank,and it obtained independent cargo insurance from appellant atlantic mutual insurance company.
the rig,secured on a flat rack container with a bottom and two sides,was loaded onto the vessel csav guayas in baltimore on october.while en route to chile,the vessel stopped at an intermediate port in charleston,south carolina.there,on october,the vessel operator ordered the rig offloaded so that it could be restowed on a lower deck of the vessel.the vessel master wanted the rig and one other container to be restowed under deck to avoid pilferage of the goods at subsequent ports and damage to them during the voyage.the master retained stevedoring services of america ssa to handle the offloading,transportation,storage,and reloading of the rig in charleston.ssa offloaded the rig,still attached to its flat rack container,and placed it on a chassis for transport.while it was being moved,the rig fell over onto the concrete dock and was damaged beyond repair.it was later declared a total loss by marine inspectors.
pursuant to its insurance obligations,atlantic mutual paid perforaciones san rafael the purchase price and related costs,on schramm behalf.then,on october,schramm and atlantic mutual filed suit against shipco,among other parties,to recover breach of contract damages from the destruction of the rig.they claimed losses in excess of,which represented the amount that atlantic mutual paid to perforaciones san rafael 
shipco filed for partial summary judgment,claiming that its liability was limited to either by cogsa or by the contractual bill of lading.at first,the district court denied shipco motion.it held that cogsa did not apply to the period of time during which the rig was the rig was being transported on land in charleston and was not hooked up to the vessel.moreover,the court held that the bill of lading did not extend cogsa beyond this limited period except where the goods were in the actual custody of shipco.
upon reflection,however,the district court granted shipco rule e motion for reconsideration and concluded that cogsa did indeed apply to the period of time during which the rig was destroyed.it held that the application of cogsa covers goods from the port of loading until the final port of destination,and that cogsa thus applies during restowage of cargo at intermediate ports regardless of whether damage occurs while goods are on land or aboard the vessel.moreover,the district court held that the bill of lading did not limit cogsa application.the court thus granted appellants motion for summary judgment against shipco on the question of liability and granted shipco motion to limit its liability to.appellants now challenge the district court decision to limit shipco liability under cogsa 
cogsa governs every bill of lading which is evidence of a contract for the carriage of goods by sea to or from ports of the united states and in foreign trade.app.and the statute provides a default limitation of liability for carriers 
neither the carrier nor the ship shall in any event be or become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with the transportation of goods in an amount exceeding per package unless the nature and value of such goods have been declared by the shipper before shipment and inserted in the bill of lading.
id.here,there is no question that schramm left blank the space in the bill of lading for declaring a higher value on its goods.it thus accepted cogsa limitation of liability,which was incorporated into the bill of lading,and chose to obtain independent cargo insurance from atlantic mutual.consequently,if we find that cogsa applied at the time the rig was damaged,then shipco liability is properly limited to under.
by its terms,cogsa covers the period from the time when the goods are loaded on to the time when they are discharged from the ship.id.e.this period has been referred to as tackle to tackle.see,mannesman demag concert express,cir elliott can.john clark son of.the basic question,then,is whether the drilling rig was discharged from the vessel,within the meaning of the term in cogsa,at the time it was damaged.appellants contend that the rig was in fact discharged because it was damaged not on the vessel,but on land.however,this does not automatically mean that cogsa provisions are inapplicable.when the rig was damaged,it was not unloaded onto the dock at its final port of destination.rather,for security reasons it was being temporarily offloaded from the vessel and transported dockside by a stevedore at an intermediate port of call in charleston.the sole purpose for the temporary offloading of the rig onto the dock was to restow it below deck.appellants have pointed us to no decisions that have found such restowage operations at intermediate ports to fall outside the scope of cogsa.
the statutory text does not permit the view that restowage of the rig constituted a discharge under cogsa.cogsa does not itself define the term discharge.when viewing the statute as a whole,however,it is clear that goods are not discharged from a vessel under cogsa until they are released from the ship at the final port of destination,and thus that the restowage of goods at an intermediate port does not constitute a discharge.for example,cogsa provides that a carrier must properly and carefully load,handle,stow,carry,keep,care for,and discharge the goods carried.app.see also id.extending a carrier responsibilities,as well as its rights and immunities,to the loading,handling,stowage,carriage,custody,care,and discharge of goods.this sweeping statement of a carrier duties when transporting goods by sea easily includes the restowage of goods at an intermediate port.for one thing,its specifies
