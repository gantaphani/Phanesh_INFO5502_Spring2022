this is an appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss on the basis of qualified immunity.
ricardo rios ii rios,joined by his wife and minor children,filed this suit in november against the city of del rio,texas,its chief of police manuel herrera herrera,and its police officer wesley wilson wilson,seeking to recover,under and state law,damages for personal injuries sustained when,on the evening of june,rios,then on duty as a customs enforcement officer at the del rio port of entry,was struck by a city police department vehicle being driven by an escaping city prisoner,reymundo avalos avalos.the defendants jointly answered and filed a rule b motion to dismiss,wilson and herrera claiming qualified immunity.following denial of the motion in july,wilson and herrera timely brought this interlocutory appeal under mitchell forsyth,d 
the complaint asserts that rios was subjected to negligence,injury,gross misconduct and damages from the deadly use of force in violation of rights guaranteed to him by the fourth and fourteenth amendments.it alleges that at all relevant times wilson and herrera were,respectively,city of laredo police officer and chief of police,acting within the course and scope of their employment,the heading facts the following 
on june,rios was years old and he was as a customs enforcement officer at the del rio port of entry along the united states border with acuna,mexico when he was struck and severely injured by a city police department patrol unit driven by an escaping prisoner,reymundo avalos.
customs officers at the del rio port of entry,including rios,were responding to the city police department request for assistance in intercepting a car chase which commenced at holt street.
reymundo avalos was an adult person who had a criminal history in the city including a penchant or tendency to escape police custody which was well known to the police officers of the city police department,and he was known by the nickname around the city police department as houdini.
on the evening of june,reymundo avalos,had been placed under arrest by officer wesley wilson.
officer wilson improperly left the prisoner reymundo avalos in the backseat of his patrol vehicle while the keys were in the ignition and the engine running while he visited with a person who lived in the neighborhood.
avalos escaped from confinement in the rear sat,commandeered the patrol car,and sped away.
the city police department issued an all points alert on the escaping prisoner,reymundo avalos,and proceeded to channel reymundo avalos towards the international bridge.
the city police department did not clearly inform the del rio port of entry customs officers that the vehicle being driven by reymundo avalos was an official marked patrol car of the city police department.
del rio police department officers pursued the patrol car being driven by reymundo avalos and had opportunities to divert or disable that vehicle,but failed to do so.
as the stolen vehicle driven by reymundo avalos approached the open lane,the vehicle violently struck rios.
rios sustained devastating injuries from the violent impact by that vehicle 
it is also alleged that t he city was acting with deliberate indifference breaching their duty to provide officer wilson with adequate supervision and training regarding the reasonable containment of prisoners in custody and that t he facts stated in the facts section of the complaint constitute intentional,deliberate,and conscious indifference to standards in the management of the city police department in the training on,demonstrated proficiency in,and the safe handling of individuals in custody 
additional allegations are that officers of the city police department were aware of previous attempts of the prisoner to flee from their custody,were aware that their actions increased danger to others including rios and were aware of department and state law citing.trans.code that an operator of a motor vehicle may not leave a vehicle unattended without stopping the engine,locking the ignition and removing the key from the ignition.it is also alleged that defendants acted with deliberate indifference to rios safety,by creating an environment which would not have existed for the crime to occur otherwise,and that 
with an intentional,a deliberate,and a conscious indifference to the lives and safety of other persons,including rios,the city adopted or maintained,through its final policymakers,unconstitutional policies and customs,and failed to implement constitutional and proper policies and procedures,which proximately caused or resulted in the violation of the constitutional rights of rios 
officer wilson acted willfully,deliberately,maliciously,or with reckless disregard for rios constitutional rights when,with knowledge of reymundo avalos previous attempts to flee police custody,officer wilson left avalos unattended in an operative police unit on june.
discussion 
standard of review 
our review of a district court decision on a b motion is,as we said in campbell city of san antonio,cir 
de novo,accepting all facts as true and viewing those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.walker cent.bell,cir heaney united states veterans,cir dismissal is not proper unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of her claim which would entitle her to relief.heaney,at quoting conley gibson,d.however,the complaint must contain either direct allegations on every material point necessary to sustain a recovery or contain allegations from which an inference fairly may be drawn that evidence on these material points will be introduced at trial.wright miller,federal practice and procedure civil at footnote omitted.a statement of facts that merely creates a suspicion that the pleader might have a right of action is insufficient.id.at footnote omitted.dismissal is proper if the complaint lacks an allegation regarding a required element necessary to obtain relief moore federal practice at footnote omitted.the court is not required to conjure up unpled allegations or construe elaborately arcane scripts to save a complaint.gooley mobil oil,cir.further,conclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss.allied pilots ass n,cir.
where the issue is one of qualified immunity,saucier katz,d,states the relevant test as follows 
a court required to rule upon the qualified immunity issue must consider,then,this threshold question taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,do the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right 
if no constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established,there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.id.at 
constitutional violation danger 
the complaint makes plain that rios asserts a fourteenth amendment substantive due process right to be free from state deprivation of his bodily integrity liberty interest in deshaney winnebago county,d,the court held that a s a general matter a state failure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the due process clause,but recognized an exception respecting individuals in certain special relationships with the state,id.at,an exception which it described and explained as follows 
in the substantive due process analysis,it is the state affirmative act of restraining the individual freedom to act on his own incarceration,institutionalization,or other similar restraint of personal is the deprivation of liberty triggering the protections of the due process clause,not its failure to act to protect his liberty interests against harms inflicted by other means.id.at.
rios was injured from being struck by the patrol car driven by an escaping prisoner,reymundo avalos who had earlier commandeered the vehicle after having escaped from confinement in the rear seat and sped away.obviously,avalos is a purely private party not in any sense acting under color of law,and nothing in the complaint suggests otherwise.moreover,it is likewise obvious that rios was not incarcerated or institutionalized or under other similar restraint of personal liberty so as to be within the noted special relationship exception to deshaney.rios does not contend otherwise.
rather,rios seeks to invoke another purported exception to deshaney,namely what has been referred to as the danger theory.as we noted in mcclendon city of columbia,cir en banc,this court has frequently spoken of the danger theory,and has discussed its various permutations and requirements as applied in other circuits,but neither the supreme court nor this court has ever either adopted the danger theory or sustained a recovery on the basis thereof.we have,however,many times refused to allow recovery sought to be predicated thereunder.see,beltran city of el paso,cir this court has consistently refused to recognize a danger theory of liability rivera houston independent school district,cir we have never recognized danger as a trigger of state affirmative duties under the due process clause piotrowski city of houston,cir although this court has discussed the contours of the danger theory on several occasions,we have never adopted that theory randolph cervantes,cir the danger theory has not been adopted in this circuit johnson dallas,cir no fifth circuit case has yet predicated relief on a state created danger theory leffall dallas,cir we have found no cases in our circuit permitting recovery for a substantive due process violation predicated on a danger theory.
rios contends,however,that scanlan texas,cir,adopted the danger theory.it is certainly not clear that scanlan purports to do so.there the panel primarily addressed the district court error in considering matters outside the complaint in granting a rule b dismissal.the scanlan panel did cite the johnson and piotrowski opinions respecting what would be required to make out a danger claim and stated that the plaintiffs had adequately pled the there referenced required elements thereof however,this discussion was introduced by the statement that this court has never explicitly adopted the danger theory,scanlan,at,and nowhere in the opinion does the court expressly purport to adopt or approve that theory.at least two subsequent panels have construed scanlan as not adopting the danger theory.see beltran,at citing mcclendon and scanlan as examples of our refusal to recognize a danger theory rivera,at in scanlan d espite remanding that case for further proceedings,we did not recognize the state created danger theory.we need not,however,ultimately resolve the meaning of scanlan because,as explained below,prior decisions of this court more specifically on point here than scanlan and not cited in scanlan are controlling in the present setting 
officer wilson 
the only conduct,or inaction,alleged respecting officer wilson,and the only fault or wrongdoing sought to be charged to him,is that on the evening in question,after he had placed avalos under arrest,he improperly left the prisoner avalos in the backseat of his patrol car while the keys were in the ignition and the engine running while he visited with a person who lived in the neighborhood,that as a result avalos escaped from confinement in the rear seat,commandeered the patrol car,and sped away,and that wilson acted willfully,deliberately,or with reckless disregard for rios constitutional rights when,with knowledge of reymundo avalos previous attempts to flee police custody,officer wilson left avalos unattended in an operative police unit.it is not alleged that in so leaving the vehicle unattended wilson knew or believed that avalos would likely drive the vehicle to the del rio port of entry or would more likely endanger anyone there as opposed to any other member of the general public in or around the streets of del rio or its environs.in fact,the contrary is to be inferred by the allegations that the police department proceeded to channel reymundo avalos towards the international bridge and that the police officers pursuing the stolen patrol car driven by avalos had opportunities to divert or disable the vehicle,but failed to do so.it is not alleged wilson participated in the pursuit of avalos or requested assistance from any customs officers in intercepting avalos or that he had anything to do with the wording or transmission of the all points alert or the failure to clearly inform customs officers that the vehicle was a police department official marked patrol car.there is no allegation that any alleged action or failure to act on the part of wilson was taken by him with the actual purpose or intention of causing injury to anyone,much less rios whom it is not alleged wilson in any way knew or even knew of.
our decisions make clear that the facts alleged do not show that wilson conduct violated any constitutional right.in saenz heldenfels,cir,the plaintiffs were injured when a private actor drunk drove his truck into the plaintiffs oncoming vehicle,and we held there was no constitutional violation on the part of a senior deputy sheriff who had ordered his junior deputy not arrest or investigate as the junior wanted to the truck driver,whom both believed to be drunk as he sat in his vehicle just in front of the deputies at a stop sign for some minutes and was known to be always drunk and stopped for that and had eventually pulled away making a wide right turn.a few minutes later the drunk drove his truck into the plaintiffs vehicle.id.at.relying on deshaney,we held that the allegations did not state a constitutional claim.id.at.we rejected application of the danger theory stating that the defendant senior deputy was neither aware of an immediate danger facing a known victim,nor did he use his authority to prevent the appellants from receiving aid.this danger theory is inapposite without a known victim,and that a state officer can not offend due process by permitting an intoxicated driver to remain on the highway,thereby increasing the risk of harm to unidentified and unidentifiable members of the public.id.at.the same principles apply here and dictate the conclusion that wilson conduct violated no constitutional right.
we made a similar holding in morin moore,cir,where the son of defendant police officer moore shot the plaintiffs using an assault rifle which officer moore had procured from the police department and stored in his son bedroom notwithstanding that he,and the defendant police officer who furnished him the weapon,knew that the son was a psychologically unstable drug user who revered nazi ideology,and officer moore,the night before the shooting,had kicked his son former girlfriend out of his house,knowing both that she had a new boyfriend and that the son was looking for the new boyfriend a plaintiff victim of the shooting.we affirmed the district court rule b dismissal of the complaint,noting that the allegations in this case do not show specific knowledge of a harm to a known victim.id.at 
relatedly,we have rejected section liability in instances where the alleged deliberate indifference of police allowed a prisoner or prisoners to injure an officer.in hogan city of houston,cir,a decision,we affirmed a rule b dismissal of a section complaint alleging that certain policies of the city and its chief of police respecting procedures in the prisoner intake facility,allowed a prisoner to grab another officer gun and shoot plaintiff,officer hogan with it and that such policies manifest deliberate indifference to or conscious disregard for the safety of officers on the part of the defendants city and its chief of police.id.we held no constitutional violation was alleged.
in de jesus benavides santos,cir,one of our first decisions to consider deshaney,we affirmed the rule b dismissal of a section complaint by county jail guards who while on duty and unarmed were shot by prisoners attempting to escape defendants were the sheriff,employer of the guards,as well as the county commissioners and county judge.the complaint alleged that the sheriff had been warned by the dea nearly two weeks before that a jailbreak was imminent and was also aware of a persistent pattern on contraband smuggling into the jail,but nevertheless the defendants,in callous i
