opinion of the court 
robert golden,for leah golden,and donald earwood,executor of the estate of helen earwood,appeal a final order of the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania dismissing their action for lack of jurisdiction.appellants action sought,through various means,to challenge the distribution of assets from the estate of irene king.in addition to asserting a number of familiar torts,including fraud and slander,the complaint asserted several grounds for relief that relate to probate law,including undue influence and breach of fiduciary duty as the executor of a will.appellants also sought punitive damages.the district court dismissed the action as falling within the probate exception to federal diversity jurisdiction.this case,therefore,requires us to explore the contours of the probate exception.we will affirm in part and reverse in part.
appellant robert golden is a citizen of the state of new york and holds general power of attorney for leah golden,also a citizen of the state of new york.appellant donald earwood is the personal representative of the estate of helen earwood,a citizen of the state of georgia prior to her death appellees david golden and darlene koposko are both adult citizens of the commonwealth of pennsylvania.
on september,irene king executed a last will and testament the will and an inter vivos trust the trust.pursuant to her testamentary scheme,all of her property was transferred to the trust,under which she named herself the sole trustee.in the event of her incapacity or death,appellee david golden was to become the sole trustee.as a redundancy,her will also contained a pour over provision,transferring all of her property to the trust upon her death.under the terms of the original trust,the trust corpus was,upon her death,to be distributed in equal shares among leah golden,king,helen earwood,king sister,and appellee david golden,king brother the original trust,will,and other attendant paperwork were prepared by nicholas cook,and his office.
as set forth in the complaint,king health deteriorated over the months that followed.concurrently,appellee david golden began exercising increasing control over both king finances and,allegedly,over king herself.at some point during the fall of,appellee david golden terminated king professional home care services in favor of those provided by appellee darlene koposko and koposko mother and daughter.during this time,appellants allege,several of their attempts to visit king were either directly rebuffed by appellee david golden or met with so much hostility that they were soon terminated.
by june,king was bedridden,experiencing excruciating pain and unable to maintain bodily functions.she was being medicated for her pain and was prescribed hospice care.that morning,however,she purportedly summoned appellee koposko to her side and dictated the preparation of a document altering the distributive scheme enumerated in her trust.koposko then purportedly prepared a handwritten instrument memorializing those changes the addendum,propped king up in bed,watched her sign the instrument and then,along with one of koposko friends,witnessed it.appellee koposko then allegedly placed the addendum in a dresser drawer where it remained until june,when she delivered it to the offices of nicholas cook.
the addendum reduced the amount of the legacy granted to leah golden from of king estate to the sum of.at.in a similar manner,the addendum reduced the amount of the legacy granted to helen earwood from of king estate to the sum of.id.the remainder of the estate,according to the addendum,was to pass to appellee david golden.
on july,king died.on september,king will was probated and letters testamentary thereafter issued.at some point thereafter,appellee david golden,through nicholas cook,filed a pennsylvania inheritance tax return the tax return with the fayette county register of wills listing the net value of king estate as.distribution of the legacies has not occurred due to the pendency of the instant litigation.
appellants brought this action in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania on march.appellants alleged jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship and an amount in controversy in excess of.in addition to seeking punitive damages,appellants asserted six causes of action undue influence fraud forgery slander asserted by appellant earwood only tortious interference with inheritance and breach of fiduciary duty as executor of a will asserted against appellee david golden only.appellants essentially alleged that their shares under king trust were reduced either as a result of appellees outright forgery,or as a result of appellees wrongful influence on,or slanderous statements to,king.
on june,after discovery was complete,the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment on november,the district court conducted a pretrial conference but,on march,sua sponte dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.appellants timely appealed.
appellees present two arguments against subject matter jurisdiction.first,they claim that appellants have failed to satisfy the amount in controversy requirement for diversity jurisdiction.see a.second,they urge that appellants action falls under the probate exception to federal diversity jurisdiction.see,markham allen.waterman bank trust.moore graybeal,cir.we exercise plenary review over a district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.see bakhtriger elwood,cir.
appellees contend that the amount in controversy has not been adequately pled.the amount in controversy is a statutory limit on the subject matter over which the federal courts have jurisdiction.see a as with all issues of subject matter jurisdiction,defects in the pleading of the amount in controversy can not be waived and,as a consequence,may be raised by any party at any time during litigation of the dispute.see.h see also,kontrick ryan,d.the federal courts themselves,of course,have a continuing obligation to investigate their jurisdiction over the matters before them.see exxon mobil saudi basic indus,cir quoting desi pizza,city of,cir meritcare paul mercury ins,cir.even if no party reaches the issue,therefore,the courts may take the initiative and probe the sufficiency with which the amount in controversy has been pled.see meritcare,at.
where a federal cause of action is based on diversity jurisdiction,the complaint must allege an amount in controversy between the parties in excess of the statutory minimum.see a.the amount need not be proven rather,the amount is judged from the face of the complaint and is generally established by a good faith allegation.see horton liberty mut.ins,d measuring good faith by whether it appears to a legal certainty the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount internal quotations and citations omitted paul mercury indem.red cab.see also jumara state farm ins,cir.each plaintiff must meet the amount in controversy may not be aggregated among plaintiffs to meet the statutory minimum.see meritcare,at citing wright,miller cooper,federal practice and procedure at.on the other hand,courts do not separately evaluate each of the causes of action asserted by any one plaintiff against any one defendant snyder harris,d suber,at cir see also wright,miller cooper,federal practice and procedure at.
claims for punitive damages may be aggregated with claims for compensatory damages unless the former are patently frivolous and without foundation.packard,at quoting gray occidental life ins,cir.punitive damage claims are per se patently frivolous and without foundation if they are unavailable as a matter of state substantive law.see in re corestates trust fee,cir packard provident nat.bank,cir.where guidance from state substantive law is absent,the federal courts must attempt to predict the position that the state courts would take on the question.corestates,at.if appropriately made,therefore,a request for punitive damages will generally satisfy the amount in controversy requirement because it can not be stated to a legal certainty that the value of the plaintiff claim is below the statutory minimum.
with the foregoing general principles in mind,we turn to the specific allegations of the complaint.
appellees argue that the compensatory damages at stake fall below the threshold.they observe that the tax return filed with the pennsylvania orphans court lists the estate net value at.the original trust provided that appellants each receive a share of the estate,or.but the amended trust provided for a distribution of to helen earwood and to leah golden.thus,appellees argue,appellant earwood has alleged an amount in controversy of and appellant golden,each less than the statutory minimum.
appellants respond that the statutory minimum has been met because the complaint alleged that,but for appellees conduct,the value of the estate would have been valued in excess of but if the filing of the tax return with the orphans court was a determination by that court of the actual value of the estate,then a determination by a federal court that the estate should have been valued higher than would constitute an impermissible collateral impeachment of a state court judgment.see rooker fidelity trust.district of columbia court of appeals feldman,d see also exxon,at.although this court asked counsel,through supplemental briefing,to clarify how the orphans court treated the tax filing,they were unable to do so.
nevertheless,the jurisdictional amount in controversy may be satisfied on another basis the complaint seeks punitive damages.if punitive damages are available under pennsylvania state law for the causes of action asserted by the appellants,and if the claims for punitive damages are not otherwise patently frivolous and without foundation,then the pleadings satisfy the necessary amount in controversy.packard,at.
pennsylvania law permits the recovery of punitive damages for torts that are committed willfully,maliciously,or so carelessly as to indicate wanton disregard of the rights of the party injured.thompson swank,see also shv coal,continental grain.the pennsylvania supreme court has adopted section of the restatement second of torts,which states that p unitive damages may be awarded for conduct that is outrageous,because of the defendant evil motive or his reckless indifference to others.restatement second torts see also feld merriam.the pennsylvania supreme court has also discussed with approval comment b of that section,which states that r eckless indifference to the rights of others and conscious action in deliberate disregard of them may provide the necessary state of mind to justify punitive damages.restatement second torts cmt.b see also shv,at martin,overruled on other grounds by kirkbride lisbon contractors.
the complaint asserts conduct on the part of appellees that appellants allege to be,at least,recklessly tortious.for example,the complaint asserts a cause of action for slander by appellant earwood against both appellees.pennsylvania permits the recovery of punitive damages for slander claims.see walder lobel,defamation generally.the complaint also asserts a cause of action for tortious interference with inheritance by both appellants against both appellees there is no direct pronouncement by the pennsylvania courts that punitive damages are recoverable in actions for tortious interference with inheritance,but punitive damage awards have been upheld in actions for analogous torts.see,judge tech,clancy,tortious interference with contractual relations.given the pennsylvania supreme court broad pronouncements with respect to the availability of punitive damages,and given the assertion of allegedly intentional or reckless conduct here,we may confidently predict that the pennsylvania courts would not bar the recovery of punitive damages in this action corestates,at.from the face of the complaint,appellants punitive damage claim is not patently frivolous and without foundation.packard,at.thus,at this stage in the litigation,it does not appear to a legal certainty the appellants claims fall below the statutory minimum.horton,at.internal quotations and citations omitted.
appellants have adequately pled the amount in controversy.we move to the more tangled question presented on appeal whether the probate exception precludes the federal courts from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over appellants substantive causes of action.
the lineage of the probate exception to federal diversity jurisdiction can be readily traced.as early as,the supreme court observed that a court of equity will not entertain jurisdiction of a bill to set aside a will or the probate thereof,and dismissed the action before it on that basis.in re broderick will,wall.later opinions by the court were more explicit as to the reason the judiciary act of and its successors granted the federal courts equitable powers coextensive with those held by the english chancery court in.see judiciary act of,ch,stat.markham,at,at.because probate matters in late eighteenth century england were assigned to the ecclesiastical court and not to the chancery court,the federal courts are without the power to probate a will or administer an estate markham,at,at.see also georges glick,cir rice rice,cir.
the probate exception extends both to matters of pure probate and to matters ancillary to probate.see farrell.see also dragan miller,cir,cert.denied,d rice,at.on the other hand,strictly in personam actions whose subject matter relates only incidentally to probate can be maintained in federal court because the exercise of jurisdiction under such circumstances would not interfere with the probate proceedings or require the court to assume general jurisdiction of the probate or control of the property in the custody of the state court.markham,at.
where is the line of demarcation various descriptions of the probate exception over the years often seem to substitute one opaque verbal formulation for another.see markham,at.princess lida of thurn and taxis thompson,at.farrell,at.dragan,at lamberg callahan,cir.but however one articulates the precise contours of the probate exception,three principles discernable from caselaw are enough to guide our disposition of this appeal.
first,the federal courts lack the power to actually probate a will.see markham,at.moore,at see also georges,at.second,where a will has already been probated,permitting an action that seeks,expressly or in fact,to assail or contradict a judgment of the probate court generally constitutes an impermissible interference with the probate see moore,at.likewise,the probate exception bars federal courts from adjudicating claims that challenge management of the estate.princess lida,at.treating a claim of trustee mismanagement as related for jurisdictional purposes to administration of the corpus.third,federal courts may nevertheless exercise jurisdiction over an otherwise barred cause of action if the action would be maintainable inter partes in the state courts of general jurisdiction sutton english.farrell,at.see also moore,at.this supplemental rule means that a state can effectively contract the scope of the probate exception if it allows its courts of general jurisdiction to adjudicate challenges to probate.
in sum,federal courts have the power to entertain in personam diversity actions,firmly grounded in recognized legal theories,if their resolution will not undercut the past probate of a will or result in the federal court assum ing general jurisdiction of the probate or control of the property in the custody of the state court.markham,at.where relief can be granted without challenging the probate court determinations or management of the res,the exercise of federal jurisdiction could not interfere with the probate.and,in any event,if the actions would be maintainable inter partes in the state courts of general jurisdiction,the state has presumably determined as a matter of law that such actions will not disrupt the activities of the state probate courts.
the parties acknowledge,as they must,the foregoing threshold principles.from that point of departure,however,they proceed down different analytical paths.
appellants contend that the probate exception is categorically inapplicable to this case.they argue that the probate exception by its terms applies only to a will,and not to a if,as here,the trust operates as a will,distributing corpus upon the death of the settlor.they point out that trusts,by definition,do not pass through probate.that being so,they argue,actions involving trusts should per se not be subject to the probate exception.
this mistakes the scope of the probate exception,which is not limited to the formal act of probating a will.as described previously,the probate exception bars a federal court from entertaining both matters of pure probate and matters ancillary to probate.farrell,at.moore,at see also dragan,at rice,at.accordingly,the seventh circuit has rejected a per se rule identical to the one proposed by the appellants here.see storm storm,cir see also georges,at.in georges,the seventh circuit noted that analysis of the probate exception applies as well to trusts that act as will substitutes 
the plaintiffs argue that the probate exception is inapplicable here because this action relates to the execution of an inter vivos trust,not to a will.we reject such a per se rule.the inter vivos trust is clearly a will substitute.however,the fact that this case does involve a will substitute does not automatically render the probate exception applicable.
the probate exception protects the state interest in managing all challenges addressing an estate res located in that state or with which the state has some meaningful connection.that interest is no less compelling if the estate res is distributed by trust rather than by a will.we agree with the court of appeals for the seventh circuit in holding that causes of action involving trusts are treated under the probate exception in the same way as actions involving wills.
appellees take the opposite categorical position,and contend that the probate exception applies categorically to all claims here.they argue that,because the pennsylvania legislature has transferred to the orphans court the power to administer and oversee actions seeking to reform trusts,see.the probate exception must per se apply to preempt this action.of course,we have already observed that the state can shrink the probate exception by assigning probate related claims to a state court of general jurisdiction.but the reverse does not follow.a state can not expand the probate defeat otherwise proper federal jurisdiction over a by vesting exclusive authority over otherwise in personam actions in the probate court.see,at.payne hook,wal.see also wright,miller cooper,federal practice and procedure,at.that is to say,if a claim is otherwise outside the scope of the probate exception,a federal court is not divested of jurisdiction simply because the state places that sort of claim in state probate court.see marshall lauriault,cir.
accordingly,we reject the categorical argument of each party.instead,we must examine the substance of each of the claims to determine whether it falls within the probate exception.
we first turn to the claims of undue influence,forgery and breach of fiduciary duty as an executor.
once a will has been probated,it generally constitutes an impermissible interference with the probate for a federal court to entertain a cause of action that seeks,in fact or in effect,to attack a determination of the probate court.
we take a fairly broad view of the types of actions that interfere with the probate proceedings.moore,at.under that broad view,we must conclude that appellants claims for undue influence,forgery and breach of fiduciary duty as an executor would interfere with the probate proceedings and,therefore,are subject to the probate exception.
in moore,this court upheld the district court dismissal under the probate exception of an action seeking to establish rights in an estate that had already been probated.at.moore,a legatee under an earlier,revoked will,sought a declaration that the will probated by the delaware probate court was invalid as a result of either undue influence or lack of testamentary capacity.see id.at.we held that moore action was barred by the probate exception because it would interfere with the delaware courts past probate of the estate by partially reversing the bequests.see id.at.in other words,a judgment favorable to moore would necessarily adjudicate a matter normally determined as a part of probate.w e are satisfied that jurisdiction can not be sustained on the theory that this is an action by a legatee which does not interfere with the probate proceedings.id.we noted that the result did not change simply because moore cast her action to recover damages rather than to reform the will.
regardless of how moore characterizes her claim,she is seeking in substance to invalidate the will we are not impressed with the concept that granting her relief would not interfere with the probate proceedings if done by an award of damages rather than by an order to the executor directing distribution of the estate.either way the substance is the same.
id.internal citations omitted.under moore,therefore,actions that seek in effect to reform a will or overturn a determination of will validity by the probate court constitute an impermissible interference with the probate.
here,the practical effect of each of appellants claims for undue influence and forgery would do exactly that declare the addendum and its distributive scheme invalid or unenforceable.to be sure,the register of wills and the orphans court never directly passed on the trust or its addendum.but the register of wills did probate king will which,in turn,passed all of her property under the terms of her trust agreement and any amendments thereto.at.as we see it,therefore,by probating king will,the register also implicitly determined the trust,the addendum and their combined distributive scheme to be valid and enforceable appellants claims for undue influence and forgery would strike at that determination of validity,however.for a will that is the result of undue influence or that is forged is necessarily invalid.see.in re fleming estate,in re carothers estate.an implicit federal court judgment that the addendum is invalid or unenforceable would be inconsistent with the orphans court probate jurisdiction over king estate.as the seventh circuit has observed,application of the probate exception depends not on how the federal claim is labeled,but on whether the action is in effect one to declare the will invalid because of undue influence.dragan,at.
appellants claim for breach of fiduciary duty as the executor of a will is also at odds with the probate jurisdiction of the orphans court.based on the complaint,the primary theory of appellants breach of fiduciary duty claim is that appellee david golden misappropriated or wasted estate assets prior to probate.see in re lux estate.the complaint also arguably raises the theory that appellee david golden breached his duty as the executor of king estate by operating under a conflict of interest.these claims strike at management of the estate,and the district court is nonetheless without jurisdiction to adjudicate it.in pennsylvania,all claims that an estate executor engaged in are handled in the probate court,either by removal of the offending executor,see,or by assessing a penalty against that executor.see in re estate of harrison.claims for breach of fiduciary duty as executor of an estate are never adjudicated outside the probate context.appellants breach of fiduciary duty,under either,therefore,a classic example of a claim that is so ancillary to probate that it is not justiciable in federal court.see farrell,at.that is because,as the supreme court observed in princess lida,claims of mismanagement of an estate relate solely as to administration and restoration of corpus.at see also mangieri mangieri,cir holding probate exception excludes claim that fiduciary should refund money to the estate.
moreover,these theories of recovery do not come within any state law inter partes exemption from the probate exception.pennsylvania law does not vest in the pennsylvania courts of general jurisdiction any power to establish rights in an estate on the theories of undue influence,forgery or breach of fiduciary duty as an executor.indeed,at least with respect to undue influence,authority is directly to the contrary.see lucidore novak.in lucidore,the plaintiffs attempted to sue,in the court of common pleas,the executrix and the attorney of the estate of their deceased aunt.id.at.at the time of the suit,the deceased will had already been probated by the orphans court and letters testamentary had issued.id.the complaint alleged that the defendants had exercised undue influence over the deceased,and sought an injunction against disposition of assets from the estate on the ground that the will was obtained as a result of the undue influence.id.
the court of common pleas dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and the pennsylvania superior court affirmed,saying that undue influence claims fell exclusively within the ambit of the probate court 
t here is no doubt that the appellants incorrectly captioned the nature of their action as a complaint in equity in that this action must be an appeal from probate.further,there is no doubt that appellants brought the action in the incorrect division of the court of common pleas 
case law confirms that an action contesting the validity of a will on grounds of lack of testamentary capacity,undue influence,and confidential relationship must be brought as an appeal from probate in the orphans court division of the court of common pleas i t is incorrect to file a complaint in the civil division seeking to set aside the will.
we are persuaded,therefore,that the pennsylvania courts do not recognize undue influence as a tort existing outside the probate context.further,no pennsylvania case permits a suit,in the state courts of general jurisdiction to sue for forgery of a will or breach of fiduciary duty as executor of an estate.these theories of recovery also contest the validity of the will,and must be addressed as an appeal from probate.id.at.
appellants claim for the tort of fraud presents a somewhat closer question.fraud is a tort in pennsylvania.see,gibbs ernst.and if the appellants were pressing a theory of fraud that did not in any way challenge the orphans court probate of king estate,the district court might well have jurisdiction over those claims.but as it stands,both of the fraud theories that the complaint might conceivably support entail a direct challenge to determinations of the orphans court.
from the complaint,the appellants could argue two possible theories of fraud.first,that the appellees forged the addendum and king signature on it and thereby defrauded the orphans court and robbed the appellants of their inheritance.see,in re fleming estate,at.second,that the appellees fraudulently induced king into signing the addendum by making her believe that it said something other than what it actually said,and thereby deprived the appellants of their inheritance.see,in re estate of glover.
under either theory,the the orphans court implicitly found to be valid and either invalid or unenforceable.if appellants first possible fraud theory is correct and the addendum and king signature on it were forged,the documents are obviously invalid as a forgery.see.in re fleming estate,at.we have already explained why such a theory falls within the probate exception.and if the appellants second theory is correct,the addendum is either invalid or unenforceable because king was misled about what she was signing and,therefore,the document does not reflect king testamentary intent see in re glover estate,at.in that case as well,appellants theories are inimical to the determinations of the orphans court that the will,the trust,the addendum and their combined distributive scheme are both valid and enforceable.
since the appellants fraud claims effectively seek to challenge the orphans court probate of king estate,we must go on to ask would pennsylvania allow a court of general jurisdiction to entertain such a fraud claim anyway to be sure,fraud may be a recognized tort in pennsylvania.but we are not aware that any court in pennsylvania has permitted a plaintiff to seek to challenge the past probate of an estate through the vehicle of a fraud action.as we have observed,it is not enough under the inter partes exemption from the probate exception for a state court to recognize a cause of action rather,the state court must recognize the use of that action to impeach a probate.any other rule would reward creative pleading and would undermine both the fundamental assumptions of the inter partes exemption from the probate exception and the finality that the probate system requires.see moore,at see also storm,at.thus,appellants fraud claims must be with their claims for undue influence,forgery and breach of fiduciary duty as executor of a recovery on those claims would not be otherwise maintainable in the pennsylvania courts of general jurisdiction,would be contrary to a determination of the probate court,and would impermissibly interfere with the probate proceedings.markham,at.moore,at.
as already noted,federal courts retain the power to entertain in personam diversity actions involving parties to a will if the resolution of the action will have no effect on the past probate of a will.the first of appellants causes of action that is saved by this principle is appellant earwood claim for slander.
a claim for slander is a strictly in personam action.it is,in this case,also firmly based on a recognized legal pennsylvania courts have long recognized the tort of slander.see,klumph dunn,chubb gsell,see also corabi curtis pub.moreover,even assuming that slander is proven,relief can be granted without challenging the orphans court determinations of estate value and testamentary document validity,enforceability and distributive scheme.that is to say,a determination by the district court that earwood may have been slandered and damaged by the appellees is in no way contrary to the orphans court determination that the will,the trust,the addendum and their combined distributive scheme are valid and enforceable.to be sure,the amount of earwood damage as a result of the alleged slander it need measured by the difference between the legacy under the addendum and the legacy under the trust.but a judgment that the appellees slandered earwood and caused her some amount of damage does nothing to impeach the orphans court determination that king intended to and succeeded in distributing her estate via the scheme laid out in the trust and its addendum.the district court has jurisdiction to consider appellant earwood claim for slander.
so,too,is there jurisdiction over appellants claims for tortious interference with inheritance.despite its entwinement with probate,a cause of action for tortious interference with inheritance is one brought in personam.it is no different from any other plaintiff is asserting that some tortious action on the part of the defendant has caused him or her damage.further,though it may not be so in other states a claim for tortious interference with inheritance is one based on a legal theory recognized by the pennsylvania state courts.see mangold,at cardenas,at.
further,relief can be granted without challenging the orphans court determinations of estate value and testamentary document validity,enforceability and distributive scheme.in pennsylvania,the elements of tortious interference with inheritance are 
the testator indicated an intent to change his will to provide a described benefit for plaintiff,
the defendant used fraud,misrepresentation or undue influence to prevent execution of the intended will,
the defendant was successful in preventing the execution of a new will and 
but for the defendant sic conduct,the testator would have changed his will.
cardenas,at.in no event does an action for tortious interference with inheritance in pennsylvania challenge the orphans court determination of value of the estate.mangold,at.nor may a plaintiff use an action for tortious interference with inheritance to challenge the validity or enforceability of the testamentary documents if any admitted to probate,or the testamentary scheme established by those documents.id.
true,any cause of action for tortious interference of inh
