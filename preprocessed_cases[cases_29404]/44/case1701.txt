omar esparza was shot and killed by houston police officers during an incident at his family home.his parents,jose and asuncion valle the valles,individually and as representatives of their son estate,sued the city of houston city seeking relief under.the district court granted summary judgment in the city favor on all claims.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
on the day of the incident,apparently had been suffering from depression and anxiety in the preceding upset and locked himself inside the family home and refused to allow his parents to enter.after about an hour,the valles called for assistance and requested a operator because neither of them spoke english.the valles apparently hoped that the call would bring medical assistance for their son.
the dispatcher sent police officers to the valles home.the valles allegedly showed the first officer on the scene,officer duarte,papers from their previous attempts to get esparza admitted to a hospital for psychiatric treatment and requested that he help them get medical care for their son.duarte then approached the front door of the house and conversed with esparza both duarte and esparza spoke english.officers walsh,seay,and chaisson then arrived and spoke with esparza,who stated he would not come out of the house and would not let anyone in.the officers contacted their supervisor,sergeant bryant,who assumed control of the situation upon his arrival.after unsuccessfully attempting to communicate with esparza,sergeant bryant contacted police headquarters to report the situation and seek orders.captain williams of the special weapons and negotiation team swat directed sergeant bryant to get a crisis intervention team cit special officer to negotiate with esparza.cit officer broussard was called to the scene.she negotiated with esparza for about thirty to forty minutes,but was unable to get him to come out of the house or allow officers into the house.the other officers,without consulting officer broussard,sought and received permission from captain williams to forcefully enter the house.esparza was not a suspect in any criminal activity,nor had he threatened the officers or himself.nonetheless,captain williams authorized the entry and seizure,although he was neither present at the scene nor had any direct communication with cit officer broussard.
sergeant bryant and three other officers armed themselves with a taser,a shotgun loaded with bean bags,and their sidearms.while cit officer broussard was still conversing with esparza through the front door,sergeant bryant and officers chaisson,duarte,and walsh forcibly entered a side door of the house.the city alleged that esparza was in possession of a hammer and charged at the officers when they entered.less than thirty seconds after entry,the officers began discharging their weapons.sergeant bryant fired three blasts of beanbags from the shotgun he was carrying but was,apparently,unable to stop esparza.walsh fired his taser and missed esparza.chaisson then fired his automatic pistol six times at bullets struck him.after the assault subsided,valle entered the home and saw her son lying on the floor she saw no hammer esparza died from his wounds.
swat captain williams was disciplined by the police department for his role in approving entry into the valles home.he successfully appealed his reprimand on the basis that he had acted within the policies and procedures of the police department.
the valles sued the pursuant to,alleging violations of the fourth and fourteenth amendments flowing from the officers warrantless forcible entry into their home and lethal seizure of esparza.the valles alleged that the officers exercised excessive force in entering their home and seizing esparza pursuant to a city policymaker orders,and that the city was liable under for failure to properly train the officers who entered their home.the district court granted the city first motion for summary judgment,finding that the decision to enter the valles home was not made by a city policymaker,and thus no city policy was a moving force in causing the valles injuries.the district court also granted the city second motion for summary judgment finding that,although the valles raised a material fact issue as to the city failure to train the officers,the valles failed to show that a city policymaker acted with deliberate indifference and that the allegedly inadequate training was a moving force in bringing about the constitutional violation.
we dispose first of the city claim that the valles lack standing.the city argues that esparza may have had a son,which would require administration of esparza estate under texas law,thereby raising a question whether appellant jose valle is the proper party to administer the estate.
we find the city arguments without merit.texas law provides that when a person dies intestate,as esparza did,the decedent estate immediately vests in his heirs at law,subject to the payment of any debts of the estate.ann.title to any estate passes equally to the decedent parents in the absence of a spouse or children.id.at a,b.administration of the estate is necessary if two or more debts exist against the estate.id.at b.as required,the valles submitted evidence demonstrating that an estate administration was neither pending nor necessary.see shepherd ledford,holding that heirs at law may maintain a wrongful death or survival suit without administration of the estate if they allege and prove that there is no administration pending and none necessary.even if esparza did have a son,a point that the parties contest,the valles still have standing under texas law to recover wrongful death damages on behalf of themselves and all others entitled to recover under the wrongful death statute.civ.prac.ann.b.the city conclusory allegation that esparza estate requires administration is insufficient.accordingly,the district court determination that the valles have standing to sue was correct.
this court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.mack city of abilene,cir citing morris dillard dep t stores,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if no genuine issue of material fact exists.all facts and inferences are construed in the light most favorable to the party.murray earle,cir.
the valles argue that the city is liable for entering their home in violation of the fourth amendment and for using excessive force to seize their son,which resulted in his death.the valles assert that captain williams was acting as the city final policymaker with respect to arrests and seizures when he authorized entry into the valles home,and thus his actions constitute city policy for the seizure at issue here.
it is well established that a city is not liable under on the theory of respondeat superior.monell dep t of soc,d.a municipality is liable only for acts directly attributable to it through some official action or imprimatur.piotrowski city of houston,cir.to establish municipal liability under,a plaintiff must show the deprivation of a federally protected right caused by action taken pursuant to an official municipal policy.see monell,at.a plaintiff must identify an official policy or custom,of which a policymaker can be charged with actual or constructive knowledge,and a constitutional violation whose moving force is that policy or custom.pineda city of houston,cir citing piotrowski,at.
the existence of a policy can be shown through evidence of an actual policy,regulation,or decision that is officially adopted and promulgated by lawmakers or others with policymaking authority.burge tammany parish,cir.a single decision by a policy maker may,under certain circumstances,constitute a policy for which a municipality may be liable.brown bryan county,cir.however,this single incident exception is extremely narrow and gives rise to municipal liability only if the municipal actor is a final policymaker.bolton city of dallas,cir citing woodard andrus,cir.
under the second prong,a ctual or constructive knowledge of a custom must be attributable to the governing body of the municipality or to an official to whom that body has delegated authority.webster city of houston,cir en banc see also piotrowski,at.this circuit has long distinguished between final decisionmaking authority and final policymaking authority.see jett dallas indep.sch,cir citing pembaur city of cincinnati,d and praprotnik,at.a municipal policymaker is someone who has the responsibility for making law or setting policy in any given area of a local government business.city of louis praprotnik,d.municipal liability attaches only where the decisionmaker possesses final authority to establish municipal policy with respect to the action ordered.pembaur,at.whether an official possesses final policymaking authority for purposes of municipal liability is a question of state and local law.id.at.
the third prong requires a plaintiff to prove moving force causation.to succeed,a plaintiff must show that the municipal action was taken with the requisite degree of culpability and must demonstrate a direct causal link between the municipal action and the deprivation of federal rights.bd.of the county comm rs brown,d.that is,the plaintiff must demonstrate that a municipal decision reflects deliberate indifference to the risk that a violation of a particular constitutional or statutory right will follow the decision.id.at.deliberate indifference is a high standard a showing of simple or even heightened negligence will not suffice.piotrowski,at quoting brown,at.
the valles do not argue that the city has a formal written policy or custom that caused the unconstitutional seizure of their son instead,they contend that the city is liable for captain williams single unconstitutional decision to order entry into their home to seize their son.to succeed on this claim,the valles must show that captain williams had final policymaking authority and that his decision was the moving force behind the constitutional injury.the valles appear to argue that some lesser decisionmaking authority to make the decision at issue is sufficient.see pembaur,at.if the decision to adopt that particular course of action is properly made by that government authorized decisionmakers,it surely represents an act of official government policy as that term is commonly understood.this argument is based on a misunderstanding of pembaur and this circuit precedent.see bolton,at discussing the distinction between final decisionmaking authority and final policymaking authority and noting that a municipality may only be liable for a decision of a final policymaker.we have long recognized that the discretion to exercise a particular function does not necessarily entail final policymaking authority over that function.bolton,at citing praprotnik,at.pembaur,at.jett,at.
under chapter of the city code of ordinances,the chief of police may delegate authority to another and such person so designated shall be vested with the full authority of the office of chief of police.houston,of ordinances.the valles contend that the chief of police exercised his policymaking authority in promulgating go,which delegates the chief full policymaking authority to the assistant chief of police for tactical operations and to the captain of tactical,captain williams.they further argue that special operating procedure sop specifically designated the captain of tactical operations as the person responsible for determining how to implement go.in particular,sop states that the captain of tactical operations shall be contacted regarding a special threat situation and will determine whether a full,partial or no swat response is appropriate.the valles contend that when a decision is made under go and sop about how to handle a special threat situation,the person who makes that decision is making policy for the specific arrest because the designated decisionmaker is exercising authority delegated by the chief of police who is the final policymaker for arrest decisions.
although go and sop confer decisionmaking or operational command authority on captain williams,it does not follow that captain williams,or another person to whom such authority is delegated,acts in a policymaking capacity.captain williams was afforded a certain measure of discretion in carrying out the city policy.but w hen an official discretionary decisions are constrained by policies not of that official making,those policies,rather than the subordinate departures from them,are the act of the municipality.praprotnik,at.the valles do not contend that either go or sop were policies made by captain williams pursuant to delegated policymaking authority.rather,they are policies made by other officials that williams was required to follow.assuming that captain williams was delegated some level of decisionmaking authority,go and sop constrained his authority and set forth the range of choices which he could make in a given situation.the fact that captain williams made the final decision in this situation does not mean that he was setting city policy regarding the making of arrests nor does the fact that captain williams decision violated esparza right to be free of an unconstitutional seizure elevate his decision to one attributable to the municipality 
although captain williams decision to order entry into the home was arguably the moving force behind the constitutional violations that resulted in esparza death,because his decision was not a decision by a final policymaker of the city,the city can not be liable.thus,the district court properly granted summary judgment on the valles municipal liability claim against the city.
the valles also argue that the city is liable because it failed to adequately train its patrol supervisors in the use of cit tactics.as a result,the valles contend that the cit officer on the scene at their home was overruled by a supervisor,which resulted in immediate and lethal escalation of the situation,an outcome that cit training was intended to prevent.
the standard applicable to a claim is the same as the standard for municipal liability.roberts city of shreveport,cir.the failure to provide proper training may fairly be said to represent a policy for which the city is responsible,and for which the city may be held liable if it actually causes injury.bryan county,at quoting city of canton harris,d.in resolving the issue of a city liability,the focus must be on adequacy of the training program in relation to the tasks the particular officers must perform.city of canton,at.a plaintiff must show that the municipality training policy or procedure was inadequate the inadequate training policy was a moving force in causing violation of the plaintiff rights and the municipality was deliberately indifferent in adopting its training policy.see,city of plano,cir pineda,at.
to show that the city training was inadequate,the valles presented evidence that the city chose not to implement a proposal for additional mandatory cit training,prepared at the direction of the executive assistant chief of police.according to the proposal,cit training is a proven curriculum for helping officers safely situations involving individuals in serious mental health crises.the proposal made two recommendations relevant here that all patrol officers be required to complete hours of cit training,and that all patrol sergeants be required to complete cit training.
the first proposal was intended to address the underutilization of cit officers.lieutenant mike lee,of the police department mental health unit,testified that cit training gives officers a basic understanding of mental health issues and appropriate and communication tactics.yet,the proposal noted that officers only handled thirty percent of cit calls.it also noted the potential liability that could flow from officers not trained in proper tactics responding to volatile situations.the proposal specifically noted if we dispatch a officer to a cit call and the officer shoots and kills the mental health consumer,the community will ask why we did use a cit officer.we could be liable if a cit officer was available but not used.
the second recommendation was intended to preclude possible conflicts that could arise between a officer and a officer that might result in the officer overcalling the cit officer suggested approach to the situation.lieutenant lee described cit training as degrees different than typical police officer and law enforcement training.for instance,situations involving mentally ill persons require a greater degree of patience and can require use of cit tactics for periods as long as hours.officers are trained not to let the pressure of time be a factor in their decisionmaking.supervisors,such as sergeant bryant,are supposed to allow cit officers to do their jobs with the least amount of interference possible,but ultimate control nonetheless rests with the supervisor,not a junior officer.thus lieutenant lee recommended that the city either allow the if lower be in charge of a scene involving a mentally ill person or train all supervisors to a level equal to that of the junior cit officers so that conflicts would be less likely to occur.the assistant chief and chief of police considered the proposals but decided not to implement either 
we agree with the district court that the valles presented sufficient summary judgment evidence to raise a jury question whether the department decision not to implement the cit training recommendations in the proposal constituted an official policy of failing to adequately train.the valles also raised a factual question whether a city policymaker,the chief of police had actual or constructive knowledge of the alleged inadequacy.the proposal suggests that the city recognized that mental health situations were not being adequately dealt with by officers and that there was a need for additional cit training.the proposal recommends a course of action,but the city declined to implement those recommendations.the city points to evidence that the chief of police and executive assistant chief had to balance the need for training with practical considerations such as budgetary and time constraints,and that instead of adopting the proposal,the city attempted to identify officers for dispatch purposes to increase the percentage of cit calls actually handled by cit officers.although this evidence suggests that the city did not completely ignore the issues raised by the proposal and sought other ways to deal with them,it highlights the factual dispute whether the city training and its response to the proposal were inadequate.
as to the second requirement for municipal liability,the district court found insufficient evidence of causation to survive summary judgment.plaintiffs must meet a heightened standard of causation in order to hold a municipality liable under.see city of canton,at.thus,we require that the municipality failure to train be the moving force that caused the specific constitutional violation.bryan county,at.in other words,the plaintiff must establish a direct causal link between the municipal policy and the constitutional injury.brown,at.we have said that the connection must be more than a mere but for coupling between cause and effect.the deficiency in training must be the actual cause of the constitutional violation.thompson connick,cir,cert.granted,d internal quotations and citations omitted.
the valles have failed to present sufficient evidence of causation as to the entry of their home.that decision was made by captain williams,the head of the tactical swat team,who was trained in cit tactics.moreover,although cit officer broussard testified that she was neither told nor consulted about making entry into the home,she further testified that she did not disagree with the decision to enter.while we are troubled that captain williams never spoke directly with the only cit officer on the scene prior to ordering the forceful entry of the valles home,any alleged lack of cit training was not the moving force in the decision to enter the home.
however,we find that there is sufficient evidence of causation to survive summary judgment with respect to the escalation of force after the officers entry.the district court reasoned that because cit officer broussard was on the scene,the first goal of the training increase the use of cit officers in situations such as involved in this accomplished even though that policy had not been implemented.although officer broussard was present,she was not one of the officers who entered the valles home.moreover,there is no record evidence that the officers who did enter the valles home had received any cit training.lieutenant lee emphasized that cit training is degrees different from standard patrol officer training and agreed that the command techniques that are employed to take a criminal suspect into custody can serve to escalate contact with the mentally ill into violence.furthermore,assistant chief michael dirden,at the time responsible for internal investigations,testified that he had concerns that the officers who handled the situation were not adequately prepared to do so.in addition,the valles expert opined that there is a substantially greater likelihood that esparza would have survive d if the officers going in there are the very best trained,best equipped,best prepared to deal with any kind of eventuality.on the other hand,the city presented some testimony to the effect that cit training may not have changed the outcome and that esparza death was not an incident that would have been addressed by implementation of the training proposal.at best,the city evidence raises a factual dispute whether failure to train all of the patrol officers involved in the incident in cit tactics was a moving force in the precipitous escalation of force following their entry,which violated esparza constitutional rights.
the district court also found that the valles failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact on the deliberate indifference prong.although we find this a closer question than the district court apparently did,we ultimately conclude that the valles did not present evidence sufficient to survive summary judgment.deliberate indifference is a stringent standard,requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his action.bryan county,at quoting brown,at.internal quotation marks omitted.deliberate indifference is more than negligence or even gross negligence.see estate of davis city of richland hills,cir citation omitted.the valles must show that in light of the duties assigned to specific officers or employees the need for more or different training is so obvious,and the inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights,that the policymakers of the city can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.city of canton,at.usually a plaintiff must show a pattern of similar violations,and in the case of an excessive force claim,as here,the prior act must have involved injury to a third party.see,at.
the valles presented some evidence that the city decision not to implement the cit training proposal could potentially lead to the deprivation of constitutional rights.contrary to the district court findings,we think that the proposal was,at least in part,intended to address the potential for the unconstitutional use of excessive force against mentally ill persons.although the proposal does not explicitly state that it was intended to prevent constitutional violations,we think the use of magic words denoting that a policy is intended to address constitutional violations or liability are unnecessary the training proposal shows that city policymakers were aware that the cit program was being significantly underutilized,even though it was proven for helping officers safely situations involving individuals in serious mental health crises.the proposal explicitly acknowledged potential liability albeit without referencing arising from not using cit officers in situations that called for cit tactics.furthermore,it specifically referenced an example of a officer shooting and killing a mentally ill person,a factually similar situation to that here,and specifically referenced liability for failure to train.the reasonable inference from the proposal discussion of these liability issues is that the city was concerned about the potential for excessive force liability,even though no explicit mention of constitutional violations was ma
