facts and procedural history 
appellant david strachman represents the estates of husband and wife,yaron and efrat ungar,who were killed during a terrorist attack.in february,strachman,along with members of the ungar family and their representatives the ungars,obtained a default judgment against in rhode island federal district court pursuant to the civil provisions of the antiterrorism act of,see estates of ungar ex rel.strachman palestinian,d.that district court determined that its judgment was enforceable against the assets of the holy land foundation for relief and development hlf id.at.based on this judgment,federal district courts in new york,south carolina,and washington issued writs of execution against hlf that the ungars allege were levied in the respective jurisdictions on or before september.
meanwhile,on july,the united states filed a count indictment against hlf in federal district court for the northern district of texas.the indictment charged hlf with material support of a terrorist organization,tax evasion,and money laundering,and the government sought forfeiture of hlf property.in order to preserve hlf assets in the event of a conviction,the government sought a restraining order from the district court on september.the district court issued that order ex parte with the authority given it in the criminal forfeiture statute,e a.that order indefinitely froze the assets of hlf and its financial agents,including the bank accounts in new york,south carolina and washington.
the ungars were suddenly unable to obtain the funds upon which they levied,and which they believed belonged to them.they appealed the restraining order to this court,alleging,among other things,that it was entered without providing them adequate notice or a fair opportunity to be heard.on april,a panel of this court agreed with them.after deciding several jurisdictional and statutory questions,the panel concluded that it was constrained by our precedent in united states thier,cir,to apply the notice provisions of federal rule of civil procedure to the ex parte restraining order.therefore,the panel vacated the restraining order for noncompliance with rule and remanded the case to district court for any further proceedings.at.in doing so,the panel repeatedly explained that it was bound to follow thier until such time as it was overruled either by the supreme court or by our court sitting en banc.that time has come.
ii.standard of review 
ordinarily we review a district court order of injunction for abuse of discretion,but where,as here,the district court decision turns on the application of statutes or procedural rules,our review of that interpretation is de novo.castillo cameron county,cir although the district court decision to continue the injunctions is to be reviewed for an abuse of discretion,because the district court decision turns on the application of b of the prison litigation reform act,that interpretation is reviewed de novo.citations omitted.
iii.discussion 
we begin our inquiry with the question of the ungars standing to appeal the restraining order to this court.unlike the panel,however,our primary concern here is not with the three constitutional requirements of standing,per se.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d identifying three requirements that constitute irreducible constitutional minimum of standing injury in fact,causation,and redressability.the panel opinion properly dealt with the question of the ungars personal stake in the outcome of this controversy,and we have no reason to revisit that inquiry.at.indeed,even the government does not now challenge the legitimacy of the ungars interest in this case.rather,its more specific argument,and our primary concern,is whether the ungars are barred by statute from bringing their arguments to this court at this time.
the government argues that the ungars must pursue their interest in hlf property in accordance with the scheme set out in the federal criminal forfeiture statute,if this is true,then the ungars likely would have to wait until hlf criminal trial is over and,if hlf is convicted,assert their interest in a hearing in the district court.see n detailing hearing.at that hearing,the district judge would assess the primacy of their interest relative to that of the government and any other claimants,and distribute the property accordingly.the government urges,therefore,that this appeal is an attempt to circumvent that statutory scheme and must be dismissed.
the ungars respond in two ways.first,they assert that they are,in their words,the victims of a restraining order that was issued without notice or a hearing,and therefore our holding in thier,which extended rule protections to parties adverse to a criminal restraining order,allows them to appeal that order to this court.second,they argue that they need not wait for a hearing because a of the terrorism risk insurance act of tria,stat,trumps the criminal forfeiture statute.we consider these arguments in turn.
a.the ungars right to notice under thier 
the ungars argue that they have a right to appeal the district court restraining order to this court,rather than resort to the hearing,because we gave them that right in united states thier,cir.thier presented the case of a restraining order,issued by a district court pursuant to e a,which prevented a criminal defendant from disposing of his assets pending the outcome of his trial.id.at.the government had requested the order and put forth sufficient evidence to convince the district judge that thier might frustrate justice and endanger the government interest in these properties by placing them beyond the jurisdiction of the court.id.at.importantly,the court issued the order ex parte and ruled that it was to stay in effect until further ordered by the court.thier was served with a copy of the order the next day.at his request,the court later held a hearing to consider modifying the order,but declined to do so.thier then appealed to this court,alleging,inter alia,that the district court restraint of his assets without an adversary hearing violated his due process rights under the fifth amendment.
a panel of this court held that restraining orders and injunctions issued pursuant to e a would not offend due process so long as the requirements of federal rule of civil procedure were satisfied.id.at.rule provides certain procedural safeguards to the adverse party when a district court issues an injunction or restraining order.in the case of an ex parte restraining order,it states that such order is only effective for ten days unless the court chooses to extend it for one additional period for good cause,or the party against whom the order is directed consents to an extension.b thier,at.the ex parte restraining order in thier exceeded these hearing and duration limits,and so the panel remanded the case with directions to conduct a hearing on reasonable notice and in accordance with the other strictures of rule.thus,thier stands for the proposition that rule protects adverse parties whenever an injunction or restraining order is issued pursuant to the criminal forfeiture statute,e a.
the ungars argue that they are similarly situated to thier,that they are an adverse party as that term is used in rule,and that they were not given adequate notice or a hearing in the district court.accordingly,they maintain that they,like thier,have the right to appeal that order to this court.the panel considered this argument at great length and concluded that it was constrained by thier and its progeny to dissolve the restraining order.at.we are not so constrained.we decide,here and now,that thier is no longer the law of this circuit.
there are several reasons why we have chosen to overrule thier.first,shortly after the case was decided,it was called into doubt by the supreme court in united states monsanto,d.in fact,that opinion overruled thier insofar as thier applied a higher burden on the government than the probable cause standard to justify pretrial restraint of forfeitable assets.id.at.it is true that the court specifically declined to decide whether due process might require a hearing before a pretrial restraining order could be imposed,id.at,but the opinion nevertheless speaks in strong terms about the primacy we ought to give to the language of.it states that the language of is plain and unambiguous all assets falling within its scope are to be forfeited upon conviction,and that congress could not have chosen stronger words to express its intent that forfeiture be mandatory in cases where the statute applied,or broader words to define the scope of what was to be forfeited.id.at.this language strongly suggests that we need not read into the protections of a wholly separate rule of civil procedure in order to satisfy the requirements of due process.the apparent incongruity of the opinions recently prompted us to observe that s ome aspects of thier appear to be in tension with monsanto,and future cases may need to consider whether certain portions of thier were overruled.melrose east subdivision,at.
in addition to the spirit of monsanto,however,we are overruling thier because it is out of step with the reasoning of several of our sister circuits most circuits that have spoken to the issue do not resort to rule guarantee of a hearing to satisfy due process,but they also do not hold that a hearing is never required.rather,they rely on the test of mathews eldridge,d,to determine when a hearing is required.see,united states jones,cir united states monsanto,cir on remand from,d united states,cir united states harvey,cir,superceded as to other issues,in re forfeiture hearing as to caplin drysdale,chartered,cir en banc,aff,d.under this method,which we adopt,when the government is seeking forfeiture and secures an indictment to that effect based on probable cause,a court may issue a restraining order without prior notice or a hearing.in some cases,however,due process will require that the district court then promptly hold a hearing at which the property owner can contest the restraining order,without waiting until trial to do so.to determine when such a hearing is required,we consider the three eldridge factors the private interest that will be affected by the restraint the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and finally,the government interest,including the burdens that the hearing would entail.at.as we observed in melrose east subdivision,circuits employing this test have found that a property owner interest is particularly great when he or she needs the restrained assets to pay for legal defense on associated criminal charges,or to cover ordinary and reasonable living expenses.see melrose east subdivision,at collecting cases.
we note that the ninth circuit still adheres to the view expressed in thier,that the protections of rule apply to all injunctions and restraining orders under e a.see united states roth,cir.on the other end of the spectrum,the eleventh circuit maintains that no pretrial hearing is ever required,even when the restrained assets are needed to pay counsel.see united states register,cir we appear to be the only circuit holding that,although restraint of assets needed to retain counsel implicates the due process clause,the trial itself satisfies this requirement.citing united states bissell,cir.with due respect to both of those circuits,we believe the rule we adopt strikes an appropriate balance between those views.it will spare the government from frivolous challenges that might impede its ongoing criminal investigations,but does so without jeopardizing the rights of property owners to access their assets in a timely fashion when necessary.
returning now to the ungars,we find that their claim is substantially affected by our decision to overturn thier.it was thier that incorporated federal rule of civil procedure,with its procedural safeguards for adverse parties.that language,in turn,allowed the ungars to bring their due process claim to this court,for even though they were not parties to the underlying criminal action,the panel did consider them to be adverse parties for purposes of rule at.under the rule we announce today,however,there is no need to consider rule,and there are no such protections for adverse parties.instead,if the ungars wish to challenge the district court order,they must be able to satisfy the eldridge factors.we turn now to the question of whether they can do so.
b.the ungars interest in the forfeitable assets 
the ungars argued before the panel that the district court in texas had no jurisdiction to restrain the bank accounts in question because other courts in new york,south carolina and washington had already levied writs of execution against those accounts,rendering them in custodia legis the panel considered this argument at great length,examined the status of each account individually,and concluded 
our review of the record reveals that none of the levies was perfected so as to transfer possession or control of hlf interest in the bank accounts to the respective federal district courts or to the ungars in such a manner that the ungars may now challenge the texas district court jurisdiction to enter the restraining order.
at emphasis added.this reasoning was sound,and it bears directly on the question of the ungars property interest in the accounts.therefore,before going forward,we note that the entire portion of the panel opinion explaining that jurisdiction was not defeated on this basis,specifically part,is hereby reinstated.at.
having accepted the panel conclusion that the ungars had no perfected property interest in the subject accounts,we find that the private interest affected by the restraint in this case is minimal at best accordingly,they do not have any right under eldridge to request a hearing at this time,nor do they have any right to appeal the district court restraining order to this court.they are simply judgment creditors,and while they may have a viable claim on the assets of hlf,there is currently no legal basis for them to appeal a restraining order on those assets.in fact,the relevant law is to be found in the criminal forfeiture statute itself,which lays out a detailed scheme by which claimants like the ungars can assert their interest in the restrained assets.
claims under 
the criminal forfeiture statute is designed to balance the government interest in efficient and orderly prosecution with the rights of defendants and third parties who claim an interest in forfeitable property.two key provisions of the statute make clear that the ungars may not intercede in the pending hlf prosecution at this time,at least not in the fashion in which they have done so 
section k reads 
except as provided in subsection n of this section,no party claiming an interest in property subject to forfeiture under this section may 
intervene in a trial or appeal of a criminal case involving the forfeiture of such property under this section or 
commence an action at law or equity against the united states concerning the validity of his alleged interest in the property subsequent to the filing of an indictment or information alleging that the property is subject to forfeiture under this section.
this bar on intervention makes an exception for the process set out in section n.that section,in turn,makes plain that the ungars will have a chance to assert their interest in the subject property,but only after the termina
