plaintiff kristin blair,a virginia resident,brought this action against defender services,defender,a south carolina corporation,for injuries sustained as a result of a violent attack upon her by james lee harris,an employee of defender.alleging claims against defender for negligent hiring,retention and supervision and for respondeat superior liability,blair filed a complaint in the circuit court for the city of roanoke,virginia.the case was duly removed to the united states district court for the western district of virginia on the basis of diversity of citizenship,pursuant to,and.subsequently,the district court granted defender motion for dismissal as to the negligent supervision count,pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure upon the conclusion of discovery,defender moved for summary judgment as to the remaining three claims.the district court entered summary judgment for defender on all three counts,and blair now appeals.we affirm the decision of the district court as to respondeat superior liability,but reverse that court entry of judgment for defender on the claims of negligent hiring and negligent retention,and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
this court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo and applies the same standard as the district court.temkin frederick county comm rs,cir,cert.denied,d baber hospital of america,cir.federal rule of civil procedure provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings,depositions,interrogatories and affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.we have previously noted that,when the moving party has met its responsibility of identifying the basis of its motion,the party must come forward with specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.white radiologists,cir quoting celotex catrett,d.in its review,this court must view such facts and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the party then a dispute over a material fact is genuine.anderson liberty lobby,d.
in conducting this analysis,this court recognizes that the instant action was filed in virginia state court and removed to federal court based upon diversity of citizenship.accordingly,the choice of law of virginia applies.see klaxon stentor electric.in evaluating the facts in the light most favorable to the party,we will apply virginia substantive law consistent with virginia lex loci delicti,the law of the place of the wrong.see,jones jones.law buchanan doe.law.
on the morning of march,at approximately,kristin blair blair,a college freshman at virginia polytechnic institute and state university virginia tech,entered the digital art classroom in henderson hall on the virginia tech campus to work on a project prior to the commencement of a class session.when blair arrived,other students were completing a class in the room.by,all but a few of these students had departed.around that time,a man wearing blue jeans and a gray with a colorful logo entered the room and soon departed.a few minutes later,that same man returned and asked blair,who was now alone in the classroom,when the next class started.
at approximately,blair left the classroom and observed the same man standing in the middle of the hallway,with a large gray bucket beside him.after walking to the end of the hallway,blair entered a unisex bathroom.when she opened the restroom door to leave,the same man was standing in the doorway.suddenly,this individual grabbed blair by her neck and pushed her back into the bathroom.while straddling blair and using both hands to strangle her,the attacker pushed her to the floor.blair lost consciousness during the attack.she awoke on the bathroom floor,with her face swollen to the extent that she only could see out of one eye blair then left the bathroom and began screaming for help.a member of the virginia tech administrative staff approached her and asked,who did this.blair pointed to the same man whom she had seen earlier,and who was standing in the hallway.
the man identified by blair was james lee harris,an employee of defender,which,pursuant to a contract,provided janitorial staffing services on virginia tech campus eleven months prior to his attack on blair,a protective order had been issued against harris in the giles county juvenile and domestic relations court this protective order resulted from a criminal complaint having been filed by a woman who had been physically assaulted by harris at a restaurant.
harris previously had worked for defender during a brief period from november until january.at that time,defender required harris to complete an application that included a question concerning any criminal charges,to which harris answered that he had no prior criminal convictions.pursuant to a contract with virginia tech,defender assigned harris to perform custodial work at virginia tech under virginia tech supervision.that contract required defender to perform criminal background checks on all defender personnel assigned to the virginia tech campus.a criminal background check of harris was not completed by defender during this period.
in january of,harris quit his employment with defender,and became employed directly by virginia tech for approximately one year.harris returned to the employment of defender for a brief two weeks in october of.once again harris completed another application and indicated no criminal convictions.defender did not conduct a criminal background check with respect to harris during this second brief period of employment.
on february,defender once again hired harris.unlike harris prior employment with defender,he was not required to complete any application on this third occasion.as with the previous occasions,defender did not conduct a criminal background check on harris prior to his employment.defender representatives did,however,contact some of the personal references provided by harris.while harris did not have a record of any criminal convictions,he was subject to the aforementioned court protective order in neighboring giles county.
at all times,the contract between defender and virginia tech specifically required defender to perform criminal background checks on all personnel assigned to virginia tech property.expert testimony offered in opposition to defender motion for summary judgment presented the view that defender screening of harris was inadequate.specifically,there was evidence that defender would have discovered that harris was the subject of a protective order and criminal complaint in the neighboring county if a background investigation had been conducted as required.
a.the respondeat superior claim 
the supreme court of virginia in the cases of gina chin assocs.first union bank,and majorana crown cent.petroleum,both decided on the same day and authored by justice lawrence koontz,addressed the elements of a claim against an employer for the wrongful acts of an employee based on the doctrine of respondeat superior.in gina chin,the court noted that a lmost from its first consideration by the courts of this commonwealth the determination of the issue of whether the employee wrongful act was within the scope of his employment under the facts of a particular case has proved vexatious.at citations omitted.in majorana,the court explained that 
when the plaintiff presents evidence sufficient to show the existence of an relationship,she has established a prima facie case triggering a presumption of liability the burden of production then shifts to the employer,who may rebut that presumption by proving that the employee had departed from the scope of the employment relationship at the time the injurious act was committed.
at citations omitted.
the district court correctly viewed all facts in the light most favorable to blair in assuming that harris was an employee of defender at the time of the attack on march.this court concurs that blair has met her burden in presenting sufficient evidence that harris was an employee of defender.however,any presumption of liability may be rebutted by proof that harris had departed from the scope of that employment.
even viewing the facts in the light most favorable to blair on this issue,we find that the district court correctly concluded that harris actions had nothing to do with his performance of janitorial services.the district judge thoroughly reviewed applicable virginia law in reaching this conclusion.
it is well established that the simple fact that an employee is at a particular location at a specific time as a result of his employment is not sufficient to impose respondeat superior liability on the employer.cary hotel rueger.however,as the district court noted,virginia courts have not automatically placed intentional torts outside the scope of employment for purposes of vicarious liability.see,davis merrill.the district judge correctly noted that the test set forth in the gina chin case is whether the service itself,in which the tortious act was done,was within the ordinary course of the employer business.gina chin,at.
in gina chin,supra,the supreme court of virginia noted its earlier opinion in kensington associates west.law.in that case,the court reversed a jury verdict in favor of a worker,and entered final judgment in favor of the employer of an individual who had engaged in horseplay in shooting the plaintiff.at.the court noted that this horseplay was not done to further the employer interest,and also noted its earlier opinion in abernathy romaczyk.id.in abernathy,the court reversed a jury verdict and held as a matter of law that a delivery man was not acting within the scope of his employment when he participated in a scuffle over who had caused a traffic accident.at.
the present case falls within the ambit of these virginia cases.harris assault on blair is clearly distinguishable from situations where the employee wrongful conduct was related to the nature of the employment.in the gina chin case,a bank teller embezzled money,while in the majorana case,a gas station employee sexually harassed a customer during payment by the customer.when harris embarked on independent acts to attack blair,he clearly acted outside the scope of his employment.we hold that this act was so great a deviation from defender business that the district court correctly granted defender motion for summary judgment on the respondeat superior liability claim as a matter of law.
b.the negligent hiring and negligent retention claims 
the recognition of claims for negligent hiring and negligent retention can be traced in virginia case law to the opinion of the supreme court of virginia in big stone gap iron ketron,am.see courtney ross stores.cir.lexis.cir,tracing history of negligent hiring and retention under virginia state law.in big stone,the court recognized a duty of a company to exercise reasonable care in a hiring decision,and a distinction between the hiring and the retention of an employee.at.subsequently,the supreme court of virginia explicitly recognized the independent torts of negligent hiring in davis merrill,and negligent retention in norfolk protestant hospital plunkett.
in victory tabernacle baptist church.law,the virginia supreme court held that allegations of negligent hiring had set forth a cause of action under virginia law.in that case,the mother of a girl brought suit against a church and its pastor as a result of the rape and sexual assault of the girl by an employee of the church.victory tabernacle,at.it was alleged that when the church hired this employee it knew,or should have known,that the employee had recently been convicted of aggravated sexual assault on a young girl,that he was on probation for the offense,and that a condition of his probation was that he not be involved with children.id.
the defendants filed a demurrer,contending that the plaintiff had failed to state a cause of action.id.the supreme court of virginia specifically addressed only whether the allegations of negligent hiring state a cause of action in virginia.id.at.in reversing the trial court granting of a demurrer on this question,the court held that the plaintiff had asserted a claim of negligent hiring,distinct from a claim for respondeat superior liability.id.the court discussed at length its earlier opinion in davis merrill,supra,noting that when the wrongdoing employee in that case was interviewed no one made inquiry concerning his past record,habits,or general fitness,and further commented to the effect that had the employer investigated,it probably would not have offered the assailant the job.id.at.
in the instant case,the district court found that no reasonable trier of fact could find that defender knew or should have known of harris criminal problems in the neighboring county some eleven months earlier.we respectfully disagree.there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether defender should have known of harris violent conduct,as the undisputed facts are that defender never conducted any type of criminal background check on harris prior to employing him.while defender can certainly argue that such a background check would not have resulted in the discovery of the protective order issued in april,and a jury could certainly so find,there is expert testimony proffered by blair that a background check would have indicated the existence of a protective order resulting from a criminal complaint.
the trial court and defender placed great reliance on the virginia supreme court opinion in southeast apts,jackman.in that case,a tenant was molested by a maintenance person of the apartment building after his entry into her apartment.the tenant claimed that the owner of the apartment building breached its duty to exercise reasonable care in the hiring of its employee or in the retention of the employee.at.the court noted its earlier opinions in victory tabernacle,supra,and davis merrill,supra,in establishing the tort of negligent hiring.in providing further edification of this tort,the court cited the following summary provided by a minnesota state court 
liability is predicated on the negligence of an employer in placing a person with known propensities,or propensities which should have been discovered by reasonable investigation,in an employment position in which,because of the circumstances of the employment,it should have been foreseeable that the hired individual posed a threat of injury to others.
id.at citing ponticas.
in the southeast apts.decision,the virginia supreme court further noted its recognition of the tort of negligent retention in its earlier opinion in philip morris,emerson.law.the court in southeast apts.stated that the tort of negligent retention was based on the principle that an employer owning leased premises is subject to liability for harm resulting from the employer negligence in retaining a dangerous employee who the employer knew or should have known was dangerous and likely to harm tenants.at.similarly,this court recognized this principle of virginia law in our opinion in barrett applied radiant energy,cir.
in applying the above principles to the facts before it,the court in southeast apts.held that the evidence was insufficient to make out a prima facie case of negligent hiring or negligent retention.at.the facts presented in southeast apts.were that the owner had received a detailed application containing information about the employee personal background,work experience,and behavioral history.id.in responding to the application inquiry,the employee denied any engagement in types of criminal behavior,except traffic violations,he denied any criminal convictions in the past seven years.addition to the thorough steps taken by the employer,the evidence in southeast apts.indicated that the wrongdoing employee had two previous charges totaling.id.importantly,there were no criminal convictions or protective orders involving violent acts perpetrated on women.id.
the facts in the instant case are clearly distinguishable from those found in southeast,and are much closer to the facts addressed by the supreme court of virginia in victory tabernacle,supra.in the present
