factual and procedural background 
molly harvill brought this action alleging that she had been repeatedly subjected to sexual harassment by a.in january of,she began working with the grand saline sun the sun as an office manager for the newspaper.the paper is owned by westward communications.during a new employee orientation,harvill received a company handbook that included an explanation of the company policies.the handbook stated that if an employee believed that she was being harassed,she was to directly inform her immediate supervisor.if speaking with the supervisor did not provide sufficient recourse,then the employee must direct her complaint to the director of human resources.
on october,harvill,along with fellow employee ladonna allison hockman hockman,alleged to their immediate supervisor nell french,the publisher of the sun,that they had been sexually harassed by oscar rogers,who operated a commercial printing press within the sun offices.french then initiated an investigation into the allegations,speaking with several female employees of the sun about whether they were cognizant of any inappropriate behavior by rogers.additionally,french spoke with former employees to determine whether they too had information regarding allegations of rogers having sexually harassed female employees at the sun however,french never spoke with rogers,who remained unaware of any sexual harassment allegations being made against him.
harvill claimed that rogers continued to sexually harass her even after she had reported his conduct to french.harvill approached french two or three times to inform her that rogers inappropriate behavior was continuing.finally,in february of,harvill informed westward that she would be filing an eeoc charge against the company based on rogers continuing conduct.gina fisher,westward director of human resources,then launched her own investigation.fisher contacted rogers and informed him that sexual harassment allegations had been made against him.fisher also alerted french that harvill claimed that she was still being harassed by rogers.fisher further spoke with an employee of the sun named aggie mcdonald.harvill and hockman claimed that mcdonald would substantiate their claims.mcdonald had alleged that rogers had accidently brushed up against her more than a decade earlier however,contrary to harvill representation of mcdonald declarations,mcdonald told fisher that she did not believe that he had intended anything untoward.indeed,mcdonald asserted that,to her knowledge,rogers had never behaved inappropriately towards any female employee.
harvill and fisher scheduled a telephone conversation for february,during which harvill described rogers conduct towards her,which included several alleged instances of lewd and inappropriate touching.when fisher queried harvill as to why harvill had not brought these complaints to her earlier,harvill asserted that she had been expressly instructed by her supervisor french not to ever go above french head on any matters.
fisher immediately ordered that rogers no longer work in close physical proximity to either harvill or hockman,who had both made allegations of sexual harassment against him.fisher continued to interview numerous former and current employees of the sun.fisher investigation uncovered no evidence specifically corroborating harvill or hockman allegations regarding rogers.on march,fisher informed both rogers and french of the results of her investigation.she also instructed rogers to avoid direct interaction with harvill and hockman.less than a week later,fisher met with harvill and informed harvill that she was unable to uncover sufficient corroborating evidence to support harvill allegations and warrant further company action against rogers.
on march,harvill sought leave under the family medical leave act fmla,et.she was informed by fisher that her job and benefits would remain in place,and that her leave fell under the auspices of the fmla.within a relatively short period of time after she had taken her leave,harvill tendered her resignation,asserting that this was at the behest of her physician.shortly thereafter,harvill brought this action claiming,inter alia,sexual harassment,constructive discharge,and retaliation.westward eventually moved for summary judgment,and the motion was granted.this timely appeal ensued.

sexual harassment claim 
harvill first argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for westward on her sexual harassment claim because substantial evidence exists that the harassing conduct was severe or pervasive,and that her employer failed to take prompt remedial action.
harvill can establish that she was sexually harassed in violation of title vii by proving,inter alia,that the harassment created a hostile or abusive working environment.woods delta beverage group,cir.to establish a hostile work environment claim,harvill must demonstrate that she is member of a protected group she was the victim of uninvited sexual harassment the harassment was based on sex the harassment affected a term,condition,or privilege of harvill employment and her employer knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt remedial action.id.at.
the parties agree that harvill has established the first three elements of her prima facie case they only dispute whether the harassment affected a term,condition,or privilege of harvill employment,and whether westward knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt remedial measures.
whether the harassment affected a term,condition,or privilege of employment 
for sexual harassment to be actionable,it must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment.meritor sav.bank,fsb vinson,d alteration in original quoting henson city of dundee,cir.in determining whether an environment is hostile or abusive within the meaning of title vii,courts look at the totality of the circumstances including the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.harris forklift,d.we have also considered whether the complained of conduct undermines the plaintiff workplace competence.hockman westward commc ns,cir citing butler ysleta indep.sch,cir.to be actionable,the challenged conduct must be both objectively offensive,meaning that a reasonable person would find it hostile and abusive,and subjectively offensive,meaning that the victim perceived it to be so.shepherd comptroller of pub.accounts,cir citing harris,at.
the district court held that the harassment by rogers was not so severe and pervasive that it altered the terms and conditions of harvill employment.in requiring harvill to establish that the conduct was both severe and pervasive,the district court applied the wrong legal standard.as quoted above,the supreme court has stated that title vii provides a legal remedy to victims who establish that the abusive conduct was severe or pervasive.meritor,at.see also harris,at.clark county sch.dist.breeden,d faragher boca raton,d quoting meritor,at.burlington,ellerth,d hostetler quality dining,cir harassment need not be severe and pervasive to impose liability one or the other will do.the district court error may have resulted from inconsistent application of the severe or pervasive standard in this circuit.compare hockman,at,severe and pervasive,and shepherd,at same quoting weller citation oil gas,cir,with septimus of houston,cir severe or pervasive,horizon health care,cir same,carmon lubrizol,cir same,and indest freeman decorating,cir weiner,specially concurring emphasizing that the standard is the disjunctive severe or pervasive.nevertheless,the supreme court decisions are controlling and we correctly stated the standard originally in waltman international paper,cir therefore,subsequent incorrect statements of the test are not binding.see,tire,pitney bowes,cir when panel opinions appear to conflict,we are bound to follow the earlier opinion.
contrary to being an irrelevant distinction,as westward counsel asserts,the requirement that a plaintiff establish that reported abusive conduct be both severe and pervasive in order to be actionable imposes a more stringent burden on the plaintiff than required by law.the supreme court has stated that isolated incidents,if egregious,can alter the terms and conditions of employment.see faragher,at.see also worth tyer,cir w e have often recognized that even one act of harassment will suffice to create a hostile work environment if it is egregious.lockard pizza hut,cir holding that a single incident of physically threatening and humiliating conduct can be sufficient to create a hostile work environment for a sexual harassment claim tomka seiler,cir,abrogated on other grounds by burlington,ellerth,d e ven a single incident of sexual assault sufficiently alters the conditions of the victim employment and clearly creates an abusive work environment for the purposes of title vii liability.by contrast,under a conjunctive standard,infrequent conduct,even if egregious,would not be actionable because it would not be pervasive.
harvill alleges that rogers harassment began in july and continued until gina fisher,the director of human resources,confronted rogers with the allegations in february.in her deposition,harvill testified that,during that period,rogers grabbed her and kissed her on the cheek,popped rubber bands at her breasts,fondled her breasts numerous times,patted her on her buttocks numerous times,and came behind her and rubbed his body against her.at one point,harvill estimated that rogers touched her breasts or her buttocks perhaps as often as once a she later stated that it may not have been as often as once a week.she also claims that on one occasion rogers made comments to her about her sex life and her abilities in bed.harvill stated that she protested every time rogers touched her breasts and she also protested when rogers would pat her buttocks.undoubtedly,the deliberate and unwanted touching of harvill intimate body parts can constitute severe sexual harassment.see,worth,at d irect contact with an intimate body part constitutes one of the most severe forms of sexual harassment.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to harvill,the,we conclude that a reasonable jury could find that rogers conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter a term or condition of harvill employment.see matsushita indus.zenith radio,d stating that the inquiry on summary judgment is whether the evidence could lead a rational trier of fact to find for the party see also anderson liberty lobby,d.
the district court concluded,and westward stringently urges on appeal,that harvill allegations of numerous touchings or fondlings and numerous butt grabbings were too conclusory as to create an issue of material fact on her harassment claim.harvill westward communications,llc,d.we disagree.harvill recalled that the first incident of harassment occurred in july,after rogers had returned from a vacation and she walked back to his office area to give him a message.she contends that he used the opportunity to grab her and kiss her on her cheek.she stated that sometime after that,rogers touched her breast for the first time in the hallway leading to the front office,and she described the exchange that occurred as a result of the touching.she recalled the circumstances surrounding occasions when rogers popped rubber bands at her breast and patted her on her buttocks,and she listed individuals who allegedly witnessed the events.additionally,she recalled a conversation in which rogers questioned her about her sex life and told her that a technician from ramirez air conditioning,who she had dated many years prior,had allegedly told him that she was skilled in bed.we do not agree that harvill allegations are too conclusory to permit a fact finder to assess the totality of the circumstances.harvill assertions that she was touched numerous times instead of providing exact dates or the exact number of instances do not render her allegations so conclusory that they fail to create a genuine issue of material fact.torres pisano,cir finding that the ability to recall the exact dates and circumstances of only a few of the incidents of harassment may make it difficult to convince a jury that pervasive harassment in fact took place,but do not defeat the plaintiff claim as a matter of law.to require that harvill provide precise dates for the occurrences or provide an exact number of occurrences to support her allegations is an onerous burden not required by law.whether her allegations are too vague to ultimately carry the day is a credibility determination,or requires weighing the evidence,both of which are more appropriately done by the trier of fact.see moore willis indep.sch,cir stating that the court can not make credibility determinations or weigh any evidence on a summary judgment motion.accordingly,the district court erred in concluding that harvill did not raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether rogers alleged conduct towards harvill was sufficiently severe and such that it altered the terms and conditions of her employment.
whether westward failed to take prompt remedial action 
the district court also held that harvill failed to establish the fifth prong of a prima facie case for a hostile work environment sexual harassment claim specifically,she did not show that westward failed to take prompt remedial action upon being informed of the harassment.
we have observed that determining w hether an employer response to discriminatory conduct is sufficient will necessarily depend on the particular facts of the case,such as the remedial steps taken and the severity of the harassment.hirras.passenger,cir quoting waltman,at.when a company,once informed of allegations of sexual harassment,takes prompt remedial action to protect the claimant,the company may avoid title vii liability.nash electrospace,cir.prompt remedial action must be reasonably calculated to end the harassment,therefore,westward may be held liable despite having taken remedial steps if harvill can establish that westward response was not reasonabl
