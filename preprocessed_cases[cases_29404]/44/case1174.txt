opinion of the court 
in this appeal from the district court award of declaratory judgment in favor of defendant jan kopacz,and against plaintiff delaware river bay authority drba,we are called upon to decide two issues of admiralty law whether commuter seamen,who eat and sleep on land,are entitled to maintenance and cure payment from a shipowner to a seaman to cover medical,food,and lodging expenses during the seaman recovery from illness or injury and if so,whether a shipowner is relieved of its maintenance and cure obligation when the injured seaman receives social security disability benefits and disability payments provided by the shipowner.relying on our opinions in barnes andover company,cir,and shaw ohio river company,cir,the district court concluded that commuter seamen are entitled to maintenance and cure,independent of other benefits paid to the seaman.accordingly,the district court awarded kopacz maintenance of,plus prejudgment interest of,but denied kopacz claim for consequential damages,including lost wages,pain and suffering,and attorney fees and costs.both parties timely appealed.
drba central contention on appeal is that payment of maintenance would produce a double recovery,because kopacz wages already enabled him to procure food and housing on land,and because social security disability and disability payments made to kopacz adequately covered his living expenses.drba argues,further,that the award of prejudgment interest was punitive and thus impermissible.the sole argument advanced in kopacz is that consequential damages were improperly denied.finding no error in the district court thoughtful resolution of these issues,we will affirm its order.
background 
maintenance is the payment by a shipowner to a sailor for the sailor food and lodging costs incurred while he is ashore as a result of illness or accident.barnes,at.a common law remedy,maintenance,derived from medieval maritime codes,was incorporated into american jurisprudence nearly two centuries ago.harden gordon,see the osceola.its original purpose was clear and ensure injured seamen funds adequate to cover basic living expenses during their recovery.the imposition of such a duty,it was felt,would benefit both shipowners and seamen,by encouraging shipowners to implement appropriate safeguards to protect sailors,and by encouraging seamen to undertake hazardous voyages 
seamen are by the peculiarity of their lives liable to sudden sickness from change of climate,exposure to perils,and exhausting labour.they are generally poor and friendless,and acquire habits of gross indulgence,carelessness,and improvidence.if some provision be not made for them in sickness at the expense of the ship,they must often in foreign ports suffer the accumulated evils of disease,and poverty,and sometimes perish from the want of suitable nourishment if these expenses are a charge upon the ship,the interest of the owner will be immediately connected with that of the seamen.the master will watch over their health with vigilance and fidelity even the merchant himself derives an ultimate benefit from what may seem at first an onerous charge.it encourages seamen to engage in perilous voyages with more promptitude,and at lower wages.it diminishes the temptation to plunderage upon the approach of sickness and urges the seamen to encounter hazards in the ship service,from which they might otherwise be disposed to withdraw.
barnes,at quoting harden.at.
since harden was decided almost years ago,the lot of the poor and friendless seaman has improved considerably.as we noted in barnes,union contracts may guarantee sailors a host of benefits,including overtime and premium pay,vacation allowances,disability pensions,and various amenities,including televisions and washers and dryers.at.the emergence of these benefits,however,has not diminished our historic solicitude toward seamen,who continue to be viewed by the law as wards of the admiralty.id.at.accordingly,maintenance,a duty that is annexed to the employment contract,that attaches once the seaman enters the service of the ship,and that no private agreement is competent to abrogate,has retained its vitality in the modern era.id.at.
drba guarantees many of the benefits discussed above to its seamen.the interaction of these benefits and the maintenance obligation lies at the heart of this appeal.
a permanent employee of drba who suffers an injury on the job is entitled to full wages for the first days of disability.thereafter,the employee is entitled to benefits equivalent to of his wages,which are paid through a disability ltd policy funded wholly by drba,and administered by hartford insurance company hartford the personnel manual provided to kopacz sets forth the purpose of ltd provide a continuing income should the employee ability to earn a living be interrupted or terminated by a prolonged disability.
the duty to provide ltd benefits stems from a provision in the collective bargaining agreement between drba and its marine employees,providing that,employer agrees to continue to provide all permanent employees disability plans that are offered to employees generally.the agreement makes no mention of maintenance payments,and drba does not maintain an insurance policy specifically to cover its maintenance obligation to seamen.
in the event of a delay in the payment of ltd benefits,an injured sailor also receives the value of his sick and annual leave.according to drba risk manager,bonnie miller,the payment of annual leave is distinct from maintenance and is merely a to enable an injured seaman to cover his living expenses during the pendency of his ltd application.
kopacz suffered a debilitating back injury in december and was subsequently deemed unfit to return to duty by drba.as a permanent employee,kopacz received his full wages for days following the date of his disability,equivalent to approximately.kopacz also received the value of his sick and annual leave,equivalent to approximately.thereafter,hartford paid kopacz monthly ltd benefits of for months,beginning in april and ending in september drba did not make separate maintenance payments to kopacz,nor did kopacz request them.
because hartford also required injured seamen to apply for social security disability ssd benefits,which,if approved,would be deducted from monthly ltd benefits,kopacz submitted an application for ssd benefits in october.after approval of kopacz application,the social security administration transmitted a check to him in the amount of,representing his total benefits retroactive to july,and thereafter provided monthly payments of.
upon discovering the payment of,hartford demanded reimbursement of slightly less than this and advised kopacz that his ltd benefit would thereafter be reduced by the amount of his monthly ssd payment.after kopacz refused to reimburse hartford,it suspended payment of ltd benefits.shortly thereafter,kopacz advised drba that it,not he,was required to reimburse hartford for this sum when drba declined to do so,this suit followed.
drba sued kopacz in the united states district court for the district of delaware,seeking a declaratory judgment that drba did not owe kopacz maintenance and cure.after a bench trial,the district court concluded that kopacz was entitled to maintenance in the amount of,plus prejudgment interest of.however,the district court denied kopacz claim for consequential damages,including lost wages,pain and suffering,and attorney fees and costs both parties timely appealed 
drba contends that commuter seamen,who eat and sleep ashore,are ineligible for maintenance.it also argues,in the alternative,that the district court should have deducted other payments made to kopacz,including ltd and ssd,from the amount of maintenance owed to result that,drba maintains,is necessary to avoid double recovery.further,drba contends that the award of prejudgment was punitive,rather than compensatory,and thus impermissible.kopacz urges that the district court improperly denied his claim for consequential damages.
ii.discussion 
commuter seamen 
drba asks the court to adopt a per se rule denying maintenance to commuter seamen.drba observes that the rationale for provide seamen compensation equivalent to food and lodging received at inapplicable to commuter seamen,who eat and sleep ashore.drba argues,further,that the wages of commuter seamen are already computed with the expectation that they will pay for their own food and housing expenses on land and,therefore,an award of maintenance would produce an unjustified windfall.drba maintains that,based on these concerns,we left open the question of whether commuter seamen are entitled to maintenance in barnes,at.
our inquiry begins with barnes.there,we considered whether a blue water seaman,who maintained a home ashore,was entitled to include in his calculation of maintenance expenses incurred in connection with his permanent lodging,or whether he was solely permitted to recover the incremental costs attributable to his presence on land,including food,laundry,and gas.in approving barnes recovery of costs associated with his permanent lodging,we cited precedents awarding maintenance to commuter seamen 
many of the reasons given by the courts for awarding maintenance to seamen who,by definition,ordinarily incur their own expenses for food and lodging are also applicable to inclusion in maintenance of the prorated costs of permanent lodging by a blue water seaman the status of seamen as wards of the admiralty,weiss,at duplantis.at consistency with maritime tradition,weiss,at duplantis.at and the need to provide support to those who are ineligible for workman compensation or other means of support.weiss,at.
despite our reliance on these precedents in barnes,drba insists,this circuit has left open the question of whether a commuter seaman,such as kopacz,is even entitled to maintenance in the first place.appellant br.at.although barnes acknowledged that there was some logic in denying maintenance to seamen,the court stressed that the life of the law is experience,not logic.id.at.barnes then reiterated congress and the supreme court solicitude to seamen,the liberal attitude regarding the scope of maintenance,and the interpretative canon requiring that ambiguities in regard to maintenance be resolved in favor of the seaman all considerations that,barnes concluded,supported an expansive understanding of the right to maintenance.id.at,citing vaughan atkinson,d.barnes also quoted at length from an opinion rejecting a position identical to that urged by drba 
to deny maintenance to a seaman because he does not receive lodging and meals aboard ship raises problems that would distort the simple lines of the maintenance remedy indeed,the rationale that maintenance is allowable only when meals would have been served aboard challenges the now well settled doctrine that the disabled seaman is entitled to be paid maintenance beyond the end of his voyage,for were maintenance to be allowed only for those days during which the ship would have served him meals,it would end when the voyage was over.
id.at quoting hudspeth atlantic gulf stevedores,see smith.bay launch,see also crooks united states,cir t he maintenance remedy should be kept simple,uncluttered by fine distinctions which breed litigation,with its attendant delays and expenses.internal citation omitted.hence,barnes strongly suggested that commuter seamen are also entitled to maintenance.
today,we make explicit what was implicit in barnes commuter seamen enjoy the same right to maintenance as their blue water counterparts.although drba concerns relating to other payments have merit,we do not write on a blank slate.id.at noting the court clear and frequent pronouncements that seamen remain wards of the admiralty.rather,our analysis is informed by nearly two centuries of jurisprudence consistently expand ing the scope of the right to maintenance.id.at.in vaughan,decided over one hundred years after the introduction of maintenance into admiralty law,the supreme court stressed the continued status of seamen as wards of admiralty and the need for liberal interpretation of the maintenance obligation.at.
notwithstanding our dissenting colleague vigorous argument that the maintenance and cure obligation does not arise when the seaman is a commuter,we find no such limiting inclination to curtail this historic the applicable jurisprudence as much as we might have expected the supreme court in to modify the traditional maintenance obligation to reflect changes in the modern seaman lifestyle,it did no such thing.to the contrary,the court,stressing the expansive nature of this right,declined to fashion exceptions to the shipowner longstanding duty to provide maintenance and cure 
admiralty courts have been liberal in interpreting this duty for the benefit and protection of seamen who are its wards.we noted in aguilar standard oil,that the shipowner liability for maintenance and cure was among the most pervasive of all and that it was not to be defeated by restrictive distinctions nor narrowly confined.when there are ambiguities or doubts,they are resolved in favor of the seaman.
id.at internal citations omitted.and,in fact,drba cites no authority supporting withholding maintenance from commuter seamen.see id.at quoting weiss central of,cir we know of no authority for holding that a seaman is not entitled to the traditional privileges of his status merely because his voyages are short,because he sleeps ashore,or for other reasons his lot is more pleasant than that of most of his brethren.bailey city of,cir awarding maintenance to seaman after finding no authority for narrow construction of the right see also crooks,at thus we find the obligation of maintenance enforced even where maritime compensation did not include board and the seaman was expected to pay for his meals out of his wages.no matter what the terms of his maritime employment were,during the period of his disability he was entitled to be provided with maintenance as well as cure.the city of avalon,cir holding that seaman could recover cost of food as element of maintenance,even where shipowner had not paid for his meals.
in short,t he supreme court has shown no inclination to depart from its solicitude for seamen,despite the protections afforded modern seamen.barnes,at.until it does so,we decline to depart from the uniformly enforced rule entitling deep water and commuter seamen to maintenance.weiss,at.
disability benefits 
having established kopacz general eligibility for maintenance,we turn to drba alternative ltd payments satisfied its maintenance obligation.shaw ohio river company governs when other payments received by an injured seamen satisfy a shipowner maintenance obligation.at.there,we considered whether benefits paid to a seaman under a disability policy funded by the shipowner,and administered by prudential insurance company prudential,relieved the shipowner of its maintenance duty.id.we attached primary importance to the character of the benefit conferred.id.we explained that where a benefit is part of the seaman wage package,it will be deemed separate and independent of the shipowner maintenance obligation accordingly,payment of the benefit will not relieve the shipowner of its maintenance duty.considerations supporting characterization of a benefit as wages rather than maintenance include that the benefit is mandated under a wage agreement between the employer and the seaman the absence of any contractual provision indicating that the benefit is in lieu of,or in satisfaction of,the employer maintenance obligation the purpose of the benefit is to replace lost wages and the benefit is recoverable,even where the seaman does not satisfy the maintenance requirements.id.in shaw,all four factors supported classification of disability benefits as a substitute for wages the benefits were guaranteed in a collective bargaining agreement governing employee compensation the shipowner did not specify that disability payments were in lieu of maintenance employees were entitled to the benefits,even if they did not satisfy the conditions required to recover maintenance and the benefits,designed to replace lost wages,were not narrowly tailored to cover food and lodging expenses.id.accordingly,we concluded that the payment of disability benefits did not relieve the shipowner of its maintenance obligation.
on the other hand,we concluded in shaw that health benefits provided to the seaman did satisfy the shipowner duty to provide cure the payment of a seaman medical expenses during his convalescence.under the relevant policy,which was fully funded by the shipowner and administered by blue shield,all of the injured seaman medical expenses were covered.because the benefits were narrowly tailored to satisfy the shipowner cure duties,we concluded that additional payments to the seaman were not required.
here,the district court,applying the considerations discussed in shaw,found that the ltd benefits were part and parcel of kopacz wage package.it specifically noted that drba extended ltd benefits to all permanent employees,including personnel ineligible for maintenance at common law the employee manual characterized ltd benefits as continuing income,not as payment for food and lodging the collective bargaining agreement did not expressly indicate that ltd benefits were in lieu of maintenance and disability benefits were awarded,even when the maintenance requirements were not met nothing connected the insurance payments to food and lodging,or the maintenance offered as such.accordingly,the district court concluded that drba maintenance obligation was not satisfied by the payment of ltd benefits.
drb a attempts to distinguish the prudential payments in shaw from the ltd benefits paid here.drba insists that the collective bargaining agreement here is silent on ltd benefits.to the contrary,the document expressly provides,employer agrees to continue to provide all permanent employees disability plans that are offered to employees generally.the inclusion of this guarantee in the collective bargaining agreement thus supports classification of ltd benefits as a substitute for wages,not maintenance.
in shaw,we scrutinized the record for clear written evidence that the shipowner intended disability benefits to satisfy its maintenance duty.we stated,t he collective bargaining agreement in this case contained no provision specifying that payments from the insurance company under the benefits plan would be in lieu of maintenance.undoubtedly a vessel owner could insure against his maintenance obligation by a benefits program tailored to that end but there is no indication in the collective bargaining agreement before us that this was done.at emphasis added see also id.at it is clear that in the absence of an explicit contractual provision specifying that accumulated leave time pay or other wages is to be deemed a substitute for maintenance,there is no basis for crediting such earned wages against the vessel owner maintenance obligation.emphasis added.conceding that no such written evidence exists here,drba asserts that,instead,its evidentiary burden is satisfied by the existence of a tacit and longstanding understanding between the drba and its seaman that ltd benefits were in lieu of maintenance.appellant br.at.drba relies on testimony offered by its risk manager,bonnie miller,that no employee had previously sued drba to recover both maintenance and disability benefits.this absence of suit,however,is readily prior plan administrator,pennsylvania manufacturer association,paid injured seamen maintenance wages of daily.the absence of suit,therefore,is not indicative of a tacit understanding that ltd benefits would be provided in lieu of maintenance.in any event,speculation about why other drba employees refrained from suit is just such circumstantial evidence is especially unpersuasive here,where all of the considerations identified as significant in shaw support classification of the ltd payments as a wage substitute,not maintenance,and where ltd payments were not narrowly tailored to the essential purpose of cover food and lodging expenses during the seaman recovery.
unable to demonstrate that ltd payments were intended as maintenance,drba focuses on the underlying rationale for this right.drba contends that the historic purpose of provide an injured seaman funds adequate to cover basic living met by the payment of ltd benefits,and that an additional award would produce an unjustified windfall for kopacz.we similar argument in barnes,where we approved an award of maintenance to a unionized seaman,who received benefits similar to those afforded kopacz 
andover is persuasive in arguing that today those seamen who are unionized are neither friendless nor improvident.the record in this case shows that the seafarers international union,to which barnes belongs,has obtained for its members overtime and premium pay,vacation allowances,disability pensions,and amenities.furthermore,the adjectives friendless and helpless were generally used to describe sailors in foreign ports.now,under union contracts ill or injured seamen are quickly repatriated.the changed circumstances of the unionized seaman may undercut the rationale supporting the traditional right to maintenance and cure,at least for unionized seamen.however,the supreme court has shown no inclination to depart from its solicitude for seamen.until it does so,we see no basis to assume the emergence of powerful seamen unions,a development concerning which the court has full knowledge,justifies our ignoring the court clear and frequent pronouncements that seamen remain wards of the admiralty.
barnes,at internal citations omitted emphasis added see also vaughan,at rejecting double recovery argument and finding that income earned by an injured seaman at position during his recovery did not offset the amount of maintenance due 
hence,we conclude that the ltd payments do not offset the amount of maintenance owed to kopacz,a duty that is independent of drba contractual obligations.see barnes,at see also vaughan,at maintenance and cure differs from rights normally classified as contractual.
social security disability benefits 
alternatively,drba maintains that kopacz receipt of ssd benefits satisfied its maintenance obligation,at least in part.for its position,drba relies on our statement in shaw that a vessel owner has no obligation to provide maintenance and cure if it is furnished by others at no expense to the seaman.at.
in shaw,discussed earlier,we held that blue shield benefits satisfied the shipowner cure obligation.we reasoned that these benefits,which covered the costs of the seaman medical care and hospitalization,were the exact equivalent of cure.shaw,at.accordingly,we concluded that the parties intended the blue shield payments be in lieu of,rather than in addition to,the cure owed to the injured sailor.however,we reached the opposite conclusion with respect to the prudential disability benefits,which the record indicated were intended as a substitute for lost as payment for food and which were owed to the seaman,independent of his eligibility for maintenance and cure.on that basis,we held that the prudential payments did not offset the maintenance owed to the seaman.distinguishing the blue shield benefits from the prudential payments,we explained,
i t is also true that the vessel owner has no obligation to provide maintenance and cure if it is furnished by others at no expense to the seaman the essential difference between the blue shield and the prudential payments which do not satisfy the maintenance obligation is that the former provides the exact equivalent of maintenance and cure whereas the latter,at least under this collective bargaining agreement,constitutes a substitute for lost wages which are owed to a seaman even if he is ineligible for maintenance and cure.
id.at emphasis added.the dispositive issue here,therefore,is whether ssd benefits provide the exact equivalent of maintenance,or whether the two differ in their scope,purpose,and conditions of eligibility.id.
ssd benefits and maintenance are distinguishable in several important respects.first,distinct policy aims underlie maintenance and ssd payments.whereas maintenance is intended to provide for the cost of food and lodging comparable in quality to that the seaman is entitled to at sea,barnes,at,ssd benefits aim to replace the income of beneficiaries when that income is reduced on account of retirement and disability.temple united states,cir see barnes,at noting that maintenance does not entitle a seaman to a pension or a payment to compensate for disability or lost earning capacity.hence,ssd benefits are more closely analogous to ltd payments,which aim to replace lost wages,than to maintenance.
second,the conditions of eligibility for maintenance and ssd payments differ substantially.maintenance is available solely when a seaman is injured during the course of his employment or at a place where he is subject to the call of duty,barnes,at citing aguilar standard oil.is incapable of performing seaman work,vaughan,at and has actually incurred food and lodging expenses during his recovery.barnes,at see vaughan,at noting that maintenance is limited to food and lodging expenses incurred gypsum carrier,handelsman,cir maintenance and cure is based upon need,and the seaman is under a duty to minimize expenditures.maintenance,moreover,is available immediately upon the seaman incapacitation,but ceases once the seaman attains maximum cure,defined as the point at which he is either cured or his condition is diagnosed as permanent and incurable.barnes,at see vella ford motor,d crooks,at payments must be promptly made,at a time contemporaneous to the illness or injury.internal citation omitted.
the conditions of eligibility for ssd benefits,by contrast,are both than those required to obtain maintenance.on the one hand,the ssd requirements are more onerous a claimant must demonstrate that he has suffered a disability for a minimum period of five months,gaines amalgamated ins.fund,cir that his disability is permanent,having lasted,or been expected to last,for a continuous period of months,and that his impairment precludes performance not only of his former job but also of any work existing in significant numbers in the national economy,including basic work activities.mccrea comm r of social,cir see d a.
on the other hand,the conditions of eligibility for ssd benefits are,in certain other respects,less burdensome than those required to receive maintenance.claimants with nonoccupational injuries may recover ssd benefits,d a and proof of actual expenditure of funds on food,lodging,or other expenses is not necessary to obtain benefits.further,ssd payments need not be expended on food and lodging,and financial need is not a prerequisite to obtain assistance.mazza sec.of health and human,cir.further,a social security claimant is entitled to benefits,even if his condition is diagnosed as permanent or incurable.a.
these important differences support classification of maintenance and ssd payments as different,rather than exact ly equivalent,benefits.shaw,at see handelsman,at holding that payments received by sailor under state disability program do not offset amount owed under maintenance duty see also barnes,at upholding seaman right to maintenance,despite possibility of double recovery from his receipt of disability pensions,overtime and premium pay,and vacation allowances.
nonetheless,drba attempts to analogize ssd payments to medicare benefits,which at least one court of appeals has concluded may satisfy a shipowner cure obligation.moran towing transportation lombas,cir.in moran,the second circuit court of appeals held that a seaman receipt of treatment relieved the shipowner of its duty to provide cure.the court relied on our pronouncement in shaw that a vessel owner has no obligation to provide maintenance and cure if it is furnished by others at no expense to the seaman.id.at quoting shaw,at.significantly,moran did not analyze a consideration that we identified as critical in determining whether offset was appropriate in the payments received are the exact equivalent of cure.shaw,at.because moran omitted an aspect of the offset analysis that we deemed essential in shaw,its holding lacks persuasive force.
even if moran were binding on this court,moran core medicare benefits may satisfy a shipowner cure with the reasoning in shaw.there,as discussed,we held that blue shield benefits,which covered all of the seaman medical expenses during his recovery,provided the exact equivalent of cure.likewise,the medicare benefits in moran,which covered the seaman hospital bills during his convalescence,provided the equivalent of cure.ssd benefits,by contrast,differ in scope and purpose from maintenance.hence,moran conclusions with respect to medicare benefits do not govern our analysis of ssd payments made to kopacz.
hence,we conclude that kopacz receipt of ssd benefits did not relieve drba of its maintenance obligation.
prejudgment interest 
next,drba contends that the district court erred in granting kopacz prejudgment interest on the amount of maintenance owed to him the rule in admiralty is that prejudgment interest should be awarded unless there are exceptional circumstances that would make such an award inequitable.matter of bankers trust,cir see noritake hellenic champion,cir.unit a discretion to deny prejudgment interest is created only when there are peculiar circumstances that would make it inequitable for the losing party to be forced to pay prejudgment interest.internal citation omitted.in matter of bankers trust,we explained,generally,exceptional circumstances exist only when the district court concludes that the party requesting interest has unreasonably delayed in prosecuting its claim,made a bad faith estimate of its damages that precluded settlement,or not sustained any actual damages.at.an award of prejudgment interest,however,must be compensatory rather than punitive,and is left to the sound discretion of the district court,which will be disturbed only for abuse of discretion.m o marine,marquette,cir see socony mobile oil.coastal,cir see also skretvedt dupont de nemours,cir noting district court broad discretion to award prejudgment interest.the district court concluded that an award of prejudgment interest was appropriate in this instance,citing our statement in deisler mccormack aggregates,that such relief is merely an element of a plaintiff complete compensation,cir.
drba does not identify an exceptional circumstance justifying withholding prejudgment interest.rather,drba sole contention on appeal is that other payments to kopacz,including ltd benefits and the value of his sick and annual leave,adequately compensated him,and that the award of prejudgment interest was thus punitive.however,we earlier rejected this argument,concluding that other payments made to kopacz did not satisfy drba maintenance obligation.having held that kopacz has a separate and independent right to maintenance,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in compensating kopacz for losses stemming from drba tardy discharge of its duty.see matter of bankers trust,at its prejudgment interest purpose is to reimburse the claimant for the loss of use of its investment or its funds from the time of such loss until judgment is entered.skretvedt,at as a general rule,prejudgment interest is to be awarded when the amount of the underlying liability is reasonably capable of ascertainment and the relief granted would otherwise fall short of making the claimant whole because he or she has been denied the use of the money which was legally due.quoting anthuis colt indus.operating,cir see also deisler,at the supreme court has repeatedly held that prejudgment interest is merely an element of a plaintiff complete compensation.
consequential damages 
in his,kopacz argues that the district court erred in denying his claim for consequential damages.in deisler,we held that consequential damages arising from a shipowner failure to provide maintenance and cure,including lost wages and pain and suffering,are generally recoverable.at.to establish an entitlement to such damages,however,a plaintiff must articulate,at minimum,a specific injury,and explain how that injury resulted from the shipowner breach of its maintenance duty.id.at.kopacz fails both requirements.in fact,kopacz fails even to identify the kind of consequential damages that he wages,pain and suffering,or other relief.nor does kopacz specifically identify an emotional,physical,or economic injury resulting from of maintenance.to the contrary,kopacz concedes that all properly documented medical costs were promptly reimbursed,and he does not allege,much less prove,that other payments,including ssd and ltd benefits,were insufficient to cover his basic expenses.rather,kopacz merely asserts that he really needed the money.appellee br.at.on this record,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying kopacz claim for lost wages and pain and suffering.
the sole type of consequential damages that kopacz expressly fees and properly denied by the district court.attorney fees and costs are recoverable solely where a shipowner refusal to pay maintenance and cure is unreasonable.see atlantic sounding,townsend,d noting that award of attorney fees is permissible for shipowner callous and willful and persistent refusal to pay maintenance and cure vaughan,at noting that attorney fees are recoverable where shipowner refusal to pay maintenance stemmed from a wanton and intentional disregard of the legal rights of the seaman deisler,at attorney fees and costs differ from interest,lost wages and damages for pain and suffering because attorney fees and costs can not be recovered unless plaintiff can first establish defendant bad faith or recalcitrance.here,drba,providing kopacz almost in wages,sick and annual leave,and disability benefits,did not exhibit the requisite callousness.further,kopacz did not seek maintenance until over one year after his date of injury,when hartford demanded reimbursement for the amount of ssd payments made to him.although drba declined to pay maintenance,its decision,premised on a colorable legal theory,did not reflect a wanton and intentional disregard of kopacz rights.see deisler,at requiring proof that denial of maintenance was arbitrary or capricious to recover attorney fees and costs.
accordingly,we conclude that the district court properly exercised its discretion to deny kopacz attorney fees and costs.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
i respectfully dissent from the majority opinion in this matter.the question presented for our review is whether a person who resides on shore and commutes to his or her job as a day laborer aboard a ferry is entitled to compensation for lodging and food,if he or she becomes incapacitated,in addition to receiving disability benefits paid for by his or her employer that fully cover his living expenses.
in concluding that kopacz is entitled to an additional payment for the cost of his lodging and meals,the majority,citing this court decision in barnes andover,cir,states as follows although barnes acknowledged that there was some logic in denying maintenance to seamen,the court stressed that the life of the law is experience,not logic.majority op.at.in a subsequent passage,the majority states barnes strongly suggested that commuter seamen are also entitled to maintenance.majority op.at.i disagree with this reading of barnes.in fact this court expressly declined to reach this question in barnes.instead,this court stated 
whatever the merits of the double recovery objection for maintenance paid to seamen,that argument is inapplicable to barnes.barnes was not shorebound and andover does not suggest that his wages were fixed in contemplation of his providing his own food and lodging.thus,the fact that barnes chose to use his wages to maintain an residence rather than on entertainment or on some frivolity should not be used to reduce his recovery,particularly since there is no question here of any double recovery as a result of wages.
id.at emphasis added.
moreover,the fact that drba cites no authority supporting withholding maintenance from commuter seamen,majority op.at,does not logically support a conclusion that a commuter seaman is therefore entitled to maintenance without some showing that the equities favor this result.i can not join the majority number because i am persuaded that extending the maritime doctrine of maintenance to an employee who commutes each day from his home to his job as a day laborer on a ferry boat is contrary to both logic and experience.
as noted in barnes,this circuit has not yet determined whether the doctrine of maintenance applicable to seamen who are incapacitated while on ships that sail to distant ports should be extended to commuter seamen.
in his brilliant harvard law school lectures,justice oliver wendell holmes explained the evolution of common law principles as follows 
the object of this book is to present a general view of the common law.to accomplish the task,other tools are needed besides logic.it is something to show that the consistency of a system requires a particular result,but it is not all.the life of the law has not been logic it has been experience.the felt necessities of the time,the prevalent moral and political theories,intuitions of public policy,avowed or unconscious,even the prejudices which judges share with their,have had a good deal more to do than the syllogism in determining the rules by which men should be governed.the law embodies the story of a nation development through many centuries,and it can not be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics.in order to know what it is,we must know what it has been,and what it tends to become.we must alternately consult history and existing theories of legislation.but the most difficult labor will be to understand the combination of the two into new products at every stage.the substance of the law at any given time pretty nearly corresponds,so far as it goes,with what is then understood to be convenient but its form and machinery,and the degree to which it is able to work out desired results,depend very much upon its past.

the woeful experience suffered by seamen incapacitated on lengthy voyages to distant ports that led to the adoption of the maintenance doctrine was vividly described by justice story in in harden gordon,cas.
seamen are by the peculiarity of their lives liable to sudden sickness from change of climate,exposure to perils,and exhausting labor.they are generally poor and friendless,and acquire habits of gross indulgence,carelessness,and improvidence.if some provision be not made for them in sickness at the expense of the ship,they must often in foreign ports suffer the accumulated evils of disease,and poverty,and sometimes perish from the want of suitable nourishment.their common earnings in many instances are wholly inadequate to provide for the expenses of sickness and if liable to be so applied,the great motives for good behavior might be ordinarily taken away by pledging their future as well as past wages for the redemption of the debt.in many voyages,particularly those to the west indies,the whole wages are often insufficient to meet the expenses occasioned by the perilous diseases of those insalubrious climates.on the other hand,if these expenses are a charge upon the ship,the interest of the owner will be immediately connected with that of the seamen.the master will watch over their health with vigilance and fidelity.he will take the best methods,as well to prevent diseases,as to ensure a speedy recovery from them.he will never be tempted to abandon the sick to their forlorn fate but his duty,combining with the interest of his owner,will lead him to succor their distress,and shed a cheering kindness over the anxious hours of suffering and despondency.
id.at.justice story opinion in harden was written in his capacity as the circuit justice for the district of maine.
in,the united states supreme court referred to justice story decision in harden as the first case in this country that adopted the doctrine of maintenance and cure.the osceola.the court summarized justice story opinion as follows 
justice story held that a claim for the expenses of cure in case of sickness constituted in contemplation of law a part of the contract for wages,over which admiralty had a rightful jurisdiction.the action was in personam against the master and owner for wages and other expenses occasioned by the sickness of the plaintiff in a foreign port in the course of the voyage,which were allowed.
id.emphasis added.the court held in the osceola that,upon reviewing english and american authorities,the law 
may be considered as settled upon the following proposition t hat the vessel and her owners are liable,in case a seamen falls sick or is wounded in the service of his ship,to the extent of his maintenance and cure,and to his wages,at least as long as the voyage is continued.
id.at.the court also held t hat the seaman is not allowed to recover an indemnity for the negligence of the master,or any member of the crew,but is entitled to maintenance and cure,whether the injuries were received by negligence or accident.id 
in each of the cases in which the supreme court has applied justice story analysis of the experiences of seamen that support application of the doctrine of maintenance and cure,the facts demonstrate that the seaman was incapacitated while he served as a member of a vessel traveling to distant ports.in calmar taylor,the court defined the terms maintenance and cure as follows the maintenance exacted is comparable to that to which the seaman is entitled to while at sea and cure is care,including nursing and medical attention,during such period as the duty continues.id.at internal citations omitted.
in aguilar standard oil of new jersey,the injured seaman was a messman on a steamship engaged in coastwise trade between new orleans and east coast and gulf coast ports.while the vessel was moored in a port in philadelphia,the seaman was injured as he left the ship on shore leave.id.at.in a consolidated companion case,a seaman on shore leave was injured as he walked back to his ship by the driver of a motor vehicle not owned,operated or controlled by the ship owner.id.at.
citing justice story decision in harden,the court in aguilar explained its holding that the seamen were entitled to cure and maintenance as follows 
from the earliest times,maritime nations have recognized that unique hazards,emphasized by unusual tenure and control,attend the work of seamen.the physical risks created by natural elements,and the limitations of human adaptability to work at sea,enlarge the narrower and more strictly occupational hazards of sailing and operating vessels.and the restrictions which accompany living aboard a ship for long periods at a time combine with the constant shuttling between unfamiliar ports to deprive the seaman of the comforts and opportunities for leisure,essential for living and working,that accompany most land occupations.furthermore,the seaman unusual subjection to authority adds the weight of what would be involuntary servitude for others to these extraordinary hazards and limitations of ship life.
accordingly,with the combined object of encouraging marine commerce and assuring the of seamen,maritime nations uniformly have imposed broad responsibilities for their health and safety upon the owners of ships.in this country these notions were reflected early,and have since been expanded,in legislation designed to secure the comfort and health of seamen aboard ship,hospitalization at home and care abroad.the statutes are uniform in evincing solicitude that the seamen shall have at hand the barest essentials for existence.they do this in two ways.one is by recognizing the shipowner duty to supply them,and the other by providing for care at public expense.the former do not create the duty.that existed long before the statutes were adopted.they merely recognize the preexisting obligation and put specific legal sanctions,generally criminal,behind it.

the ship owner declined to provide the seaman with maintenance because he never complained of any illness during his four months service.id.the seaman hired a lawyer to enforce his right to maintenance.he also requested an award of attorney fees.the district court denied his request for the payment of his attorney fees.the court of appeals affirmed the denial of attorney fees and held that the amount he earned as a taxi driver had to be deducted from the amount he was entitled to for maintenance and cure.id.at.
relying on its decision in calmar taylor,and justice story opinion in harden,the supreme court held in vaughn that i t is difficult to imagine a clearer case of damages suffered for the failure to pay maintenance than this one.id.at.
the supreme court has not extended the maritime doctrine of maintenance and cure to persons who commute to work aboard vessels that do not sail to distant ports.instead,the court has continued to adhere to justice story explanation of the policy underlying that duty in harden.for example,in vaughn,the court stated 
the reasons underlying the rule,to which reference must be made in defining it,are those enumerated in the classic passage by justice story in harden gordon,fed.cas.c the protection of seamen,who,as a class,are poor,friendless and improvident,from hazards of illness and abandonment while ill in foreign ports the inducement to masters and owners to protect the safety and health of seamen while in service the maintenance of a merchant marine for the commercial service and maritime defense of the nation by inducing men to accept employment in an arduous and perilous service.

the foregoing facts do not meet the requirements for the application of the doctrine of maintenance set forth in harden and adopted by the supreme court in the osceola.as the court instructed in vaughn,the reasons underlying the rule to which reference must be made in defining the doctrine of maintenance are those enumerated by justice story in harden.vaughn,at.in awarding maintenance in this matter,the district court failed to set forth the experiences encountered by a commuter seamen that define his or her entitlement to maintenan
