while responding to a situation in which guns and gunfire were present,officer terry lewis of the flint,michigan police department shot tracy jefferson while she stood in the doorway of her home.although officer lewis contends that he believed that she was firing at him,jefferson turned out to be unarmed.she thereafter sued officer lewis under and state tort law.after discovery,officer lewis sought summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity,but the district court denied his motion.officer lewis now brings this interlocutory appeal.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
on december,at approximately,officer terry lewis of the flint,michigan police force responded to a report of shots fired.it is apparently a mainstay of the flint new year eve celebration ritual to fire guns in the air and into a nearby lake.at that time,officer lewis had been on shift for what jefferson contends was eleven hours because the flint police force was short on officers.
when he arrived on location,officer lewis found several individuals who reported that shots had been fired and that bullets had hit near the individuals just before officer lewis arrived.they informed officer lewis that the shots were coming from the woodhall drive area and from across a field near west pierson road.during this conversation,officer lewis heard approximately six gunshots from what he estimated to be a long gun.
officer lewis called for backup and drove to the place from which he believed the shots to have emanated.while driving,officer lewis heard several more gunshots but described them as being more faint.he parked his car a short distance from west pierson road.officer lewis exited his car and took his pump shotgun with him.he proceeded on foot to the place from which he believed that the first round of shots had come.while advancing,officer lewis heard several more gunshots from and,fearing that they were directed at him,hid behind a car parked at west pierson.he heard male voices from across a fence and moved to determine their location.he then saw two males near west pierson,at least one of whom was holding a long gun,either a rifle or a shotgun.
as officer lewis began approaching the two men,a car passed and shined its lights on officer lewis.the two men turned toward officer lewis.the man with the gun,later identified as thomas manning,was pointing the gun in officer lewis general direction.the other man,victor adams,was reaching into the trunk of a car.officer lewis advanced toward the two men with his shotgun pointed at them and instructed them to freeze,drop their weapons,and put their hands against the wall of the house.
adams and manning testified that they immediately complied with officer lewis command officer lewis contends that manning ducked behind a column and that adams continued reaching into the trunk of the car.either way,both men eventually complied with officer lewis commands to drop their weapons and to put their hands against the wall.at some point during the initial confrontation between officer lewis and adams and manning,a third man,taurean stewart,emerged from between the car and the house.officer lewis instructed stewart to freeze and to move against the wall.all three men were,at this time,against the wall,although officer lewis testified that the men continued to duck up and down and to move their hands toward their waists.throughout the entire interaction,officer lewis saw only manning holding a gun.
after stewart appeared and officer lewis ordered him to place his hands against a wall,officer lewis heard what he describes as a loud metal sounding noise to his left.he looked and saw a fourth individual exiting the front door of the house.he saw that it was an unarmed woman and commanded her to go back inside the house.
officer lewis then detected movement to his right,where the side door of the house was located.as officer lewis tells it,he turned and saw that the door,a security door made of black armor guard and glass with a brass doorknob,was opening outward and that a person was standing in the doorframe.he perceived a hand with something metallic in it extended in his direction beyond the door frame and,at the same time,a flash of light.officer lewis maintains that he believed that the flash was a muzzle flash from a gun and that the person in the doorway was firing on him.officer lewis never heard a gunshot,did not identify himself as a police officer,and did nothing further to ascertain whether the person in the doorway was,indeed,armed.
instead,officer lewis immediately fired his shotgun at the person in the doorway.he did not chamber another round into his shotgun after firing the first shot and did not take cover to protect himself from future gunfire.however,he did yell shots fired into the microphone located on his lapel and immediately began patting his vest to see if he had been shot.as it turns out,the person in the doorway was jefferson.she was unarmed and did not have anything shiny in her hand,except perhaps the doorknob.she testified that her right hand never left the door handle as she opened the door outward.although officer lewis theorizes that the flash he claims to have seen could have been caused by the headlights of a car flashing off of the door,no one testified to having actually seen a car passing at the time.jefferson further testified that there were no lights on in the carport area and that there were no lights on in the room behind her.jefferson was injured,but the shot was not fatal.
jefferson thereafter filed suit under,claiming violation of her constitutional right to be free from excessive force,as well as a pendant claim of battery after discovery,officer lewis sought summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.the district court denied the motion,stating that 
for the purposes of this motion,the court accepts jefferson account that she did not step outside of the house before being shot,did not extend her arm toward lewis,and did not have any shiny object that might have given the appearance of a muzzle flash.read in this light,the record shows that,without warning,lewis shot an unarmed woman who had not threatened him from close range.under these circumstances,lewis did not have probable cause to believe that jefferson was dangerous.

jurisdiction 
jefferson initially contends that we do not have jurisdiction to hear officer lewis appeal due to its interlocutory district court denied officer lewis motion for summary judgment but trial has not yet occurred thus there is no final judgment.we are not persuaded.
the denial of a summary judgment motion usually presents neither a final appealable order nor an appealable interlocutory order.floyd city of detroit,cir.however,a rejection of a defendant assertion of the qualified immunity defense is a exception to this rule to the extent that the appeal presents a question of law and does not require us to resolve disputes of material facts.id.citing risbridger connelly,cir.thus,to bring an interlocutory appeal of a qualified immunity ruling,the defendant must be willing to concede the plaintiff version of the facts for purposes of the appeal.morrison bd.of trustees of green,cir citations omitted sheets mullins,cir.
jefferson contends that there are disputed facts and that,because the district court found that disputes of material facts precluded summary judgment,we can not entertain officer lewis interlocutory appeal.however,the district court assertion that there were genuine issues of material fact does not,standing alone,destroy the appealability of a qualified immunity ruling.turner scott,cir.as the supreme court stated,d enial of summary judgment often includes a determination that there are controverted issues of material fact and johnson surely does not mean that every such denial of summary judgment is nonappealable.behrens pelletier,d see also christophel kukulinsky,cir stating that a defendant right to appeal the denial of qualified immunity does not turn on the phrasing of the district court order.taking a dim view of the mo
