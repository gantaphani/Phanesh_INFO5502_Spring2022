david roth was attempting to unload a railway tank car filled with sulfuric acid when its chemical contents exploded,spraying roth across his face and chest and inflicting severe burns.roth brought suit,seeking damages for his personal injuries under the common law,but the district court held that his lawsuit was preempted by the hazardous materials transportation act hmta.we agree and will therefore affirm.
in the early,those who transported hazardous materials through interstate commerce were forced to navigate a patchwork of sometimes conflicting state regulations.jersey cent.power light twp.of lacey,cir.the prevailing regulatory regime was fragmented and,to some,incoherent,at explaining that the fragmentation of regulatory power among the agencies dealing with the different modes of transportation blocks a coherent approach to the problem.at the same time,the quantity of hazardous material moving across state lines was on the increase,at the amount of hazardous material being transported in the united states increases every year.predictably,accidents involving such materials were concomitantly on the rise,at the increasing volume of dangerous products in commerce has brought with it an increasing number of accidents.to address these concerns,the secretary of transportation requested greater oversight capability.see,at.

many states and localities have enacted laws and regulations which vary from federal laws and regulations pertaining to the transportation of hazardous materials,thereby creating the potential for unreasonable hazards in other jurisdictions and confounding shippers and carriers which attempt to comply with multiple and conflicting registration,permitting,routing,notification,and other regulatory requirements,
because of the potential risks to life,property,and the environment posed by unintentional releases of hazardous materials,consistency in laws and regulations governing the transportation of hazardous materials is necessary and desirable,

where applicable,the hmr is comprehensive it sets forth,for example,each substance or material considered to be hazardous governs the transport of such material by aircraft,railcar,vessel,and motor vehicle describes requirements for packaging,marking,labeling,declaring,and registering hazardous materials and advances a series of training and security requirements for those who come into contact with hazardous substances.failure to comply with these provisions can result in an array of administrative sanctions,civil penalties,and,under certain circumstances,criminal punishment.see.
sulfuric acid is a hazardous material.accordingly,railway tank cars carrying the chemical must adhere to design specifications approved by the dot.a.tank cars must be mounted to a railcar structure in a specified manner.tank car volume and weight capacity are spelled out.most tank car models must satisfy dot standards for thermal resistance.modifications to the design features set forth in the hmr are prohibited absent written authorization from the dot.
defendant norfalco transported sulfuric acid using model tank cars.the hmr governs the shape,the thickness of the plates used to construct the car,its expansion capacity,the method for applying attachments to the tank car structure,the size,shape,and appearance of plugs used to cap tank car openings,and the presence,quantity,and application of insulating materials.each tank car must also undergo pressure testing to ensure there is no leakage or evidence of distress.it is undisputed that norfalco fully complied with the hmr requirements for model aw tank cars.
the hmr sets forth various fittings suitable for tank car installation.when so installed,g auging devices,top loading and unloading devices,venting and air inlet devices must be approved for use by the association of american railroads aar,an industry organization.defining approved under part.the aar,in turn,publishes a manual of standards and recommended practices,one chapter of which details design and maintenance criteria for the fittings identified above.several specifications in this chapter pertain to devices installed on sulfuric cars.the parties agree that norfalco tank cars complied with aar criteria concerning gauging devices,top loading and unloading devices,venting and air inlet devices.
most tank cars must also be equipped with agencyapproved pressure relief devices.see.such instruments must permit sufficient flow capacity to prevent pressure in the tank.a.flow capacity requirements are set forth in the aar manual of standards and recommended practices.b.furthermore,the hmr dictates precise technical settings according to which pressure relief devices must be reclosed following use,b,and imposes testing standards to ensure that each instrument satisfies applicable criteria before it is put to use in transport.the parties agree that norfalco complied in full with the hmr requirements for pressure relief devices.indeed,there is not a single provision in the hmta or hmr with which norfalco failed to comply.
glatfelter company is a paper manufacturer based in york,pennsylvania.its manufacturing process requires large quantities of sulfuric acid approximately pounds per day which it uses to bleach wood pulp.in,glatfelter purchased nearly all the sulfuric acid it needed from norfalco,north america largest supplier of the chemical.norfalco would then deliver the sulfuric acid by rail directly to glatfelter pennsylvania mill.
roth was employed by glatfelter as a chemical unloader.his primary responsibility,as his job title suggests,was to unload sulfuric acid from the tank cars sent by norfalco.before he could safely do so,however,roth was required to depressurize each car.this process was simple enough roth explained in a deposition that he first removed a cap covering an air inlet located on the tank car and then opened something called the jamesbury valve.at this point,air began to exit the tank car through the uncapped air inlet.roth knew the tank car was depressurized when he could no longer hear or feel air escaping from the inlet.
to unload the depressurized tank car of its chemical contents,roth opened a second inlet into which he inserted a device called an elbow pipe.on the opposite end of the elbow pipe,roth attached a rubber hose,called the acid hose.the acid hose ran to a nearby acid storage tank.roth had to siphon the sulfuric acid out of the tank car through the acid hose by pumping air into the tank car through the first air inlet the incoming air pushed sulfuric acid out of the tank car through the second air inlet and into the acid hose,where it flowed into the storage tank.on average,it took approximately two hours to empty a tank car of sulfuric acid.
on august,roth was attempting to unload a tank car of sulfuric acid when he encountered an unidentified mechanical difficulty.because the source of the complication was not apparent,roth supervisor instructed him to deactivate the unloading process and move on to another tank car.roth complied,but he did not remove the elbow pipe from the car.two days later,roth was told to detach the pipe.as he did so,acid began flying out of the air inlet,spraying roth face and chest and causing severe burns.roth later explained that he had not attempted to depressurize the tank car before removing the elbow pipe because he believed mistakenly,as it turned out that the car was already depressurized.
roth invoked diversity jurisdiction and filed a complaint in the district court asserting negligence,strict liability,products liability,and breach of warranty claims.his theory of the case was the stuff of basic tort law norfalco had a duty to design its tank cars to ensure they were safe for those who unloaded them.this duty required norfalco to equip its cars with a safety valve that would have allowed a chemical unloader like roth to control the rate at which sulfuric acid was discharged.in addition,norfalco had a duty to equip its tank cars with a pressure gauge,whose presence would have alerted roth of the need to depressurize the car before unloading it.the absence of both safety devices,according to roth,meant that norfalco had been negligent.roth also argued that norfalco warranted that its cars were designed in a reasonably safe manner,that norfalco tank cars were ultrahazardous,and that,given the absence of a safety valve and pressure gauge,sulfuric acid could not be removed from the cars in a safe and prudent manner.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of norfalco.the court first determined that roth common law negligence,products liability,and breach of warranty claims are expressly preempted by the hmta.it then held that roth strict liability claim,while not preempted,nonetheless failed because unloading sulfuric acid from a tank car is not an abnormally dangerous activity.roth appeals this decision,attacking both of the district court conclusions.we have jurisdiction to entertain his appeal pursuant to.

section of the hmta contains a preemption provision that,when applicable,displaces an array of state and local law.under subsection a,a regulation is preempted if it is not possible to comply with both the hmta and the requirement.subsection a preempts a requirement that is an obstacle to accomplishing and carrying out a regulation prescribed under the hmta.neither of these provisions is applicable to the case at hand.
section b of the hmta contains an express preemption provision,which states,
u nless authorized by another law of the united states,a law,regulation,order,or other requirement of a state,political subdivision of a state,or indian tribe about any of the following subjects,that is not substantively the same as a provision of this chapter,a regulation prescribed under this chapter,or a hazardous materials transportation security regulation or directive issued by the secretary of homeland security,is preempted.
this section then sets forth five subject areas that fall within the provision preemptive scope,the following subjects,reference above 
a the designation,description,and classification of hazardous material.
b the packing,repacking,handling,labeling,marking,and placarding of hazardous material.
