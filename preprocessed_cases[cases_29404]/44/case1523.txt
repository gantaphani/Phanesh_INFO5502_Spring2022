in this appeal,we hold that,for purposes of determining subject matter jurisdiction under the class action fairness act of cafa,stat.codified in scattered sections of title,united states code,a limited liability company is an unincorporated association as that term is used in d and therefore is a citizen of the state under whose laws it is organized and the state where it has its principal place of business.
after carl ferrell,a citizen of south carolina,commenced this class action in south carolina state court against express check advance of south carolina,llc,and others,alleging that their payday loans violated south carolina law,express check removed the action to federal court under cafa,b,alleging minimal diversity,as specified in d a,as the basis for federal jurisdiction.express check contended that the minimal diversity requirement of cafa was satisfied because all other parties are south carolina citizens,while it,as a limited liability company,is a citizen of missouri and kansas based on the citizenship of its sole member,a missouri corporation with its principal place of business in overland,kansas.alternatively,it argued that if it was deemed an unincorporated association within the meaning of d,it is nonetheless a citizen of tennessee,under whose laws it is organized,and of kansas,where it has its principal place of business.
on ferrell motion to remand,the district court concluded that express check,as a limited liability company,is an unincorporated association under d and that its principal place of business is in south carolina,not kansas.the court accordingly remanded the case to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
on appeal,we conclude that a limited liability company is an unincorporated association as used in d,whose citizenship is that of the state under whose laws it is organized and the state where it has its principal place of business,and express check has its principal place of business in south carolina.accordingly,we affirm.
carl ferrell commenced this class action in the richland county court of common pleas,naming four business entities as defendants advance america,cash advance centers of south carolina,local cash advance of sc,iii,llc payday usa of sc,llc and express check advance of south carolina,llc.the complaint alleges that,in making payday loans in south carolina,the defendants violated the south carolina deferred presentment services act,in particular ann,by engaging in unfair,deceptive,and fraudulent practices the south carolina consumer protection code,in particular ann,by engaging in unconscionable conduct and the south carolina duties of good faith and fair dealing.the complaint also alleges that defendants acted negligently and engaged in a civil conspiracy.ferrell,a south carolina citizen,purports to represent a class of other south carolina citizens who had entered into payday loans in south carolina.the parties agree that,other than express check,all defendants are also citizens of south carolina for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.
express check is a limited liability company organized under the laws of tennessee,and its sole member is qc financial services,a missouri corporation with its principal place of business in overland,kansas.all the stock of qc financial services is in turn owned by qc holdings,a kansas corporation with its principal place of business in overland,kansas.express check engages in the business of making payday loans from stores located solely in south carolina.while its top four officers,who are also officers of qc financial services,are located in kansas,all other express check employees are located in south carolina.
express check operations in south carolina are substantially controlled by qc financial services and qc holdings.these two corporations make the major operational and policy decisions for express check,which then are implemented by express check employees in south carolina.qc financial services and qc holdings also provide a variety of general support services to express check,such as legal,marketing,accounting,auditing,information technology,and collection services.
invoking federal subject matter jurisdiction based on minimal diversity under d a,express check filed a notice of removal under b,contending that it is not a citizen of south carolina and therefore that the minimal diversity requirement was fulfilled.ferrell filed a motion to remand,claiming that express check is a citizen of south carolina and therefore that the minimal diversity needed for jurisdiction did not exist.the district court granted ferrell motion to remand,concluding that express check is an unincorporated association,which,under d,is deemed to be a citizen of the state where it has its principal place of business and the state under whose laws it is organized.concluding that express check has its principal place of business in south carolina,the court found that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the action.
express check filed a petition for permission to appeal under c,and we granted the petition by order dated december.
express check contends that,as a limited liability company,its citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction should be determined under traditional rules by looking to the citizenship of its sole member,qc financial services.see carden arkoma,d holding that a limited partnership is not itself a citizen and that courts must instead look to the citizenship of its members to determine if diversity jurisdiction exists tech.applications,exro ltda,cir holding that a limited liability company citizenship is that of its members.it argues that cafa,which,in d,changed the traditional rule for determining the citizenship of unincorporated association s in class actions,does not apply to it because a limited liability company is not an unincorporated association.it argues that,under tennessee law,it is an artificial entity created by statute,whose nature falls somewhere between that of a corporation and an unincorporated association.thus,when applying the traditional rules,it should not be treated as a citizen of south carolina,but rather as a citizen of missouri and kansas,the states of citizenship of its sole member,qc financial services.because the minimal diversity requirement of d a is thus satisfied,express check argues that it properly removed this action to federal court under b and that the district court erred as a matter of law in concluding otherwise.
ferrell contends that the term unincorporated association,as used in d,is very broad and encompasses all entities,including limited liability companies.he argues that in congress created two categories,corporations and unincorporated associations,both of which are treated similarly for determining diversity jurisdiction in cafa class actions,and that federal courts should not rely on the nuances of tennessee law to make their jurisdictional decisions.see carden,at.admonishing against delving into such an analysis.
the issue thus presented focuses on the single question of statutory interpretation of whether d,which,in the cafa context,changed the traditional rule for determining the citizenship of unincorporated associations,applies to limited liability companies.
in cafa,congress conferred subject matter jurisdiction on federal courts over class actions in which the amount in controversy exceeds million and in which any member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a state different from any defendant.d a.the citizenship of a corporation is determined by the state in which it is incorporated and the state in which it has its principal place of business,see id.c,and the citizenship of an unincorporated association is determined similarly by the state under whose laws it is organized and the state where it has its principal place of business,see id.d.the provisions for determining the citizenship of corporations and of unincorporated associations,however,are contained in separate places in,reflecting that the provision for determining the citizenship of unincorporated associations applies only to class actions covered by cafa.the significance of including a provision f
