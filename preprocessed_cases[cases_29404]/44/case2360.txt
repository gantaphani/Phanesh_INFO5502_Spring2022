plaintiff jeffrey boykin appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants,alleging a violation of his constitutional rights under and various claims.boykin was thought by private security guards at a meijer store to have shoplifted a drill that was on sale for five dollars.as it turns out,the guards were mistaken he had paid in full for the drill.nevertheless,a call was placed to the van buren township police department,two of whose officers tracked boykin down,arrested him at his home,and hauled him in a squad car back to the meijer store.only after boykin had suffered this indignity did one of the meijer guards finally talk to the cashier who had rung boykin up and check the receipts,at which point it became evident that they had been in error.boykin was then released from custody,with apologies.
all this over a five dollar drill.
the majority of the relevant facts were recounted by the district court in its february,order 
on april,plaintiff went to the meijer store in belleville,michigan.plaintiff went through the checkout lane to purchase,among other things,a drill.at the register,he learned that the drill was only and decided that he wanted two of them.the cashier rang him up for a second drill.he left the bag with his other purchases with the cashier and went back for the second drill.when he returned,the cashier was with another customer.so,plaintiff says that he just picked up his bag after the cashier acknowledged him with a nod,placed the second drill inside,and left the store.
meijer loss prevention officer defendant george chaney first observed plaintiff when he went to pick up the second drill.he did not see that plaintiff had gone through the checkout lane already.he saw plaintiff take a drill from the shelf as a quick selection,without checking the price or comparing it to anything else.chaney says he was taught that quick selection is contrary to normal shopping behavior.after selecting the drill,chaney says that he followed plaintiff and saw him walk to an empty checkout lane,place the drill into a bag and leave the store.there is some dispute as to whether chaney later reported that plaintiff put the drill into an empty bag,or whether there were other items in the bag.chaney says that he did not see where plaintiff picked up the bag,because his view of plaintiff was partially obstructed for two to three seconds by other customers.
as plaintiff walked through the empty checkout lane,chaney called another loss prevention officer,defendant jason youmans,to come to the area to assist chaney in initiating a stop of plaintiff.meijer loss prevention policy requires that two employees be present when a suspected shoplifter is approached or detained.by the time youmans arrived,however,plaintiff was in his car.neither youmans nor chaney approached plaintiff because meijer policy also prohibits employees from approaching a suspect once he is in his vehicle.so,youmans called the van buren township police department to report a retail fraud.he gave a description of plaintiff his car and the license plate number.
officers chris hayes and dale harrison were dispatched to meijer in response to youman call.while en route to meijer,dispatch informed the officers that meijer loss prevention reported that the suspect was fleeing from the location.the officers,through dispatch,obtained plaintiff address from the license plate number and diverted to his house.
the officers arrived at plaintiff home in separate patrol cars.officer hayes was the investigating officer.officer harrison was the assisting officer.when plaintiff came to the door,he declined to open it or come out,but he spoke with the officers through the door.the officers advised that they were investigating a retail fraud at meijer and that plaintiff was a suspect.one of the officers also contacted dispatch and asked that it contact meijer to get a more detailed description than a black male wearing a red sweatshirt and to find out what plaintiff allegedly took.dispatch advised that plaintiff was accused of taking a drill and provided another description.either chaney or youmans described plaintiff as a black male,tall,with a medium build,wearing a red sweatshirt.
officer hayes asked that another call be placed to meijer loss prevention to confirm that there was a good retail fraud and whether meijer wanted plaintiff to be taken into custody.per officer hayes,a good retail fraud is one that meets meijer criteria.he also described it as one where loss prevention observes a suspect select merchandise,conceal it and leave or attempt to leave the store.after speaking with chaney or youmans again,dispatch advised officer hayes that there was a good retail fraud,and indicated that meijer requested that plaintiff be taken into custody.
plaintiff told the officers that he was calling a lawyer.just before he opened the door,he instructed his wife to videotape subsequent events.when plaintiff opened the door there was some discussion between plaintiff and the officers.one of the officers told plaintiff that he was being charged with retail fraud and that he had to accompany them.plaintiff questioned the basis of the accusation.he maintained his innocence.one of the officers indicated that he did not know why plaintiff was being accused but that they were going to go to meijer to find out.plaintiff indicated that he paid for his purchases at the cash register and asked that he be allowed to get the receipt from his garage.the officers declined to let him leave the front door,but agreed to wait while plaintiff wife looked for the receipt.in response to plaintiff request that he be allowed to retrieve his receipt,the officer told plaintiff that meijer had everything on video camera.plaintiff stepped outside and was taken into custody and handcuffed.
before leaving plaintiff house,the officers went with plaintiff into the garage while his wife looked for the receipt.it is not clear from the videos when plaintiff learned that he was alleged to have stolen a drill,but he repeatedly denied doing so while in the garage.also while in the garage,one of the officers saw and picked up a meijer bag and two drills.plaintiff told him to bring the entire bag,the contents of which he said that he had just bought,and the two drills.plaintiff wife was unable to find the receipt and plaintiff said that he did not know where it was.plaintiff eventually told his wife to discontinue the search he agreed to go with the officers.the officers took plaintiff and the merchandise to the store.
at the store,chaney and youmans met officer hayes at the entrance.chaney confirmed that plaintiff was the suspect and described what he saw.chaney and youmans then left the area to prepare their reports.officer hayes prepared to take plaintiff to the police station.however,after hearing the discussion between chaney and youmans and the police officers,plaintiff says that it occurred to him why they thought he committed retail fraud.he then explained his actions at the register to officer hayes and asked that his story be confirmed with the cashier.officer hayes had dispatch call chaney back to the front of the store.per chaney,both he and youmans went back to the entrance.officer hayes says that he relayed plaintiff version of events and asked chaney to talk to the cashier.chaney went inside and checked the register journal for the lane plaintiff said that he went through.youmans talked to the cashier.both confirmed that plaintiff purchased the second drill.
chaney apologized to plaintiff.officer hayes removed plaintiff handcuffs,returned his merchandise,and also apologized.he advised plaintiff that he was free to leave with his wife,who had arrived at the scene.at plaintiff request,however,officer hayes drove plaintiff back to his house and released him there.plaintiff said that he wanted the officer to take him back home in the patrol car because of the embarrassment the incident caused him with his family and neighbors.
plaintiff says that he did not tell the officers his version of events until they returned to the store because the officers were unable to explain what exactly meijer claimed that he had done.moreover,plaintiff says that,contrary to defendant harrison assertion that plaintiff refused to explain,the officers cut him off every time he attempted to give an explanation.
after the incident,chaney was cited for a training violation.he was advised by his supervisor,carl winekoff,that he was not supposed to call the police unless he first identified himself to the suspect.chaney testified and winekoff confirmed,however,that chaney was instructed by a prior supervisor that he could contact the police under the circumstances presented in this case.winekoff said that he still issued the violation as a means of changing that policy.another policy winekoff testified about is that meijer only contacts the police when it intends to prosecute.winekoff and chaney acknowledged that meijer does not prosecute if the item is under and the person does not have a criminal history with the store.
boykin filed suit in federal court,alleging against meijer and its two employees,chaney and youmans premises liability and negligent hiring false imprisonment defamation and violation of.boykin also made several allegations against van buren township,van buren police department,and its two officers,hayes and harrison,claiming false arrest and imprisonment,and violation of.finally,against all of the defendants,boykin made the following allegations intentional infliction of emotional distress malicious prosecution abuse of process concert of action and civil conspiracy the meijer and van buren township defendants moved for summary judgment on all of boykin claims.all of these motions were granted by the district court in an order filed february.

boykin claims under 
van buren township defendants 
the district court ruled that defendants hayes and harrison,the two van buren township officers who arrested boykin at his home,had not violated boykin constitutional rights because they had probable cause for his arrest.the district court explained its reasoning as follows 
over a series of phone calls prior to plaintiff arrest,chaney and youmans,in their capacity as loss prevention officers at meijer,relayed the essential facts to a person fitting plaintiff description and driving a car registered to his address left meijer with a drill that he failed to pay for.when the source of the allegations and the claims made are considered,the information obtained by dispatch was unquestionably sufficient to establish the probability that a crime was committed.importantly,the information received from dispatch was confirmed once the officers reached plaintiff home and spoke to him.then,they were able to further determine that there was a probability that plaintiff was the perpetrator.plaintiff fit the physical description.and,during the course of their discussions with him,plaintiff acknowledged that he was at meijer and that he was in possession of a drill from meijer.prior to placing him under arrest,the officers were not obligated to presume the truth of or further investigate plaintiff insistence that he paid for the drill,since he was unable to produce a receipt to substantiate his claim.see crockett cumberland college,cir once the officer establishes probable cause,he or she is under no obligation to continue investigating and may instead pursue the arrest of a suspect.criss city of kent,cir a policeman is under no obligation to give any credence to a suspect story nor should a plausible explanation in any sense require the officer to forego arrest pending further investigation if the facts as initially discovered provide probable cause.
boykin argues on appeal that there was a lack of probable cause for his arrest,and thus the district court ruling was in error.for the reasons aptly articulated by the district court,however,boykin argument is unavailing.officers hayes and harrison received information that a good retail fraud had occurred at meijer,and that a person fitting boykin description and driving boykin car had committed the offense.this information came from dispatch,who had spoken directly with security guards chaney and youmans.once the officers arrived at boykin house and spoke with him,they confirmed,based on his own admissions and his inability to produce a receipt,that he was indeed the alleged perpetrator.
whether it was reasonable for the meijer defendants to conclude that a theft had actually occurred is of course a valid question,but this is a question that meijer and its security guards must answer,as discussed in the ensuing section.the van buren township police officers can not be held least not on grounds of unconstitutionally arresting an individual without probable an error,assuming there was one,wholly attributable to meijer employees.if the tip had lacked the indicia of reliability essential to support probable cause,then the officers would have violated the fourth amendment in arresting boykin.see illinois gates,d.but such is not the case here.the officers were relayed information about a suspected theft at a major local retail store.they presumably receive such calls with relative frequency,and there would have been no reason for them to doubt the veracity of the information they received,especially in light of the facts they were able to corroborate once they spoke with boykin.
the district court was also correct in holding,in light of its finding that there was no constitutional violation committed by officers hayes or harrison,that boykin claim of municipal liability necessarily fails.op.at see also blackmore kalamazoo county,cir a municipality or county can not be liable under absent an underlying constitutional violation by its officers.further,the district court was correct in ruling that under michigan law,van buren township police department is subsumed within van buren township as a municipal entity to be sued under,and thus the police department was improperly included as a separate defendant in boykin suit.see laise city of utica,noting that a city police department is merely an agency of the city,and therefore is not a proper defendant in a lawsuit.
in light of these considerations,we affirm the district court dismissal of boykin claims against all van buren township defendants 
meijer defendants 
as to defendants chaney,youmans,and meijer,the district court at first questioned whether,as private persons,they were properly state actors for purposes of.the district court did not think that these private defendants met any of the tests for private conduct attributable to the state.yet because the meijer defendants conceded state action,the court proceeded with an analysis of whether they had violated boykin constitutional rights,concluding that they had not.
a claim must satisfy two elements the deprivation of a right secured by the constitution or laws of the united states and the deprivation was caused by a person acting under color of state law.a plaintiff may not proceed under against a private party no matter how discriminatory or wrongful the party conduct.tahfs proctor,cir.with this framework in mind,we need not inquire least for the actions of meijer or its defendant security guards,chaney and youmans,if they are not deemed to have acted under color of state law,that is,if they are not deemed to be state actors.see also romanski detroit entertainment,cir section makes liable only those who,while acting under color of state law,deprive another of a right secured by the constitution or federal law.the supreme court has developed three tests for determining the existence of state action in a particular case the public function test,the state compulsion test,and the symbiot
