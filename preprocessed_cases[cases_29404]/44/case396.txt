this diversity action arises out of the arrest of plaintiff michael for shoplifting.after his criminal case was dismissed,plaintiff sued defendant hannaford brothers,alleging false imprisonment,false arrest,malicious prosecution,and defamation.after a three day trial,the jury returned a general verdict in favor of plaintiff and awarded him in damages.defendant appeals,arguing that the district court erroneously instructed the jury on false arrest under new hampshire law erred in denying it judgment as a matter of law on plaintiff false imprisonment claim erred in denying it judgment as a matter of law on plaintiff malicious prosecution claim and erred in denying its motion for remittitur we have jurisdiction,and affirm.
the evidence presented at trial,viewed in a light most favorable to the jury verdict,demonstrated the following plaintiff and his companion,lara mcruer,went shopping at defendant grocery store on the evening of july.louis frender,the store night manager,saw plaintiff and mcruer in the store and immediately began videotaping them with the store security system.frender knew plaintiff from a previous dispute over video rental privileges at the store.
plaintiff and mcruer completed shopping and paid for their groceries.mcruer put the receipt in her wallet.upon leaving the store,however,plaintiff and mcruer realized they had purchased the wrong type of drixoral a cold and sinus medication.plaintiff returned to the store to exchange the drixoral.upon reentering the store,plaintiff testified that he informed a store clerk of his intent to exchange the drixoral.plaintiff left the drixoral at a vacant checkout counter.he returned to the drug aisle and obtained a different type of drixoral.plaintiff also grabbed some bottled water.he then proceeded to a checkout register,told a different clerk he already had paid for the drixoral,paid for the water,and left the grocery store.
meanwhile,frender asked the clerk who checked plaintiff out the second time whether plaintiff had paid for the drixoral.the clerk said no.frender pursued plaintiff outside the store.frender apprehended plaintiff in the parking lot and asked him to return to the store.plaintiff complied.frender and another store employee escorted plaintiff to the store security room and began questioning him about the drixoral.
frender subsequently called the franklin police department.officer scott tompkins responded.frender showed officer tompkins the portion of the surveillance videotape beginning when plaintiff reentered the store and left without paying for the second box of drixoral.officer tompkins contacted mcruer,who informed him that plaintiff simply wanted to exchange the drixoral.officer tompkins nevertheless arrested plaintiff for shoplifting.the state charged plaintiff with shoplifting however,a new hampshire court later dismissed the criminal case.this suit followed.
first,defendant argues the district court erroneously instructed the jury on false arrest because the court false arrest instruction punishes citizens for reporting crimes in good faith if the arrest is later found to be technically unlawful the instruction negates the merchant privilege and the court erroneously instructed the jury that plaintiff arrest was unlawful as a matter of law.where,as here,abstract errors of law are claimed,we review jury instructions de novo.goodman bowdoin college,cir.an erroneous jury instruction warrants a new trial if the preserved error,based on a review of the entire record,can fairly be said to have prejudiced the objecting party.id.internal quotation and citation omitted.the district court false arrest jury instruction stated in relevant part 
false arrest is a form of false imprisonment.to be found liable on this claim,hannaford brothers,must have instigated or participated in the unlawful arrest of.
in the instance of an arrest without a warrant,the law of arrest determines whether the arrest was lawful.new hampshire revised statutes annotated rsa provides in relevant part that 
i.an arrest by a peace officer without a warrant on a charge of a misdemeanor or a violation is lawful whenever 
a he has probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed a misdemeanor or violation in his presence 
if the arrest is unlawful under the law of arrest,the good faith of the instigator or participator,or reasonable belief that the arrest is authorized or justified is not a defense.probable cause is not a defense to an action for false imprisonment,if the arrest is otherwise unlawful.i instruct you that the arrest of by the franklin police was unlawful under the facts of this case 
instigation consists of words or acts which direct,request,invite or encourage the false imprisonment itself it is not enough for instigation that the actor has given information to the police about the commission of a crime,or has accused the other of committing it,so long as he leaves to the police the decision as to what shall be done about any request,without persuading or influencing them.
therefore,the only issue for you to decide in this count is whether hannaford brothers,instigated or participated in the arrest.if it did you must find for the plaintiff on this count.if not then you must find for the defendant on this count.
we discuss and reject defendant three arguments in turn.
first,the instruction does not hold citizens who simply report crimes liable for an unlawful arrest.the district court expressly instructed the jury that it could only find false arrest if defendant instigated or participated in the arrest.this was a correct statement of law.see restatement second of torts civil jury instr,committee cmt.to instigate or participate,as the district court aptly explained,means more than giv ing information to the police about the commission of a crime.restatement second of torts,cmt.instead,i nstigation consists of words or acts which direct,request,invite or encourage the false imprisonment.see also harper,james,gray the law of torts,at ed explaining that while the mere giving of inaccurate information is not a basis for liability,a private citizen who knowingly conveys false information to the police may be held liable for a subsequent false arrest.the jury found defendant instigated participated in plaintiff unlawful arrest if we presume as we must that it followed the court instruction.see sheek asia badger,cir.thus,the jury did not punish defendant for reporting a crime in good faith nor did it find defendant vicariously liable for the actions of the police.to the contrary,the jury held defendant liable and compensated plaintiff for his injuries as a result of defendant independent tortious conduct that is,for persuading or influencing officer tompkins in the decision to arrest plaintiff.
second,the false arrest instruction does not negate the merchant privilege.according to defendant,the court instruction that the good faith of the instigator or participator,or reasonable belief is not a defense,conflicts with and negates the merchant privilege,which permits a merchant to detain a customer if they have reasonable grounds to believe that a customer has shoplifted.ann.a.the court false arrest instruction,however,only references the reasonable belief and good faith of the instigator if the arrest is unlawful.the court instructed the jury that as a matter of law,the arrest was unlawful.the disputed language,therefore,was entirely superfluous and the jury never had occasion to consider the language further,the jury verdict demonstrates,through a special interrogatory finding,that frender was aware plaintiff reentered the store carrying a box of drixoral.the jury finding undermines defendant contention that the jury would have applied the merchant privilege.the finding clearly shows the jury determined defendant did not have reasonable grounds to believe plaintiff was shoplifting.ann.thus,the jury had independent grounds to,and did,reject the merchant privilege defense.
third,the district court correctly instructed the jury that plaintiff arrest was unlawful as a matter of law.officer tompkins did not have probable cause to believe plaintiff committed a misdemeano
