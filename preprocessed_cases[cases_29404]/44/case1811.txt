this case requires us to consider the continued viability of our longstanding precedent holding that a watercraft under construction is not a vessel in navigation for purposes of the jones act.we hold that the supreme court decision in stewart dutra construction company,d,has not effectively overruled that precedent because the decision did not concern or address the point at which a actually becomes a vessel.we therefore reverse the district court denial of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
background 
in,rocky cain began working as a driller on a drilling rig in the gulf of mexico for sonat offshore usa.sonat later became part of transocean offshore usa.on march,transocean assigned cain as a toolpusher to the cajun construction site in singapore.cain worked in singapore for approximately six months at the ppl shipyard,where the cajun express was under construction.the cajun express is a mobile offshore drilling rig designed to drill for oil and gas.cain was expected to continue working on the cajun express,or a sister rig,after construction was complete.cain supervised a drill crew of seven men and was responsible for overseeing safety issues and commissioning the drilling equipment.
during the first half of,the cajun express underwent sea trials to ensure that the power generation and navigation systems worked and that the structure was watertight for transit.with tugboat assistance,the cajun express was then towed with men and equipment aboard to grand isle,louisiana.during the journey,workers continued to build the rig,and cain continued to test equipment.upon arriving in the gulf of mexico,the cajun express was moored in a floating shipyard for completion of construction.
although the rig was capable of,it was not fully capable of operating as a drilling rig.the necessary construction still included installation of vital equipment and blisters,which are large steel boxes welded to the rig to increase its buoyancy.daniel haslam,a transocean engineer,testified that when it arrived in the gulf of mexico the cajun express could lay pipe only under limited weather conditions.however,as a fifth generation unit,the most state of the art in the industry,the cajun express was not designed to operate only under limited conditions.haslam testified that no drilling contractor would have found the cajun express fit for the purpose of drilling a deepwater well in the gulf of mexico.
on september,cain was working on board the cajun express.at that time,the blisters still had not been installed and the drilling systems had not been commissioned.cain entered a warehouse located on board the rig to retrieve a part for a member of the drill crew,whereupon he struck his head on a light fixture and was injured.a neurosurgeon later examined cain and recommended that he undergo physical therapy.cain received physical therapy and continued to work on board the cajun express.in april or may,the cajun express was finally completed and began drilling operations in the gulf of mexico.
cain continued to work as a toolpusher on the cajun express but was subsequently diagnosed with a herniated disc.in september,he discontinued work to undergo a cervical discectomy and fusion.cain returned to work in december,when transocean assigned him to a work hardening program at the fontana center,a facility in lafayette,louisiana.while participating in the work hardening program,cain allegedly experienced elevated blood pressure and suffered additional injuries.
cain filed suit under the jones act,alleging that his injuries were the result of transocean negligence and the unseaworthiness of the cajun express.he also alleged that transocean was negligent in assigning him to the work hardening program.transocean moved for summary judgment,arguing that cain was not a jones act seaman at the time of his injury because the cajun express was not yet a vessel in navigation.the district court denied transocean motion,concluding that the supreme court decision in stewart had overruled fifth circuit precedent concerning watercraft under construction.the district court held that the cajun express was a vessel at the time of cain injury because under stewart it was capable of transporting workers and equipment over water.this court granted transocean petition for leave to appeal the district court denial of summary judgment.fontana center has not submitted a brief and has not raised any arguments on appeal.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court denial of summary judgment de novo.solano gulf king,cir.summary judgment is proper if the evidence shows the existence of no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.
transocean argues on appeal that under our established precedent the cajun express was not a vessel in navigation,and therefore cain was not a jones act seaman,because the rig was still under construction at the time of cain injury.it further argues that the supreme court decision in stewart has effected no change on our prior case law.we agree with both contentions.
seaman status and our established precedent 
we begin by describing two of the principal remedies available to injured workers who ply their trade in connection with the sea the jones act and the longshore harbor workers compensation act lhwca.the two acts are mutually exclusive compensation regimes.becker tidewater,cir.the jones act permits a seaman to sue his employer for personal injuries suffered as a result of the employer negligence.park stockstill boat rentals,cir citing a.such an action allows for potentially unlimited damages and is in contrast to the generally prescribed remedial scheme available to maritime workers under the lhwca.see becker,at.congress did not define the term seaman,however,and left the courts to decide which maritime employees were covered by the jones act.chandris,latsis,d.
the lhwca provides the exclusive remedy to workers who fall within its provisions.id.at.it specifically excludes from its coverage a master or member of a crew of any vessel.g.the supreme court has held this exclusion to be a refinement of the term seaman under the jones act.chandris,at.thus,a key requirement for jones act coverage is actually found in the lhwca.id.
under the jones act,a seaman is a term of art for an employee whose duties contribut e to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission and who has a connection to a vessel in navigation or to an identifiable group of such vessels that is substantial in terms of both its duration and its nature.chandris,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also garret dean shank drilling,cir the worker is a seaman if he is assigned permanently to a vessel in navigation or performs a substantial part of his work on the vessel,contributing to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission.the existence of a vessel is thus crucial to determining seaman status under the jones act.holmes atl.sounding,cir.
we have long held that the jones act analysis requires a watercraft to be in navigation,and we have drawn a distinction between completed crafts and crafts that are under construction.a maritime worker assisting in the building and ultimate commissioning of a launched but uncompleted vessel floating or maneuvering in navigable waters is not a seaman within the meaning of the jones act,because his vessel is not yet an instrumentality of or is therefore not in navigation.williams avondale shipyards,cir.in williams,we held that a launched ship conducting sea trials was not in navigation because it was not yet being used for its intended purpose.id.
similarly,in garret,we held that an offshore drilling rig was not a vessel in navigation because,at the time of the plaintiff injury,the structure was still undergoing final construction to make it operational as an oil and gas drilling rig.at.we noted that the structure had never been engaged as an instrument of commerce and held that a nonmerchant vessel is in navigation if it is engaged in its expected duties on navigable waters.id.
in the instant case,the cajun express was still under construction at the time of cain injury.although the rig was capable of and had run some test pipe,it lacked vital equipment to make it fully operational as an oil and gas drilling rig.indeed,as daniel haslam testified,no drilling contractor would have found the cajun express fit to drill a deepwater well in the gulf of mexico.the cajun express was not finally completed and placed into service until april or may,after cain was injured.thus,under established fifth circuit precedent,the cajun express was not a vessel in navigation and cain was not a jones act seaman.
we now turn to the supreme court decision in stewart dutra construction company.in stewart,the court addressed whether a dredge known as the super scoop was a vessel under the lhwca.at.although the case specifically concerned the lhwca,we have recognized that stewart analysis of the term vessel applies equally to the lhwca and to the jones act.holmes,at.
the super scoop was a floating platform with a clamshell bucket suspended beneath the water used to remove silt from the ocean floor.stewart,at.the dredge was engaged in digging a trench beneath boston harbor as part of the big dig project.id.it had limited means of and was typically moved by tugboat,but it could move short distances by manipulating its anchors and cables.id.
the first circuit applied its test for vessel status found in digiovanni traylor,cir en banc,which had held that if a barge or other float purpose or primary business is not navigation or commerce,then workers assigned thereto for its shore enterprise are to be considered seamen only when it is in actual navigation or transit at the time of the plaintiff injury.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the first circuit held that the super scoop was not a vessel because any navigation was incidental to the craft primary function of construction.id.at.it also found significant the dredge stationary position at the time of the plaintiff injury.id.
the supreme court rejected the first circuit test for vessel status,concluding that although congress did not define vessel in the lhwca or the jones act,it had already defined vessel elsewhere at the time both acts were passed.id.at.specifically,under formerly of the revised statutes of,a vessel includes every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used,or capable of being used,as a means of transportation on water.significantly,codified the meaning that the term vessel had acquired in general maritime law,and the court noted the historic case law prior to the jones act and the lhwca where courts had often used definition to conclude that dredges were vessels.id.at.the early case law showed that at the time the jones act and lhwca were passed in the,a structure status as a vessel depended on whether the structure was a means of transportation.id.at.
relying on,the court held that a vessel is any watercraft practically capable of maritime transportation,regardless of its primary purpose or state of transit at a particular moment.id.at.in other words,the court rejected the first circuit test,which had asked whether a craft was used primarily for transportation,and if not whether the craft was motionless or moving at the time of the plaintiff injury.the court looked only to whether the dredge could be used for transportation.because the super scoop was not only capable of transporting men and equipment but had actually done so,the court found that the dredge was a vessel for purposes of the lhwca.id.at.
with respect to the requirement that a vessel be in navigation,the court clarified that the requirement was meant to show only that structures could lose their vessel status if they are withdrawn from the water for extended periods.id.at.the in navigation requirement does not stand apart from and is relevant to whether the craft is used,or capable of being used for maritime transportation.id.but t he question remains in all cases whether the watercraft use as a means of transportation on water is a practical possibility or merely a theoretical one.id.
stewart and 
the district court held that the cajun express was a vessel under stewart because not only was it capable of transportation but it had also transported workers and equipment from singapore to the gulf of mexico.we disagree,however,that stewart was intended to apply to watercraft that are still under construction.w e can not overrule the decision of a prior panel unless such overruling is unequivocally directed by controlling supreme court precedent.united states,cir emphasis added.we conclude that our body of law in this area has not been effectively overruled.
the language in stewart is admittedly broad,and we have recognized that the court decision significantly enlarges the types of unconventional and special purpose watercraft that now must be considered vessels that might not have met the test before stewart.see holmes,at.stewart began,however,by framing the issue before it narrowly whether a dredge is a vessel under the lhwca.stewart,at.the court decided that specific question,concluding that the first circuit focus on an existing craft purpose and movement was inconsistent with the text of and the established meaning of vessel in general maritime law.we thus read stewart instruction that a craft is a vessel if it is capable of marine transportation in the context of that case to negate the first circuit test for an established structure.
stewart examined an structure in use for its intended purpose.stewart did not concern what to do with ships and other structures under construction,and so the court did not address whether s definition of vessel applies to incomplete structures that may be in a dry dock or a floating shipyard.in other words,stewart did not consider whether an incomplete structure that is not yet an instrumentality of commerce,williams,at,is a vessel in navigation.rather,stewart stressed that the in navigation requirement had nothing to do with locomotion and instead meant that structures may lose their character as vessels if they have been withdrawn from the water for extended periods of time.stewart,at.but for a structure to be able to lose its vessel status by being taken out of navigation,it must be equally true that a structure may not attain vessel status before it is ever put into navigation.
other courts have similarly concluded that an incomplete structure that has not been put into navigation as an instrument of commerce is not a vessel.see caruso sterling yacht shipbuilders,cir frankel shipyard,cir.moreover,courts have historically spoken of navigation in tandem with commerce.see,the robert parsons.holding that a barge drawn by horses in the erie canal was a vessel because s o long as the vessel is engaged in commerce and navigation it is difficult to see how the jurisdiction of admiralty is affected by its means of propulsion cope vallette.noting that a ship or vessel,used for navigation and commerce,though lying at a wharf,and temporarily made fast thereto,as well as her furniture and cargo,are maritime subjects people ferry of boston beers,how.t he admiralty courts now exercise jurisdiction over rivers and inland waters,wherever navigation is or may be carried on,and extends to almost every description of vessel which may be employed in transporting our products to market the admiralty jurisdiction,in cases of contract,depends primarily upon the nature of the contract,and is limited to contracts,claims,and services,purely maritime,and touching rights and duties appertaining to commerce and navigation.
that is not to say that only commercial structures may become vessels and implicate admiralty jurisdiction.see,sisson ruby,d admiralty jurisdiction in tort requires inter alia that an incident have a potentially disruptive effect on maritime commerce and be substantially related to maritime activity,such as navigation,but the tortfeasor activity may be commercial or noncommercial.rather,our precedent is not inconsistent with the historical perspective that vessels under construction are treated differently from completed vessels.see the francis mcdonald.holding in a contract case that shipbuilding has been con
