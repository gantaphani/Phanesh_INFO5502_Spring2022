opinion of the court 
this tax dispute arose in the course of bankruptcy proceedings for harvard industries,and related entities collectively harvard.its resolution requires us to determine the meaning of specified liability losses as that phrase is used in f in the bankruptcy court,harvard attempted to collect a federal tax refund for the tax year based upon three categories of specified liability losses incurred in the tax year that purportedly qualified for a special net operating loss pursuant to b c the bankruptcy court allowed the for each of the claimed expenses over the government objection.
on appeal from the bankruptcy court,the district court ruled that i payments to a qualified pension plan that were made pursuant to a settlement agreement with the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc did not arise under federal law and were therefore not specified liability losses under ii losses incurred in relation to the manufacture of defective lock nuts were not product liability damages within the meaning of,and hence were not specified liability losses but iii payments made pursuant to a retrospective workers compensation insurance policy were properly deductible as specified liability losses in the tax year.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm in part and reverse in part.
factual background 
in,harvard earned profits of approximately million and hence paid a total of in federal income taxes.for the tax year,harvard sustained a net operating loss of.on april,harvard filed an amended corporation income tax return in which it claimed a refund in the amount of for the tax year based on a specified liability loss generated during the tax year that was purportedly eligible to be carried back ten years pursuant to of the internal revenue code in a notice of partial claim allowance dated february,the internal revenue service irs allowed the for such losses as were attributable to workers compensation payments,but denied the remainder of the claimed refund.
on march,harvard filed a protest to the first partial disallowance and challenged the service basis for denying portions of its refund claim.harvard also expanded the refund claim to include,among other things i product liability payments in the amount of which included forgiven accounts receivable and a settlement payment to one distributor in connection with defective manufactured by a harvard operating division and ii prior year pension payments in the amount of the pbgc payments.
the irs issued a second notice of partial disallowance on october,denying harvard refund application for the and the pbgc payments.the irs denied the claim related to the because i harvard liability was based on breach of contract and breach of implied warranty of merchantability,as opposed to product liability ii harvard customers suffered no physical or emotional harm due to the defective iii costs incurred by harvard were for repair and replacement of the.the irs also determined that the pension payments were not eligible for a because the code requires that the event giving rise to an eligible liability under state or federal law must occur at least three years before the tax year in question,in this case.the irs position was that because the payments were made pursuant to a settlement agreement with the pbgc in,they did not meet the code requirements for eligible special liability loss.the irs also took the position that the formation of pension plans and the decision to enter a settlement agreement with the pbgc regarding additional funding requirements for the pension plans were voluntary decisions of harvard,not arising under federal law as required by the code.rather,they related to an obligation under federal law,which is not enough to satisfy the arising under element required for the special provision of the code.as we explain below,this ongoing dispute was ultimately brought before the bankruptcy court.
losses related to defective 
elastic stop nut of america esna,an operating division of harvard,manufactured for use in commercial and military aircraft engines and airframes.harvard sold the to various distributors,who resold them to aircraft manufacturers.military and commercial specifications required that the be baked for hours in order to withstand extreme temperatures during use.failure to comply with this requirement could result in a condition called hydrogen embrittlement which could cause the to crack and fail.
in,it was discovered in the course of an internal investigation that certain of harvard were defective because they had not been baked for hours as required.when the defect was discovered,harvard informed its customers and stopped shipping the pending further investigation.prior to the time harvard stopped shipping the,there were no reported instances in which the failure of an esna caused an accident or resulted in personal injury or property damage.in some cases,efforts were made to recall and rework some of the.however,several distributors who had received the defective refused to pay for them because they could not be resold had to be recalled.
harvard largest suit against harvard based on the sale of defective,alleging breach of contract breach of implied warranty of merchantability breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing fraud negligent misrepresentation and civil rico violations.the suit was ultimately settled in an agreement dated april.pursuant to that agreement,harvard paid harco and harco agreed to release and discharge harvard from any and all claims asserted in harco complaint.harvard then entered into settlement agreements with other distributors,whereby esna forgave a total of in receivables for the.harvard subsequently claimed that it should be allowed to treat all these expenses as product liability losses eligible for a.
pbgc settlement pension payments 
harvard filed for chapter bankruptcy in may of thereafter,the bankruptcy court confirmed a plan of reorganization which required harvard to pay all holders of allowed unsecured claims cents on the dollar by.in order to meet its obligations under the plan,harvard sought to obtain million in financing by offering senior unsecured notes.
however,the pbgc was concerned about the issuance of the notes.harvard pension plans had a substantial amount of unfunded benefit liabilities due to erroneous actuarial assumptions underlying pension plan contributions for and.the pbgc therefore took the position that the note offering might provide sufficient basis for the pbgc to seek termination of one or more of harvard pension plans pursuant to section a of erisa,a.negotiations followed in which the pbgc and harvard reached a settlement agreement.pursuant to that agreement,harvard made a million additional contribution to its pension plans in and agreed to pay an additional million for each of twelve consecutive quarters thereafter 
the pbgc settlement agreement contains restrictions on the amount and use of the proposed senior notes.harvard warranted in the agreement that as of the date of execution of this settlement agreement there are no past due minimum funding contributions owed to any of its pension plans,and the pbgc agreed that it would not institute proceedings to terminate any of taxpayer pension plans as a result of the senior notes offering.
workers compensation payments 
from april to april,harvard annually purchased insurance policies from the wausau insurance company wausau.the policies included insurance for general liability,workers compensation and automobile insurance.harvard describes the wausau workers compensation polices as retrospective insurance plans.pursuant to these policies,harvard paid an initial premium at the beginning of each policy year based on actuarial assumptions about the amount of claims that would be paid.once harvard paid its premium to wausau,wausau had access to these funds and used them to pay claims covered by the policy.
at the end of each policy year,adjustments were made to the premium based on the difference between the actual amount paid out on claims and the expected claim amounts that had been estimated based on actuarial assumptions.even after the policy years expired,as claims arising in those years were paid,harvard could be required to submit additional payments.wausau periodically sent reports to harvard concerning claim activity.by comparing year to year reports,wausau could determine if harvard had to make additional payments to cover any shortfall for each plan year.harvard also paid taxes and premium expenses for plan administration,calculated as a percentage of claims expenses.
according to testimony given by a harvard representative,harvard records indicated that the retrospective adjustments pertaining to the refund request at issue here were sent to harvard around october.wausau and harvard then commenced negotiations and ultimately came to an agreement as to the appropriate adjustments in early.the trust also seeks to those payments to wausau as specified liability losses arising under state law because they constitute harvard obligation to provide workers compensation benefits for its employees.
ii.procedural background.
on january,harvard,along with several subsidiaries,filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.thereafter,harvard filed a motion requesting a determination as to debtor rights to a tax refund.the substance of the motion dealt with the three categories of supposed specified liability losses described above.harvard argued that each expense qualified for a refund of federal taxes paid for the tax year.the motion was heard as a contested matter pursuant to fed.bank.while the motion was pending,harvard reorganization plan was confirmed and the harvard secured creditors liquidation trust the trust became the party in interest with respect to any potential refund.eventually,the trust and the government filed for summary judgment in the bankruptcy court.
on march,the bankruptcy court granted the trust summary judgment motion with respect to two of the three categories of specified liability loss expenses at issue.in re harvard.the court ruled that the related payments were product liability losses as they were a liability of the taxpayer for damages on account of loss of the use of property in accordance with f.the court reasoned that s ince the term property is not defined in the statute,it must be accorded its ordinary meaning which would include the at issue here.id.at.the bankruptcy court also ruled that the pension payments arose under erisa,and were therefore also specified liability losses under the tax code.id.at.thus,harvard was entitled to a refund as a result of the allowance of these expenses.the bankruptcy court denied harvard motion with respect to the third category of claimed expenses workmen compensation premiums pending additional discovery,and denied the government for summary judgment.the amount of the overpayment ordered by the bankruptcy court exceeded the tax paid when added to the refund amounts already received by harvard.therefore,no further refunds could be ordered and the bankruptcy court summary judgment order was final.thereafter,the government appealed to the united states district court for the district of new jersey,which had jurisdiction under a.
for reasons we explain below,the district court reversed the bankruptcy court order with regard to the expenses and the pbgc payments,and remanded the matter for resolution of the third disputed category of losses.after a hearing,the bankruptcy court ordered that harvard was entitled to a refund with respect to the retrospective adjustments to its workers compensation plan,but held that administrative fees associated with the plan could not be included in the.on november,the trust appealed to the district court and the district court subsequently affirmed in part,reversed with respect to administrative costs associated with the policy,and remanded to the bankruptcy court for entry of judgment.the district court order is a final order because it disposes of all claims with respect to all parties.thereafter,the trust appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to d.

iv.analysis.
all of the issues before us turn on the interpretation of of the.in,that section allowed for certain portions of net operating losses,called specified liability losses,to be carried back ten years to offset tax liabilities incurred in more profitable years.
during the period in question,f defined specified liability loss as follows 
in term specified liability loss means the sum of the following amounts to the extent taken into account in computing the net operating loss for the taxable year 
a any amount allowable as a deduction under section or which is attributable to 
i product liability,or 
ii expenses incurred in the investigation or settlement of,or opposition to,claims against the taxpayer on account of product liability.
b any amount not described in subparagraph a allowable as a deduction under this chapter with respect to a liability which arises under federal or state law,or out of any tort of the taxpayer if 
i in the case of a liability arising out of a federal or state law,the act or failure to act giving rise to such liability occurs at least years before the beginning of the taxable year 
the trust contends that all three categories of expenses at issue here qualify as specified liability losses under this section of the code and can thus be carried back to harvard eligible for a refund from that year.as noted earlier,harvard claims that expenses related to the qualify as product liability losses,while the pension payments and the workers compensation insurance payments purportedly arise out of a federal or state law,and therefore satisfy the requirements of f.
as there is no binding authority interpreting this statute,we rely on basic tenets of statutory interpretation.when interpreting a statute,the literal meaning of the statute is most important,and we are always to read the statute in its ordinary and natural sense.galloway united states,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in construing the tax code,we strictly construe deductions and allow such deductions only as there is a clear provision therefor.id.moreover,we rely on the legislative history only where the text itself is ambiguous.id.we have recently ruled that where a provision of the is ambiguous,we apply a chevron analysis to any applicable treasury regulations.swallows holding,comm r,cir.
product liability losses.
the defines product liability for purposes of section f a i as 
a liability of the taxpayer for damages on account of physical injury or emotional harm to individuals or damage to or loss of the use of property,on account of any defect in any product which is manufactured,leased,or sold by the taxpayer,but only if 
b such injury,harm or damage arises after the taxpayer has completed or terminated operations with respect to,and has relinquished possession of,such product.
f.neither the supreme court,nor any circuit court of appeals has interpreted this provision.
the bankruptcy court analyzed the language of the statute and concluded that harvard settlement with harco and other customers qualified as liability for damages on account of loss of the use of property.at quoting f.it reasoned that the word property,which is not defined in the statute,should be read to include the themselves.therefore,the court concluded 
loss of the use of the defective property is precisely what occurred here.harvard customers were distributors who were unable to use the manufactured by harvard because of a defect known as hydrogen embrittlement.here again,the court gives the term use its plain meaning which would include intended use as an item to resell.
the district court rejected the interpretation of the bankruptcy court.it reasoned that 
loss contemplates possession followed by the failure to maintain possession.harvard customers did not have possession of fit for resale at any point they merely had possession of defective that were unfit for resale.consequently,harvard customers could not have lost the use of the property for its intended purpose where they did not possess usable in the first place.
additionally,section f b requires that such injury,harm,or damage arises after the taxpayer has completed or terminated operations with respect to,and has relinquished possession of,such product.in the instant case,the defect that gave rise to harvard liability arose during the manufacturing of the,as harvard own brief admits.since the damage to the property clearly occurred before harvard relinquished possession of the product,the damage to the is excepted from the statutory definition of product liability as stated in f.
as we have just noted,product liability is liability of the taxpayer for damages on account of physical injury or emotional harm to individuals or damage to or loss of the use of property,on account of any defect in any product which is manufactured,leased,or sold by the taxpayer f a emphasis added.it is uncontested that the were defective.it is also uncontested that none of harvard customers suffered physical injury or emotional harm because of the defective there is also no allegation that any of the caused any damage to other property of any customer or user.for instance,had a defective caused a plane to crash,harvard might well have been liable for the cost of replacing the plane as well as other damages.the question then is whether the distributor inability to resell the defective product itself qualifies as damage to or loss of the use of property.
both the district court and the bankruptcy court examined the statute closely,referencing dictionary meanings for each significant term.yet,those two courts arrived at opposite conclusions.this clearly suggests an ambiguity in the language of the statute.much of the textual ambiguity arises from the fact that it is not clear whether congress intended property in the phrase,loss of the use of property,to include the defective product itself as opposed to the property of downstream purchasers or users to which the defective product has caused loss or damage.
in arguing that property refers to something other than the actual,the government focuses on the fact that congress used property and product differently in the statute.relying on this distinction,the government reminds us that 
where the statutory language refers to the defective product,it uses the term product,which term appears once in subparagraph a and once in subparagraph b.f.subparagraph a refers to damages on account of any defect in any product,while subparagraph b refers to the requirement that the damage arises after the taxpayer has completed or terminated operations with respect to,and has relinquished possession of,such product.f.not only is the defective product referred to in both instances by the term product,but the second instance in effect refers back to the first instance by using the term such product.id.
on the other hand,the term product does not appear in the phrase loss of the use of property,the statutory language does not refer to a loss of use of the product or other property.id.rather,the statute refers to a loss of use of property.id.in this context,the term product,and not the term property,refers to the.thus,when viewed in the context of the definition as a whole,the distributor inability to resell the did not constitute a loss of use of property.
reply br.although this approach has some surface appeal,we believe it actually does more to demonstrate the difficulty of textual analysis than to establish the congressional intent underlying the language we must interpret.
we therefore turn to legislative history for guidance.in re unisys sav.plan litigation,cir if the statutory language is unclear,we then look to a statute legislative history.the house conference report stated that t he definition of product liability under the senate amendment is intended to include the kinds of damages that are recoverable under prevalent theories of product liability,at,cong.it went on to state that t he definition of product liability in the amendment does not include liabilities arising under warranty,which essentially are contract liabilities.id.at,cong,unfortunately,there was more than one prevalent theory about the kinds of damages recoverable under product liability law when the statute was enacted.fortunately,the supreme court has discussed the divergent views of product liability that were viable around that time.
in east river steamship transamerica delaval,d,a defectively designed ship turbine component malfunctioned and damaged the turbine itself without harming any other part of the ship.the supreme court was called upon to determine whether,in the context of admiralty law,injury to a product itself was the kind of harm that should be addressed by contract law or product liability law.this was then a question of first impression in admiralty.the court began its analysis by noting that general maritime law is an amalgam of traditional rules,modifications of those rules,and newly created rules,which are d rawn from state and federal sources.id.at.it is this analysis of prevailing common law rules that makes the court opinion useful to our analysis here.
the court viewed the paradigmatic action as one where a product reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril,distributed without reinspection,causes bodily injury.id.at.citing macpherson buick motor.it then discussed the expansion of products liability to include protection against property damage based on similar concerns of safety.id.at.however,the expansion traditionally only involved cases where the defective product damages other property.id.emphasis added.
the court described the majority approach as one which held that there should be no action in tort for purely monetary harm in order to preserv e a proper role for the law of warranty id.at.citation omitted.the minority approach held that a manufacturer duty to make nondefective products encompassed injury to the product itself,whether or not the defect created an unreasonable risk of harm.id.at.after evaluating the merits of these different approaches,the court concluded that where the only injury was to the product itself,the resulting loss due to repair costs,decreased value,and lost profits is essentially the failure of the purchaser to receive the benefit of its the core concern of contract law.id.at.citing farnsworth,contracts.the court concluded that a manufacturer in a commercial relationship has no duty under either a negligence or strict theory to prevent a product from injuring itself.id.the court also reasoned that the policy concerns for public safety were not as compelling in these circumstances as in those where bodily injury or harm to other property occurred.
thereafter,we had to decide what rule pennsylvania would adopt when a defective product damaged itself.in aloe coal clark equipment,cir,we predicted that pennsylvania courts,although not bound to do so,would nevertheless adopt the supreme court reasoning in east river.id.at.in so doing,we reversed a conclusion we had reached in a previous case,because we were persuaded by the cogent reasoning of east river.id.at.
neither of these cases controls our present inquiry under the tax code.however,we continue to find the reasoning of east river persuasive,and the distinction it draws between warranty and contract damages on the one hand,and product liability and tort damages on the other,is similar to that drawn by the congress that drafted and enacted f.moreover,this approach is reinforced here because harco sued harvard on various theories of contract and warranty liability based on the defective.harco did not assert a product liability cause of action.thus,the damages here are liabilities arising under warranty,which congress did not intend to include in the statute.
as noted earlier,the taxpayer has the burden of proving its eligibility for a deduction,and statutes authorizing deductions are a matter of legislative grace and are to be construed narrowly unless the text of the statute authorizing the deduction reflects a different congressional intent.see properties,government of the virgin islands,cir.viewed in that context,we are not persuaded by the trust argument that the irs interpretation of the statute will leave manufacturers with no incentive to make safe products.in fact,the argument is specious.even if corporations are not allowed to this deduction may still take a deduction for such expenses in the applicable tax year.furthermore,regardless of how such liabilities are treated for tax purposes,the threat of products liability and other claims hangs over a company that makes unsafe products.here,for example,the potential products liability and tort recovery from death and injury that could have resulted from a plane crash caused by the defective would dwarf the claimed tax benefit of allowing a ten year.
we therefore conclude that the district court did not err in reversing the bankruptcy court conclusion that the loss fell within the scope of f.the district court was correct in accepting the government position and disallowing the trust claim that the payments for defective qualified for the ten year.
pbgc payments 
a taxpayer may also claim a specified liability loss if the deduction arises under a federal or state law if the act or failure to act giving rise to such liability occurs at least years before the beginning of the taxable year and the taxpayer used an accrual method of accounting throughout the period or periods during which the acts or failures to act giving rise to such liability occurred.f b.
as explained above,harvard made million in payments to its various pension plans in the tax year pursuant to the settlement agreement with the pbgc.the trust argues that these payments arose under the employee retirement income security act,et.erisa.erisa sets minimum standards for most voluntarily established pension and health plans in private industry.the trust maintains that the underfunding of harvard pension plans in and created erisa liability and that the liability therefore arose under erisa and was partially discharged through the pbgc payments.thus,according to the trust,those payments meet the statute requirements because they constitute a liability that arose under federal law and accrued at least three years before the loss.
the government argues that these payments are not a specialized liability loss for two reasons.first,the pbgc payments are not rooted in federal law rather,they resulted from choices made by harvard.second,the relevant act was the choice to enter into a settlement agreement with the pbgc in act which occurred less than three years before the payments.
however,we are persuaded by the bankruptcy court insightful analysis of this issue.we therefore adopt the bankruptcy court cogent and persuasive discussion of this issue 
in arguing that the payments did not arise under federal law,the irs focuses on the fact that harvard had satisfied its minimum funding requirements under section of the irc.that argument ignores the fact that those are not the only payment obligations under erisa.additional funding requirements may be triggered by a plan unfunded current liability.that was the case here because the pbgc had determined that harvard had unfunded current liabilities in the tax years and.it is certainly true that harvard settlement with the pbgc on that issue was motivated by its desire to issue senior notes to fund its plan of reorganization without objection from the pbgc,but that does not change the ultimate fact that the plans had unfunded liabilities in and.thus,to maintain its qualified status harvard was required by law to make those payments.
that,of course,leads to the irs other argument that the need for additional contributions to the pension plans arose out of a choice made by harvard to maintain qualified pension plans for its employees.in a recent decision on this issue the federal circuit court of appeals stated that the nature and amount of the liability must be traceable to a specific law and can not be the result of choices made by the taxpayer or others.major paint united states.while that decision is interesting,it does not instruct a court on where it must draw the line regarding what constitutes a choice made by a taxpayer.at some level everything involves a choice.it is frequently recognized that liability for workers compensation claims may qualify for specified liability loss status,host marriott united states,d,aff cir,yet that liability only arises because an employer makes the decision to hire workers who are covered by that law.a similarly slippery slope is apparent here.while it is certainly true that offering an erisa qualified pension plan to its employees was a voluntary business decision by harvard,the court finds that the more prudent interpretation would be to find that once a decision like that is made then harvard was bound by all of erisa regulations.thus,complying with erisa funding requirements was not a voluntary decision on the part of harvard,it was required by federal law.
the next issue is whether the liability arose within three years prior to the beginning of the taxable year at issue.the irs takes the position that the final act fixing harvard liability occurred on july,the date harvard entered into its agreement with the pbgc.the court finds that argument to be misplaced.the agreement with the pbgc did nothing to create harvard liability,it was merely the settlement of how that liability would be paid.the liability itself was created in tax years and due to harvard reliance on inaccurate actuarial assumptions.therefore,the court finds that the liability arose more than three years prior to the relevant tax year.accordingly,the court will grant summary judgment in favor of harvard on the issue of its pension plan payments qualifying as specified liability losses.
as is evident from the portion of the bankruptcy court opinion set forth above,that court analysis was guided by the decision in major paint united states.there,the court held that in order for a liability to arise under a federal law,the nature and the amount of the liability must be traceable to a specific law and can not be the result of choices made by the taxpayer and others,at.major paint is the latest of only four cases that have addressed the meaning of arising under in.
in sealy corporation commissioner,a taxpayer argued that professional fees the company paid to have filings required by the sec and erisa prepared,as well as costs incurred during an irs audit,arose under federal law and should therefore qualify for the,cir.the court of appeals rejected this argument,holding that t he act giving rise to each of the liabilities in question was the contractual act by which sealy engaged lawyers or accountants and that these acts did not occur at least three years before the tax year in question.id.at.
in host marriott corp united states,the court of appeals for the fourth circuit adopted the reasoning of the district court in holding that interest on a federal income tax deficiency was a specified liability loss,cir.the district court had noted that t he liability for federal income tax deficiency interest arises out of a under a rate established by.host marriott corporation united states,d.the district court also distinguished sealy,by noting that the taxpayer liability for tax deficiency interest is set by federal law,not by taxpayer choice.id.at.
finally,in intermet corporation commissioner,the tax court held that state tax deficiencies and interest on federal and state tax deficiencies are specified liability losses because federal law expressly imposes those liabilities,wl.
as the bankruptcy court mentioned,in major paint,the court of appeals for the federal circuit had to decide whether fees paid to various professionals employed to assist the taxpayer during bankruptcy proceedings arose under federal law.the taxpayer argued that the costs arose under the bankruptcy code and emphasized that a bankruptcy judge,rath
