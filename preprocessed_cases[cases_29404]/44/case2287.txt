this is an admiralty action arising out of a collision in which the wake of the tennessee valley authority tva tugboat patricia h capsized a small fishing boat.plaintiff ronald matheny,a passenger in the fishing boat,died as a result.after a bench trial,the district court concluded that matheny death was caused by the negligent operation of the tugboat and that the tva was not entitled to limitation of liability under the limitation of liability act,west,because the captain actions were within the privity or knowledge of tva.the tva appeals.we reverse in part and remand for further proceedings.
background 
the facts,issues,and relevant law are all adequately presented in the district court page opinion and supplemental opinion following a bench trial and are very briefly summarized here.see matheny tva,d,modified in part by matheny tva.
tva operates the cumberland fossil plant cfp,a electric power generating plant,on the south bank of the cumberland river at river mile in stewart county,tennessee.see tva act of,supp.v.in the,tva excavated a second channel and created an island approximately feet long between the two channels.tva has a coal barge unloader and barge mooring cells along the south side of the old channel.since the early,various towing companies have delivered tows of barges loaded with coal to barge mooring areas in the old channel,and tva has used tva tugboats to move the barges to the unloader and then back to the mooring areas for pickup by the towing companies.
the patricia h is one of the tva tugboats used to move barges at cfp.at the time of the accident,it was worth.
the tva is aware that the old channel is used for recreational fishing by various types and sizes of boats.at approximately on june,thomas lawrence went fishing with his cousin,matheny,in lawrence fourteen foot phantom fiberglass boat in the old channel of the cumberland river near cfp.lawrence had fished there numerous times before.
at,captain ralls and his crew started their shift on the patricia shortly after,captain ralls piloted the patricia h from the unloader downstream to pick up a loaded coal barge.as the patricia h traveled from the unloader downstream lightboat without a barge,it passed the phantom boat without incident.as the patricia h traveled back upstream to the unloader with a loaded barge,it passed the phantom boat again without incident.however,at approximately,when the patricia h came back downstream again to obtain another loaded barge,its wake swamped the phantom boat.both men were thrown overboard.the crew of the patricia h were able to save lawrence,but matheny drowned.
captain ralls immediate supervisor was david duke,the coal haul foreman at cfp.duke was responsible for ensuring that cfp employees obeyed safety rules.d at.duke testified that tva has no yearly training program specifically for tugboat operators,that tva does not train the pilots in the rules of the road except through informal on river training,and that there was no specific policy regarding the speed of tugboats,but that there was an expectation that the tugboats would be operated as slowly as possible around fishing boats.id.duke also testified that he was not aware of any prior incidents concerning captain ralls.id.at.
matheny was years old when he died.matheny suffered from coronary artery atherosclerosis and had a heart attack on september.d at.he had a life expectancy of eight years.at.he was not employed at the time of his death,but acted as primary caretaker for his granddaughter.he was drawing a disability pension from the tennessee department of corrections and had applied for disability benefits from the social security administration.
and matheny had been married since and lived for many years in middle tennessee.the couple had three adult years old at the time of trial,christina years old at the time of trial,and stephanie years old at the time of trial.one of christina children,chloe,lived with and matheny,and they provided for her care.the district court found that matheny had a very close relationship with his children and his wife.d at.
b.the district court ruling 
the district court found that captain ralls was an experienced tugboat captain and that he proved himself,up to the time of the accident,to be a perfectly competent captain.id.at.however,the district court also found,and tva concedes,that captain ralls violated rules b and of the inland rules of navigation by operating the patricia h at an excessive speed when it passed the fishing boat,id.at,and that captain ralls creation of an excessive wake was responsible for the capsize of the fishing boat and the death of matheny.id.at.
the district court held that the limitation act did not apply to limit tva liability to the value of the patricia h because tva had privity or knowledge of the risks posed by captain ralls negligent operation of the patricia h at an excessive speed.id.at.as a separate basis for liability without limitation,the district court found that tva negligently supervised captain ralls,by failing to specifically instruct him to maintain a low speed or a low wake in the presence of small fishing vessels.id.at.on the other hand,the district court found that tva did not commit negligent entrustment although the court finds that captain ralls was negligent in this specific instance,it finds no basis to question his overall competency as a tugboat captain.accordingly,tva did not commit negligent entrustment.id.at.
the district court awarded becky matheny,as surviving spouse of matheny,a total of,which represented for lost future earnings and household services,and million for consortium losses of matheny and matheny three adult children.see at.the figure represented the present value of matheny disability pension assuming a life expectancy of eight years,or,and the present value of his household services for eight years,or.id.the million represented a year times eight years for each of his four family members.id.
thomas lawrence and his wife were awarded a total of based on lawrence injuries.see d at.

factual findings from a bench trial are reviewed for clear error.in re cleveland tankers,cir.a.questions of law are reviewed de novo.pearce united states,cir.
limitation of liability 
the limitation of liability act states in relevant part as follows t he liability of the owner of a vessel for any claim or liability described in subsection b shall not exceed the value of the vessel and pending freight.a west subsection b states in relevant part that claims and liabilities subject to limitation under subsection a are those arising from any loss,damage,or injury by collision,or any act done,occasioned,or incurred,without the privity or knowledge of the owner.id.b see kellogg sons hicks the linseed king.the act alters the normal rules of vicarious liability by limiting the ship owner liability for any injuries caused by the negligence of the captain or crew to the value of the ship unless the owner himself had privity or knowledge of the negligent acts.in re city of new york,cir internal citations omitted.
limitation of liability involves two inquiries negligence or unseaworthiness,and knowledge or privity of the vessel owner.see in re muer,cir cleveland tankers,at.the burden of proving negligence is on the claimant the burden of proving lack of privity or knowledge of the negligence is on the owner.muer,at cleveland tankers,at.
tva concedes on appeal that it is liable for captain ralls negligence,but claims that it is entitled to limitation of liability because it had no privity or knowledge of ralls negligent act.thus,the only issue is whether tva had privity or knowledge of ralls negligent act.in answering this question,we are mindful that t he shipowner privity or knowledge is not measured against every fact or act regarding the accident rather,privity or knowledge is measured against the specific negligent acts or unseaworthy conditions that actually caused or contributed to the accident.suzuki of orange park,shubert,cir.further,when the owner of a vessel is a corporation or government entity,the owner is charged with privity or knowledge of an officer,manager,or superintendent who has authority over the scope of activities out of which the liability occurred.coryell phipps.in re city of new york,at in re kristie leigh,cir.
the district court held that the limitation act did not apply because tva had knowledge of the risks posed by captain ralls negligent operation of the patricia h at an excessive speed.d at emphasis added see also id.at framing the the relevant inquiry as whether the defendant had privity or knowledge of the risks posed by tugboats being operated too fast,creating potentially dangerous wakes for nearby fishing boats.thus,according to the district court,because tva was aware of the fact that if a tugboat operates at an excessive speed it may create a dangerous wake for nearby recreational boats,and tva did not tell captain ralls that,tva is fully liable.
the district court misreads the limitation of liability act,which speaks in terms of acts,not risks.as tva points out,it is indisputable that all vessel owners know that if a competent captain commits a negligent act,there is a risk of harm.instead,the limitation of liability act focuses on the specific negligent acts or unseaworthy conditions that actually caused or contributed to the accident,suzuki,at,and limits liability unless the owner has privity or knowledge of the specific act.
there is no evidence in this record to justify imputing knowledge to tva about the specific conditions that led to the accident.tva barges and fishing boats have peacefully coexisted for years in the area in which the drowning occurred.lawrence and his friend james stanley testified that the harbor is considered a safe place in which to fish,that they have fished there on hundreds of occasions without incident,and that they have continued to fish in the same area were the accident occurred even after matheny death.although stanley mentioned that on two occasions he saw wakes cause spillovers into fishing boats,two isolated incidents involving wakes causing spillovers into fishing boats do not impart knowledge to tva about a dangerous condition.thus,tva was justified in assuming that the area was safe for both barges and fishing boats.
furthermore,it is that under the limitation of liability act,an owner may rely on the navigational expertise of a competent ship master.kristie leigh,at.here,the district court found that captain ralls had proved himself,up to the time of the accident,to be a perfectly competent captain.d at.the district court also found captain ralls had been tested on the rules of the road aspect of the inland rules of navigation by the coast guard,had been trained in collision avoidance and considered the wake of his boat hitting another boat a collision.id.at captain ralls had no prior citations.id.the court went so far as to add that at the time of the accident,captain ralls appears to have been the most qualified tugboat captain that tva employed.id.at.a competent captain conversant in the inland rules of navigation did not need to be told that an excessive wake would be dangerous to small fishing boats.tva was entitled to rely on a competent captain navigational knowledge and can not be deemed negligent because it failed to inform captain ralls or any of its other captains not to be negligent by creating excessive wakes near recreational boats.
a sixth circuit case,the longfellow,cir,is dispositive.the longfellow was a passenger boat on the ohio river.while departing the port of cincinnati,the pilot allowed the longfellow to become positioned in the river such that she was headed for the center pier of a railroad bridge,despite the assistance of a tugboat,the hercules carroll.id.at.the pilot and captain were unable to avoid a collision,and the longfellow struck the center pier of the railroad bridge.the boat immediately sank,and several lives and most of the cargo were lost.id.the district court found liability in the amount of,but held that longfellow corporate owners were not liable beyond the value of the wrecked vessel,appraised at.id.this court affirmed the district court finding that the collision was due to faults of navigation which were without the knowledge or privity of the owners,who were therefore exonerated from liability beyond the value of the wreck and freight.id.at.
the court explained 
the faults which the trial judge found were clearly faults in the navigation of the longfellow,and can not be imputed to her owners,as having occurred through their privity or knowledge.if we assume that there was no positive prearrangement between the officers of the longfellow and the hercules carrol as would secure the best cooperative results,it was the fault of those navigating those boats,and not of the owners of the longfellow the navigation of the longfellow was under the sole control and direction of her pilot,who was a licensed pilot of unquestionable reputation and skill.it was for him to direct how the hercules carrol should assist,and the latter was subject to his orders and direction so far as the actual navigation of the longfellow was affected the navigation of the towboat when lashed alongside of the longfellow was necessarily to be governed by the navigation of the latter,and it was for the pilot to give such special orders as his judgment and the circumstances dictated.neither was it the personal fault of the owners that the navigators of the longfellow did not stop and back up when smoke first obscured her pilot view.if there was fault,it was a fault of those controlling her navigation,and was without the knowledge or privity of the owners.
id.similarly,in this case,captain ralls was a skilled pilot,who should have exercised his judgment to slow down while passing the fishing boat in the channel.the accident was caused by captain ralls navigational decisions.
other cases support the conclusion that ralls errors were mistakes of navigation,which do not justify denying limitation of liability.for example,in in re omega protein,cir,a fishing vessel struck an oil platform at night.the captain,acting as a helmsman,had turned the wheelhouse lights on to examine a broken refrigerator part,and the mirror effect of the wheelhouse lights prevented him from seeing out the windows or using the radar.id.at.the fifth circuit affirmed the lower court ruling that the captain errors were mistakes of navigation by a competent captain not within the privity or knowledge of the vessel owner for limitation purposes.id.at.the court pointed out that there was no pattern of improper or unsafe behavior by the captain,a veteran with a spotless record.id.at.the fifth circuit rejected the argument that the owner did not provide sufficient training and supervision of the captain as to when he should use the radar alarm system because mistakes in navigation caused the accident.id.significantly,the fifth circuit concluded that while the plaintiff had demonstrated that the corporate owner did not do everything it could have done to ensure that the pilot knew the full capabilities of the boat radar,or have a protocol in place,the privity or knowledge standard does not require a vessel owner to take every possible precaution it only obliges the owner to select a competent master and remedy deficiencies which he can discover through reasonable diligence.id.at.
also illustrative is united states sandra dennis fishing,cir.there,five lives on the fishing vessel b g were lost when a coast guard patrol boat the towed the b g onto a shoal in bad weather.id.at.the district court had denied limitation because it found both negligent navigation by the commanding officer,lieutenant junior grade mcmanus,and deficiencies in the equipment,which were known to commander waters,the officer in charge of the coast guard rescue coordination center that dispatched the,and a managing officer of the government for limitation of liability purposes.id.at.the first circuit reversed the limitation holding,finding that the equipment deficiencies were not the cause of the loss,id.at,but that the loss was caused by the impropriety of the conduct of mcmanus,as captain,in navigating the vessel.id.at.the court further concluded that i t is against this very liability that
