opinion of the court 
this appeal by richard kautz from the district court order granting corporation motion for summary judgment in an age discrimination case requires us to decide whether kautz met his burden of proving that his employer reasons for laying him off,in a reduction in force situation,were pretextual.
kautz presents no direct evidence of age discrimination.his claim must,therefore,be analyzed under the burden shifting framework provided by mcdonnell douglas green,d.in stanziale jargowsky,cir,we explained this burden shifting framework in the context of an age discrimination in employment act adea,claim 
a plaintiff must first produce evidence sufficient to convince a reasonable factfinder as to all of the elements of a prima facie case of discrimination.if a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case,t he burden of production but not the burden of persuasion shifts to the defendant,who must then offer evidence that is sufficient,if believed,to support a finding that the defendant had a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment decision.an employer need not prove,however,that the proffered reasons actually motivated the employment decision.if a defendant satisfies this burden,a plaintiff may then survive summary judgment by submitting evidence from which a factfinder could reasonably either disbelieve the employer articulated legitimate reasons or believe that an invidious discriminatory reason was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the employer action.
id.at citations omitted.
the district court held that kautz established a prima facie case of discrimination under the adea and the pennsylvania human relations act phra.the court determined that met its burden of going forward with the evidence by establishing legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for his termination and that kautz failed to establish that reasons were pretextual.we will affirm.
this dispute arose when laid kautz off from his position as a regional sales manager rsm during a reduction in force which cut back the number of rsms from six to five.kautz was laid off by on february,after he had worked for the company as an rsm since.he had just turned.
manufactures and sells industrial pumps.in october,consolidated two of its divisions fybroc and dean pump.kautz had previously been one of four rsms for dean pump.with the consolidation,he became one of the six rsms in charge of fybroc and dean pump and his account responsibilities were revised,as were those of the other rsms.he was assigned to the southwest region.attrition,rather than layoffs,provided the vehicle for this consolidation.
in august,kautz was told that he would have to transfer from houston,texas to telford,pennsylvania to work in an office in fybroc plant located there.at this time,the five other rsms all worked from factory locations and kautz was the only rsm who worked from his home.agreed to pay kautz relocation expenses.kautz gave his assent to the transfer but did not actually begin work from the new location until january.in february,decided to reduce the number of rsms from six to five because further consolidation of the sales force was necessary.
asserts that it decided to lay off kautz after two statistical comparisons of the rsms and then,after narrowing the field of possible candidates to two,a comparison of the candidates personnel files.kautz asserts that these reasons were pretextual.we examine each of proffered reasons in detail below and,therefore,will not recount them here.
when laid off,kautz signed an agreement for a severance package which allowed him to receive weeks of severance pay.the agreement provided that had no obligation to him.subsequent to kautz being laid off,two other rsms ages and were fired for cause and replaced by david hakim,age,and christopher cousart,age.kautz was not notified about these job openings or considered for either position.when these openings became available he was,and still is,working for kirkwood company,one of distributors.his salary at this new position is significantly less than the salary he earned at.continues to employ only five rsms.
subject matter jurisdiction over kautz claims under the adea arises pursuant to.we exercise pendent jurisdiction over kautz claims arising under the phra pursuant to we have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to.
the standard of review applicable to the district court order granting summary judgment is plenary.carrasca pomeroy,cir.we must apply the same test employed by the district court under federal rule of civil procedure c.id.accordingly,the district court grant of summary judgment was proper only if it appears that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.rule c,federal rules of civil procedure.kautz,as the party,is entitled to every favorable inference that can be drawn from the record.carrasca,at.
the district court conclusion that kautz has made out a prima facie case,kautz,no.civ,wl,at,may,is not disputed by on appeal.the sole issue of contention in this appeal,therefore,is whether kautz has succeeded in creating an issue of fact as to whether proffered reasons for eliminating kautz position are a pretext.
in reeves sanderson plumbing products,d,the court held that proof of pretext does not have to include evidence of discrimination,but rather i n appropriate circumstances,the trier of fact can reasonably infer from the falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose.at.
although reeves makes clear that we may not require affirmative evidence of discrimination in addition to proof of pretext,it does not change our standard for proving pretext which places a difficult burden on the plaintiff.fuentes perskie,cir.in order to avoid summary judgment,fuentes requires a plaintiff to put forward such weaknesses,implausibilities,inconsistencies,incoherencies,or contradictions in the employer proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence.id.internal quotation and citation omitted emphasis in the original.
fuentes further explains that to avoid summary judgment,the plaintiff evidence rebutting the employer proffered legitimate reasons must allow a factfinder reasonably to infer that each of the employer proffered reasons was either a post hoc fabrication or otherwise did not actually motivate the employment action.id.at emphasis in the original see also logue int l rehab,cir holding that the district court erred in failing to consider all of the employer proffered evidence of legitimate business reasons for the plaintiff termination.in a footnote,fuentes allowed for the possibility that in a case where a defendant proffers a bagful of legitimate reasons,casting substantial doubt on a fair number of them may impede the employer credibility seriously enough so that a factfinder may rationally disbelieve the remaining proffered reasons.id.at see also sheridan dupont de nemours,cir en banc determining that where a plaintiff completely undermined the employer main complaint by proving that she was on jury duty on several days when she was alleged to have given out free drinks called into question the credibility of central employer witnesses and presented affirmative evidence of retaliatory bias against her,there had been a showing of pretext and there was,in that situation of overwhelming evidence,no need to discuss whether pretext had been shown for each allegation that the employee was tardy or in violation of the grooming policy.
fuentes instructs that pretext is not shown by evidence that the employer decision was wrong or mistaken,since the factual dispute at issue is whether discriminatory animus motivated the employer,not whether the employer is wise,shrewd,prudent,or competent.id.at.
we have applied the principles explained in fuentes to require plaintiffs to present evidence contradicting the core facts put forward by the employer as the legitimate reason for its decision.see stanziale,at upholding summary judgment where the plaintiff attempted to show pretext by disputing the importance of the difference in educational qualifications between himself and the person hired rather than challenging the disparity itself or proving that the qualifications at issue bore no actual relationship to the employment being sought keller orix credit alliance,cir en banc determining that summary judgment was appropriate notwithstanding the plaintiff contention that his failure to meet or approach his goal of raising billion in financing was due to factors beyond his control,stating that the relevant question is not whether keller could have done better instead,the relevant question is whether the evidence shows that it was so clear that keller could not have done better that orix credit alliance could not have believed otherwise.
an employer may not use evaluating criteria which lacks any relationship at all to the performance of the employee being evaluated because to do so would be inconsistent with and contradictory to the employer stated purpose.see fuentes,at.absent this type of violation of the fuentes standard,we will not second guess the method an employer uses to evaluate its employees.see simpson kay jewelers,div.of sterling,cir whether sales quotas or evaluation scores are a more appropriate measure of a manager performance is not for the court or factfinder to decide.keller,at the question is not whether the employer made the best or even a sound business decision it is whether the real reason is discrimination.healy new york life ins,cir o ur inquiry must concern pretext,and is not an independent assessment of how we might evaluate and treat a loyal employee.logue,at o ur task is not to assess the overall fairness of the employer actions.
determining pretext is a inquiry.see simpson,at.we must,therefore,look carefully at each of proffered reasons as well as kautz claim of pretext regarding each of these reasons.see ezold wolf,block,schorr and,cir concluding that a district court is obligated to focus on the employer articulated reasons and citing logue in support of this conclusion.
offered two groups of reasons for its decision to eliminate kautz rsm position after it had decided to downsize from six to five sales regions.first,analyzed two different sales statistics and on the basis of that analysis determined that kautz and one other rsm were the lowest performers.
second,upon reviewing the files of kautz and the other rsm selected for further review,determined that there was a record of several specific instances of inadequate performance by kautz a june,memo from edward murphy,kautz immediate supervisor,related to poor performance on a specific project a december,memo from murphy faulting kautz for the loss of a job due to his serious failure in judgment a february,memo by james board,vice president and general manager of the fybroc and dean pump divisions,that memorialized a complaint by gary cauble,president of one of distributors,that,after receiving adequate advanced notice of a job,kautz had failed to inform the distributor of desire to bid on it until the morning the bid was due,which was too late a january,memo from board asserting that,at a review meeting,kautz offered that dean pump had lost a quote and january,memos from both board and murphy criticizing kautz for his inability to present any details about what was going on in his territory during a weekly production meeting.there was no record of comparable derelictions from the other rsm whose record was considered 
we first address the two sets of statistics offered by the employer as evidence of substantial reasons for selecting kautz as the rsm to be let go.
the first statistic relied on in decision presents the greatest problem.the statistic measured number of sales by region and the southwest region,kautz territory,was the lowest.kautz does not dispute that this statistic was used or the accuracy of the numbers.he does argue that the statistic was not actually relevant to a comparison of individual rsm performance.importantly,he supports this argument with the statement of dehont who,in deposition testimony,admitted that the rsms did have control over these numbers.dehont did not admit that these numbers were irrelevant but he did concede that the other statistical method used was the more relevant one.
in board deposition testimony,he admitted that this statistic showed territory snapshots not snapshots of individual performance.he went on,however,to explain that even though territories had been swapped and things had been shifted around,he,knowing where everybody was and where they had been,was able to evaluate individual performance based on this statistic.even in view of board attempt to explain the relevance of this statistic,we determine that kautz has put forward evidence which creates a dispute of fact on this issue.dehont testimony that the rsms did have control over these numbers would give a jury a reasonable basis for concluding that the statistical method used was not at all relevant to purported purpose individual evaluation of rsm performance.
here,the fuentes standard has been satisfied by kautz because it is implausible,inconsistent,incoherent and contradictory for an employer to use a method of evaluation that has nothing to do with individual performance in order to measure individual performance.at.
the second statistical method requires a closer analysis.this statistical method compares two years of what are described as booking numbers,raw sales numbers computed at the time of sale that are not adjusted to later variances or profit margins,and then set forth the percentages between the two years.the figures compare booking numbers in fiscal with fiscal for each rsm 
bookings for fiscal year were measured as a percentage of the rsm bookings for,the previous fiscal year.of the six rsms,kautz had a percentage of,the second lowest.this means that in the fiscal year of he booked only of what he had booked in the previous fiscal year.john chenault was the lowest,with.here again,kautz does not dispute that this statistic was used nor does he dispute the accuracy of the numbers,but asserts that the methodology itself was pretextual.
kautz makes much of the circumstance that the number was handwritten on the bottom of the page.he also asserts that this ratio does not appear on any of computer runs and that a comparison of two years of production by percentage had never been used before to evaluate rsm performance.
with each of these assertions kautz fails to create a question of fact on the issue of pretext.the handwritten notation at the bottom of each rsm bookings chart simply tabulates the booking numbers from a portion of the october through recalculates the ratio already set forth in the computer printout.kautz actually fares better when the full fiscal year is taken into account.he goes from in the computer generated partial year comparison to in the full year comparison.at the same time,the percentages of some of the other rsms are reduced by the added handwritten notation.
kautz does not explain what he means by his contention that this percentage does not appear on any of computer runs.if his assertion is that this number only appears as a handwritten notation,it is demonstrably false.the computer printout for each rsm,marked exhibit,calculates versus prior year for both shipments and bookings.in any event,kautz provides no citation to the record for his claim that this statistic is something not normally calculated.
similarly,kautz provides no supporting evidence for his claim that this statistical method had never been used before to evaluate the performance of rsms.even if there was some evidentiary support for the allegation,a naked assertion that a method of evaluation is new would not,by itself,support a finding that it is implausible,inconsistent,incoherent or contradictory.see fuentes,at.
kautz relies heavily on the contention that should have looked at total bookings rather than the comparison between the two fiscal years.he asserts,correctly,that he was the second highest in total bookings for the and fiscal years.this argument fails because it is axiomatic that the mere fact that a different,perhaps better,method of evaluation could have been used is not evidence of pretext unless the method that was used is so deficient as to transgress the fuentes standard.see simpson,at keller,at healy,at logue,at.
moreover,kautz has not shown focus on comparative rather than total booking numbers to be implausible,inconsistent,incoherent or contradictory.see fuentes,at.kautz superiors at gave reasonable reasons why they felt that total booking numbers were not the best basis for comparison.kautz has not rebutted the logic of these explanations and has not even offered a sound basis for his own conclusion that total booking numbers are a better method of evaluation.he failed to rebut the basic premise that total bookings is a faulty indicia of performance,because the employer marketing regions are not fungible in the sense that each region has the same sales potential.specific unrebutted evidence was presented by that the marketing potential varied from region to region.
even if kautz had succeeded in showing that total bookings would provide a better basis for comparing the rsms,that would not be enough.evidence that the method of evaluation an employer used was not the best method does not amount to evidence that the method was so implausible,inconsistent,incoherent or contradictory that it must be a pretext for something else.see simpson,at keller,at fuentes,at healy,at logue,at.
we now turn to the contention that the percentage methodology was skewed deliberately and intentionally to discriminate against kautz because of his age.the argument seems to be that people who have been on the job for a long time will be more likely to have reached their full sales potential and have fairly stable sales numbers.these veterans will be more affected by a down turn in the market,like the one that apparently happened in the industrial pump industry post,than newer rsms who are more likely to improve from year to year,and therefore compensate for the market downturn with improved performance.
this argument is riddled with assumptions and lacking evidentiary support in the record.the argument assumes that more experienced rsms will have higher total bookings and that older rsms are the most experienced.next,the argument assumes that it takes a long period of time for an rsm to reach his or her sales potential,as measured by total bookings,and that continued improvement is not a viable or expected goal.
by its very nature a sound legal argument must contain a conclusion supported by evidentiary premises.it is a formal inference in which the conclusion is arrived at and affirmed on the basis of one or more propositions,which are accepted as the starting point of the process.its key is the reasonable probability that the conclusion flows from evidentiary datum because of past experience in human affairs.the passage can not be made by mere speculation,intuition or guessing.
the record shows that kautz had been an rsm since we are not told how long the other rsm held their positions,and it is quite possible that some have been working for as long or longer.
kautz relies on the the testimony of david gutt,one of the rsms fired for cause after kautz had been laid off.gutt identified himself as inexperienced,and said that gene silvers,another rsm,did not have the same experience as kautz.he identified kautz,john chenault and lloyd hill as veteran sales guys.
this information does not support the argument that using a bookings comparison rather than total bookings is deliberately skewed to prejudice older workers.gene silvers,an inexperienced rsm and,had the fourth best bookings comparison percentage.ronald aceto,whose length of experience is not revealed on our reading of the record and was,had the second best bookings comparison percentage.this example casts doubt on the premise that longevity as an rsm inevitably produces a higher and more static production level.
the explanation offered by both board and dehont for the use of the comparison percentages rather than some other measurement is important.these corporate officers explained that bookings expectations depend on the market conditions and other factors in the area.one rsm might have higher raw booking numbers than another but not be performing as well because of the greater potential of his territory.board explained that booking million in a territory that would typically generate million would be poor performance compared to booking million in a territory that would typically generate million.dehont made a very similar statement in his testimony using different numbers.
board specifically stated you have to compare booking numbers to historical data coming out of that same region to judge whether the performance is better or worse than you would expect based on historical data and based on current economical sic conditions.moreover,board testified that bookings numbers from the previous year are a key factor in setting the budget for a particular region.
kautz contention that the test for productivity of rsms is simply to tabulate total bookings by region is demonstrably faulty because market demand varies by region.instead,decided that,in a falling market that required a reduction in force,the better method was a comparison of bookings in to bookings in.this,reasoned,would eliminate market demand differences that existed region by region,and instead show a more neutral and more accurate picture of sales production of the six rsms.
kautz offered no evidence that this method discriminated against him because of his age.the idea that discriminated against veteran sales managers because older men reach a plateau in sales production is totally devoid of proof.the record contains no empirical data of the existence of this plateau,no evidence of reports or studies supporting this theory,no expert witnesses.it is a thesis totally devoid of data to substantiate it.
to avoid summary judgment,the teachings of fuentes require a plaintiff to put forward such weaknesses,implausibilities,inconsistencies,incoherencies,or contradictions in the employer proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence.at internal quotation and citation omitted emphasis in the original.kautz failed to meet this burden.
to the extent that kautz relies on the teachings of showalter university of pittsburgh medical center,cir,and potence hazleton area school district,cir,we conclude that the facts in those cases are fundamentally dissimilar to the facts before us and,therefore,do not serve as proper analogues.
in showalter,the employer determined that it would lay off the security guard with the least seniority in a downsizing situation.at.the plaintiff proffered evidence that the employer was presented with three different methods of determining in the job,department or hospital.id.at.plaintiff also offered substantial proof that before the employer decided which method to use,it knew which employee would be affected by each test.id.at a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the employer had the discretion to choose any of the three forms of seniority that he knew in advance the result that each choice would produce and that he selected department seniority because he knew it would result in the layoff of the oldest employee,showalter.the employer countered that as far as he knew,this form of seniority was always used in a rif.id.at.we reversed the district court grant of summary judgment because b ased on this evidence,a reasonable factfinder could find that the decision maker explanation was pretextual.id.
in the case at bar,there is no evidence that board and dehont,the corporate officers who made the decision to lay off kautz,considered different methods of statistical analysis for evaluating the rsms knowing in advance which rsms would benefit under each method.showalter depended for its holding on the employer advanced knowledge that the method selected would result in the termination of the oldest employee.id.in potence,a major issue was whether the employer requirement of refrigerant certification was a pretext.at.the plaintiff had proffered
