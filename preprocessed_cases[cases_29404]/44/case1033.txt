background 
factual background 
these two actions arise from five shipments of computer equipment pursuant to shipping contracts between toshiba and skyway.toshiba suffered losses as a result of these shipments having been lost or not delivered complete to toshiba consignees in new jersey and florida.nippon was toshiba insurer for cargo losses and,having compensated toshiba for these losses,brought these two actions as toshiba subrogee.
under the first set of shipments considered by the district court,skyway agreed to carry a shipment of laptop computers on monday,september,and a second shipment of laptops on tuesday,september.the shipments were to be picked up from toshiba in california and delivered to toshiba consignee in new jersey.both shipments were designated as being shipped by air on,or standard air terms,which provide for delivery on the third business day after pickup.the air waybills provided that the shipments would be governed by a standard tariff provision limiting skyway liability to the declared value of the shipment.skyway tariff defines declared value to be the higher of either cents per pound or,unless the shipper declares a higher results in an extra charge of cents for every above the default declared value.toshiba declined to declare a higher value for either shipment,but it declared the weight of the first shipment to be pounds and the second shipment to be pounds.
without consulting or notifying toshiba,skyway elected to subcontract these shipments to defendant aia.aia issued air waybills to skyway that incorporated a tariff to skyway expressly limiting liability to cents per pound unless a higher value is declared.skyway did not declare a higher value for the shipment.aia was to hold the shipments for pickup by skyway in philadelphia.as agreed upon by toshiba and skyway,the two shipments were picked up by skyway on monday,september,and tuesday,september.aia carried both shipments by air to philadelphia,where they arrived on thursday morning,september.nippon and aia contend that skyway was notified several times that these shipments had arrived in philadelphia but did not attempt to retrieve these shipments from aia airport warehouse until the afternoon of monday,september.skyway disputes this assertion,claiming that it first attempted to retrieve the shipments during the afternoon of friday,september,but that aia refused to remain open long enough for the skyway driver to do so.
on tuesday,september,skyway informed toshiba and the local police that part of the first shipment of the laptops and all of the second shipment were missing.nippon asserts that law enforcement officials believe that the computers were converted by aia employees,and that a criminal investigation of these employees was underway.the losses incurred by toshiba totaled approximately.
under the second set of shipping contracts between toshiba and skyway,skyway agreed to carry three shipments of laptop computers from irvine,california,to toshiba consignees in new jersey and florida.the bills of lading again provided that the shipments would be governed by a standard tariff provision limiting skyway liability to the declared value of the shipment.as in nippon i,skyway tariff defines declared value to be the higher of either cents per pound or,unless the shipper declares a higher value and pays an additional cents for every above the default declared value of.toshiba shipped the first shipment,consisting of cartons of data processing machines,on january,on ss,or standard two day service terms.toshiba did not declare a value for this shipment on the waybill,but declared a weight of pounds.skyway subcontracted this shipment to defendant usair.usair issued to skyway its own waybill,which incorporated a tariff provision limiting liability to cents per pound unless a higher value is declared.like toshiba,skyway did not declare a higher value on the usair waybill but declared that the shipment weighed pounds.while the shipment was to have left los angeles on january,it apparently did not leave los angeles until february,and was never delivered to skyway or toshiba new jersey consignee.
the second shipment,consisting of cartons of data processing machines,was shipped on february,on the same ss terms to the same new jersey consignee.toshiba again did not declare any value for the shipment,but declared a weight of pounds.skyway again subcontracted the shipment,this time using the general freight service of defendant united.the waybill issued by united also limited liability to cents per pound unless a higher value is declared,and skyway did not declare any value for the shipment.toshiba shipment was combined into a larger shipment totaling pounds.the waybill also indicated that all claims must be made within nine months and nine days of the date of acceptance.only of toshiba cartons were delivered on march,skyway did not present any claim to united for the lost cartons.
the third shipment of cartons of data processing machines was shipped by toshiba to a california consignee on july.the shipment was made on,or standard delivery terms.toshiba again did not declare any value,but declared a weight of pounds.this time,skyway shipped the cartons by truck,rather than air,and delivered only of the cartons on august.skyway did not receive any report of a shortage for the undelivered cartons until september.the losses incurred by toshiba for the three shipments totaled approximately.
for all five shipments,skyway compensated toshiba for its losses based on the declared weight of each shipment,pursuant to the limitations of liability in the skyway tariff,since toshiba had not declared a value for any of the five shipments.
ii.procedural history 
after reimbursing toshiba for these losses,nippon filed two actions seeking compensation from the defendants in connection with the two sets of shipments.the first action nippon i,filed june,against skyway and aia,alleged breach of contract and federal common law duties negligent damage to property breach of bailment and warehouseman obligations and conversion in connection with the two september shipments.while the complaint originally sought recovery from aia on all four theories,nippon subsequently dropped its contract claim against aia.skyway against aia seeking indemnification.in considering the parties motions and for summary judgment,the district court held that skyway was liable to nippon for loss of shipments,but that its liability was limited to on account of the contractual limitation of liability,and that aia,as a secondary common carrier,was not liable in tort to nippon at all.the court also upheld the contractual limitation of liability in the waybill issued by aia to skyway,and accordingly limited aia obligation to pay damages to skyway to.see nippon fire marine ins.skyway freight,d nippon i.following the district court decision,skyway and aia stipulated to withdrawal of skyway against aia with prejudice,subject to reinstatement if the district court decision were subsequently vacated,modified,or reversed so as to hold skyway liable to nippon for more than.the district court approved and endorsed that stipulation on july,and entered final judgment in nippon i on july.
the second action nippon ii,filed september,against skyway,united,and usair in connection with the january,february,and july shipments,alleged breach of contract against skyway and negligence,breach of bailment obligations,breach of warehouseman obligations,and conversion against skyway,united,and usair.skyway for indemnification against usair and united,and united for indemnification against skyway and usair.in considering the parties motions and for summary judgment,the district court again held that skyway was liable to nippon for the losses,but that its liability for the three shipments was contractually limited to,and,respectively and that the secondary common carriers,united and usair,were not liable in tort to nippon at all.see nippon fire marine ins.skyway freight,d nippon ii.following the district court decision,skyway and usair stipulated to withdrawal of skyway against usair with prejudice,subject to reinstatement if the district court decision were subsequently vacated,modified,or reversed so as to hold skyway liable to nippon for more than.the district court approved and endorsed that stipulation on november,and entered final judgment in nippon ii on november.
these timely appeals followed.after the notices of appeal had been filed,skyway filed in bankruptcy for liquidation chapter and aia filed in bankruptcy for reorganization chapter.as a result,all claims and against skyway and aia were automatically stayed by operation of a.in light of the automatic bankruptcy stay,the parties stipulated to voluntary dismissal,with prejudice and without costs to any party,of nippon claims and united against skyway and united against usair in nippon ii.the parties also stipulated to voluntary dismissal,without prejudice to reinstatement and without costs to any party,of nippon claims against skyway and aia in nippon i.we approved and endorsed the stipulation in nippon ii on may,and the stipulation in nippon i on november,and thereby have dismissed these claims nippon claims against united and usair,however,remain before us.these remaining claims are not subject to the automatic stay and properly may go forward.see teachers ins.butler,cir it is well established that stays pursuant to a are limited to debtors and do not encompass.
discussion 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party.see bogan hodgkins,cir,cert.denied,d.summary judgment is appropriate w here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.very few of the material facts in this case are disputed rather,the parties disputes center primarily around conflicting interpretations of the law.
on appeal,nippon argues that the secondary carriers,united and usair,should be held directly liable in tort to nippon for its losses.united and usair counter that nippon may not assert any tort claims against them,but is limited to claims sounding in contract.if there is to be recovery on these contractual claims,the secondary carriers further assert,that recovery must be limited by the liability limitation provisions in their shipping contracts with skyway.nippon responds that while the secondary carriers might be able to assert those liability limitation clauses against skyway,they may not do so against nippon.we agree with the secondary carriers that nippon is limited to contractual relief,and since nippon does not assert any contract claims against the secondary carriers,we affirm the district court conclusion that united and usair are not liable to nippon at all.
applicable law 
prior to enactment of the airline deregulation act of ada,stat,it had been clearly established that actions against interstate air carriers for lost or damaged shipments were governed by federal common law.see generally burlington air express,cir sam majors jewelers abx,cir see also insurance of north america federal express,cir fletcher,concurring.this court has not explicitly stated whether federal common law continues to govern such actions following enactment of the ada.see victoria sales emery air freight,cir declining to address whether federal common law or state law governs action seeking damages for lost air shipment in situation in which warsaw convention does not apply ruston gas turbines,pan american world airways,cir stating that d eregulation of certain common carriers returns us to the common law,but not stating explicitly whether that common law is state or federal.other courts,however,have held that federal common law continues to govern actions against air carriers for lost or damaged interstate shipments.see,at sam majors jewelers,at manufacturers mutual ins.great western airlines,cir first pennsylvania bank,eastern airlines,cir fiberglas air,united states gold federal express.we agree with those courts and hold that federal common law continues to control the issue of liability of air carriers for lost or damaged shipments even after deregulation 
effect of the secondary carriers contractual limitations of liability 
under the federal common law rules governing common carriers,contractual provisions that purport to relieve carriers from liability for loss or damage to cargo altogether are invalid and unenforceable as against public policy.see adams express croninger.shippers freight claim council,icc,cir.however,under the released value doctrine,contractual provisions that merely limit carrier liability for lost or damaged as those incorporated into the air waybills in this are valid and enforceable so long as they are set forth in a reasonably communicative form,so as to result in a fair,open,just and reasonable agreement between carrier and shipper and offer the shipper a possibility of higher recovery by paying the carrier a higher rate.hill constr.american airlines,cir shippers freight claim council,at.
the released value doctrine,which dates back to the earliest cases at common law governing railroads,see,hart pennsylvania,subsequently has been extended by statute and common law to common carriers of every stripe,including air carriers both before and after deregulation.see,hill constr,at citing cases and statutes deiro american airlines,cir under federal common law,released value doctrine applies to air carriers.a valid limitation of liability clause governs not only the nature and extent of the carrier liability,but also the nature and extent of the shipper right of recovery.north american phillips emery air freight,cir.such clauses,therefore,limit recovery not only for breach of contract,but also based on other legal theories,including negligence,bailment,or conversion.see fiberglas.at valid limitation of liability clause also applies to claims sounding in tort neal republic airlines,holding that w here it is clear plaintiffs seek damages for breach of the carriage contract t hey must proceed,if at all,on a breach of contract theory,and the contractual limitation of liability applies if otherwise valid saul sorkin,goods in transit,at supp.contractual limitations of liability may not be avoided by framing the complaint in terms of bailment or tort.moreover,the fact that an air carrier temporarily may have stored the goods does not render the carrier a warehouseman,subject to common law warehouseman duties,so long as the storage was only temporary and incidental to the primary goal of interstate shipment.see fiberglas.at baloise ins.united airlines,carrier should not be treated as a warehouseman simply because it stores goods temporarily in a warehouse facility prior to transport.
the original shipping contracts between toshiba and skyway contained provisions limiting skyway liability to the greater of either cents per pound or.while toshiba had the option of declaring a higher value for its shipments and paying skywa
