susan septimus septimus filed claims for gender discrimination,retaliation,and hostile work environment against the university of houston and the university of houston system collectively,the university.septimus discrimination and hostile work environment claims and one of her retaliation claims were dismissed on summary judgment.because septimus failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding the pretext elements of her gender discrimination claim and one of her retaliation claims,summary judgment on these claims was proper.septimus hostile work environment claim was also properly dismissed,because she failed to set forth sufficient evidence that the alleged harassment was severe or pervasive.septimus remaining retaliation claims proceeded to trial.with regard to these claims,the court holds that they were subject to a but for causation standard rather than the motivating factor standard used in the trial court charge to the jury.the trial court grant of partial summary judgment is affirmed,the judgment on septimus two retaliation claims that went to trial is reversed due to the erroneous jury charge,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
facts and proceedings 
septimus was an assistant general counsel for the university who handled business and transactional matters.in december,after the resignation of associate general counsel bonnie weisman,the university posted an open associate general counsel agc position for litigation and employment matters.in early,agc joseph williams who held a business counsel position also resigned from the university,which left open two agc positions.brian nelson,an outside candidate,was interviewed for the litigation and employment agc position on january.
later that day,septimus told the university general counsel dennis duffy that she was interested in being promoted to the agc position responsible for business matters.duffy responded that he would not consider her for promotion because he wanted someone with management experience.duffy further told septimus that she had not stepped up to the plate in her current position to assume management responsibilities.nelson was ultimately hired by duffy as an agc.although the university contends that nelson was hired for the employment and litigation counsel position formerly held by weisman,the record reflects that nelson actually handled business and contractual matters.septimus admits she was not seeking the employment and litigation counsel position,but she claims that nelson was actually hired for the business counsel position vacated by williams.she thus contends that duffy decision to hire nelson instead of her for that position was rooted in gender discrimination.
on march,duffy spent two hours in septimus office haranguing her while they discussed work matters.nelson watched and septimus sobbed uncontrollably.nelson described this incident as intimidating and inappropriate.septimus filed an internal discrimination complaint with the university later that month.she also filed an eeoc charge of discrimination regarding the denied promotion.septimus further alleged in her eeoc charge that duffy created a hostile work environment.
because other female employees in the office of the general counsel ogc had also complained about duffy,the university engaged attorney deborah mcelvaney to investigate.in her report dated april,mcelvaney concluded there was sufficient evidence that duffy had discriminated against septimus in hiring nelson and that he created a hostile work environment.she also thought that the evidence did not support septimus claim that duffy retaliated against her for filing her internal complaint of discrimination and for her participation in the investigation.
after mcelvaney provided her report to university chancellor art smith,he formed a committee of three university administrators to review mcelvaney work.ultimately,the committee decided that none of septimus complaints had merit and denied her internal grievance on all of her discrimination,hostile work environment and retaliation.
on may,smith offered septimus the choice of remaining in the ogc supervised by duffy or transferring to the position of director of contracts administration dca,where she would work under a different management group.smith offer to move septimus to contracts administration was conditioned on the requirement that she discontinue practicing law on behalf of the university.smith policy was that employees who did not report to the ogc could not practice law.additionally,smith conditioned the transfer offer on septimus providing a release of her claims against the university.septimus initially refused the transfer,but eventually accepted it after smith dropped the requirement that she sign a release.
septimus began her new job as dca in july,reporting to john martin.in her new position,septimus was required to work with the ogc on any legal issues,relying upon the expertise and judgment of the lawyers in the ogc.she was not permitted to negotiate,modify or draft contracts.
in early march,ron miller,another employee who reported to martin,announced his retirement.miller title was director of procurement and campus services.prior to leaving,miller suggested to martin that septimus serve as his interim replacement.despite that recommendation,septimus was denied the interim position,because martin supervisor randy harris decided to combine miller former position with that of ann lamar.that change caused no additional salary expense since lamar was already earning the salary of an interim division director.lamar was appointed to the retitled position of interim executive director of procurement and auxiliary services.septimus views these events as a promotion she received,but that was later rescinded,and claims that the university retaliated against her by awarding the position to lamar instead.after lamar appointment to interim director,she became septimus supervisor and septimus no longer reported directly to martin.
although septimus was then reporting to lamar,martin criticized her in late for suggesting revisions to contracts without coordinating her advice with that of the ogc.septimus was upset at the criticism and resigned from the university in december.after septimus left,her responsibilities were given to nelson in addition to his duties as an agc.in this new role,nelson continued reporting to the ogc.
septimus sued the university in september,alleging gender discrimination related to the hiring of nelson instead of her for the agc position retaliation based upon her transfer to the dca position retaliation based upon being denied the interim director position hostile work environment and retaliation through constructive discharge.the district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the university on septimus claims for gender discrimination,hostile work environment,and the retaliation claim related to the interim director position awarded to lamar.on septimus claims of retaliatory transfer and constructive discharge,the district court found that genuine issues of material fact existed in the summary judgment record,and denied summary judgment.
the case proceeded to trial on the remaining retaliation claims related to her transfer to the dca position and her alleged constructive discharge.the jury found for septimus on these claims and awarded damages.the university now appeals the judgment entered for septimus,and septimus the district court grant of partial summary judgment.
ii.discussion 
challenged jury instructions 
the university appeals the jury verdict on these claims,arguing that the district court incorrectly instructed the jury regarding the applicable standard of proof for septimus retaliation claims.
standard of review 
the university did not object to the jury instructions in the district court,and its position was not made clear to the court in some other manner.accordingly,this court consideration of the issue is limited to plain error review for an appellant to prevail under the plain error standard,it must show that an error occurred that the error was plain,which means clear or obvious the plain error must affect substantial rights and not correcting the error would seriously impact the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings the plain error exception is designed to prevent a miscarriage of justice where the error is clear under current law 
in determining whether a particular jury instruction was erroneous,we consider the jury charge as a whole an inadequate instruction merits reversal when the charge as a whole leaves us with the substantial and ineradicable doubt whether the jury has been properly guided in its deliberations.
legal standard for title vii retaliation claims 
the parties agree that this case was litigated and tried as a pretext rather than retaliation case under the pretext framework,after the employee demonstrates a prima facie case of retaliation and the employer carries its burden by stating a legitimate reason for the employment action,the burden falls to the employee to establish that the employer permissible reason is actually a pretext for retaliation 
here,the parties disagree as to the proper standard of proof for the final portion of the above framework.the university seeks plain error review of the district court use of the phrase motivating factor instead of the causation standard in submitting septimus retaliation claims to the jury.conversely,septimus contends that the motivating factor language employed by the district court was legally proper,and therefore the jury verdict on these claims should not be disturbed.
septimus relies primarily on fabela socorro indep.school dist to support her argument that the district court motivating factor language was appropriate for a retaliation claim.in that case the discharged employee presented direct evidence of retaliation and proceeded upon a theory as was then provided for under the framework set out in price waterhouse hopkins this court noted in fabela that it is unusual to have direct evidence of retaliatory intent,and that in cases based on circumstantial evidence it has long recognized the path by which a plaintiff may demonstrate retaliatory intent through the use of circumstantial evidence and the famed mcdonnell douglas framework.because this is a circumstantial evidence pretext case,the standard of proof applied in fabela and other cases is not controlling here.
the mcdonnell douglas evidentiary framework applies to title vii retaliation claims brought under a pretext theory under that framework,the employee ultimate burden is to prove that the employer stated reason for the adverse action was merely a pretext for the real,retaliatory purpose the proper standard of proof on the causation element of a title vii retaliation claim is that the adverse employment action taken against the plaintiff would not have occurred but for her protected conduct this court has consistently held that in retaliation cases where the defendant has proffered a nondiscriminatory purpose for the adverse employment action the plaintiff has the burden of proving that but for the discriminatory purpose he would not have been terminated.moreover,we have recently stated that the motivating factor test is less stringent,implying that standard would require a lesser burden of proof we hold that the district court erred when it used the term motivating factor to instruct the jury in this case.
because the university did not timely raise this issue at trial,the court must determine whether this error requires reversal under the plain error standard.this court has consistently required a but for standard for proving causation on a title vii retaliation claim brought under the pretext framework thus,the disputed jury instruction amounts to plain error that should have been clear or obvious.even when the jury instructions are viewed in their entirety,the substitution of the phrase motivating factor for but for causation causes us to doubt substantially whether the jury was properly guided in its deliberations.septimus was held to a lower standard in proving the causation element of her retaliation ultimate question in this therefore substantial rights of the university were prejudiced.because the jury was improperly instructed,the outcome of this case may have been affected.therefore,failing to correct this fundamental error could impact the fairness of the judicial process in this case and could result in a miscarriage of justice.
claims dismissed on summary judgment 
septimus the district court entry of summary judgment on her gender discrimination claim,one of her retaliation claims,and her hostile work environment claim.
standard of review 
a district court grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo,applying the same standard as the district court summary judgment is appropriate when,viewing the evidence and all justifiable inferences in the light most favorable to the party,there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law the appropriate inquiry is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.
denial of awarded to brian nelson 
to survive summary judgment,septimus must satisfy the burden shifting test found in mcdonnell douglas and recently reaffirmed in reeves sanderson plumbing prods.under this test,the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination,and if she successfully does so,the defendant shall respond by setting forth its legitimate,reason for its decision if the defendant produces a legitimate reason,any presumption of discrimination raised by the plaintiff prima facie case vanishes however,the plaintiff may still avoid summary judgment if she demonstrates a genuine issue of material fact whether the legitimate reasons proffered by the defendant are not its true reasons,but instead are a pretext for discrimination 
septimus may establish her prima facie case by showing that she is a member of a protected class was qualified for her position was subjected to an adverse employment action and was replaced by someone outside the protected class,or that other similarly situated persons were treated more favorably 
the summary judgment record shows that in january,the university posted an opening for an agc to handle employment and litigation matters.although septimus admits she was not qualified for that position,she expressed interest to duffy in being promoted to williams former agc position,for which she was qualified.earlier that day,before septimus expressed interest in being promoted,duffy had interviewed nelson.septimus claims that although nelson was officially hired for the litigation position,for which she admits she was unqualified,he was actually hired,over her,for the business counsel position she sought.accepting these facts as true,we presume that septimus sufficiently established her prima facie case.continuing with the applicable burden shifting analysis,the university has set forth a legitimate,reason for its actions septimus was less qualified than nelson for the litigation counsel position.
finally,we agree with the district court conclusion that septimus did not raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding pretext.there is no dispute that she was not qualified for the litigation counsel position for which the university says it hired nelson.furthermore,even assuming,as septimus asserts,that the university actually hired nelson for a business counsel position similar to the position septimus wanted,she admits that when she raised the issue with duffy,he stated that because she had not stepped up to assume management responsibilities,she would not be promoted to such a position.
septimus offered no evidence to contest the reasons duffy gave to support his decision.the mere fact that nelson was hired instead of septimus does not sufficiently raise a material fact issue concerning discriminatory intent by duffy.septimus belief that duffy decision was motivated by discrimination,however genuinely held,is not sufficient evidence of pretext septimus reliance on mcelvaney conclusion that she suffered gender discrimina
