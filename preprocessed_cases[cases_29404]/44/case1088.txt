opinion of the court 
this case involves product liability claims by individuals who allegedly suffered bone fractures because they took fosamax a drug used to treat or prevent osteoporosis and paget disease or the generic equivalent of that drug,alendronate sodium.those plaintiffs sued merck sharp dohme,merck,the manufacturer of fosamax,as well as several entities that manufacture the generic equivalent the generic defendants.the united states district court for the district of new jersey granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of the generic defendants because it determined that the claims against them were by federal law.the district court certified the finality of that order pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,and a number of the plaintiffs have appealed.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm.
background 
statutory and regulatory 
the food,drug,and cosmetic act fdca,ch,stat.codified as amended at et,provides the framework for federal regulation of prescription drugs in the united states.under the fdca,a manufacturer must seek approval from the united states food and drug administration fda to market a new drug and,in doing so,must first file a new drug application nda and then prove the drug safety and efficacy and propose accurate and adequate labeling.b,d.as the supreme court has recognized,m eeting those requirements involves costly and lengthy clinical testing.pliva,mensing.
congress has amended the fdca several times,including in by passage of the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of the hatch waxman act,codified at,and.the hatch waxman act governs the production and sale of generic versions of previously approved drugs.in short,it allows the manufacturers of generic drugs to gain fda approval simply by showing equivalence to a drug that has already been approved by the fda.mensing.at citing j a.a manufacturer seeking approval of a generic drug will file an abbreviated new drug application anda demonstrating that the generic drug and the drug are bioequivalent in addition to having the same active ingredients,the drug and the generic version must share the same route of administration,dosage form,dosage strength,and labeling j a ii v.the statutory aim is to allow manufacturers to develop generic drugs inexpensively,without duplicating the clinical trials already performed on the equivalent drug.mensing.at.
factual and procedural 
the fda gave a green light to merck nda for fosamax in september.teva pharmaceuticals usa,one of the generic defendants,then developed alendronate sodium a generic form of the branded drug and obtained fda approval on its anda in february.the other generic defendants subsequently obtained approval for alendronate sodium formulations as well 
alendronate sodium is a bisphosphonate drug that,as already noted,is used for treating bone conditions such as osteoporosis and paget disease.vol.at.the drug acts by inhibiting bone resorption or absorption and suppressing bone turnover.id.consequently,it also inhibits primary mineralization which is involved in the formation of new bone.meanwhile,secondary mineralization of existing bone continues,which increases the bone mineral content and results in higher bone mineral density.according to the plaintiffs,higher bone mineral density does not necessarily correspond with reduction of fracture risk rather,it can make bone highly mineralized,homogenous,brittle,and more susceptible to fracture.id.at.according to some studies,the effects of alendronate sodium linger after treatment ends,with one study reporting that bone turnover may be inhibited by even years after discontinuing treatment.
on february,plaintiffs,who are citizens of different states,filed this products liability suit in missouri state court against both merck and the generic defendants collectively,the defendants for damages related to long bone fractures that they suffered after taking prescribed doses of fosamax or alendronate sodium id.at.the grounds they asserted for liability focused on the defendants alleged concealment of risks associated with fosamax alendronate sodium,gross exaggeration of the purported fracture reduction benefits conferred by the drugs,and overpromotion of the drugs for,or,indications.id.at.specifically,they brought product liability claims under theories of design defect,negligence,breach of express warranty,breach of implied warranty,fraudulent misrepresentation,and negligent misrepresentation.
with the consent of the generic defendants,merck removed the action to the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri.the united states judicial panel on multidistrict litigation later centralized the action with several other fosamax related lawsuits in a litigation mdl,mdl,in the united states district court for the district of new jersey.
once the mdl was established,the generic defendants moved under rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure for judgment on the pleadings,arguing that the plaintiffs claims are by federal law under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution.the district court granted the motion,holding that claims against the generic defendants relate to duties under state tort law that directly conflict with duties under federal regulations.it read the claims as alleging that alendronate sodium should have been designed differently to comply with state tort law.id.at.the district court decision anticipated reasoning given by the supreme court in its opinion last term in mutual pharmaceutical bartlett.while the district court did not have the benefit of the bartlett opinion,it was guided by another recent supreme court case,pliva,mensing,which it understood to say that a federal duty of sameness arising out of the fda regulatory requirements preempts any conflicting tort duty arising under state law.vol.at.the district court thus concluded that the claims against the generic defendants are because,just as those defendants can not lawfully change drug labeling for alendronate sodium,they can not lawfully change the active ingredient design of the drug either.
in a series of orders,the court dismissed all of the generic defendants from the case,leaving only merck as a defendant several of the plaintiffs of the hereinafter the appellants then filed this appeal.

pursuant to,we have jurisdiction over appeals from final decisions of the district courts of the united states.generally,an order which terminates fewer than all claims pending in an action or claims against fewer than all the parties to an action does not constitute a final order for purposes of.elliot,at.however,under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,a district court may convert an order adjudicating less than an entire action to the end that it becomes a final decision over which a court of appeals may exercise jurisdiction under.id.
this appeal was originally taken from the district court order that,inter alia,dismissed all claims except those against merck the district court,at the time,did not enter judgment under rule b.we sua sponte raised the issue of jurisdiction,and the parties acknowledged in a rule j letter that this appeal was taken from a order for purposes of.the parties have since jointly sought and obtained certification from the district court under rule b for entry of a final judgment as to one or more,but fewer than all,claims or parties.b.

a.the claims at issue on appeal 
the appellants challenge only the judgment entered against them on their claims,which were held to be.before turning to the merits,we need to determine the scope of the claims before us,as some has been attempted.the parties,and particularly the appellants,have been trying to catch up with precedential developments,most importantly the supreme court bartlett decision.consequently,as more fully described herein,the appellants arguments have changed from their opening to their reply briefs.in their reply brief,the appellants contend that they preserved their appeal on all aspects of their design defect claims,including those based on negligent design theories.appellants reply br.at.they assert that their claims are grounded on the theory that the generic defendants were negligent because of their failure to properly analyze alendronate sodium to discover the product defects and for negligently continuing to sell alendronate sodium after they were,or should have been aware,that it was defectively designed.id.at.
the generic defendants respond that the appellants waived any arguments regarding claims by raising them for the first time in their reply brief and that,instead,the only claims on appeal are the appellants claims.we agree.
we have consistently held that a n issue is waived unless a party raises it in its opening brief,and for those purposes a passing reference to an issue will not suffice to bring that issue before this court.ethypharm france abbott labs,cir alterations in original quoting laborers int l union of am.foster wheeler energy,cir.the appellants contend that they did raise the issue of negligence in their opening brief,and they point to their statement of the issues,which says the only issues for this court determination are whether the district court erred when it granted the g eneric defendants motion to dismiss on the basis of federal preemption as to plaintiffs design defect claims.appellants opening br.at.the idea,it seems,is that the words design defect claims are broad enough to encompass claims.however,the appellants summary of the argument in their opening brief states more specifically that t he district court erred in dismissing appellants based design defect claims.id.at emphasis added.count ix,titled strict liability defective design,is the only claim against the generic defendants brought under a based theory,specifically that the foreseeable risks exceeded the benefits associated with alendronate sodium design or formulation and that alendronate sodium lacked efficacy posed a greater likelihood of injury than other osteoporosis treatments.vol.at.it is also the only count from the appellants complaint that they mention in their opening brief.nowhere in the opening brief do they raise any arguments specific to a claim or,for that matter,make any reference to such a claim at all therefore,fairly read,that brief is limited to the based claim set forth in count ix 
the appellants reply brief arguments,which go beyond the scope of count ix and are outside of anything addressed in the opening brief,must be seen as waived.we thus decline to consider whether there is any basis for distinguishing between claims and claims for purposes,and we withhold comment on whether claims are or are not preempted 
of the appellants strict liability design defect claims 
t he states possess sovereignty concurrent with that of the federal government,subject only to limitations imposed by the supremacy clause.tafflin levitt.that clause of the constitution provides that federal law shall be the supreme law of the land,any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.const.art.vi,cl.the idea is simply stated,but it is seldom simple to determine whether the dissonance between a federal and state law is such that it requires the former to the latter.
circumstances giving rise to are typically divided into three categories state law must yield when a federal statute includes an express provision for preemption w hen congress intends federal law to occupy the field in an area of law and when a state and federal statute are in conflict crosby foreign trade council,citation omitted see also farina nokia,cir recognizing three different types of.the last variety is the one at issue here,and it comes in two impossibility,which is when compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,and obstacle,which is when a state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.maryland louisiana,internal quotation marks omitted see also md mall,llc csx,cir.the generic defendants arguments are confined to impossibility.
in wyeth levine,the supreme court considered impossibility in the context of pharmaceutical regulation and state tort law.the plaintiff in that case brought claims against the manufacturer of a drug,alleging that the manufacturer failed to adequately warn of the risks posed by a particular way of administering the drug.id.at.the manufacturer argued that the claims were because it was impossible for it to comply with its duty to modify the drug labeling without violating its duties under federal law.id.at.the levine court start ed with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.id.at internal quotation marks omitted citation omitted.the court said that manufacturers of drugs remain responsible for updating drug labeling and,as the manufacturer had not submitted evidence that the fda would not have approved a change to the drug label,the manufacturer failed to demonstrate that it was impossible for it to comply with both federal and state requirements.id.at.on the way to that conclusion,the court briefly review ed the history of federal regulation of drugs and drug labeling,id.at,and stated that,i n keeping with congress decision not to tort suits,it appears that the fda traditionally regarded state law as a complementary form of drug regulation,id.at 
the appellants assert that,under levine presumption against,we should err on the side of not finding preemption unless congress has clearly spoken.appellants opening br.at.the supreme court more recent opinions in mensing,and bartlett,however,hold that certain claims against manufacturers of generic drugs conflict directly with federal law and are without effect because of impossibility.when such preemption is found,liability can not attach if the manufacturer has complied with the applicable federal standard.restatement third of torts products liability cmt.b.the appellants,recognizing the import of mensing and bartlett,argue that their claims are materially distinguishable from the claims at issue in those cases to assess their arguments,then,we first consider mensing and bartlett in detail.
the mensing decision 
in mensing,the supreme court consolidated appeals arising from decisions made by the united states courts of appeals for the fifth and eighth circuits.both plaintiffs in the two underlying cases had sued the manufacturers of metoclopramide tablets,a generic drug,alleging that longterm use of the drug caused them to develop a severe neurological disorder.mensing.at.they brought claims,one under louisiana law and the other under minnesota state law.their contention was essentially that,despite mounting evidence that long term metoclopramide use carries a risk of the neurological disorder far greater than that indicated on the label,none of the generic drug m anufacturers had changed their labels to adequately warn of that danger.id.at.the manufacturers countered with the argument that,as the court put it,federal statutes and fda regulations required them to use the same safety and efficacy labeling as their counterparts,such that they could not simultaneously fulfill their federal obligation while updating the labels for metoclopramide under their state tort law duty.id.at.the fifth and eighth circuits each rejected that argument and held that the plaintiffs claims were not preempted by federal law.see id.
the supreme court granted certiorari on the question of whether federal drug regulations applicable to generic drug manufacturers directly conflict with,and thus,claims.id.at.the answer was yes.as the court explained,when a party can not satisfy its state duties without the federal government special permission and assistance,which is dependent on the exercise of judgment by a federal agency,that party can not independently satisfy those state duties for purposes.id.at.the court observed that the tort laws of louisiana and minnesota require a drug manufacturer that is or should be aware of its product danger to label that product in a way that renders it reasonably safe.id.at.at the same time,federal fda regulations require that the warning labels of a drug and its generic copy must always be the same thus,generic drug manufacturers have an ongoing federal duty of sameness.id.at citing.the particular issue was therefore whether it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements.id.at quoting freightliner myrick,u.
the court considered three arguments two from the plaintiffs and one from the for why generic drug manufacturers could comply with warning requirements and avoid liability while also satisfying the fda requirement that generic drugs always have the same labeling as their brand name counterparts.first,the plaintiffs argued that the fda cbe process allows generic drug manufacturers to update warnings on labels but the court concluded that the cbe process only allows those manufacturers to update their labeling to match the drug labeling.id.at.second,the plaintiffs submitted that the manufacturers can send out letters to inform physicians of new warnings.id.at.the court held that the manufacturers can not do that,though,because the fda considers such letters to be labeling that must be consistent with the labeling provided with the drug.id.citing d.third,the fda argued that generic drug manufacturers can satisfy both state and duties by proposing stronger labeling to the fda when they believe new warnings are needed.id.the court determined,however,that even if those manufacturers have a federal duty to ask for fda assistance to change labeling,federal law would permit them to comply with the state labeling requirements if,and only if,the fda and the manufacturer changed the label to do so.id.at.the court observed that one can often imagine that a third party or the federal government might do something that makes it lawful for a private party to accomplish under federal law what state law requires of it,but i f these conjectures suffice to prevent federal and state law from conflicting for supremacy clause purposes,it would be unclear when,outside of express,the supremacy clause would have any force.id.at.
because it was impossible for the generic drug manufacturers to independently do under federal law what state law requires of them to change the drug label the supreme court held that the state law claims against the manufacturers were.id.as other circuit courts have observed,and we concur,mensing holds that manufacturers can not unilaterally change a generic drug labeling,and therefore a claim premised on such a manufacturer being obligated to revise its label is preempted.see drager pliva usa,cir morris pliva,cir per curiam bell pfizer,cir schrock wyeth,cir.
the bartlett decision 
while the present case was pending,the supreme court decided bartlett,which considered whether designdefect claims under new hampshire law were.at.the court noted that the claims were claims because new hampshire law imposes a duty on manufacturers to ensure that their products are not unreasonably dangerous,a duty which can be achieved in the context of pharmaceuticals in two ways either by changing a drug design or by changing its labeling.id.at.importantly,the court held that manufacturers do not have the option of redesigning a generic drug because,under the fdca requirements,were a manufacturer to change the composition of its generic drug,the altered chemical would be a new drug that would require its own nda to be marketed in interstate commerce.id.at.the bartlett court thus observed that new hampshire law ultimately required the defendant manufacturer to change the drug labeling.id.at.but under mensing,federal law prevents generic drug manufacturers from changing their labels.id.at.accordingly,federal law prohibited the generic drug manufacturer from taking the remedial action required to avoid liability under new hampshire law,and the rule of impossibility preemption applied.id.
in the course of its analysis,the supreme court also rejected as incompatible with jurisprudence the argument.id.at.that argument,which had been endorsed by the united states court of appeals for the first circuit,reasons that a manufacturer can avoid a conflict between its state and duties by simply choosing to halt sales of the generic drug.id.the supreme court said,however,that its cases presume that an actor seeking to satisfy both his federal and obligations is not required to cease acting altogether in order to avoid liability.indeed,if the option of ceasing to act defeated a claim of impossibility,impossibility would be all but meaningless.id.internal quotation marks omitted see also strayhorn wyeth,cir noting the supreme court unqualified rejection of the theory.
the appellants attempt to distinguish mensing and bartlett by arguing that those decisions were limited to the of claims.appellants reply br.at.they say that the claims at issue here do not necessarily require the generic defendants to unilaterally change the labeling for alendronate sodium,so the generic defendants duties do not conflict with any specific provisions of the fdca and thus do not raise impossibility.appellants opening br.at.in support of that argument,the appellants draw our attention to the supreme court choice of language in bartlett s claims that turn on the adequacy of a drug warnings are by federal law under mensing.bartlett.at emphasis added.under the appellants reading of the case,bartlett only stands for the of claims against generic manufacturers when a state imposes a duty to strengthen a drug warning 
that is too narrow a reading of the supreme court instructions.as the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit has held,t ogether,mensing and bartlett establish that under the fdca a generic drug manufacturer may not unilaterally change its labeling or change its design or formulation,and can not be required to exit the market or accept state tort liability.drager,at.thus,to the extent it is impossible for a generic drug manufacturer to comply with its duty under a state tort law unless it takes one of those actions,that law is by the fdca.id.
at oral argument,the generic defendants emphasized that,although the claims at issue were brought under the laws of different states,they could only avoid liability by taking one of the options that mensing and bartlett say they can not be forced to take changing alendronate sodium labeling,changing the drug design,or ceasing sales of the drug altogether.in the end,the appellants were forced to concede that point,in effect if not in words.they tried to avoid the scope of mensing reach by saying that their claims are not intended to relate to any drug warnings accompanying alendronate sodium appellants opening br.at.they also state that they do not seek a change in alendronate sodium design id.at,which is not yielding much,since the bartlett decision clearly holds that such a redesign is impossible under federal law for a generic drug manufacturer.the appellants are left with their position that their claims impose liability for the generic defendants willful choice to sell a particular product with an unreasonably dangerous design.id.in other words,they are trying to resurrect the theory,under which the generic defendants can only avoid liability by halting their sales of alendronate sodium but bartlett categorically rejected that theory,and that ends the argument 
admittedly,the supreme court was careful in both mensing and bartlett to consider in the context of the specific state laws at issue in those cases.but we have not been directed to any specific state law regime by the appellants and we need not ponder hypothetical state laws.when we pressed the appellants at oral argument to give an example of a claim under any relevant state regime that would not ultimately result in some combination of the same three options for the generic defendants,changing the labeling of alendronate sodium,changing the design of the drug,or pulling the drug from the market they were unable to identify such a claim.nothing in the briefing offered any analysis either.therefore,it is unnecessary for us to embark on a state tour of law schrock,at finding that,as n o effort wa s made to identify a mechanism through which the generic drug manufacturer could have modified or supplemented the warranties allegedly breached without running afoul of the duty of sameness identified in mensing,the plaintiff claims are preempted to the extent they rest on inadequate labeling as broadly defined by the fda.
in sum,mensing and bartlett recognize that manufacturers have no control over the design or labeling of generic drugs.short of exiting the market which bartlett rejects the appellants have failed to identify anything the generic defendants can do to reconcile their conflicting duties under state and federal law therefore,the appellants claims are preempted.

for the foregoing reasons,we will affirm the district court judgment for the generic defendants.

the district court initially denied the generic defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings as to watson pharmaceuticals,and watson laboratories,collectively,the watson defendants because,under rule c,the court took as true the plaintiffs allegation that the watson defendants were not generic manufacturers.however,the court subsequently granted the watson defendants motion for reconsideration,thereby granting judgment on the pleadings to them as well.in addition,the district court initially denied the generic defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings as to plaintiffs who had filed a motion for remand notice of voluntary dismissal.the court later resolved the motion for remand and dismisse d plaintiffs claims against generic defendants as preempted.vol.at.

count ix alleges,in part.when placed into the stream of commerce,alendronate sodium was defective in its design or formulation and was unreasonably dangerous in that its foreseeable risks exceeded the benefits associated with its design or formulation.when placed into the stream of commerce,alendronate sodium was defective in design or formulation in that it lacked efficacy posed a greater likelihood of injury than other osteoporosis treatments on the market and was more dangerous than ordinary consumers or their physicians could reasonably foresee or anticipate.alternatively,when placed into the stream of commerce,alendronate sodium was defective in design and was unreasonably dangerous in that its label failed to warn physicians and patients of the dangers associated with use of bisphosphonates,including,but not limited to the risk of severely suppressed bone turnover,brittle bones and a greater susceptibility to stress fractures or long bone fractures and the label failed to instruct physicians and patients about the limited length of time alendronate sodium was actually effective in preventing fractures.vol.at.
the shift to arguments in the appellants reply brief is not surprising given that the supreme court bartlett decision which,as discussed below,addressed claims issued during the pendency of this appeal.according to the generic defendants,t he bottom line is that the appellants placed their bets on the first circuit bartlett decision that credited the theory embraced by the appellants in their opening brief and they lost.appellees br.at.after the supreme court overturned the first circuit bartlett opinion,the appellants did not seek to file a revised opening brief.they proposed for the original briefing to be continued with the generic defendants answering brief and thei
