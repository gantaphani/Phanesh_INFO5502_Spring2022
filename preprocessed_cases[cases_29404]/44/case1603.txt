this appeal arises from a claim that a public high school wrestling coach violated the constitutional rights of a member of his high school wrestling team by instituting and encouraging repeated beatings of the student by other members of the team.the coach appeals the district court refusal to dismiss the complaint on the basis of qualified immunity.we affirm.
the amended complaint alleges that in the fall of,james robert meeker,a freshman at rosewood high school in wayne county,north carolina,joined the school wrestling team,which william henderson edmundson ii coached.according to the complaint,from november through january,coach edmundson frequently initiated and encouraged abuse of meeker by other members of the wrestling team.
during these attacks,at least two team members restrained meeker,who was only five feet,five inches tall and weighed pounds,while additional teammates would pull up or remove his clothing and take turns repeatedly beating his bare torso until it turned red.meeker received such beatings,referred to as red bellies,at least times during the few months he was a member of the team.coach edmundson allegedly instituted,permitted,endorsed,encouraged,facilitated,and condoned the abuse,using other students as his instruments to beat meeker.
the complaint alleges that coach edmundson employed the beatings as his sole means of discipline and as a way to force an unwanted member to quit the team,which had a purported policy.edmundson assertedly told meeker that the beatings would continue until meeker toughened up and stopped crying,and the coach prevented disclosure of the abuse by intimidation and retaliation,including more severe beatings.the beatings caused meeker excruciating physical pain,inflammation of the body,and severe emotional anguish and humiliation,requiring him to seek professional care and medical treatment for among other conditions,traumatic stress disorders,which may be permanent in nature.in january,suffering from traumatic stress and reacting to the most recent beatings,meeker brought a to school,which led to his suspension and reassignment to another school in the district.
in august,meeker parents,individually and as guardians ad litem for meeker,filed this action for compensatory and punitive damages against coach edmundson,principal richard gene sauls,and superintendent steven taylor,in their official and individual capacities chairman of the wayne county board of education,george moye,in his official capacity and the wayne county board of education.in addition to claiming that the defendants acted negligently in violation of state law,the amended complaint alleges violation of meeker and his parents constitutional rights under and and civil rights conspiracy in violation of and.
the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety.although refusing to dismiss the state law claims,the district court did dismiss all the conspiracy claims,as well as the claims against all defendants except edmundson in his individual capacity.the court found the complaint alleged facts stating a claim that edmundson violated meeker constitutional rights because a state actor,through his agents,can not randomly beat a student.moreover,the district court refused to dismiss this claim against coach edmundson on the basis of qualified immunity,reasoning that at the time of the alleged incidents,it was clearly established that a state actor could not arbitrarily commit violence against a student.
edmundson appeals from the district court refusal to grant him qualified immunity 
in an appeal from the denial of qualified immunity,we first determine whether the facts alleged,t aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,show that the official conduct violated a constitutional right.saucier katz,d.if not,the analysis ends the plaintiff can not prevail.clem corbeau,cir.if,however,a plaintiff has alleged the violation of a constitutional right,we then ask whether the right was clearly established at the time of the asserted violation.saucier,at.clem,at.if the right was not clearly established in the specific context of the case,then the official is entitled to immunity from suit.clem,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.only if a plaintiff alleges the violation of a clearly established constitutional right does his complaint survive a motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds.
our first task,then,is to resolve whether,t aken in the light most favorable to meeker,the facts alleged show that coach edmundson conduct violated a constitutional right.saucier,at.meeker maintains that the facts show that edmundson violated his substantive due process right to be free from the infliction of malicious corporal punishment by school officials.
years ago in hall tawney,cir,we considered whether a student could state a substantive due process claim by alleging malicious corporal punishment inflicted by school officials.there,a public school student and her parents asserted,in admittedly conclusory allegations,that,after a teacher had paddled the student without provocation,the school principal supervis ed and approv ed an additional paddling,which caused the student serious injury.id.at.we found that the complaint set forth a substantive due process claim against both the teacher and the principal.
in doing so,we relied on the fact that three years earlier,in ingraham wright,d,the supreme court had expressly recognized that corporal punishment in public schools implicates a constitutionally protected liberty interest to be free from unjustified intrusions on personal security.the ingraham court said such punishment did not infringe a student eighth amendment or procedural due process rights,but it specifically left open the possibility that corporal punishment at a public school could give rise to a substantive due process claim.see id.at.in hall we concluded that the court express reservation of the issue in ingraham compelled the conclusion that substantive due process rights might be implicated in school disciplinary punishments even though procedural due process is afforded by adequate civil and criminal state remedies.hall,at emphasis omitted.
we then held that the proper substantive due process inquiry focuses on the force imposed by school authorities whether the force was disproportionate to the need presented,whether the force was inspired by malice or sadism rather than a merely careless or unwise excess of zeal,and whether the force inflicted severe injury.id.at citation omitted.if consideration of these factors leads to the conclusion that the force imposed amounted to a brutal and inhumane abuse of official power literally shocking to the conscience,then the plaintiff has made out a substantive due process claim.applying this test in hall,we concluded that the district court erred in dismissing the student substantive due process claim against the teacher who had paddled her and the principal who had authorized the paddling.id.at see also koch,cir collecting cases from several circuits that have adopted hall rationale and holding.
meeker complaint clearly alleges facts sufficient to state a substantive due process claim under the criteria set forth in hall.the complaint alleges facts asserting a use of,unprovoked beatings disproportionate to any need.hall,at.the complaint further alleges that edmundson deliberately and intentionally instituted these unprovoked beatings on numerous occasions a certainly could determine that such beatings were inspired by malice.id.finally,meeker allegations that coach edmundson repeatedly directed the unprovoked and malicious beatings,causing him to suffer excruciating physical pain,inflammation of the body,and traumatic stress disorders which may be permanent in nature,are adequate to allege the requisite injury to support a substantive due process claim.see,at holding that pain,bruising,and emotional injury provide the basis for a substantive due process claim when a school official acts maliciously and without any disciplinary purpose webb mccullough,cir holding that when a trier of fact could find a school official need to strike a student
