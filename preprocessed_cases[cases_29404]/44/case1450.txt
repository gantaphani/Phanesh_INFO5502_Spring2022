jamie meyers was working in a utility bucket positioned above an unblocked lane of traffic when a truck driven by michael lamer struck the bucket.as a result of the collision,meyers was ejected from the bucket and suffered injuries to his back and lower body.meyers then sued lamer and lamer employer for negligence pursuant to maryland state law.the parties for summary judgment,and the district court granted summary judgment to lamer and his employer and denied summary judgment to meyers.this appeal ensued.for the reasons that follow,we vacate the judgment below and remand with instructions.
on february,jamie meyers was performing work for rommel engineering construction,rommel,a company that contracts with the state of maryland to maintain traffic signals and streetlights.meyers task that day was to replace the traffic signals at the intersection of maryland route and maryland route.this work required meyers to be in a bucket positioned above the intersection.eric hatfield,who was also employed by rommel,accompanied meyers as meyers groundsman.hatfield task was to watch for oncoming at times when meyers work required that he turn his back to oncoming to warn meyers when a vehicle was approaching so that meyers could,if necessary,increase the clearance between the ground and the bottom of the bucket using controls in the bucket.
the for the worksite,which was determined by rommel superintendent,dan mcmunn,was as follows.meyers and hatfield each parked a vehicle along the shoulder of route for meyers,a utility truck with an extendable boom and a bucket at the end of the boom,and for hatfield,a truck.meyers truck was parked closer to the intersection with hatfield truck parked behind it,making the rear of hatfield truck the first vehicle that drivers would see as they approached the intersection in the lane adjacent to the shoulder where the trucks were parked.hatfield truck had a light board that displayed blinking lights to signal caution,as well as flashing strobe lights,both of which were activated during the time that meyers was performing work.meyers truck also had flashing strobe lights.
additionally,meyers and hatfield placed warning signs along the shoulder of route to indicate that work was being performed ahead and that drivers should proceed with caution.this included placing signs at distances of miles,one mile,mile,and mile before the intersection as northbound traffic approached the intersection.in the feet immediately prior to the intersection,meyers and hatfield placed cones along the line separating the vehicle travel lane from the shoulder of route,where their trucks were parked.notably,meyers and hatfield did not close the northbound lane of travel adjacent to the shoulder or use flagmen with signs to allow traffic to pass only intermittently.the parties and their experts dispute whether failure to close the lane of travel or use flagmen was consistent with the standard of care for the industry.
the incident giving rise to the underlying lawsuit occurred when a truck owned by carroll county foods,llc,and driven by michael lamer together,appellees collided with meyers bucket.deposition testimony revealed that meyers had told hatfield that he had to turn his back to the northbound lane of traffic on route to perform his work and that hatfield told meyers,n o problem,i got you.meanwhile,lamer was talking to his wife on his cell phone as he approached the intersection where meyers was working and did not notice the caution signs placed alongside the shoulder of the road leading up to the intersection.lamer did see meyers bucket but thought that there was enough clearance between the top of his truck and the bucket to safely pass beneath it.lamer estimation regarding the clearance turned out to be erroneous and,as a result,his truck collided with meyers bucket.immediately after the collision,lamer slammed on his brakes and skidded to a stop.
as a result of the collision,meyers was ejected from the bucket.although meyers was wearing a safety harness,he nevertheless suffered injuries to his back and lower body.on october,meyers sued appellees in maryland state court,alleging that lamer failed to,inter alia,keep a proper lookout,appreciate that the tractor trailer he was operating would not go under the,and carefully and prudently apply his brakes so as to avoid a collision.appellees subsequently removed the action to the district court based on diversity of citizenship.
following discovery,the parties for summary judgment.the district court granted appellees motion and denied meyers motion,each on the bases that meyers assumed a risk that he would be struck by a truck while working above an open lane of traffic and because meyers was contributorily negligent.meyers then timely filed this appeal.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.

as noted above,the district court granted summary judgment to appellees on the grounds that meyers assumed a risk that the bucket would be hit by a vehicle passing beneath it and because meyers was contributorily negligent.we address these reasons in turn.
the doctrine is grounded on the theory that a plaintiff who voluntarily consents,either expressly or impliedly,to exposure to a known risk can not later sue for damages incurred from exposure to that risk.crews hollenbach.t o establish the defense of assumption of risk,the defendant must show that the plaintiff had knowledge of the risk of the danger appreciated that risk and voluntarily confronted the risk of danger.adm martin.maryland courts apply a hybrid standard to determine whether an injured plaintiff had the requisite knowledge and appreciation of the risk.see c m builders,llc strub.more specifically,
i t is ordinarily for the jury to determine whether a plaintiff knew of the danger,appreciated the risk,and acted voluntarily but when it is clear that a person of normal intelligence in the position of the plaintiff must have understood the danger,the issue concerning knowledge,appreciation of the danger and voluntariness is for the court.

meyers argues that the doctrine does not apply to him because he was a worker engaged in tasks in the roadway.for this argument,meyers relies on clayborne mueller,clayborne i,aff,clayborne ii.there,a police officer was struck by a passing motorist who did not see the officer standing alongside the road while the officer was talking to a stopped motorist that he had pulled over.id.at.in affirming the trial court verdict in favor of the officer and against the passing motorist,the appellate court noted that the doctrine is not applicable to those persons such as workers in the street,traffic directors or police officers exercising traffic control and regulation enforcement if they are in the course of the normal pursuit of their duties.id.at.maryland highest maryland court of this holding,concluding that because the officer was following usual police procedure,there can be no basis for a claim that he,as a matter of law,voluntarily assumed the risk of an obvious danger.clayborne ii,at.
appellees claim that meyers waived any argument concerning applicability of the defense because meyers arguments in the district court pertained to the merits of that defense only,to wit,whether meyers assumed a risk.although appellees are correct that meyers did not challenge the applicability of the defense would normally lead us to conclude that the argument was waived on appeal,see holland big river minerals,cir it is the fundamental province of this court to decide cases correctly,even if that means considering arguments raised for the first time on appeal or not raised by the parties at all.see kirby allegheny beverage,cir although this point was not presented to the district court or raised by the parties on appeal,that does not preclude this court from considering it sua sponte,in order to reach the correct result.citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted artrip califano,cir normally,this court would not entertain an appeal where the record does not indicate that the issues were raised below,but where necessary to reach the correct result,and where the record provides an adequate basis for consideration on the merits,we will review such issues.see also seney rent a center,cir citing kamen kemper fin,when an issue is properly before the court,the court is not limited to the particular legal theories advanced by the parties,but rather retains the independent power to identify and apply the proper construction of governing law.in this case,permitting appellees to avail themselves of the defense when maryland law carves out an exception for persons such as workers in the street in the course of the normal pursuit of their duties,clayborne i,at,would be contrary to the rule of law.
in response,appellees advance three arguments.first,appellees claim that the clayborne cases involved a police officer and,therefore,any reference to highway workers was no more than dicta.we see no reason,however,why workers such as meyers should not also be covered by the exception,particularly in light of the fact that the court in clayborne i listed workers in the street in its serial recitation of those classes of persons to whom the doctrine is not applicable.see at.second,appellees argue that m ore modern cases since clayborne have applied the doctrine of assumption of risk where the plaintiff is engaged in a dangerous profession.for this assertion,appellees rely on crews.in crews,the foreman of a repair team sued various defendants after he was injured by an explosion while attempting to fix a leak,at,and the maryland court of appeals held that the defense applied and barred the plaintiffs recovery,see id.at.notably,the crews court did not reference the clayborne cases,perhaps because the plaintiff was plainly not a worker in the street,traffic director or police officer exercising traffic control and regulation enforcement,clayborne i,at.
finally,appellees argue that clayborne ii abrogated the central holding from clayborne i upon which meyers relies.to be sure,the court in clayborne ii did state that,it is not necessary to describe police officers acting pursuant to their duties as having a special status.they,like all other persons,must act reasonably under all of the circumstances at.whether a plaintiff acts reasonably,however,goes to the issue of the plaintiff contributory was also at issue in the clayborne cases and not the plaintiff assumption of risk,which looks instead at the inherent dangers of a particular activity.compare kassama magat,contributory negligence is conduct on the part of the plaintiff which falls below the standard to which he should conform for his own protection citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted,with poole coakely williams,when a risk is a foreseeable consequence of engaging in a particular activity,we have reasoned that there is an implied consent to relieve others of liability for injury and assumption of the risk may be established as a matter of law.further,given the court statement in clayborne ii that there can be no basis for a claim that the police officer,as a matter of law,voluntarily assumed the risk of an obvious danger,at emphasis added,we do not think that clayborne ii disturbed the holding from clayborne i upon which meyers relies.
accordingly,we need not assess the merits of appellees defense insofar as meyers status as a worker in the street precludes appellees from relying on the defense that meyers assumed the risk that the bucket would be struck by a vehicle passing beneath it.we turn now to whether meyers was contributorily negligent.
in maryland,c ontributory negligence is the failure to observe ordinary care for one own safety.it is the doing of something that a person of ordinary prudence would not do,or the failure to do something that a person of ordinary prudence would do,under the circumstances.menish polinger,citation omitted internal quotation marks omitted.ordinarily,the question of whether the plaintiff has been contributorily negligent is for the jury,not the judge,to decide.campbell balt.gas,see also williamson truck lines,benjamin,it is only where the minds of reasonable persons can not differ that the court is justified in deciding contributory negligence as a matter of law.like the defense,a determination that a plaintiff was contributorily negligent serves as a complete bar to recovery against a defendant who was also negligent.woolridge price.that is to say,even if the plaintiff is determined to be only one percent negligent in an accident and the defendant percent negligent,the plaintiff is still denied recovery.see harrison montgomery cnty.bd.of,a plaintiff who fails to observe ordinary care for his own safety is contributorily negligent and is barred from all recovery,regardless of the quantum of a defendant primary negligence.although the great majority of the states employ a system that awards damages as a pro rata percentage of fault,the maryland court of appeals recently reaffirmed its commitment to the doctrine of contributory negligence.coleman soccer ass of columbia.appellees,as the defendants,bear the burden of proving that meyers was contributorily negligent.mcquay schertle.
before assessing the merits of the defense in this case,we first address briefly an evidentiary issue relating to the admissibility of meyers expert report.in opposition to appellees motion for summary judgment and in support of his own motion for the same,meyers submitted the expert report of richard balgowan,a professional engineer,who concluded that the worksite was set up in accordance with the standard of care for the industry.appellees maintain on appeal,as they did at summary judgment,that balgowan report is inadmissible because it was not authenticated or accompanied by a sworn affidavit.see orsi kirkwood,cir.appellees further contend that without balgowan expert report,meyers did not present any evidence demonstrating that he took the necessary precautions in accordance with industry standards to ensure his safety,and thus,there was nothing in the record to preclude summary judgment to appellees as to meyers contributory negligence.
we review the trial court decision regarding whether to admit evidence into the summary judgment record for an abuse of discretion.distaff,springfield contracting,cir.here,it is unclear whether the magistrate judge considered balgowan report in determining that meyers was contributorily negligent insofar as the summary judgment order is completely void of any mention of balgowan report and is likewise silent with respect to the report of appellees opposing expert.regardless,we need not decide whether balgowan report should have been admitted or excluded at summary judgment because,as we explain below,other evidence tended to show that a material factual dispute for the jury exists as to what precautions and actions a reasonable person in meyers position would have taken.
on the merits,appellees claim that meyers is chargeable with foreseeing that a may enter the lane of travel where he had positioned the bucket and with guard ing against that event.more specifically,appellees assert that meyers was contributorily negligent because he failed to block off the lane of traffic where lamer traveled and turned his back to oncoming traffic during a time that he knew that the bucket was in an unsafe position.appellees also claim that meyers can not rely upon any purported lookout being provided by hatfield as an indication that meyers took care for his personal safety.
