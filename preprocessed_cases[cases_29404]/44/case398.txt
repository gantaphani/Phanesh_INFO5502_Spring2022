frank was the director of labor affairs of the human resources department of the puerto rico highway authority prha,until he was terminated for violations of the prha rules and regulations.and his daughter,jennifer,claim that termination was motivated by his political affiliation in violation of his constitutional rights pursuant to,and they now appeal the district court dismissal of their claims against certain defendants,its grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant fernando fagundo,and its determination that the procedures followed in termination did not violate due process.after examining the record,we reject each of appellants arguments,and affirm the order of the district court.
the chain of events leading to appellant cepero firing began on september,when wrote a letter to the former prha executive director,fernando fagundo,requesting a salary increase in accordance with a prha regulation that required a pay increase for employees who had not been given a pay raise equivalent to one step in the pay scale over the preceding five years.in the letter,also stated that he possessed a list of the salaries and fringe benefits of several female employees.based on this information,he alleged gender and age discrimination,and that the salary raises given to those female employees violated the merit principle established in the prha personnel handbook.
did not receive the response he had hoped for.on january,fagundo sent a letter denying his request for a salary raise because he had received six pay raises in as many years with the prha.in the same letter,fagundo informed that he had ordered the prha legal department to investigate possible violations of the puerto rico penal code and several articles of the prha disciplinary measures handbook,including two alleged violations of infraction of the handbook,which prohibits using confidential personnel records for personal gain.fagundo letter outlined the underlying facts relating to admitted possession of other employees confidential information in his september letter and a previous instance in which he appended portions of defendant howard phillip confidential personnel records to a memorandum about phillip.fagundo letter additionally alleged insubordination and involvement in various incidents with other prha employees.the letter informed of fagundo intentions to file disciplinary measures,which could result in dismissal,and that an informal hearing was to be held on january.the january,letter was first notice of defendants intentions to take disciplinary measures against him.
on january,sent a letter to fagundo responding to the allegations that he had misused confidential personnel records and requesting more information about the specific facts underlying the insubordination and misconduct allegations.request was never answered by defendants.on january,sent fagundo a handwritten note stating that the january letter did not state the time of the hearing,and thus,he was handing in certain documents as evidence of his appearance in writing to the informal hearing.on february,received a letter officially terminating his employment with the prha.
ii.analysis 
appellants make four distinct arguments on appeal.first,appellants claim that district court erred in requiring to present a prima facie case of political discrimination against eric,samuel de la rosa,and william vega.second,appellants argue that the district court erred in dismissing,sua sponte,the claims against harry,roberto,and howard phillip figueroa.third,appellants challenge the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant fernando fagundo for failure to rebut defendants proffered nondiscriminatory basis for dismissal.finally,argues that the procedure leading to his termination did not afford him due process of law.we address each of plaintiffs claims in turn.
a.the district court misapplication of the prima facie case standard 
appellants contend that the district court incorrectly applied a heightened pleading standard to ramírez,de la rosa,and vega motion to dismiss.although the district court in large part correctly described the motion to dismiss standard,see rivera fagundo,d,it also stated that appellants claims should be dismissed for failure to establish a prima facie case of political discrimination,id.at.appellees concede that appellants did not have the burden of establishing a prima facie case in order to survive a motion to dismiss.however,they argue that appellants nevertheless clearly failed to meet their burden under the proper.a standard,and thus,the ultimate decision to dismiss should be affirmed.we agree.
for years,courts in this circuit had required plaintiffs to satisfy a heightened pleading standard in civil rights actions.educadores puertorriqueños en acción hernández,cir.however,in hernández,this court recognized that the supreme court decision in swierkiewicz sorema,d,sounded the death knell for the imposition of a heightened pleading standard except in cases in which either a federal statute or specific civil rule requires that result.hernández,at.in all other cases,courts faced with the task of adjudicating motions to dismiss under rule b must apply the notice pleading requirements of rule a.id.since there is no federal statute or specific federal rule of civil procedure mandating a heightened pleading standard for civil rights actions such as the political discrimination claims at issue in this appeal,the notice pleading standard,not the heightened pleading standard formerly applied in this circuit,governs motions to dismiss.
the case before us appears at first glance to present precisely the same situation that we resolved in hernández.as in hernández,the district court in this case dismissed plaintiffs political discrimination claims on the basis that plaintiffs failed to establish a prima facie case.compare rivera,d at,with hernández,at.on this basis,in hernández,we remanded the case to the district court to proceed in light of the proper standard.at.appellants ask that we follow suit in the instant case.
notwithstanding the citations to the prima facie case standard,it does not,however,appear that the district court in this case applied a heightened pleading standard.rather,it looked to the complaint and found that the allegations therein failed to make out a claim against these defendants.furthermore,we find that remand would be unnecessary,because appellants claims in question clearly fail to survive the proper rule a notice pleading standard.
under rule a,a complaint need only include a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.id.at.this statement must give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.id.quoting conley gibson,d.under this standard,a court confronted with a rule b motion may dismiss a complaint only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.id.quoting hishon king spalding,d.
appellants allegations against defendants ramírez,de la rosa,and vega are not simply vague or lacking in specificity.rather,they consist entirely of speculation about possible future conduct by the defendants.defendants are members of prha appeals committee,which is to hear the administrative complaints filed as a result of the actions taken against him.claims that these defendants will entertain a pending appeal and will carry out the public policy of discrimination because of their political ideology against plaintiff and are ready to rubber stamp the decision of fagundo.rivera,amended complaint,emphasis added.to date,the only proceedings that have taken place on this matter before the appeals committee,have been 
attempts by to consolidate both complaints,which were denied a request by the prha for counsel to withdraw,because of conflict of interest issues a request by to stay the administrative proceedings pending resolution of this case and a hearing called by ramírez for the sole purpose of recusing himself from both complaints because he appeared as a defendant in this case.
rivera,d at.
to prevail in a claim,plaintiffs must allege facts sufficient to support a determination i that the conduct complained of has been committed under color of state law,and ii that the alleged conduct worked a denial of rights secured by the constitution or laws of the united states,cir citations omitted.as an additional corollary,only those individuals who participated in the conduct that deprived the plaintiff of his rights can be held liable,cir finding that there is no liability on the basis of respondeat superior,and thus,a supervisor may be found liable only on the basis of his own acts or omissions wilson city of little rock,cir finding,in a action against police officers,that l iability may be found only if there is personal involvement of the officer being sued.as the district court correctly recognized,defendants ramírez,de la rosa,and vega have not taken any action adverse to plaintiff,nor did they have anything to do with fagundo and prha decision to terminate from his employment.rivera,d at.since these defendants clearly played no part in any action taken against plaintiff,we have no difficulty concluding that it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations against these defendants.hernández,at internal quotations omitted.thus,this unusual attempt to rope in defendants whose only actions against defendant might come at some point in the future fails the notice pleading standard.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of the claims against defendants ramírez,de la rosa,and vega.
dismissal of the claims against díaz,santiago and phillip 
unlike their on the appeals committee,defendants díaz,santiago,and phillip did not seek rule b dismissal of the claims against them.nevertheless,the district court dismissed the claims against díaz,santiago,and phillip sua sponte.we find that the court sua sponte dismissal was in error,but that the error was harmless because the court should have granted defendants motion for summary judgment.
sua sponte dismissal is rarely appropriate,and should not have been entered under these circumstances.sua sponte dismissals are strong medicine,and should be dispensed sparingly.chute walker,cir quoting,at.the general rule is that in limited circumstances,sua sponte dismissals of complaints under rule b are appropriate,but that such dismissals are erroneous unless the parties have been afforded notice and an opportunity to amend the complaint or otherwise respond.id.quoting futura dev.of,estado libre asociado de,cir.because the plaintiffs in this case were not given notice or an opportunity to amend their complaint,sua sponte dismissal was in error.
nevertheless,we find that the error is harmless because the district court should have granted díaz,santiago and phillip motion for summary judgment.in its decision,the district court dismissed the claims against díaz,santiago,and phillip in the course of its analysis of defendants motion for summary judgment.rivera,d at.the court found that had failed to establish a prima facie case against díaz,santiago,and phillip by failing to demonstrate that they were personally and directly involved in the alleged violation of his rights.id.at.having found that the appellants failed to meet this summary judgment threshold,the district court should have granted summary judgment in favor of these defendants.however,at this point,the court erroneously chose to grant sua sponte dismissal instead.nevertheless,we find,for the same reasons alluded to by the district court,that appellants failed to establish a prima facie case,and thus,summary judgment should have been granted.
with regard to defendants díaz,santiago,and phillip,appellants alleged in their complaint that 
santiago cancel,sic planned along with howard phillip figueroa to provoke an incident with plaintiff,which took place as follows phillip figueroa went to plaintiff office to provoke him,informing the latter that he was coming to see him under the instructions of santiago cancel.phillip figueroa asked plaintiff why sic he did not resign and leave his position to a pdp attorney.
harry díaz vega,area director for human resources of the prha,talked to plaintiff several times,criticizing him because plaintiff was protesting for the illegal action taken by fagundo in appointing some female personnel with a high salary and in violation of the merit system.also,he told plaintiff the new administration goals,which was sic to have employees in key positions,loyal to the pdp and pointed to plaintiff that he was from the npp and that he should join the pdp.plaintiff refused and replied i rather be dead.
rivera,amended complaint,paras.nothing in appellants opposition to defendants motion for summary judgment or in the record significantly adds to these allegations.the district court described these claims as a general and unsubstantiated conspiracy theory,and found that had failed to show how these defendants played any role in the alleged violation of his rights.rivera,d at.claims that these defendants all conspired with fagundo to provoke into confrontations in order to justify his dismissal.id.however,even we must on summary these confrontations occurred exactly as recounts them,they played little if any role in creating the primary basis cited for dismissal his alleged use of confidential documents.furthermore,makes no other claim as to how defendants díaz,santiago and phillip played any role in the actual termination decision or process.
in order for appellants to succeed on their claim of political discrimination,they must demonstrate that the defendants were involved in the alleged deprivation of their this case,dismissal from the prha.imposition of liability requires that the conduct complained of must have been causally connected to the deprivation.cartagena,cir internal quotations omitted.in this case,the allegations against díaz,santiago,and phillip could help build a prima facie case against fagundo,who the record suggests was involved in the decision to terminate employment.however,since appellants have made no allegation,and we see no reason to infer,that defendants díaz,santiago and phillip were involved in the decision to dismiss,or that their alleged attempts to provoke led to his discharge,summary judgment should have been granted in favor of these defendants.furthermore,we note that these defendants would also be entitled to summary judgment for the same reasons we explain below with regard to defendant fagundo.therefore,the district court sua sponte dismissal,though in error,did not prejudice the appellants,and we do not disturb the final disposition reached by the district court with regard to these defendants.
summary judgment in favor of defendant fagundo 
the remaining individual defendant in this case is prha executive director fernando fagundo,who ordered the investigation leading to dismissal.we now consider appellants challenge to the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant fagundo.
we review the district court entry of summary judgment de novo,viewing all facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and granting all reasonable inferences in that party favor.see,torres dupont de nemours,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.we will also uphold summary judgment where the nonmoving party rests merely upon conclusory allegations,improbable inferences,and unsupported speculation,rivera,cir internal quotation omitted.
claims of political discrimination are subject to the analysis developed after healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.under that analysis,a plaintiff bears the initial burden of showing that political discrimination was the substantial or motivating factor in a defendant employment decision.the defendant must then show that the decision would have been the same even in the absence of the protected conduct,at internal citations omitted.because fagundo acted under color of state law,belongs to an opposing political party,is the one directly responsible for dismissal,and it is alleged that political affiliation was the basis for his actions,the district court found that appellants claims against fagundo established a prima facie case.rivera,d at.
once plaintiffs establish a prima facie case,t he burden then shifts to the defendant official to articulate a nondiscriminatory basis for the adverse employment action,and prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the adverse action would have been taken regardless of any discriminatory political motivation.larou ridlon,cir see also cordero,cir.in this case,defendants had little difficulty laying out the nondiscriminatory reasons for dismissal.defendants contend,and appellants do not deny,that letter of september stated that he possessed a list of female employees salaries and fringe benefits.even viewed in the light most favorable to appellants,we can not but conclude that this letter gave fagundo every reason to believe that had improperly obtained this information from personnel files in violation of phra regulations.defendants also allege,and does not deny,that he had previously attached pages of phillips personnel file to a letter in which he argued that phillips was mentally impermissible use of confidential personnel information under prha regulations.in addition,defendants allege,and does not deny,that he refused to recognize the appointment of santiago as his direct supervisor,which defendants characterize as insubordination.like the district court,we find that,given the seriousness of violations of prha regulations,defendants easily meet their burden of showing,by a preponderance of the evidence,that would have been dismissed regardless of his political affiliation.see larou,at.once made the misstep of claiming physical possession of confidential personnel records,it is difficult to see how a supervisor in fagundo position could have done anything less than order an investigation,potentially resulting in the employee dismissal.
nevertheless,at this point,the plaintiff s may discredit the proffered nondiscriminatory reason,either circumstantially or directly,by adducing evidence that discrimination was more likely than not a motivating factor.guillermo rodríguez,cir.appellants efforts in this regard fail to convince us that discrimination was more likely than not a motivating factor in dismissal.appellants offer nothing to directly undermine the credibility of the proffered nondiscriminatory reasons for dismissal.their only attack on the substance of these allegations is the contention that when said he had in his power a list of the se employees with their salaries and fringe benefits,he meant only that he had a copy of the office telephone book,from which he could deduce his female employees salaries.even accepting explanation,we find that the explanation is so implausible that it should not have caused any doubt in the minds of the prha officials considering his termination.having been told by himself,when he thought it suited his interest,that he possessed a list of salaries and fringe benefits of the organization female employees,we do not see why his employers should believe later explanation that he had meant only that he had made such a list himself by guessing at salary and benefits from the office phonebook,especially in light of his earlier use of portions of phillip confidential information.thus,although on summary judgment we assume explanation to be genuine,it does not undermine defendants proffered nondiscriminatory basis.
in their brief,appellants contend that defendants proffered reasons for dismissal were nothing but an excuse to justify the real reason,which was politically motivated.however,they offer only meager evidence to support that contention.appellants allege that fagundo once asked when he was leaving his position,since a new administration had taken office.however,they do not offer any evidence that this incident was anything more than a mistake as to status as a career employee.nor do they assert that there was any conversation or point to other indicia of animus toward on the part of fagundo.appellants also state that phillip suggested that should resign and leave his post to a pdp employee,and that díaz suggested that change his party affiliation to the pdp.this type of evidence can serve to show that the proffered nondiscriminatory basis for an employee dismissal was only pretext.however,given the gravity of the charges against,and the fact that they are based on his own admissions that he possessed confidential personnel information,this evidence fails to demonstrate that political discrimination was more likely than not a motivating factor in his dismissal.
appellants arguments that the charges against were also fail to convince us that defendants reasons for dismissal were mere pretext,particularly as they do not reach the primary charge of personnel file misuse.appellants only remaining arguments address irregular procedures followed in the course of his dismissal.however,these arguments do not relate to the grounds for dismissal.we consider these arguments in our discussion of his due process claims.
due process claims 
appellants additionally claim that dismissal violated his procedural due process rights.there is no dispute between the parties that was a career employee,and as such was entitled to notice and a meaningful opportunity to respond prior to termination,cir quotations omitted.before a career employee is discharged,he is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him,an explanation of the employer evidence,and an opportunity to present his side of the story.cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d.to require more than this prior to termination would intrude to an unwarranted extent on the government interest in quickly removing an unsatisfactory employee.id.
the process leading up to termination began with fagundo january,letter in response to september,letter arguing for a salary increase and alleging gender bias in favor of female employees.in addition to responding to his request and allegations,the letter informed that he was under investigation for possible violation of prha regulations,because he had used confidential personnel documents for personal benefit that fagundo intended to file charges against him that could result in the termination of his employment that he had the right to a hearing and that an informal hearing would take place on january,in the office of the legal counsel library,where he could present his version of the facts and show cause as to why disciplinary measures should not be instituted against him on january,responded with a letter in which he answered a number of the allegations against him and requested more information about others.he also requested that the informal hearing scheduled for january be continued to a later date.no one in the prha administration responded to this letter,and on january,addressed a note to fagundo asserting that the january letter did not state the time of the hearing,and t hus,he was handing in these documents as evidence of his appearance in writing to the informal hearing.did not attend the january informal hearing,and on february,executive director fagundo sent a letter officially discharging from his position.
appellants claims that this procedure was constitutionally deficient in a number of ways.first,appellants seem to claim that was not provided sufficient notice of the facts underlying the allegations for which he might be dismissed.after a thorough review of the record,we find that appellants overstate this claim.at the outset,we note that the principal allegations against related to his use of confidential personnel documents,which,in one instance,he appended to a memorandum regarding defendant phillip and,in the other,he stated he possessed in his letter of september.these facts underlying the violation of the prha disciplinary measures handbook infraction only infraction that defendants claim allows for termination after a single clearly laid out in fagundo january letter.although we
