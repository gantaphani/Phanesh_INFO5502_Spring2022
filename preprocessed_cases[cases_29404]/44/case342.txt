robur otero carrasquillo brought an action in the puerto rico district court against his former employer,pharmacia corporation his former supervisor,zaida sanabria,and unnamed administrators and fiduciaries of pharmacia separation benefits plan.at its core,the complaint alleges that pharmacia violated the employee retirement income security act erisa,et,and article of the puerto rico civil code by improperly denying otero severance benefits after he left his employment with the company.the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment,but assessed civil penalties against pharmacia for failing to comply with erisa reporting and disclosure provision.we affirm.
otero worked as a research associate for pharmacia at its arecibo,puerto rico,fermentation plant from the late until november.he was responsible for the fermentation of antibiotics.in february,pharmacia notified its employees that,effective june,the arecibo plant would close,and the fermentation process would be relocated to an affiliate facility in kalamazoo,michigan because this relocation would result in the elimination of all jobs at the arecibo plant,pharmacia presented adversely affected employees with two options apply,between april and december,for the company separation package plan plan,a supplement to worker unemployment benefits,or continue to work for the company in a different position.in the interim,regardless of election,employees would remain active in their current positions until their services were no longer needed or the arecibo plant closed.at that time,those who had elected to remain with the company would be transferred to their newly assigned positions.for those who had elected to receive the separation benefits,the company would initiate an administrative process,designated the windows exit program,that would provide employees with days to complete the necessary plan paperwork.
during his last months at pharmacia,otero was upset by several events that transpired at the plant.he alleges that andres lugo,the plant supervisor,incorrectly informed otero that he could not apply for plan benefits until the last fermentation of antibiotics had been completed,thereby inducing him to wait while other plant employees received job transfers or applied for separation benefits.otero repeated inquiries regarding his employment prospects were ignored or treated in a cursory manner.receiving no prospective offers of employment,otero eventually applied for various vacant positions with pharmacia remaining puerto rico branches,but these slots were given to more experienced applicants.otero difficulties were exacerbated in march,when defendant sanabria replaced lugo as the plant supervisor.she was more critical of otero work than his previous supervisors,and gave him only an average employee review,well below the excellent reviews he had customarily received.finally,in august,pharmacia offered otero a position as a microbiologist.although pharmacia considered it a lateral transfer,otero perceived it as a demotion.
on november,otero declined the microbiologist position and requested separation benefits.linda diaz,pharmacia senior director of human resources,immediately contacted the plan administrator,who stated that otero was no longer eligible to receive separation benefits.although the plan provided that terminated employees are generally eligible to receive such benefits,an exception existed for employees whose employment was discontinued due to a transfer to an affiliated business,and who had been offered a comparable position within the company.because pharmacia interpreted the relocation of the fermentation process from arecibo to kalamazoo as a transfer to an affiliated business,and otero had been offered what it considered a comparable position,the plan administrator determined that otero was not eligible to receive benefits 
immediately following the administrator decision,otero sought to personally deliver a letter to pharmacia human resources manager,carmen calcano,to further inquire about his plan eligibility and the basis for his denial.as he waited in calcano office,otero suffered an emotional breakdown,collapsed to the floor,and injured his back.because otero required surgery and various other treatments for physical and psychological ailments,otero qualified for the company disability program under which he received of his salary,and ultimately,for the disability program under which he received upwards of of his annual salary.
on july,otero sent a letter to pharmacia requesting information on a serious health condition provision in the disability plan,under which an injured employee could receive up to of his annual salary.receiving no response,otero sent several additional letters requesting information and copies of the disability plan.on august,days after his initial inquiry,pharmacia responded with the requested materials.included was a copy of the summary of material modifications,a document previously circulated to all pharmacia employees in that outlined all the changes that had been made to the disability plan.the form explained that the serious health condition provision had been excised from the plan.unsatisfied,otero continued to send letters requesting information on the serious health condition provision,to which pharmacia consistently replied that all requests had been adequately fulfilled by its august response.
in july,otero filed suit against pharmacia,sanabria,and unnamed plan administrators and fiduciaries,claiming that pharmacia denial of benefits violated erisa,that pharmacia failure to produce plan documents within the time period designated by erisa reporting and disclosure provision warranted the imposition of civil penalties,and that the actions of lugo,sanabria and others amounted to intentional infliction of emotional distress and fraudulent inducement under commonwealth law.the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment,concluding that pharmacia decision was not arbitrary and capricious and that otero supplemental commonwealth law claims were preempted by erisa.the court,however,found that pharmacia had violated erisa reporting and disclosure provision,and accordingly ordered pharmacia to pay otero in civil penalties otero now appeals.
on appeal,otero claims that pharmacia denial of his request for separation benefits was arbitrary and capricious,his supplemental state law claims are not preempted by erisa,and the district court incorrectly calculated the civil penalties against pharmacia.

we begin with otero challenge to pharmacia denial of plan benefits.it is undisputed that because the plan reserved interpretative discretion to its administrators judicial review of pharmacia eligibility determination is limited to ascertaining whether the administrator decision was arbitrary or capricious.leahy raytheon,cir.thus,while we review summary judgment decisions de novo,pfizer,cir,where,as here,the underlying decision is subject to arbitrary and capricious review,we evaluate the district court determination by asking whether the aggregate evidence,viewed in a light most favorable to the party,could support a rational determination that the plan administrator acted arbitrarily in denying a claim for benefits,leahy,at.in other words,the question here is whether the district court correctly concluded that pharmacia interpretation of the plan language,and its ultimate benefits determination based upon that interpretation,were reasonable.liston unum.officer severance plan,cir.
pharmacia had determined that,because otero research associate position had been eliminated due to a transfer of the job to an affiliated business,and because otero was offered a comparable position as a microbiologist,he was not eligible to receive separation benefits.otero argues that,according to the plan,an employee whose job elimination results from a transfer to an affiliated business is only ineligible to receive benefits when the transfer is a product of the total or partial sale of the company.the eligibility provision that otero cites provides,in relevant part,that
