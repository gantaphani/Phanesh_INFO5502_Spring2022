defendants metropolitan property and casualty insurance company et collectively metropolitan appeal from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york following a bench trial before naomi reice buchwald,judge,awarding plaintiffs faith campbell campbell and her children jazmin,alteasha,and clarence collectively the children or campbell children on a policy of insurance covering bodily injury,plus prejudgment interest.the district court found that the campbell children suffered injuries from exposure to lead paint during the policy period september,to september.on appeal,metropolitan contends that the district court erred in admitting expert testimony proffered by plaintiffs as to the time of onset of the children injuries,and in awarding prejudgment interest.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court finding of liability and reverse the award of prejudgment interest.
background 
most of the facts have been stipulated by the parties.the dispute centers on the timing of injuries suffered by the campbell children.
a.the insurance policies and the campbells apartment 
from january to march,campbell and her children lived in a bronx,new york apartment in a building owned by kormal and tajwattie singh collectively singh.in january,the children were tested for lead poisoning and were found to have lead levels in their blood ranging from to micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood.later blood tests showed that the children blood lead levels had risen and ranged from to micrograms per deciliter.under the new york city health code,a blood lead level of micrograms per deciliter or higher is classified as lead poisoning.health code,tit.see also centers for disease control,preventing lead poisoning in children october epidemiologic studies have identified harmful effects of lead in children at blood lead levels as low as.campbell brought an action against singh in state court,alleging that her apartment contained cracked,chipped,and peeling paint,and that exposure to it had caused the children injuries,including brain damage,attention deficit disorder,developmental delay,decreases in iq,and lead intoxication.
with respect to the period in which the campbells lived in that apartment,metropolitan issued liability insurance policies covering singh building for the periods september,to september,first policy period or period one,september,to september,second policy period or period two,and september,to september,third policy period or period three.in the policies,metropolitan agreed to pay all sums for bodily injury and property damage to others for which the law holds singh responsible because of any occurrence.this includes prejudgment interest awarded against singh.emphasis omitted.the policies defined occurrence to include continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions,resulting in bodily injury during the term of the policy emphasis omitted bodily injury was defined to mean any bodily harm,sickness or disease.each policy provided a maximum of in coverage.
campbell action against singh was settled pursuant to a stipulation dated april,the stipulation,entered into by campbell,singh,and metropolitan.the stipulation recited,inter alia,that during each of the three policy periods the campbell children were exposed to lead based paint stipulation,and metropolitan agreed to pay campbell the full policy liability limit of for the second policy period,september,to september.the parties agreed that the action against singh would be discontinued,that campbell would bring a declaratory judgment action against metropolitan with respect to the first and third policy periods,and that metropolitan would pay plaintiffs the maximum policy amount for any period within which the court finally determined,after all appeals were concluded,that bodily injury had occurred.
b.the present action 
following the execution of the stipulation,campbell commenced the present diversity action,seeking a declaratory judgment that metropolitan was liable for coverage of injuries to plaintiffs in periods one and three.metropolitan eventually conceded liability with respect to period three and agreed to pay the full limit of that policy.accordingly,the only issue for trial was whether the campbell children had suffered bodily injury during the first policy period,september,to september.in light of the stipulated facts,the district court noted that the issue to be decided was quite narrow 
because of the stipulation between the parties,the only issue presented was whether the plaintiffs sustained a bodily injury during the first policy period.it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to establish permanent injury or to adduce evidence of the magnitude of the injury sustained.furthermore,as a matter of law,injury is not commensurate with external manifestation.thus,it was not necessary for infant plaintiffs to have exhibited external symptoms of lead poisoning so long as plaintiffs established that they sustained a bodily injury.
opinion and order dated march,posttrial opinion,at footnote omitted.notwithstanding the stipulation that during each of the three policy periods the children were exposed to lead based paint stipulation,metropolitan argued that there was no injury during the first policy period because plaintiffs could not show that the children sustained an adverse effect on the bone marrow where the red blood cell is formed heme biosynthesis or any other cellular or subcellular injury during the first policy period.posttrial opinion at quoting metropolitan proposed conclusions of law.
at trial,plaintiffs introduced,inter alia,new york city department of health health department records showing that on february,and july,the campbells apartment had contained paint in numerous locations.the lead level was so high as to constitute a nuisance,and the health department had ordered its abatement.
the only witnesses at trial were experts,two called by campbell and one called by metropolitan.campbell called john rosen,professor of pediatrics and head of the division of environmental sciences at albert einstein college of medicine einstein environmental sciences division,whose area of expertise was treatment,diagnosis and research in childhood lead poisoning trial transcript,march,tr,at.rosen qualifications are discussed in greater detail in part.below.making reference to publications of the united states environmental protection agency epa and the agency of toxic substances and disease registry,rosen described the metabolic pathway by which lead enters a child bloodstream,invades bone marrow,and inhibits the production of heme,the building block of hemoglobin,which is the red substance which coats our red cells which all of us are dependent upon to provide oxygen to the tissues and also to remove waste products from the tissues tr.rosen testified that he had directly or indirectly supervised the treatment of more than children afflicted with lead poisoning,and that the overwhelming majority of them had ingested the lead from the environments in which they lived 
v ery,very small particles of paint get into household dust which can not be seen by the naked eye nor perhaps even with a regular microscope t hese small particles of lead in household dust are very efficiently absorbed by young children through normal hand to mouth activity.
p articles of this size and nature,which are the general cause of childhood lead poisoning,totally pervade a young child living environment 
tr.rosen had examined the campbell children and their medical records,as well as the health department report on the campbell apartment,and in his opinion the children had sustained,inter alia,interruption in the production of critical heme proteins during the period january,to september.in his opinion,such an interruption in heme production constitutes bodily harm he noted that t hat the way it defined in the biomedical literature as well as in federal documents tr.further,taking into account the january report of the children blood lead levels ranging from to,rosen opined that without question the children had sustained injuries to their red blood cells during the first policy period.he stated that,given the conditions of their apartment,it would be impossible for these children to have escaped ingesting small particles of lead from household dust.tr.avoidance of the lead 
would be totally impossible with normal hand to mouth activity and with the pervasiveness of small particles of lead in their entire living environment from a pot or a pan removed from a kitchen cabinet or a dish or spoon or a utensil or their clothes,their toys,their hair,their scalp,and so forth.
tr.rosen estimated that,given the level of lead contamination in the campbells apartment,the impairment of the children ability would have commenced approximately to days after entering such an environment.id.he testified that that opinion too was supported by the scientific literature.
campbell also called margit bleecker,director of the center for occupational and environmental neurology,whose area of research was clinical neurotoxicology,particularly on the matter of how lead exposure affects the nervous systems of adult subjects.bleecker endorsed rosen views.she testified that within days of the start of lead ingestion 
y ou would actually have heme inhibition as was shown by rosen this morning you would have inhibition of the enzyme and you would have inhibition of the hemoprotein occurring in the mitochondria.and that occurs at a very low level and it occurs very rapidly.
tr.she testified that her opinion,after reviewing the campbell children medical records,was that the children cognitive and behavioral deficits were caused by lead exposure and that heme damage had caused those deficits,because if you did have that initial insult to the heme biosynthesis you would not get all the multiorgan effects.tr.bleecker testified that,given the conditions of that apartment tr,the campbell children definitely would have had an injury on the heme synthesis during the first policy period tr.
metropolitan expert witness was abraham chutorian,chief of the division of pediatric neurology at cornell university teaching hospital,new york presbyterian.chutorian testified that he had examined the campbell children medical records and determined that they had been.however,based on the children lead levels,as well as on data questioning the extent to which low lead levels actually impair a child development and functioning,chutorian testified that he did not believe the children to have sustained neurological injury from their lead exposure.he stated that not everybody in an environment containing lead paint sustains lead intoxication,and even with substantial levels of lead in the blood,not everybody is damaged.tr.
chutorian acknowledged that he was an expert on the effect of lead on the brain but not an expert on lead poisoning generally.tr.i not an expert in the metabolism of lead except as it pertains to the effect on the brain.id.although chutorian testified that he had general knowledge of the significance of things like anemia and a general knowledge of the effect of lead on red blood cells and a general knowledge of red blood cell survival itself tr,it was g enerally true that he was not an expert in the effects of lead in the blood or on the red blood cells tr.
in its posttrial opinion,the district court found in favor of plaintiffs.it noted that all three experts had agreed that 
exposure to lead causes an impairment of the process of heme biosynthesis,a process that takes place at the onset of the creation of red blood cells and is critical to their formation.thus,this interference with the synthesis of heme results in an injury to red blood cells.
posttrial opinion at.the court noted that rosen and bleecker had testified that a impairment of the heme occurs within days of exposure to a lead paint environment.id.as to chutorian,who had opined that the children sustained no neurological injury from their lead exposure,the court noted that he had conceded that he is not an expert in lead poisoning or in the metabolism of lead,and has not treated children for lead poisoning unless they suffered from brain injuries,id.the court also noted that chutorian was not even asked about the mechanism of ingestion of lead in an apartment like that occupied by the infant plaintiffs.id.at.
having heard the testimony that impairment of a child ability begins some days after exposure to significant levels of lead,the court remarked during trial that the campbell children could have suffered bodily injury within the meaning of the insurance policies as early as days after moving into the apartment,and that the first policy period did not end for another eight months.see tr.you have got eight months divided by periods of ten days for the heme system to have been affected during the first policy period.in making its findings of fact,the court also noted that the health department records 
show ed that on february,and on july,the apartment contained paint in numerous locations,as well as orders to abate the nuisance.also,faith campbell,the infants mother,testified at deposition that she first noticed chipping pain t in the apartment in april.as there was no evidence that the lead paint was applied to the apartment during the second policy period,the conclusion that the lead condition documented by the health authorities existed during the first policy period is a reasonable one.
posttrial opinion at the court concluded that plaintiffs ha d met their burden of establishing bodily injury during the first policy period.id.at.
judgment was entered ordering metropolitan to pay the full of coverage provided by the period one insurance policy.the judgment also ordered metropolitan to pay prejudgment interest on the period one and period three policies from april,the date of the stipulation,to march,the date of the posttrial opinion.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,metropolitan argues principally that rosen testimony should have been inadmissible pursuant to daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d principles metropolitan brief on appeal at,and that the court erred in awarding prejudgment interest because,under new york law,such interest is not available in an action that essentially seeks to recover for a tort.we find merit in the second contention,but not the first.
admissibility of the expert testimony proffered by plaintiff 
metropolitan argues that under daubert,the court should have excluded rosen opinions as lacking a scientific basis metropolitan brief on appeal at and manifestly unreliable id.at.although stating that it is undisputed that rosen is one of the preeminent experts in his field and has vast credentials id.at,metropolitan suggest s that the theory advanced by rosen in order to prove the plaintiffs case is not adequately based on prevailing methods of assessing lead poisoning id.at.we disagree.
the admissibility of expert scientific testimony is governed by the federal rules of evidence.rule provides that 
i f scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education,may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.
see daubert,at.the determination of whether scientific testimony will assist the factfinder entails a preliminary assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.id.at.thus,in assessing admissibility,the trial court must determine whether the proffered expert testimony is relevant,whether it ha s any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.see daubert,at,and whether the proffered testimony has a sufficiently reliable foundation to permit it to be considered,id.at.pertinent evidence based on scientifically valid principles will satisfy those demands.id.
the supreme court in daubert stated that the considerations informing the trial court as
