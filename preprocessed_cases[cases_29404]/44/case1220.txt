opinion of the court 
we deal with a deceptively simple issue which filing date applies for statute of limitations purposes when a federal district court transfers venue to another district under a here,a federal district court in new jersey with diversity jurisdiction transferred a personal injury claim filed within the limitations statutes of both new jersey and pennsylvania to another federal district court in pennsylvania because the new jersey district was an improper venue.the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania held that recovery was barred because the transfer occurred after the running of pennsylvania statute of limitations.lafferty riel,d.
that response in this uncertain area is,but we disagree.even though the suit was filed in an improper transferor forum in new jersey,it was timely here because it was filed within the limitations statute for the transferee forum in pennsylvania,as the filing date for a case transferred under a is that of the initial filing in the improper forum.
factual background 
on july,gito riel,who was driving a delivery truck for achenbach pastries together,defendants,was in an automobile accident in pennsylvania with debra lafferty.almost two years later july,lafferty filed a personal injury claim and her husband filed a loss of consortium claim as well in the united states district court for the district of new jersey.as riel and achenbach pastries were citizens of pennsylvania,and the laffertys citizens of new jersey,federal diversity jurisdiction existed under they asserted venue under a sixteen days later july,the new jersey district court transferred the action sua sponte,pursuant to a to the eastern district of pennsylvania,and the case was docketed there a few days later.two months later,defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,asserting that the laffertys action was by pennsylvania statute of limitations for personal injury claims.
the eastern district of pennsylvania court determined that the doctrine of erie tompkins,requires courts to apply the substantive law,including conflicts of laws rules and statute s of limitations,of the state where the district court sits,in this case,the law of pennsylvania whenever venue was improper.lafferty,d at citations omitted.the court noted that pennsylvania statute of limitations for personal injury actions is two years.ann.it further noted that this case was barred because it did not fall under exceptions to the state limitations period.ann.a,b.it therefore concluded that the laffertys action was untimely because the case was transferred ten days after the pennsylvania statute of limitations had the date of the transfer to the eastern district of pennsylvania july,rather than the date of the initial filing in the district of new jersey july,as the filing date.finally,the court observed that the laffertys could have filed a protective action in a pennsylvania commonwealth court or one of the federal district courts sitting in pennsylvania to avoid the possibility that the statute of limitations would bar an action in situations not exempted by pennsylvania limitations law lafferty,d at.concluding that the laffertys had not availed themselves of the means for bringing a timely claim or otherwise preserving it,the court granted defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings.
the laffertys appeal to us,arguing that they complied with both new jersey and pennsylvania statutes of limitations by filing a complaint within two years of the accident.they also point out that the new jersey district court simply transferred the matter rather than dismissing it.thus,they argue,the statute of purposes of determining timeliness under pennsylvania run from the time the case was first filed 
ii.discussion 
as the district court noted,a federal court must apply the substantive laws of its forum state in diversity actions.erie,at,and these include state statutes of limitations,guaranty trust york.see also dixon ticonderoga estate of,cir.also correct is the observation that erie and its progeny are grounded on the notion that actions in a state court and a federal court involving the same transaction or accident should not lead to a substantially different result.lafferty,d at citing ferens john deere,d see also guaranty trust,at.same.for this case the issue is not so much whose statute of limitations applies both are the same two years.it is whether the complaint,which was timely but in an improper forum,may be heard when the case is than a proper venue where the action would have been timely if filed there initially 
venue transfers under a a 
the two provisions governing venue transfers at issue here read,in relevant part,as follows 
venue change of venue 
a for the convenience of parties and witnesses,in the interest of justice,a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought.
venue cure or waiver of defects 
a the district court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss,or if it be in the interest of justice,transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.
distinctions between a and a have to do with discretion,jurisdiction,and choice of law.section a transfers are discretionary determinations made for the convenience of the parties and presuppose that the court has jurisdiction and that the case has been brought in the correct forum.jumara state farm ins,cir moore federal practice,matthew bender ed.faced with a question,federal courts in the district to which the case has been transferred under a must apply the law of the transferor state.see van dusen barrack,d for a transfers ferens,at.extending the van dusen rule to all a transfers,whether initiated by plaintiff or defendant.
section a comes into play where plaintiffs file suit in an improper forum.jumara,at moore federal practice,supra.in those instances,district courts are required either to dismiss or transfer to a proper forum.goldlawr,heiman,d emphasizing that federal district courts may than that plaintiffs initially brought in an improper forum,regardless whether they otherwise have personal jurisdiction.when cases have been dismissed for improper venue,plaintiffs in those cases must file anew in a proper forum.see moore federal practice,supra.no doubt the filing date in the new forum governs for limitations purposes.when cases have been transferred for improper venue,transferee courts generally apply the substantive law they would have applied had the action been brought there initially.see moore federal practice,supra,c,citing cases charles wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice procedure jurisdiction at west same.however,there is a question whether a transferee court should count the date of transfer as the date of initial filing under its forum statute of limitations to bar a claim merely because that statute has run by the time of the transfer.
b.the district court analysis 
the district court rejection of the laffertys claims turns on its analysis of a and a 
we acknowledge that one of the salutary purposes of a is to permit a transfer to overcome the bar of the statute of limitations that might otherwise result if an action is dismissed by a federal court for improper venue or lack of personal jurisdiction.goldlawr,at,d.it clearly serves this intended purpose where federal questions are involved.it also does so in diversity cases when the statute of limitations of the state in which the transferee court sits has not expired or the transferee state has an appropriate savings provision in its law.nonetheless,unlike a transfer under a,a transfer under a is not merely a change in courtrooms where the action can be properly filed and tried in either place we see no reason why a should not be characterized as a housekeeping measure,as was a by the supreme court,but it does not follow that erie requires the application of the law of the transferor court when it is the wrong,as opposed to an inconvenient,forum.indeed,in our view,erie requires the opposite,that is,that when a transfer occurs pursuant to a the law of the transferee forum should be applied.
lafferty,d at emphasis in original.from this,the court concluded that the laffertys action was untimely under pennsylvania law because they filed an action in an incorrect forum the district of new jersey and,applying the laws of the transferee court,the pennsylvania statute was not tolled pending the transfer of that action under a and they failed to complete service of process according to pennsylvania procedural rules.
the first basis of the court the tolling of the limitations statute for a venue transfer under a is the threshold matter that determines the outcome of this case.here,the court distinguished between the venue transfer statutes by presuming that the impropriety of filing an action in an incorrect forum is a prejudicial factor that bars transferee courts from hearing claims when a transfers are not completed within the transferee state statute of limitations and according to that state filing procedures.
we doubt this focus on impropriety as a prejudicial bar.many courts have noted that the only relevant distinction between the statutes is simply which of the two principal transfer statutes a and a is appropriate for transfers the former is appropriate when venue is proper and the latter should be used when venue is improper.john currivan,choice of law in federal court after transfer of venue,cornell,citing cases.but many other courts,like the district court here,have blurred this distinction,by finding that the improper filing prejudices a party when the case is transferred these courts fail to distinguish between the effects of transfers as opposed to dismissals.
supreme court and courts of appeals precedent 
the goldlawr court distinguished between transfers and dismissals under a.
the problem which gave rise to the enactment of a was that of avoiding the injustice which had often resulted to plaintiffs from dismissal of their actions merely because they had made an erroneous guess with regard to the existence of some elusive fact of the kind upon which venue provisions often turn d ismissal here would have resulted in plaintiff losing a substantial part of its cause of action under the statute of limitations merely because it made a mistake in thinking that the respondent corporations could be found or that they transact business in the eastern district of pennsylvania 
the language of a is amply broad enough to authorize the transfer of cases,however wrong the plaintiff may have been in filing his case as to venue if by reason of the uncertainties of proper venue a mistake is made,congress,by enactment of a,recognized that the interest of justice may require that the complaint not be dismissed but rather that it be transferred in order that the plaintiff not be penalized by and technicalities.
at.emphasis added,citations omitted goldlawr discussion of a acknowledges that dismissals will bar actions that are not refiled in the proper forum within the forum state statute of limitations.by contrast,transfers,in the interest of justice,remov e whatever obstacles that may impede an expeditious and orderly adjudication of cases and controversies on their merits.id.at.quoting a 
goldlawr establishes the following the a transfer provision is designed to preserve claims that rigid application of dismissal rules may bar a transfers do not require that prejudice should result from filing an action in an improper forum if the initial filing was made in good faith and the filing itself of a lawsuit,even in an improper forum,shows the proper diligence on the part of the plaintiff which such statutes of limitation were intended to insure,and toll s whatever statutes of limitation would otherwise apply.at.
we affirmed these goldlawr principles in carteret sav.bank,shushan when we noted that section a is read broadly so that a plaintiff properly laying venue but unable to proceed in the transferor court because of jurisdictional problems does not lose its day in court by reason of the running of the statute of limitations in another forum,cir.but the question presented in shushan was different than the one here,for there we considered whether a district court could transfer under a over a plaintiff objection an action where venue was proper.we concluded that it could not because,even though we read a broadly,we do not allow courts to force transfers in the interest of justice where venue is otherwise proper.id.at.relevant to the question before us today is that shushan acknowledged that,were the a transfer permissible,the plaintiff would not have los t its day in court by reason of the running of the statute of limitations in another forum.id.at.
prior to shushan,in united states berkowitz,cir,we recognized implicitly a distinction between transfers and dismissals under a and a.in berkowitz,the government filed in the eastern district of pennsylvania where it alleged the tax liability arose a civil action against morton berkowitz to recover back taxes.id.at.he filed a motion to dismiss the action on the ground that the eastern district of pennsylvania court had no personal jurisdiction,as he had abandoned his pennsylvania residence and become a new york citizen by the time the action was filed.id.because the new york limitations period had expired by this time,the government requested that the eastern district of pennsylvania court transfer the action to the eastern district of new york rather than dismiss it.id.concluding that it was without power to transfer under a because it had not acquired personal jurisdiction over berkowitz,and that it could not transfer under a because venue was proper as the tax liability arose in pennsylvania,the eastern district of pennsylvania court denied the transfer request and dismissed the action.id.we reversed,holding that a a transfer was available even though there was no personal jurisdiction.our decision was an extension of the goldlawr rule,which allowed venue transfers under a in the absence of jurisdiction,to a transfers.id.at.in doing so,we acknowledged the difference between transfers and dismissals noted in goldlawr.
in young clantech,we also recognized an implicit distinction between dismissals and transfers.cir.we addressed the timeliness of a wrongful death action brought against a new jersey company on behalf of james young,who was killed in an industrial accident in canada in august.his wife filed suit in a michigan state court in august,two weeks shy of the limitations statute.the michigan state court dismissed the action for lack of personal jurisdiction,and the wife refiled in federal court the district of washington in august,almost a year after the michigan dismissal and far outside the limitations window.the district of washington court transferred the action to the district of new jersey immediately because it lacked personal jurisdiction and also because of forum non conveniens approximately two years later,in may,the new jersey district court dismissed the case as untimely.we affirmed,holding that the timely filing of a case against a defendant in a court which did not have jurisdiction over the action tolled the transferee court statute of limitations only if the court in which the case was originally filed had authority to transfer the case to the proper court.id.at.because the michigan state court in which the case initially was filed dismissed,rather than transferred,the action,there was no equitable tolling.id.moreover,although the federal court in which the case was filed following the dismissal the district court of washington transferred the action to a third court the district court of new jersey,the action had been refiled almost a year outside of new jersey statute of limitations and therefore was untimely.in implying that it would have permitted the use of a transfer to overcome potential timeliness bars in the transferee state had the washington action been timely filed in the transferor state which did not occur because the action in the michigan state court was dismissed,the young court reasoning appears to follow our recognition in berkowitz of the difference between transfers and dismissals set out in goldlawr.
our sister courts of appeals have split on the general question of how to treat limitations issues in cases transferred under a.the eighth circuit court of appeals applies the limitations statute of the transferor court in such a transfer.mayo clinic kaiser,cir under goldlawr,the purpose for making transfers would be obliterated in many cases if the statute of limitations of the transferee forum were applied at the date of transfer,and that if such were the rule there would be little purpose in transferring the case instead of dismissing it.the fourth,seventh,and eleventh circuit courts apply the limitations statute of the transferee court,viewing the date of the transfer as the initial filing date for limitations calculations.see lavay dominion fed.sav.loan ass n,cir to avoid geehan monahan,cir upon agreement of counsel for both sides manley engram,cir regardless which party requested transfer.
the other courts of appeals that have considered this second,fifth,and sixth to have once applied the laws of the transferor forum,but their latest decisions require courts to apply the transferee forum rules,without specific reference to the calculation of a limitations statute upon a transfer.in the second circuit,compare schaeffer village of ossining,cir following a a transfer,the transferee court should apply whatever law it would have applied had the action been properly commenced there.citations omitted,with corke sameiet song of norway,cir dismissal and refiling would bar the action with great prejudice to the plaintiffs.in the fifth circuit,compare jackson west telemarketing.outbound,cir f ollowing a section a transfer,the transferee court must apply the choice of law rules of the state in which it sits.quoting ellis great southwestern,cir,with dubin united states,cir action filed in improper forum and subsequently transferred to proper venue under a was timely even though the statute of limitations in the transferee forum had expired.in the sixth circuit,compare flynn greg anthony constr,cir a s a general rule the law of the transferee court applies after a transfer,with taylor love,cir affirming the validity and timeliness of filing suit in the improper forum and then transferring it to a proper forum,even if the suit was filed initially just to stop the running of the statute of limitations in the transferee forum.
to repeat,the question before us does not necessarily turn on whether the laws of the transferor or transferee forum apply,as the ordinary rule is that,following transfers,the transferee forum substantive laws apply.see supra,at citing moore federal practice,supra,charles wright,arthur miller edward cooper,supra,at.instead,we address which date should be considered the filing date for purposes of limitations calculations the date of initial filing in the transferor forum or the date of transfer to or docketing in the transferee forum.in our view,the sounder interpretation is that the transferee forum limitations statute applies and the date of the initial filing in the improper forum counts as the date of the filing in the transferee forum for limitations purposes when the case is transferred rather than dismissed under a.thus,the initial complaint filed here within the transferee forum limitations period is timely.this interpretation accords with the supreme court treatment of a transfers in goldlawr,as well as its discussions of other transfers in van dusen,ferens,and sinochem.it also accords with our court decision in shushan,which mentioned the statute of limitations issue,as well as our decisions in berkowitz and young,which touched on the difference between dismissals and transfers.
this interpretation finds additional support in the common canon of statutory construction that similar statutes are to be construed similarly also known by its latin label of in pari materia.see,wachovia bank schmidt,d u nder the in pari materia canon,statutes addressing the same subject matter generally should be read as if they were one law.citations omitted cook wikler,cir applying the in pari materia canon in this regard,our interpretation today parallels the treatment of transfers pursuant to transfer to cure want of jurisdiction,which states as follows 
whenever a civil action is filed in a court or an appeal,including a petition for review of administrative action,is noticed for or filed with such a court and that court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction,the court shall,if it is in the interest of justice,transfer such action or appeal to any other such court in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed,and the action or appeal shall proceed as if it had been filed in or noticed for the court to which it is transferred on the date upon which it was actually filed in or noticed for the court from which it is transferred.
emphases added see nelson int l paint,cir for cases transferred for lack of jurisdiction in the transferor court after october,provides that the action shall proceed as if it had been filed in the court to which it is transferred footnote omitted.
accordingly,we conclude that filing a complaint otherwise proper in a wrong division or district does not make the complaint disappear,only to appear anew when it is transferred to a proper forum when a judge elects to transfer rather than dismiss a case filed in an improper forum,he elects to allow parties to preserve their claim in the interest of justice.thus,when cases,timely filed in an improper forum within the limitations periods of the transferor and transferee forums,are transferred rather than dismissed pursuant to a,the date of filing is the initial filing date in the transferor forum,even if the case is not docketed in the new forum until after the limitations period there has run.
in arriving at a contrary conclusion,the district court pointed to our statement in overfield pennroad that i f the action is barred by a pennsylvania statute of limitations,no action can be maintained in pennsylvania even though the action is not barred elsewhere.lafferty,d at quoting overfield pennroad,cir.overfield,however,did not involve a a transfer.moreover,it was decided before the supreme court clarified the distinction between transfers and dismissals under a in goldlawr.
the district court also relied on our statement in weaver marine bank that in the context of diversity jurisdiction,a state statute that bars a person from utilizing a state court likewise precludes suit in the federal court,cir,rev on other grounds,d.the case involved a state enabling statute by which federal courts transferred claims to state courts.id.at the question presented is whether the district court,once having acquired jurisdiction,can transfer the matter to a state court by virtue of a state enabling statute.we are persuaded that it can.where parties improperly filed in federal courts,weaver required those courts to transfer claims to state courts rather than dismiss them.at.contrary to the district court conclusion here,weaver did not condition the transfer requirement on an initial filing according to pennsylvania rules.lafferty,d at t he statute of limitations for an action governed by pennsylvania law is not tolled until it is commenced,that is,filed under those rules.moreover,it is not controlling because the issue here is not a transfer via a state enabling statute but a transfer via a.
finally,the district court reasoned that pennsylvania law.ann.a,b,bars this claim because this action was not commenced,that is filed,within the relevant limitations period in a pennsylvania state court or in a federal court for a district embracing any part of the commonwealth.d at.however,does not apply to this claim because it governs transfers from state and federal courts sitting within the commonwealth,not transfers from courts sitting outside the commonwealth.subsection a requires state courts to treat cases transferred from other state courts as if originally filed in the transferee court on the date when first filed in the other tribunal,the transferor state court.subsection b applies the previous provision to federal courts wit
