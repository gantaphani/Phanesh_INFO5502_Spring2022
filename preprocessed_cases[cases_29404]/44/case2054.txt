this suit arises from the sinking of two barges in the mississippi river and the loss of slabs of steel aboard those barges.the primary issues in this appeal relate to arguments between two of the lost steel cargo over the amount of the loss each should bear.defendant insurer unione mediterranea di sicurta ums also challenges personal jurisdiction and venue.issues are also presented challenging the propriety of the district court order permitting the insurers to recover in their subrogation action against steel ak steel for converting the salvaged steel.we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand this case to the district court.
the facts of this case have been set out in detail in the opinion from the earlier appeal to this court,adams unione mediterranea di sicurta,cir adams i.the background facts will be summarized here to the extent necessary to understand the issues in the present appeal.
on october,while en route from new orleans to cincinnati,two canal barge company barges carrying slabs of steel cargo broke away from their flotilla and sank in the mississippi river.the loss occurred during the final leg of a carriage of steel slabs that began in italy.the owner of the steel slabs was duferco sa duferco,a swiss company,which had agreed to ship the steel to ak steel,an ohio company.plaintiff underwriters steven henry adams et.adams and ums,an italian insurer,concurrently insured the steel cargo under separate marine cargo policies.adams insured the steel through a cargo policy originally issued to canal barge,with duferco named as an additional insured.duferco was separately insured under an open cargo policy issued by ums.the adams policy carried a policy limit of million the ums policy carried a limit of million per shipment.the value of the cargo was.duferco and adams ultimately agreed that the value of the lost steel was.
once the two barges sank,duferco filed a claim with ums for the loss.after attempts by ums and duferco to salvage the sunken cargo failed,ums denied duferco claim.duferco then pursued its claim against adams and abandoned the sunken cargo to the london underwriter.meanwhile a professional salvage company,american eagle marine,american eagle attempted to salvage the lost cargo believing it to have been abandoned in its entirety.american eagle successfully salvaged of the sunken steel slabs and sold them to ak steel for a net profit of.
plaintiff adams initially brought this action in june seeking a declaratory judgment identifying whom it should pay for the loss of the cargo under their cargo policy with canal barge that ums was obligated under its open cargo policy with duferco to contribute to payment for the loss and that plaintiffs were obligated to pay only their proportionate share of the loss.plaintiffs named as defendants,among others,canal barge,ums,and duferco 
the district court held that plaintiffs could not recover in a contribution action against ums for any potential share of the losses without first fully compensating duferco for the loss.plaintiffs then paid duferco for the loss and obtained an assignment of whatever rights duferco had against ums and other potential tortfeasors.
plaintiffs later discovered a successful salvage of of the sunken steel slabs by american eagle and ak steel.adams demanded that american eagle and ak steel return the cargo or pay its value.when the two companies refused to do either plaintiffs amended their petition to assert a claim against ak steel and american eagle for the value of the converted steel.ums then against ak steel and american eagle for its share of the value of the steel 
ums filed pretrial motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper forum.the district court rejected ums motions.the district court granted adams motion for partial summary judgment regarding the apportionment of duferco loss between the two insurers,adams and ums.the court then proceeded with a bench trial.at the conclusion of the trial the district court denied ums coverage defenses and found that ums was required to contribute pro rata with adams for the loss according to their respective policy limits.the court then awarded adams of the approximately it had paid out to duferco.the district court further found that american eagle and ak steel had converted the steel and therefore awarded adams and ums of the in value that ak steel and american eagle realized from the salvaged steel after paying the cost of salvage.
ums appealed the district court judgment objecting to the rulings on personal jurisdiction and venue as well as the apportionment of liability between insurers.adams cross appealed arguing that ums was not entitled to an award from ak steel without having paid its portion of the duferco loss and that ums owed adams a portion of the attorney fees it paid to bring the case against ak steel and american eagle.ak steel appealed the district court judgment against it.this court addressed primarily the jurisdictional issues and remanded for further proceedings only on those issues.on remand the district court found sufficient contacts with louisiana to justify the exercise of jurisdiction and again entered a judgment.ums appealed.
in the current appeal ums challenges the district court rulings on jurisdiction,venue,and apportionment of the liability for duferco loss.adams again challenges the district court order granting ums a pro rata portion of the award against ak steel,and the refusal to award attorney fees.ak steel challenges the district court award of damages to ums,arguing that ums is unable to sue its additional insured,ak steel.we address these separate challenges in turn.
ums challenges first the district court finding that it has sufficient contacts with louisiana to support specific and general personal jurisdiction.ums argues that neither the coverage of this specific shipment of steel nor the coverage of prior shipments through louisiana provide the necessary minimum contacts to support personal jurisdiction.
the court reviews de novo the district court determination that its exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant is proper.nuovo pignone,spa storman asia,cir.when,as in the instant case,the district court decides the motion to dismiss without holding an evidentiary hearing,the plaintiff must make only a prima facie showing of the facts on which jurisdiction is predicated.id.in determining whether that prima facie case exists,we must accept as true the plaintiff uncontroverted allegations and resolve in his favor all conflicts between the jurisdictional facts contained in the parties affidavits and other documentation.id.quoting kelly syria shell petroleum dev,cir see also charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure,ed.
the district court found both specific and general personal jurisdiction in this case.see adams unione mediterranea di sicurta,d.the district court also suggested that jurisdiction might be available under.k.id.at.
rule k provides for service of process and personal jurisdiction in any district court for cases arising under federal law where the defendant has contacts with the united states as a whole sufficient to satisfy due process concerns and the defendant is not subject to jurisdiction in any particular state 
if the exercise of jurisdiction is consistent with the constitution and laws of the united states,serving a summons or filing a waiver of service is also effective,with respect to claims arising under federal law,to establish personal jurisdiction over the person of any defendant who is not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of general jurisdiction of any state.
k.the rule was enacted to fill an important gap in the jurisdiction of federal courts in cases arising under federal law 
thus,there was gap in the courts jurisdiction while a defendant may have sufficient contacts with the united states as a whole to satisfy due process concerns,if she had insufficient contacts with any single state,she would not be amenable to service by a federal court sitting in that state rule k was adopted in response to this problem of a gap in the courts jurisdiction 
world tanker carriers mv ya mawlaya,cir 
before examining ums contacts with the united states as a whole,we first consider the requirement of the last sentence of rule k that it only applies if the defendant is not subject to jurisdiction in any state.we agree with the seventh circuit,that a piecemeal analysis of the existence vel non of jurisdiction in all fifty states is not necessary.rather,so long as a defendant does not concede to jurisdiction in another state,a court may use k to confer jurisdiction.see,isi int l,borden ladner gervais llp,cir if the defendant contends that he can not be sued in the forum state and refuses to identify any other where suit is possible,then the federal court is entitled to use rule k.in this case ums contested the transfer of this case to new york where plaintiff believed jurisdiction existed,arguing that there was no personal jurisdiction in new york.see ums mem.in opp.to mot.to transfer,may,at.furthermore ums has generally challenged the existence of minimum contacts with the united states as a whole.see ums mem.supp.mot.to dismiss for lack of pers,june,at.because ums has not offered other venues in this country where personal jurisdiction would attach and argues that it can not be sued in the united states,the last sentence of k does not preclude application of this rule.
in applying rule k the court must determine whether the defendant has sufficient ties to the united states as a whole to satisfy constitutional due process concerns.see world tanker,at.the record demonstrates that ums has extensive contacts with the united states.
ums has paid claims to numerous companies,in all from to.the defendant insurer has covered numerous other companies which made no claims.ums has insured hundreds of shipments to the united states.specifically records produced by ums and duferco show that ums insured approximately shipments to the united states between and for duferco alone of these duferco shipments to the united states made between and were valued at over million.
moreover,ums used and paid a number of individuals in the united states as claims adjusters,surveyors,investigators and other representatives to enable it to conduct business in this country 
given the volume of activity,we have no difficulty concluding that ums has continuous and systematic contacts with the united states as a whole.see helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d volkswagen woodson,d.it was foreseeable that suit in courts would result from these business contacts.defendant was well aware of the shipments to the united states and in fact enabled the prosecution of claims in the united states by providing claims agents and surveyors here.see puerto rico ss zoe colocotroni,cir.thus,subjecting ums to suit here does not offend notions of fair play and substantial justice.
because we conclude that our exercise of jurisdiction is clearer and more straightforward under rule k than under louisiana law,we affirm the district court jurisdictional ruling on this alternate basis.see chiu plano.sch,cir this court may affirm on grounds other than those relied upon by the district court.
ums argues next that the district court erred in denying their motion to dismiss for improper venue.ums complains that the district court should have enforced the forum selection clause contained in the insurance contract between ums and duferco which provides as follows 
competent court 
article.the competent court,at the choice of the plaintiff party,is exclusively that of the legal authority of the place at which the insurer or the agency to which the policy has been allocated or at which the contract has been concluded,has its management.
in denying the motion to dismiss for lack of venue the district court held that adams claim against ums was a contribution action and not a subrogation action.as such adams did not stand in duferco shoes and would not be bound by the forum selection clause in the agreement to which adams was not a party 
if plaintiffs suit was based on its subrogation rights,plaintiffs would be bound by the forum selection clause.plaintiffs seek contribution from ums as a.the subrogation agreement obtained from duferco does not transform the nature of their claims against ums into subrogation claims rather the subrogation agreement folds into the contribution claim.
dist,may,at.
under the general principles of contract law,it is axiomatic that courts can not bind a to a contract,because that party never agreed to the terms set forth therein.eeoc frank nursery crafts,cir see also eeoc waffle house,d it goes without saying that a contract can not bind a nonparty.thus,under this well recognized general rule,because adams is not a party to the contract he is not bound by the forum selection clause in the ums policy.
ums argues that under american,english,or italian law an insurer who sues a for contribution is bound by provisions in the insurance policy.ums cites cases where courts have dismissed contribution actions where the defendant had no coverage,or where plaintiffs did not comply with notice requirements in the policy.see continental ins.highlands ins,cir finding that exclusion in underlying policy was a defense to the contribution action new york blank,cir finding that notice provision of the underlying policy defeated coverage and provided a defense.ums further quotes an english marine insurance treatise to support its arguments 
the underwriter who has paid a claim and is seeking contribution on the basis of double insurance can have no better rights against the other underwriter than those possessed by the assured.
templeman on marine insurance its principles and practice,ed.
ums reliance on the above authorities is misplaced.we agree that the terms of the defendant policy limit the rights of the plaintiff in asserting a contribution claim.the defendant can rely on its policy terms to show it provided no coverage and to show the other insurance provisions governing the apportionment among in the event of multiple coverage.
as the right to contribution arises because both the entity seeking contribution and the entity from whom it is sought are liable for the underlying obligation,it stands to reason that any fact or circumstance which would allow the latter entity to avoid liability for the obligation would preclude contribution.this opens the door to a wide range of claims attacking the validity of the policy as a whole,or its enforceability based on compliance with any number of conditions or contractual obligations.
lee russ,couch on insurance ed.thus,in defending a contribution action against a coinsurer,a defendant can rely upon provisions in its policy to show it had no coverage for the loss sued upon or how the loss should be allocated between multiple insurers.the forum selection clause in the ums policy is not relevant to either of these questions.we therefore decline to extend the precedents cited by ums to bind adams to the forum selection clause in ums policy.
the district court correctly refused to enforce ums forum selection clause.
ums further argues that venue is improper in this case because it does not comport with the venue provisions of the brussels convention of because ums did not sufficiently raise this issue in the prior appeal the argument is abandoned and we will not address the merits of the issue here.
in ums first appeal to this court it challenged the district court decision on venue only as it related to the forum selection clause.although it referred to the district court rejection of ums brussels convention argument,it articulated no argument supporting reversal of that ruling.
issues not raised or inadequately briefed on appeal are waived.see patterson mobil oil,cir issue not raised on appeal l a contracting concrete,cir finding that issue was not adequately briefed where no authorities were cited in a one page argument.because ums did not make an argument challenging the district court venue finding regarding the brussels convention this argument was waived.
ums next challenges the district court summary judgment apportioning payment of the loss between adams and ums according to their respective policy limits.the dist
