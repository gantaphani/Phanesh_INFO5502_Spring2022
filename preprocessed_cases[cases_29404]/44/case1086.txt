opinion of the court 
ernesto galarza is a citizen who was arrested for a drug offense,posted bail,and instead of being released,was held in custody by lehigh county under an immigration detainer issued by federal immigration officials.three days after galarza posted bail,immigration officials learned that he was a citizen.the detainer was withdrawn and galarza was released.galarza then filed this action against,in relevant part,lehigh county,contending that lehigh county detained galarza without probable cause for more than hours,without notice of the basis of his detention or the ability to contest it.the district court dismissed the complaint against lehigh county on the basis that it could not be held responsible for galarza detention because it was compelled to follow the immigration detainer.on appeal,galarza argues that under a plain reading of the relevant federal regulation,immigration detainers are permissive and,to hold otherwise,would violate the principles inherent in the tenth amendment.we agree with galarza that immigration detainers do not and can not compel a state or local law enforcement agency to detain suspected aliens subject to removal.accordingly,we vacate and remand for further proceedings.
background 
this case arises out of ernesto galarza detention by the allentown police department and the lehigh county prison in november.galarza is a citizen,born in perth amboy,new jersey.he is a hispanic man of puerto rican heritage.on november,galarza was performing construction work on a house in allentown,pennsylvania.sometime that day,the contractor on the construction site sold cocaine to an undercover allentown police detective,christie correa.detective correa arrested the contractor,along with galarza and two other employees who were working at the site.all were charged with conspiracy to deliver cocaine in violation of pennsylvania law.two of the other workers arrested were citizens of the dominican republic,and the third was a citizen of honduras.at the time of galarza arrest,he had a wallet,which contained his pennsylvania driver license,his social security card,a debit card,and his health insurance card.after his arrest,galarza was detained by the allentown police department.the criminal complaint prepared by correa at the time of galarza arrest listed galarza place of birth as perth amboy,and contained galarza social security number and date of birth.in accordance with allentown policy to contact immigration and customs enforcement ice whenever persons arrested are suspected of being aliens subject to deportation,correa called ice and provided immigration officials with galarza name,date and place of birth,ethnicity,and social security number.galarza contends that,by making this call,correa gave ice reason to believe that she suspected galarza had given false information about his identity.
that evening,galarza was transported to lehigh county prison and his bail was set at.the following morning,friday,november,galarza went through the booking process,and during this process,he told prison officials that he was born in new jersey.the officials took his wallet,containing his driver license,social security card,debit card,and health insurance card.
at some point that day,ice agent mark szalczyk,acting on the information relayed by correa,filed an immigration detainer with lehigh county prison.the detainer described galarza as a suspected alien and citizen of the dominican republic.the detainer read 
investigation has been initiated to determine whether this person is subject to from the united states it is requested that you please accept this notice as a detainer.this is for notification purposes only federal regulations cfr require that you detain the alien for a period not to exceed hours excluding saturdays,sundays and federal holidays to provide adequate time for ice to assume custody of the alien.you may notify ice by calling during business hours or after hours in an emergency.
app.at.the detainer was accompanied by neither a warrant,an affidavit of probable cause,nor a removal order.that same day,a surety company posted bail for galarza,and a lehigh county prison official told galarza that he would be released.shortly thereafter,the same official informed galarza that he would not be released because he was the subject of a detainer.
when galarza protested that there should be no detainer preventing his release,the official told galarza that he would have to wait through the weekend until monday,november to speak with a counselor.galarza had not been interviewed by ice or provided with a copy of the detainer.it was not until that monday,three days after his arrest,that a lehigh county prison counselor told galarza for the first time that the detainer holding him was an immigration detainer filed by ice.galarza immediately protested that he was a citizen,and he urged the counselor to retrieve his wallet from the property room in order to look at galarza driver license and social security card,but the counselor refused.shortly thereafter,galarza met with two ice officers,who questioned him extensively about his statement that he was born in new jersey.galarza gave the immigration officials his social security number and date of birth.the officials left and returned to inform galarza that the detainer was being lifted.the detainer was in fact removed at pm on monday,november.lehigh county did not release him until more than six hours later,at about pm.galarza was eventually acquitted by a jury of the charge stemming from his november,arrest.
galarza filed two complaints the first against lehigh county,the city of allentown,and various individual federal and municipal defendants for violations of his constitutional rights,and the second against the united states under the federal tort claims act ftca,b.these cases were consolidated.all defendants in the consolidated case,except the united states,moved to dismiss under rule b.galarza szalczyk,wl,at.the district court held that the claims against ice agent szalczyk and allentown detective correa,for violations of the fourth amendment and the equal protection clause,could go forward and that these officials were not entitled to qualified immunity.id.at.the district court dismissed a procedural due process claim against ice agent szalczyk on qualified immunity grounds and dismissed all claims against another ice official,the city of allentown,and lehigh county.id.
in relevant part,the district court determined that galarza continued detention after he posted bail constituted a seizure within the fourth amendment and that the seizure was unsupported by probable cause.id.at.specifically,the district court found that galarza had stated a fourth amendment claim against correa and szalczyk because these officers lacked probable cause to issue an immigration detainer.the district court reasoned t he fact that galarza is hispanic and was working at a construction site with three other hispanic men two of whom are citizens of foreign countries and another who claimed to have been born in puerto rico but is a citizen of the dominican republic does not amount to probable cause to believe that galarza is an alien not lawfully present in the united states.id.at.it also denied these officers motions to dismiss these claims on grounds of qualified immunity.id.at.
however,the district court dismissed the fourth amendment and procedural due process claims against lehigh county on the ground that neither of the policies identified in plaintiff amended complaint is unconstitutional because both are consistent with federal statutes and regulations.id.at.in doing so,the district court relied on,concluding that detainers issued pursuant to this regulation impose mandatory obligations on state or local law enforcement agencies lea s,including municipalities,to follow such a detainer once it is received.id.at.the district court also dismissed galarza procedural due process claim on the ground that lehigh county complied with the federal regulation setting the time limits on detention because it did not hold galarza for more than hours,not including weekends.id.the court then dismissed the procedural due process claim against szalczyk on grounds of the qualified immunity doctrine,noting that even if the period of detention specified by the regulation were found to be unconstitutional,it would not be clear to every reasonable officer that the detention for a period expressly provided by federal regulation was unlawful.id.at.
following the issuance of the district court opinion,galarza reached a settlement with the remaining individual defendants,the city of allentown,and the united states,resulting in a final order dismissing the case as to all defendants.galarza appeals only the dismissal of his complaint against lehigh county.
ii.discussion 
galarza claims against lehigh county arise under.to establish municipal liability under,galarza must plead two elements first,that he was deprived of rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,and,second that the deprivation of those rights was caused by an official government policy or custom.mulholland gov t cnty.of berks,cir.regarding his fourth amendment rights,galarza contends that his detention resulted from lehigh county stated policy and practice of enforcing all immigration detainers received from ice,regardless of whether ice had,or even claimed to have,probable cause to detain the suspected immigration violator.to support his claim,galarza contends that when a lehigh county prison counselor first told galarza that he had been held on an immigration detainer,the official refused to look into galarza stated proof that he was a citizen,instead waiting for ice officers to arrive lehigh county prison honored the ice detainer in this case on less than probable cause and ice has a history of issuing and then cancelling improper ice detainers lodged against inmates at the lehigh county prison.regarding his procedural due process claim,galarza contends that,under lehigh county policies,he was held for three days without any notice of the basis for his detention or a meaningful opportunity to explain that he was a citizen,despite his repeated requests to contest his detention.
at oral argument,counsel for lehigh county conceded that the policies as alleged would be unconstitutional,and that lehigh county sole basis for seeking dismissal of galarza claims is the allegedly mandatory nature of ice detainers.in this light,the only question on appeal is whether galarza has sufficiently pleaded facts to support his claims that lehigh county unconstitutional policies or customs caused the deprivations of his fourth amendment and procedural due process rights.
interpretation of 
the parties dispute centers on whether immigration detainers issued pursuant to impose mandatory obligations on state and local leas to detain suspected aliens subject to removal.the regulation at issues provides,in relevant part,as follows 
a detainers in general.detainers are issued pursuant to sections and of the act and this chapter.any authorized immigration officer may at any time issue a form i,immigration detainer notice of action,to any other federal,state,or local law enforcement agency.a detainer serves to advise another law enforcement agency that the department seeks custody of an alien presently in the custody of that agency,for the purpose of arresting and removing the alien.the detainer is a request that such agency advise the department,prior to release of the alien,in order for the department to arrange to assume custody,in situations when gaining immediate physical custody is either impracticable or impossible.
d temporary detention at department request.upon a determination by the department to issue a detainer for an alien not otherwise detained by a criminal justice agency,such agency shall maintain custody of the alien for a period not to exceed hours,excluding saturdays,sundays,and holidays in order to permit assumption of custody by the department.
a,d emphasis added.lehigh county argues that the phrase shall maintain custody contained in d means that detainers issued under are mandatory.lehigh county acknowledges that d is titled temporary detention at department request and that a provides that t he detainer is a request.however,lehigh county maintains this language is overshadowed by the use of the word shall in d.according to lehigh county,the word shall means that the request is not really a request at all,but an order.meaning,lehigh county can not be held responsible for galarza detention after he posted bail.galarza argues that the word shall serves only to inform an agency that otherwise decides to comply with an ice detainer that it should hold the person no longer than hours.
we believe that galarza interpretation is correct.the words shall maintain custody,in the context of the regulation as a whole,appear next to the use of the word request throughout the regulation.given that the title of d is temporary detention at department request and that a generally defines a detainer as a request,it is hard to read the use of the word shall in the timing section to change the nature of the entire regulation.almendarez torres united states,d observing that a statute title and a section heading may be considered in resolving doubt about a provision meaning.
however,even if we credit that the use of the word shall raises some ambiguity as to whether detainers impose mandatory obligations,this ambiguity is clarified on numerous fronts.first,no court of appeals has ever described ice detainers as anything but requests.second,no provisions of the immigration and nationality act ina,et,authorize federal officials to command local or state officials to detain suspected aliens subject to removal.lastly,all federal agencies and departments having an interest in the matter have consistently described such detainers as requests.we will address each of these factors in turn.
first is the case law.all courts of appeals to have commented on the character of ice detainers refer to them as requests or as part of an informal procedure.see,ortega immigration customs enforcement,cir,noting that federal immigration officials issue detainers to local leas asking the institution to keep custody of the prisoner for the federal immigration agency or to let the agency know when the prisoner is about to be released liranzo united states,cir noting that ice issued an immigration detainer to jail officials requesting that they release liranzo only into ice custody so that he could be removed from the united states united states uribe rios,cir defining detainers as a request that another law enforcement agency temporarily detain an alien to permit immigration officials to assume custody citing united states female juvenile,cir noting that a detainer serves as a request that another law enforcement agency notify the ins before releasing an alien from detention citing a giddings chandler,cir describing the procedure under as an informal one in which the ins informs prison officials that a person is subject to deportation and requests that officials give the ins notice of the person death,impending release,or transfer to another institution.
second,congress only specific mention of detainers appears in ina,d.the act does not authorize federal officials to command state or local officials to detain suspected aliens subject to removal.moreover,in reviewing this statute,the supreme court has noted that d is a request for notice of a prisoner release,not a command or even a request to leas to detain suspects on behalf of the federal government.arizona united states,d observing that s tate officials can also assist the federal government by responding to requests for information about when an alien will be released from their custody.see d.
contrary to lehigh county assertion,ice and its precursor ins policy statements also hold persuasive weight in this context.see mercy catholic med.ctr.thompson,cir.since at least,and perhaps as early as,ice and its precursor ins have consistently construed detainers as requests rather than mandatory orders.in,when responding to comments provided in the process of administrative notice and comment before a final rule change amending,the ins wrote that,a detaine
