richard feingold sued john hancock life insurance company and john hancock life health insurance company collectively,hancock in a putative class action for damages said to arise from hancock adherence to contractual terms requiring that hancock be given notice of the death of its insureds before death benefits are paid out to beneficiaries.specifically,hancock is said to have an obligation,stemming from a regulatory agreement between hancock and several states,to discover such deaths and notify beneficiaries.the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim.feingold john hancock life ins,civ.jlt,wl,at.
on appeal,feingold primarily argues that the agreement hancock entered with several state governments in june regarding its handling of unclaimed insurance policy proceeds imposed new obligations on hancock as to beneficiaries of its insureds under state law.we disagree and so affirm.

in approximately,feingold mother,mollie feingold,purchased a life insurance policy from hancock.feingold did not know that his mother had purchased this policy,which named only his late father as a beneficiary.she died on or about december.
feingold first became aware that hancock owed his mother a different type of payment as a policyholder of a mutual insurance company in late,when he visited an illinois treasury website,called cash dash,listing unclaimed property he was informed that hancock owed his mother as a demutualization proceeds dividend,which he received from illinois in december.the payment resulted from the demutualization of hancock in.under illinois law,if those funds had remained unclaimed,they would be escheated to the state two years after the date of demutualization.comp.stat.a.
in january,feingold informed hancock of his mother death and requested a copy of her life insurance policy.he said he wanted information regarding the unclaimed dividend payment he had recovered and information as to whether any life insurance proceeds were due.hancock initially told him that his mother had not purchased a policy,but shortly thereafter hancock said it had found his mother policy.hancock sent feingold the forms he needed to make a death benefit claim but did not provide any other information.
after feingold had completed and submitted hancock forms,he continued to ask hancock for a copy of his mother policy,including a written request for the policy.on june,hancock issued feingold a check for for death benefits but did not provide a copy of mollie feingold life insurance policy.
global resolution agreement 
several states conducted an audit of hancock handling of unclaimed property,which includes life insurance proceeds that have not been claimed by beneficiaries.these states have unclaimed property laws under which insurance companies are sometimes required to report and remit unclaimed insurance proceeds to the state.the criteria governing if and when unclaimed property must escheat to the state vary from state to state.as a result of this audit,hancock entered into a global resolution agreement gra with illinois and other states in june to alter its procedures for handling unclaimed property.feingold attached the gra to the complaint.
the express purpose of the gra is to set forth the terms and conditions intended to resolve the unclaimed property audit of hancock that verus financial llc was conducting on behalf of participating states.hancock entered the gra to resolve disputes about its obligations under participating states unclaimed property laws.the gra says that hancock denies having violated any of those laws.
the gra outlined a process for hancock to make payments to participating states based on the results of the unclaimed property audit.hancock also agreed to adjust some of its business practices under the gra.neither feingold nor the other members of the putative class are parties or signatories to that agreement.in response to hancock motion to dismiss,feingold argued that the gra was the source of hancock liability.
procedural history 
feingold filed the class action complaint on january,alleging that hancock owed feingold and the putative class of similarly situated beneficiaries damages based on its handling of unclaimed benefits under its life insurance policies.the complaint asserted several causes of action,including conversion,unjust enrichment,violation of consumer protection laws,and breach of fiduciary duty.
on february,hancock moved to dismiss the complaint under.b.attached to the motion was a copy of mollie feingold application for a life insurance policy,which hancock had retained.the application,dated march,listed jack feingold,identified as mollie feingold husband,as the only beneficiary.
hancock also explained that it did not retain a copy of mollie feingold actual insurance policy because industry practice in was to keep only a copy of the policy form reflecting the terms and conditions of the individual coverage.as a result,hancock attached what it believed to be a copy of mollie feingold applicable policy form to the motion to dismiss.
in opposing the motion,feingold explained that his common law claims were based on duties hancock had incurred under the gra,specifically the gra requirement that hancock examine the social security administration death master file dmf,a public database containing death notices.feingold argued that had hancock examined the dmf as required under the gra,it would have learned that mollie feingold had died in and escheated the unclaimed death benefit under her policy to the state of illinois.although feingold argued that a breach of the gra supported his claim for common law damages,the complaint did not assert a separate claim.
the district court held a hearing on july,and issued a memorandum and order granting hancock motion to dismiss on august.the court applied both massachusetts and illinois law to feingold claims because it concluded that the relevant laws of both states were the same and so it did not need to resolve the choice of law issue feingold,wl,at.
the district court rejected feingold theory of liability based on an alleged violation of the gra,explaining that the gra was a contract only between hancock and participating states.the district court concluded that feingold could not enforce a contract to which he was not a party and nothing suggests that the parties to the contract intended feingold as a third party beneficiary.id.
the district court also considered the life insurance policy form that hancock said mollie feingold had likely purchased,because feingold did not dispute its authenticity and the policy was central to his claims.see watterson page,cir explaining narrow exception in which district court can consider documents outside of a complaint on a motion to dismiss without converting the motion to one for summary judgment if their authenticity is not disputed,they are central to plaintiffs claims,or they are sufficiently referred to in the complaint alt.energy,paul fire marine ins,cir same.the policy requires a beneficiary to provide proof of the policyholder death before hancock will pay the death benefit.feingold,wl,at.
the district court reasoned that feingold had not stated an unjust enrichment or conversion claim where hancock practice of waiting for proof of death before paying policy proceeds was consistent with both illinois and massachusetts law and complied with the insurance contract.see id.at.the court also dismissed feingold breach of fiduciary duty claim because feingold had not alleged a relationship of trust or the sort of reliance that made hancock a plausible fiduciary.id.this appeal followed

feingold fails to state a plausible claim based on an alleged breach of the gra 
on appeal,feingold challenges the district court refusal to consider the gra in assessing the plausibility of his claims for unjust enrichment,conversion,and breach of fiduciary duty.he argues that hancock breached the gra and that this breach makes his common law claims plausible because he is a beneficiary to the gra.he also argues,in the alternative,that hancock breach of the gra supports his common law claims even if he is not a gra beneficiary.these arguments fail because feingold is not a beneficiary to the gra,and so hancock owes feingold no enforceable duties under that agreement.
it is undisputed that feingold is not a party to the gra,a contract between hancock and several state governments.so,under illinois law,feingold has authority to enforce the terms of the gra only if he is a beneficiary of that contract.lake cnty.grading vill.of antioch,appeal allowed.under illinois law,t here is a strong presumption that the parties to a contract intend that the contract provisions apply only to them,and not to third parties.id.emphasis added quoting martis grinnell mut.reins,internal quotation marks omitted.only explicit language in the contract can overcome this strong presumption against beneficiaries.see id.the contract language must show that the contract was made for the direct,not merely incidental,benefit of the third party.id.
here,there is no such language in the gra that could overcome this strong presumption.the gra express purpose is to resolve disputes related to state governments ongoing audit of hancock handling of unclaimed property.there is no indication that the gra was intended directly to benefit anyone other than the signatory states negotiating hancock obligations with respect to their unclaimed property programs.
feingold points only to hancock assertion in the gra that it has acted in its policyholders best interest,as well as hancock obligation under the gra to attempt to locate life insurance beneficiaries before escheating unclaimed policy proceeds to a state.otherwise,feingold does not rely on contract language,as required under illinois law rather,he says he is a beneficiary because the states unclaimed property programs at issue in the gra are themselves intended to help insurance policy beneficiaries,like himself,locate unclaimed property.
at most,feingold is an incidental,as opposed to direct,beneficiary of the gra.this is particularly so given that the gra is a contract with state governments.the general contract principle,espoused by the restatement second of contracts and recognized under illinois law,is that beneficiaries of a government contract are assumed to be merely incidental beneficiaries,and may not enforce the contract absent clear intent to the contrary.bergman water reclamation dist.of greater,accord restatement second of contracts.this rule reflects that g overnment contracts often benefit the public,but individual members of the public are treated as incidental beneficiaries unless a different intention is manifested.restatement second of contracts cmt.a.in other words,t he distinction between an intention to benefit a third party and an intention that the third party should have the right to enforce that intention is emphasized where the promisee is a governmental entity.murray,corbin on contracts ed.so,as a matter of law,feingold is not a beneficiary to the gra 
feingold can not circumvent the strong presumption against beneficiaries in illinois law and the restatement by recasting an alleged violation of the gra as a common law claim.feingold has not pointed to any illinois cases where a plaintiff has asserted a claim of unjust enrichment,conversion,or breach of fiduciary duty based solely on a contract that the plaintiff lacks authority to enforce 
hancock paid the death benefit to feingold on june,shortly after it had received the proof of death that was required under mollie feingold policy that notice requirement complies with illinois law.see.comp.stat.i saying insurer commits an improper claims practice if it fails to affirm or deny coverage after proof of loss statements have been completed emphasis added am.country ins.bruhn,saying that insured duty to provide insurer with notice of a claim is a reasonable requirement in an insurance policy.it is also in accord with illinois unclaimed property statute,which acknowledges that life insurance proceeds are not payable without proof of death.see.comp.stat.b.
feingold other arguments are waived and do not give rise to a claim under illinois law 
feingold has made inconsistent arguments on appeal.perhaps recognizing that feingold has no enforceable rights under the gra,feingold attorney attempted to change course at oral argument and argued for the first time that feingold had alleged a violation of illinois unclaimed property statute.comp.stat,that was wholly independent of the gra.illinois unclaimed property act governs when insurance companies must remit unclaimed funds to the state of illinois.id.while the parties offer different interpretations of the statute,we need not resolve that question of illinois law because feingold new argument does not help him for at least two reasons.
first,the argument,not raised in feingold initial brief,is waived.see united states sacko,cir.second,feingold asserts that hancock violated illinois unclaimed property act if it knew that mollie feingold had died in but failed to escheat her policy proceeds to the state.even assuming feingold is correct that hancock knowledge of mollie feingold death would have triggered its duty to remit policy proceeds to illinois,the complaint does not allege that hancock had knowledge of mollie feingold death.
in addition,the payment of was unrelated to any death benefit under mollie feingold insurance policy.feingold acknowledges that the amount constituted demutualization proceeds from hancock conversion to a company in and.a different provision of illinois unclaimed property act required hancock to escheat those funds if they remained unclaimed for more than two years after the date of demutualization.comp.stat.a.that provision did not require hancock to search the dmf as is required in the gra.id.hancock compliance with a different section of the unclaimed property act based on an event unrelated to mollie feingold death does not state a plausible violation of illinois law.
for the reasons stated,we affirm.

the district court said hancock had argued that illinois law should control.feingold complaint,in contrast,treated massachusetts law as governing,but feingold cited mostly illinois cases in opposing hancock motion to dismiss.feingold,wl,at.
feingold does not appeal from the district court dismissal of his claims under consumer protection statutes or his request for declaratory relief.
feingold argues he must show only that it is plausible that insurance policy beneficiaries are beneficiaries of the gra on a motion to dismiss.this argument misapprehends the plausibility standard.whether feingold is a beneficiary to the gra is a question of law resolved by contract interpretation even at this early stage in the proceedings.feingold does not point to any facts alleged in the complaint that impact this legal question.see mackenzie flagstar bank,fsb,cir affirming rule b dismissal of plaintiffs complaint where,as a matter of law,plaintiffs were
