this is an adversary proceeding arising out of the bankruptcy of debtor derivium capital,llc derivium.plaintiff appellant grayson consulting,grayson,assignee of the chapter bankruptcy trustee,appeals from a district court judgment affirming the bankruptcy court decision to grant summary judgment for defendants appellees wachovia securities,llc,wachovia securities financial network,llc,and first clearing,llc collectively wachovia.
derivium filed for bankruptcy after the collapse of its stock loan lending program,alleged to be a ponzi scheme.grayson sought to recover from wachovia assets transferred into derivium brokerage accounts at wachovia and commissions,fees,and margin interest payments paid to wachovia as fraudulent conveyances under and.grayson also asserted tort claims against wachovia related to its involvement in derivium stock loan program.the bankruptcy court dismissed grayson tort claims under the doctrine of in pari and ultimately granted summary judgment for wachovia on grayson fraudulent conveyance claims,determining that the asset transfers could not be avoided under the bankruptcy code and that wachovia commissions,fees,and margin interest payments were protected from recovery by the stockbroker defense.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court decision,and grayson appealed.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm.
grayson claims relate to derivium stock loan program,in which derivium customers transferred stocks to derivium in exchange for loans worth of the stocks market values.when the loans matured,customers had the option of repaying the principal plus interest and recovering the stock,surrendering the stock,or refinancing the loan for an additional term.under an agreement with derivium,customers participating in the program put their stocks into brokerage accounts the at issue accounts in derivium name and also in the names of bancroft ventures,optech limited,and witco services the stock loan entities.customers were told that derivium would hedge their collateral using a confidential,proprietary formula.instead,derivium owners directed wachovia to immediately transfer the stocks into other accounts and liquidate them.derivium used the proceeds from the stock sales to fund customers loans and derivium owners ventures.
ultimately,derivium had difficulty satisfying its obligations to return customers stocks when the loans matured.wachovia closed the at issue accounts in late and early,and,in september of,derivium filed for chapter bankruptcy in the southern district of new york.the court converted the case to chapter and transferred it to the district of south carolina,where kevin campbell was appointed derivium trustee.
in august of,campbell filed a complaint against wachovia alleging nine tort and two bankruptcy claims under u.and,provisions that entitle a bankruptcy trustee to avoid certain fraudulent transfers made prior to the bankruptcy filing to return assets to the estate for the benefit of the creditors.specifically,campbell sought to avoid and recover three categories of transfers under sections and million in securities that customers transferred into the at issue accounts the customer transfers in cash that derivium and bancroft transferred into bancroft at issue account the year before derivium filed for bankruptcy the cash transfers and commissions,fees,and margin interest paid to wachovia.with the approval of the bankruptcy court,campbell assigned these claims to grayson,and grayson was substituted as the plaintiff in december of.
in april of,wachovia moved for dismissal.the bankruptcy court dismissed the tort claims with prejudice under the doctrine of in pari delicto and dismissed the fraudulent conveyance claims with leave to amend.grayson filed a second amended complaint and wachovia again moved to dismiss,which the bankruptcy court denied on grayson claims related to actual conveyances of assets.subsequently,grayson filed a third amended complaint omitting the nine dismissed tort claims,and the fraudulent conveyance claims proceeded to discovery.
during discovery,wachovia filed a motion for summary judgment,which the court denied.after the close of discovery,wachovia renewed its motion and also moved for summary judgment on the issue of whether the stock loan entities were derivium alter egos.the bankruptcy court denied the motion on grayson alter ego theory,but granted in part and denied in part wachovia renewed motion on grayson fraudulent transfer claims.
specifically,the bankruptcy court determined that grayson can not avoid the customer transfers because they were not transfers of debtor property as required by section grayson can not avoid the cash transfers because wachovia was not the initial transferee of the assets as required by section and wachovia commissions,margin interest payments,and fees claimed under section were protected from recovery by section,known as the stockbroker defense,provided they were customary or reasonable in the securities industry.the bankruptcy court then conducted a hearing to determine whether wachovia commissions were reasonable and customary,found them to be so,and thus concluded that they were protected under the stockbroker defense.in re derivium capital,llc,jw,pro.jw at,
in april of,the district court issued a decision affirming the bankruptcy court orders.grayson timely appealed.
in an appeal from a bankruptcy proceeding,this court applies the same standard of review that the district court applied to the bankruptcy court decision.goldman capital city mort.in re nieves,cir citing bowers atlanta motor speedway,in re se.hotel,cir.thus,we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo.in re nieves,at.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
on appeal,grayson contends that the district court erred in affirming the bankruptcy court determinations that the customer transfers were not transfers of debtor property wachovia was not the initial transferee of the cash transfers the stockbroker defense applies to commissions and in pari delicto bars grayson tort claims against wachovia.we address each issue in turn.
first,grayson argues that the district court erred in affirming the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment for wachovia on grayson customer transfers claim.the district court determined that grayson can not avoid the customer transfers because they were not transfers of an interest of the debtor in property or any obligation incurred by the debtor as required by b and a.
grayson does not contend that derivium had an interest in its customers securities prior to the transfers.rather,grayson asserts that when derivium acquired an interest in the securities through the transfers,wachovia simultaneously acquired an interest in the securities under the agreements governing the accounts into which the securities were transferred.
in its brief,grayson relies heavily on bear,stearns securities gredd in re manhattan investment fund limited,aff,app x cir manhattan investment.in manhattan investment,the bankruptcy court permitted the trustee to avoid transfers by a debtor into a broker margin account.id.here,the bankruptcy court distinguished manhattan investment by explaining that the customer transfers involved transfers of stock by third parties,derivium customers,rather than by the debtor,derivium.that is,the transferred securities came to derivium,not from or through derivium.grayson consulting,wachovia,llc in re derivium capital,llc.
the purpose of the bankruptcy code avoidance provisions is to prevent a debtor from making transfers that diminish the bankruptcy estate to the detriment of creditors.there is no dispute that derivium had no rights to the securities until after the transfers were effectuated.accordingly,the customer transfers at issue here simply were not transfers of debtor property,and thus the transfers in no way diminished the bankruptcy estate.this is true regardless of whether,as grayson argues,wachovia acquired an interest in the securities at the same time as derivium.
alternatively,grayson argues that it can avoid portions of the customer transfers as settlement payments or margin payments under a a and e,asserting that wachovia took funds from the at issue accounts to satisfy margin debt.appellant br.at.
although section provides that certain margin or settlement payments may be avoided under section,section provides for the avoidance of such payments only if they were made from debtor property.see e notwithstanding section a b,and b the trustee may not avoid a transfer that is a margin payment or settlement payment made by or to or for the benefit of a stockbroker.id.a the trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property emphasis added.as discussed,the assets in the atissue accounts were not derivium,debtor property until after the customer transfers occurred.and,as the bankruptcy court explained,section provides only a defense to otherwise avoidable transfers it does not establish a category of avoidable transfers of nondebtor property.thus,neither section a a nor e provides a basis for avoidance and recovery here.
in sum,because the customer transfers were not transfers of derivium property,we conclude that the district court did not err in affirming the grant of summary judgment for wachovia on grayson customer transfers claim.
next,grayson contends that the district court erred in affirming the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment for wachovia on grayson cash transfers claim.
the bankruptcy court determined that grayson can not recover the cash transfers from wachovia because wachovia was not the initial transferee of the assets as required by.in pertinent part,section a provides that,to the extent a trustee may avoid a transfer under the code,the trustee can recover the fraudulently transferred property from only the initial transferee.
the bankruptcy code does not define the term initial transferee.this court applies the dominion and control test to determine whether an entity qualifies as the initial transferee.in re se.hotel,at.under the dominion and control test,an initial transferee must have legal dominion and control over the property,the right to use the property for its own purpose and exercise this legal dominion and control.id.w e explicitly adopt the dominion and control test we hold further that this test requires that a person or entity must have exercised legal dominion and control over the property.here,the bankruptcy court determined that wachovia neither had nor exercised legal dominion and control over the cash transfers and therefore was not the initial transferee of these funds.
grayson argues that the agreements governing the at issue accounts gave wachovia legal dominion and control over assets transferred into those accounts.but regardless of whether the agreements gave wachovia legal dominion and control of the at issue accounts,the bankruptcy court determined that grayson failed to show the requisite exercise of dominion and control.the bankruptcy court found that wachovia never controlled the flow of assets into or out of the at issue accounts nor used assets in the accounts for its own purposes whenever wachovia moved and sold assets,it acted at the direction and consent of the account holder.in re derivium capital,llc,at.nothing in the record suggests that these findings were erroneous.
grayson nevertheless argues that wachovia exercised control by removing from the at issue accounts commissions,margin interest,and prepayment fees.appellant br.at.notably,these deductions did not equal the total amount of the cash transfers.the bankruptcy court concluded that the deduction of commissions and fees at the authorization of the account holder was not an exercise of control over the entire funds.see also sec.first bank brunson,in re coutee,cir holding law firm was not initial transferee of settlement funds in trust because t he only control exercised over the funds was the control delegated to the law firm by the clients.and again,nothing before us suggests that the court erred in its determination.
in sum,we agree with the bankruptcy court that,notwithstanding funds taken and retained as commissions and fees,wachovia was not the initial transferee of the cash transfers.accordingly,we conclude that the district and bankruptcy courts did not err in granting summary judgment for wachovia on grayson cash transfers claim.
grayson next contends that the district court erred in affirming the bankruptcy court determination that wachovia commissions and fees were protected as settlement payments under e,the stockbroker defense,once they were shown to be reasonable and customary in the industry.in re derivium capital,llc,jw,pro.jw at.grayson contends that section does not protect commissions,and even if it does,wachovia commissions here were uncommonly low and therefore should have been excluded from protection under the bankruptcy court own test.
whether brokers commissions and fees can be shielded from avoidance and recovery as a settlement payment under e is a question of statutory interpretation.as with all such questions,we begin with the plain language of the code section e states that,
n otwithstanding sections,a b,and b of this title,the trustee may not avoid a transfer that is a settlement payment,as defined in section or of this title,made by or to or for the benefit of a commodity broker,forward contract merchant,stockbroker,financial institution,financial participant,or securities clearing agency,or that is a transfer made by or to or for the benefit of a commodity broker,forward contract merchant,stockbroker,financial institution,financial participant,or securities clearing agency,in connection with a securities contract 
chapter tautologically defines settlement payment as a preliminary settlement payment,a partial settlement payment,an interim settlement payment,a settlement payment on account,a final settlement payment,or any other similar payment commonly used in the securities trade.id.
section does not limit the definition of settlement payment to security purchase prices or exclude from it payments from which brokers benefit,such as commissions.indeed,congress amended section e in to add settlement payments made to or for the benefit of stockbrokers.see financial netting improvements act of,stat.emphasis added.nevertheless,the definition is sufficiently ambiguous as to whether commissions and fees come under settlement payments that we consider legislative intent.
the parties agree that the purpose of section is to preserve the stability of settled securities transactions.see also kaiser steel charles schwab,cir citing,sess,reprinted in.specifically,congress stated that the purpose behind the provision was to clarify and,in some instances,broaden the commodities market protections and expressly extend similar protections to the securities market to minimize the displacement caused in the commodities and securities markets in the event of a major bankruptcy affecting those industries,sess.
citing this legislative history,several of our sister circuits have described the definition of settlement payment in section as extremely broad.qsi holdings,alford in re qsi holdings,cir contemporary indus.frost,cir lowenschuss resorts int l,in re resorts int l,cir kaiser steel pearl brewing in re kaiser steel,cir quoting kaiser steel,at.
because congress included in the definition of settlement payment any other similar payment commonly used in the securities trade,we also look to standard practices of the securities industry to inform the definition of settlement payment.several industry texts suggest that settlement payment means the transfer of funds paid in connection with completing a securities transaction.see,new york stock exchange,language of investing glossary defining settlement as the c onclusion of a securities transaction when a customer pays a for securities purchased or delivers securities sold and receives from the broker the proceeds of a sale group of thirty,clearance and settlement systems in the world securities markets defining settlement as t he completion of a transaction,wherein securities and corresponding funds are delivered and credited to the appropriate accounts.further,black law dictionary specifically includes a broker commission as an example in the definition of transaction cost.ed.a cost connected with a process transaction,such as a broker commission.
we underscore that not all payments to brokers labeled commissions are protected as settlement payments under section e.for example,commissions that are not part of the settlement of securities transactions,such as commissions paid for the solicitation of investors,can not be protected as settlement payments.section e also would not protect commissions the amount of which,when compared to the transaction amount,indicates that they were not actually related to closing trades.but we conclude that section e plain language,viewed through the lens of its legislative intent,does not exclude commissions and fees commonly paid to stockbrokers as part of settling a regular securities transaction.
accordingly,we hold that the bankruptcy court did not err in determining that commissions shown to be reasonable and customary parts of settling stock sales come within the stockbroker defense as settlement payments.
grayson also contends that the district court erred in affirming the bankruptcy court finding that wachovia low commissions were customary and reasonable.on appeal,grayson argues that the discounted rate was conferred on fewer than two percent of wachovia customers and thus can not be deemed reasonable and customary.
at the evidentiary hearing before the bankruptcy court,wachovia presented the testimony of three individuals george gordon,the wachovia account representative for the derivium and bancroft accounts john pinto,an expert on industry standards and rules governing broker commissions and vadim khavinson,the president of the company that calculated wachovia commissions.grayson did not present any witnesses.
gordon testified that between and of wachovia clients received discounted rates,which ranged from to discounts.pinto testified that it is not unusual for a brokerage firm to offer steep discounts to clients that provide a significant amount of business.further,pinto testified that the rates charged were fair,reasonable,and customary and well within the finra,nasd rules.
based on wachovia evidence,the bankruptcy court determined that although wachovia charged derivium and the stock loan entities discounted commission rates,discounts of the same or greater value were not unusual for large clients who conducted,or were expected to conduct,a significant volume of business with a full service brokerage firm.in re derivium capital,llc,jw,pro.jw at.the bankruptcy court also found that the commissions were customary and reasonable under industry standards.id.at.given the evidentiary record,we conclude that the bankruptcy court did not clearly err in making this finding.
grayson also challenges the bankruptcy court protection of wachovia margin interest payments as margin payments under section.in its brief,grayson summarily asserts that it seeks to recover all commissions and margin interest payments taken by wachovia from any at issue account in the period under b and south carolina statute of elizabeth.appellant br.at.
the bankruptcy code defines margin payment as a payment or deposit of cash,a security,or other property,that is commonly known to the securities trade as original margin,initial margin,maintenance margin,or variation margin,or as a payment,or that secures an obligation of a participant in a securities clearing agency.like settlement payment,courts have interpreted this term broadly.see,hays morgan stanley dw,in re stewart fin,margin payment is a broadly construed term and includes any payment by a debtor to pay for the purchase of securities or to reduce a deficiency in a margin account.citing collier on bankruptcy a at ed.kaiser steel,at biggs smith barney,in re david.
here,the parties agreed that whether a margin interest payment constitutes a margin payment turns on whether it reduces a deficiency in a margin account.in re derivium capital,llc,at.the bankruptcy court determined that because accrued interest increases the total debt owed,margin payments reduce the deficiency in a margin account,and thereby qualify as margin payments under section e.nothing in the record or the bankruptcy court reasoning suggests this was an error,particularly in light of the parties consensus on the term meaning.
accordingly,we conclude that the district and bankruptcy courts did not err in determining that margin interest payments qualify as margin payments under section e.
grayson further argues that even if wachovia commissions,fees,and margin interest payments come within section e,this court should find an exception to the stockbroker defense because applying it in the context of an alleged ponzi scheme would allow a broker to retain profits and undermine the equitable goals of the bankruptcy code.appellant br.at.
although section e does not include a ponzi scheme exception on its face,it does provide several express exceptions to the application of the defense,including claims brought under a fraudulent transfers made with actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud and in manhattan investment,for example,the court held that the existence of a ponzi scheme gave rise to a presumption of actual fraud on the part of the broker,triggering the fraud exception to the stockbroker defense.see at permitting the bankruptcy estate to recover commissions in the context of a ponzi scheme because e does not preclude avoidance if there is actual fraud under a a.
here,the bankruptcy court did not reach the issue of whether grayson established a claim under section a a to wachovia commissions,margin interest payments,and fees.specifically,in its summary judgment order,the bankruptcy court denied wachovia motion with regard to this claim,finding it was not ripe for determination.in re derivium capital,llc,at.then the bankruptcy court specifically excepted and reserved the issue from the evidentiary hearing on the reasonableness and customariness of wachovia commissions,stating plaintiff will have the opportunity during the second part of the trial to present evidence regarding the circumstances under which the defendants obtained the commissions for the purpose of establishing its a claim.subsequently,the parties settled certain claims,and it appears the later hearing was not held.because the district court simply affirmed the bankruptcy court order,whether grayson can recover commissions,fees,and margin interest payments under section a upon establishing actual fraud by wachovia remains unanswered.and grayson fails to convince us we need to establish an fraud exception to the stockbroker defense.
finally,grayson contends that the district court and the bankruptcy court erred in dismissing its tort claims under the doctrine of in pari delicto.in pari delicto is an affirmative defense that precludes a plaintiff who participated in the same wrongdoing as the defendant from recovering damages from that wrongdoing.see,in re bogdan,at describing in pari delicto as an affirmative defense that bars a wrongdoer from recovering against his alleged coconspirators.that is,grayson can not recover damages if it bears equal or greater fault in the alleged tortious conduct as the alleged tortfeasor.
as assignee of the trustee,grayson represents the bankruptcy estate.the bankruptcy estate,as defined by section,includes all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of bankruptcy.a.these legal and equitable interests include causes of action.official comm.of unsecured creditors lafferty,cir citing,among other things,collier on bankruptcy.under section,therefore,a trustee stands in the shoes of the debtor and can only assert those causes of action possessed by the debtor.conversely,the trustee is,of course,subject to the same defenses as could have been asserted against the debtor.id.quotation marks and brackets omitted emphasis added.in other words,to the extent that in pari delicto would have barred a debtor from bringing suit directly,it similarly bars a bankruptcy trustee standing in the debtor shoes from bringing
