the government appeals the district court ruling requiring it to make an immediate payment of future medical care damages to teddy vanhoy in this federal tort claims act ftca action.the government reurges its contention that the district court should create a reversionary trust into which the government could deposit the amount of the award and from which vanhoy future medical care damages would be distributed on an basis,with any balance remaining in the trust at vanhoy death reverting to the government.having been referred to no authority expressly supporting the government proposition or requiring the district court to create such a trust and having found none independently,we affirm.
facts and proceedings 
on october,teddy vanhoy,a navy veteran who had attained the rank of master chief prior to his retirement,underwent coronary artery bypass surgery,without complications,at the veterans affairs medical center in new orleans.following surgery,vanhoy was taken to the surgical intensive care unit and placed on a ventilator,which supported his breathing through an endotracheal tube.two days after the surgery,while being weaned from his ventilator support according to hospital protocol,vanhoy was left unattended for several hours by the nursing personnel.during that time,the endotracheal tube that was supplying vanhoy with oxygen became dislodged,causing him to go into respiratory and cardiac arrest.medical records indicate that he was likely extubated for more than minutes before his condition was discovered and attempts were made to reintubate him.while extubated,vanhoy was deprived of normal oxygen flow and suffered anoxic brain injury,which has left him profoundly and permanently disabled.
vanhoy and his wife,tamra vanhoy,sued the government for damages under the ftca.in its answer,the government pleaded.of the louisiana medical malpractice act mma as an affirmative defense.section b specifies that the total amount recoverable in private malpractice actions for injuries to or death of a patient shall not exceed,exclusive of future medical care and related benefits a companion provision found in of the mma specifies,in pertinent part,that private malpractice awards for future medical care expenses are payable,not by the negligent health care provider but from the patients compensation fund pcf and then only as those charges accrue,with payment ceasing on the death of the victim the government is not a private health care provider and thus is not a contributor to or exonerated by the pcf and the government did not plead of the mma as an affirmative defense.the government did,however,move for partial summary judgment on the issue of future medical expenses,urging that.b authorizes the depositing of future medical expenses awarded in an ftca action into a reversionary trust 
the district court denied the government partial summary judgment motion,ruling that was inapplicable,as it relates only to the liability of states,state agencies,and political subdivisions.the government then filed a motion in limine,asserting that,in the event of an award for future medical expenses,the government is entitled to be treated in the same manner and to the same extent as a private health care provider under like circumstances pursuant to of the ftca specifically,the government insisted that a reversionary trust should be created,as it would most closely approximate the louisiana legislature treatment of future medical expenses under.after the trial concluded,the district court denied this motion and ruled that any future medicals awarded will be in the form of a lump sum payment.
the district court entered judgment against the government,ruling that the hospital nursing staff had breached the applicable standard of care when it failed to monitor vanhoy endotracheal tube and failed to respond immediately after he began experiencing distress.the vanhoys were awarded a total amount of,of which was awarded to vanhoy for his future medical care and services.the government timely filed a notice of appeal,challenging the ruling that it is required to make an immediate payment of future medical care damages 
ii.analysis 
the vanhoys assert that the government claim to a damage limitation based on is an affirmative defense that the government waived by failing to introduce supporting evidence at trial.the vanhoys point out that the government offered no evidence regarding the availability of a trust mechanism that would approximate treatment of future medical expenses,nor any evidence regarding how the trust would be created or operated.
assuming that the applicability of is an affirmative defense as the vanhoys argue,we nevertheless conclude that it was not necessary for the government to introduce factual evidence pertaining to how the trust would be fashioned or whether it would afford an equivalent remedy to that provided under louisiana law.the applicability of,and the question whether it requires the creation of a reversionary trust,are legal issues that can be resolved without the need for factual proof the availability of a reversionary trust mechanism under these circumstances has no bearing on the vanhoys proof of future medical care damages instead,it merely concerns how such damages may be distributed.only if the district court had ruled in favor of the government on its motion in limine would the government have been required to submit factual evidence pertaining to the details of the reversionary trust mechanism.
moreover,the government raised the applicability of in a timely fashion.federal rule of civil procedure c requires an affirmative defense to be set forth in a defendant responsive pleading,with the failure to comply usually resulting in waiver of the defense if,however,a defendant raises the issue at a pragmatically sufficient time,and if the plaintiff is not prejudiced in its ability to respond,there is no waiver of the defense.here,the government failed to plead in its answer.it did,however,raise the applicability of the provision in its motion in limine as well as in the pretrial order additionally,the government had filed a motion three months before trial in which it advocated the use of a reversionary trust as an alternative to a award of future medical damages as the applicability of was raised on multiple occasions prior to trial,and as the vanhoys had adequate notice of the government intention to claim the benefit of the provision,the defense was raised at a pragmatically sufficient time and the vanhoys were not prejudiced in their ability to respond we hold that the government did not waive its argument for the creation of a reversionary trust premised upon.
reversionary trust 
the government asserts that it is entitled to be treated in the same fashion as a private defendant in a louisiana malpractice action based upon the like circumstances test of the ftca.specifically,the government argues that the district court should create a reversionary trust from which vanhoy future medical care damages may be distributed as needed.it maintains that such a trust mechanism most closely approximates treatment of future medical expenses by ensuring that the damages are used only for their intended purpose,compensating vanhoy for the expenses he actually incurs during the remainder of his lifetime.the question whether requires the district court to provide protection to the government in the form of a reversionary trust,pursuant to of the ftca,is a legal one requiring interpretation of both louisiana and federal statutes.we therefore review the district court ruling de novo 
louisiana law can not by its law make the united states liable.the united states is liable only to the extent it waives sovereign immunity,here by the federal tort claims act.pursuant to,the united states is liable in tort claims in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances section provides that whenever a victim has future medical damages that exceed the cap on malpractice damages under louisiana law,as is the case with vanhoy,future medical care damages will be paid only as those charges are incurred and only for as long
