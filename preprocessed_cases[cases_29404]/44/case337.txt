this case is the latest in a series of tragic cases arising out of the fbi mishandling of informants drawn from organized crime.elaine barrett or plaintiff,in her capacity as administratrix of the estate of her deceased husband,appeals from the dismissal of her claims under the federal tort claims act ftca,b,the fourth and fifth amendments to the constitution,and massachusetts wrongful death statute.laws ch,due to her failure to file within the applicable two and statutes of limitations.the government and the individual defendants defendants argue that we have no jurisdiction to review the dismissal of these claims and,alternatively,that plaintiff claims are.
while we recognize the tragedy experienced by barrett and his loved ones,the technical requirements of the ftca and related laws are clear,they serve important purposes,and we are bound to follow them.although we have jurisdiction to consider this appeal,we do not have jurisdiction to review plaintiff ftca claim against the government because plaintiff did not exhaust her administrative remedies.plaintiff constitutional and wrongful death claims likewise fail because plaintiff waited more than three years to file her complaint after the accrual of her cause of action.we therefore affirm the district court orders of dismissal appealed from on june.
in,plaintiff spouse was kidnapped and murdered by james bulger,stephen flemmi,and kevin weeks.the federal bureau of investigation fbi protected bulger and flemmi,both of whom served as confidential informants for the fbi,from arrest,prosecution,and investigation for this and other crimes in order to maintain them as confidential informants.on september,the district court of massachusetts wolf,issued a decision in united states salemme,d,which discussed the fbi relationship with bulger and flemmi and the protection from criminal prosecution that the agency afforded them.the salemme decision specifically mentioned bulger and flemmi slaying of barrett,and noted that the fbi had been informed that bulger was responsible for barrett murder.id.at.in january,barrett body was exhumed from a gully alongside the southeast expressway in dorchester,massachusetts,although determinations and procedures sufficient to identify and permit release of his remains were not completed for another three months.on march,in response to the reported positive identification of barrett remains,plaintiff told reporters that,i think the government is responsible because if they put them away when they should have,bucky would be alive today.they gave them a license to kill and do whatever they wanted.barrett body was released to plaintiff on april.
on january,elaine barrett,arthur barrett widow and the administratrix of his estate,presented to the government,the department of justice doj and the fbi an administrative tort claim under the ftca,notifying the government of barrett injuries and wrongful death caused by the negligent and wrongful acts or omissions of its employees.on april,before the government denied the administrative claim and before six months had passed,plaintiff filed a complaint in the district court of massachusetts,seeking redress from the government pursuant to the ftca,and seeking redress from eight former fbi agents,james bulger,stephen flemmi,and kevin weeks pursuant to the fourth and fifth amendments under bivens six unknown agents of the fed l bureau of narcotics,d and massachusetts wrongful death statute.on april,the doj denied the ftca claim as untimely based on the ftca statute of limitations.
in november,the government filed a motion to dismiss.former fbi agents john morris and robert fitzpatrick filed motions to dismiss in december and january,respectively.on september,the district court,in a written opinion,dismissed plaintiff claims against the government as untimely under the ftca statute of limitations,and against morris and fitzpatrick as untimely under the applicable statute of limitations for plaintiff bivens and wrongful death claims.on october,plaintiff appealed the september,order.
on december,for the reasons set forth in the september,order,the district court dismissed plaintiff claims against john connolly,and james ahearn.on april,we dismissed plaintiff october,appeal on the ground that we lack jurisdiction absent certification under.b.
the following day,on april,the district court dismissed plaintiff claims against the three remaining fbi agents james ring,james greenleaf,and rod kennedy two months later,on june,plaintiff appealed this order,together with each previous order of dismissal entered in this action,the september,order and the december,order.that same day,plaintiff filed in the district court a motion for entry of immediate judgment against the dismissed defendants.the district court dismissed this motion without prejudice in the absence of the filing of a set of proposed findings that meet the requirements of.b.plaintiff did not file any set of findings.thus,the district court did not direct the entry of judgment against the dismissed defendants pursuant to.b.
on july,we issued an order responding to the june,appeal,stating that b ecause the orders of dismissal do not appear to be appealable final orders,and claims against other defendants remain pending in the district court,this court does not appear to have jurisdiction to consider this appeal absent certification pursuant to.b.we also noted that the notice of appeal as to each previous order of dismissal entered in this case,the september,order and the december,order appears to be untimely because it was not filed within days of the order from which it was appealed,as required by fed.a.we thus required plaintiff to move for voluntary dismissal or show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed.plaintiff filed a showing of cause.on september,we issued an order allow ing the case to proceed for now,without prejudice to reconsideration of the jurisdictional question by the merits panel.

appellate jurisdiction 
timeliness of notice of appeal 
courts of appeals may only hear appeals from final decisions of district courts.t he term final decision normally refers to a final judgment.sell united states,d.a judgment is final only where it leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgement.consol.rail fore river ry,cir quoting catlin united states.it is undisputed that the district court entered a final judgment against all defendants on september.it is also undisputed that plaintiff did not appeal that final judgment.instead,plaintiff relied on the notice of appeal filed on june,than three months prior to the entry of final judgment.in order to exercise jurisdiction over this action,we must find that either the june,appeal was timely because the orders of dismissal underlying that appeal were final or,if the orders were not final the premature appeal ripened into a timely notice of appeal following the entry of judgment on september.
finality as of june,
rule b certification 
when a plaintiff sues multiple parties and a district court disposes of the claims against some but not all of the defendants,the district court decision is ordinarily not a final,appealable judgment unless the district court separately certifies judgment against the relevant defendants pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.see nichols cadle,cir.the district court did not certify judgment against any of the defendants on either june,or any time thereafter.as defendants note,the district court could have certified a final judgment as to those defendants dismissed prior to the june,appeal pursuant to rule b,and that partial judgment would have been appealable.but the district court did not do that.in fact,the district court denied plaintiff motion to certify a final judgment pursuant to rule b in the absence of the filing of a set of proposed facts that complied with that rule.therefore,the orders of dismissal appealed from on june,did not become final by virtue of rule b,and are not appealable on that basis.
ii.served versus unserved defendants 
plaintiff contends that even though the district court did not certify that the orders appealed from on june,were final pursuant to rule b,these orders were nevertheless final because they disposed of the claims against all of the defendants who were served with process.according to plaintiff,i t is widely agreed that defendants who have not been served with process are not counted for purposes of finality a disposition as to all those who have been served is final quoting charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.see manley city of chicago,cir holding that presence of unserved defendant does not defeat finality accord cooper pickett,cir ins.of no.am.dealy,cir.although defendants concede that unserved defendants are not counted for purposes of finality,we need not decide that point of law in this case.defendants argue that even if the disposition of claims against all served defendants renders a district court decision final,the orders of dismissal underlying the june,appeal did not dispose of the claims against all of the served defendants and,therefore,did not constitute a final disposition.we agree.
when plaintiff filed her appeal on june,the district court had dismissed plaintiff claims against all defendants except flemmi,weeks,bulger,and the fifty john does.while bulger and the fifty john does had not been served,the record indicates that flemmi and weeks had been served.the docket reveals that plaintiff filed a proof of compliance with waiver of service with respect to flemmi and weeks,among other defendants.the docket entries for september and,further state that the district court entered default judgments against flemmi and weeks but not bulger for whom n o service has been made.
various statements by plaintiff support this conclusion.in her brief to us,plaintiff states that t he district court has entered final decisions dismissing all claims in the complaint against all served defendants,leaving only james bulger,who is a fugitive from justice and an unserved defendant.emphasis added citations omitted.plaintiff further states that after enter ing defaults against bulger,flemmi and weeks on september,the default against bulger was vacated because he had not been served with process.the defaults against flemmi and weeks remained for failure to plead or otherwise defend plaintiff likewise states in her reply brief that a ll defendants have been served or appeared,except bulger,flemmi and weeks,indicating that while flemmi and weeks had not appeared,they had been served.emphasis added.therefore,the outstanding claims against flemmi and weeks defeated finality at the time of the june,appeal,thereby making the notice of appeal untimely.
finality as of september,
since plaintiff can not show that the orders appealed from on june,were final and thus appealable,we must determine whether plaintiff premature june,appeal nevertheless ripened into a timely notice of appeal after the entry of judgment against all of defendants on september.federal rule of appellate procedure a addresses premature notices of appeal,stating that a notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision or before the entry of judgment or treated as filed on the date of and after the entry.in firstier mortgage investors mortgage insurance,d,the supreme court held that rule a permits a notice of appeal filed from certain nonfinal decisions to serve as an effective notice from a subsequently entered final judgment.id.at.the supreme court cautioned,however,that rule a does not render all premature notices of appeal effective upon the entry of final judgment.on the contrary,rule a permits a notice of appeal from a nonfinal decision to operate as a notice of appeal from the final judgment only when a district court announces a decision that would be appealable if immediately followed by the entry of judgment.id.at.
if the district court had ordered the dismissal of plaintiff claims against all defendants prior to plaintiff appeal,and had entered final judgment against them after the plaintiff appeal,this would be an easy case.under firstier,since the orders of dismissal would have been appealable once the perfunctory entry of judgment was made,plaintiff premature notice of appeal would ripen into a timely notice after the entry of final judgment.see id.at.holding that premature appeal of bench ruling which purport ed to dispose of all of plaintiff claims ripened upon entry of final judgment.
here,however,the district court ordered the dismissal of plaintiff claims against not prior to plaintiff appeal.thus,the orders appealed from w ere not literally decision s that would be appealable if immediately followed by the entry of judgment.clausen,cir.because claims against flemmi and weeks remained,plaintiff appeal did not dispose of all the claims in the case.therefore,judgment could not perfunctorily be entered following the ruling absent the certification called for by rule b.id.emphasis omitted.
in clausen,we extended firstier holding to decisions involving fewer than all claims or fewer than all parties.there,we held that a premature notice of appeal of a decision disposing of some but not all claims ripened into an effective notice because the decision would have been appealable if immediately followed by certification pursuant to rule b.see at noting that a decision that was appropriate for immediate appeal pursuant to rule b was close enough to a decision that would be appealable if immediately followed by the entry of judgement.internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted see also in re bryson,cir while the firstier court had no occasion to consider an entry of judgment pursuant to rule b nothing in firstier indicates that its holding does not apply to such judgments.and rightly so a judgment properly certified by a district court pursuant to rule b is just as final as one made final pursuant to other rules.this case is consistent with orders of dismissal would have been appealable if certified pursuant to b.we indicated as much in our july,order,in which we noted that claims against other defendants remain pending in the district court and directed plaintiff to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed absent certification pursuant to rule b.
defendants attempt to distinguish clausen.the premature notice in that case ripened upon the entry of a rule b certification.as defendants point out,the decision in this case was never,in fact,certified.rather,final judgment was entered pursuant to.this argument is unavailing.firstier inquiry is a hypothetical one would the decision underlying the premature notice have been appealable immediately following entry of judgment see outlaw airtech air conditioning and heating,firstier asks hypothetically whether the nonfinal decision from which an appeal was noted would be appealable if immediately followed by the entry of judgment.internal quotation marks,citation,and emphasis omitted.in clausen,we placed a gloss on firstier hypothetical inquiry would the decision underlying the premature notice have been appealable immediately following certification pursuant to rule b see clausen,at the district court had to satisfy itself and certify that the decision was,in effect,appropriate for immediate appeal,pursuant to rule b,notwithstanding its failure to resolve all claims made in the lawsuit.it does not matter that the underlying orders of dismissal,although certifiable at the time of the june,appeal,were never,in fact,certified,but rather were made final by the entry of a final judgment on september.although the hypothetical judgment in firstier was identical to the kind of judgment eventually entered,nothing in firstier requires that the hypothetical judgment considered in applying its test be the same type as the one actually entered.outlaw,at.all that is required is that t here must at some point prior to consideration of the appeal actually have been a final appealable judgment of some sort entered.id.emphasis added.
defendants concede that the district court could have certified a final judgment as to th e relevant defendants under rule b,and that partial judgment would have been appealable.in other words,the decision would have been appealable immediately by virtue of rule b.therefore,plaintiff premature notice of appeal ripened upon the entry of final judgment on september.defendants failure to cite any authority in support of its argument,together with the wealth of authority supporting the timeliness of such appeals,bolsters this conclusion.see outlaw,at holding that a premature notice of appeal of decision disposing of plaintiff claims against some but not all would have been appealable pursuant to rule b ripened upon the entry of final judgment accord garwood packaging,allen,cir holding that premature notice of appeal took effect when,the last defendant having been dismissed,the decision became final ruiz mcdonnell,cir holding that plaintiff notice of appeal filed after the dismissal of all except one defendant ripened upon the district court entry of default judgment against the remaining defendant id.at a notice of appeal filed before the district court disposes of all claims is nevertheless effective if the appellant obtains either certification pursuant to rule b or final adjudication before the court of appeals considers the case on its merits.we therefore have jurisdiction to consider plaintiff appeal.
exhaustion under the ftca 
notwithstanding the timeliness of plaintiff appeal,we must next determine whether plaintiff exhausted her administrative remedies under the ftca.the united states,as a sovereign,can not be sued absent an express waiver of its immunity.fdic meyer,d see also skwira united states,cir.the ftca is such a waiver.it permits individuals to sue the government for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.b see also the united states shall be liable with respect to tort claims in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.
the waiver effected by the ftca is,however,closely circumscribed by the terms of the statute.rakes united states,cir.t o ensure that meritorious claims can be settled more quickly without the need for filing suit and possible expensive and litigation,the ftca includes an administrative exhaustion requirement.pascale united states,cir quoting,sess,reprinted in,internal brackets omitted.a states that 
a n action shall not be instituted upon a claim against the united states for money damages for injury or loss of property or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,unless the claimant shall have first presented the claim to the appropriate federal agency and his claim shall have been finally denied by the agency in writing and sent by certified or registered mail.the failure of an agency to make final disposition of a claim within six months after it is filed shall,at the option of the claimant any time thereafter,be deemed a final denial of the claim for purposes of this section.
in short,plaintiff may not file a tort claim in district court until i the agency finally denies the administrative claim,or ii six months pass without a final denial of the administrative comes first.
the government argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to review plaintiff ftca claim because it was filed on april,the doj issued its denial of plaintiff administrative tort claim on april,and within the waiting period otherwise required.plaintiff argues that while she filed her complaint before the administrative denial,she did not serve or attempt to serve any defendant until september,after the administrative claim was denied on april.thus,plaintiff argues,t his action was begun when service of process was made after denial of plaintiff administrative claim.we disagree.
plaintiff does not cite any authority for the proposition that we should look at the date of service of process as opposed to the date on which the complaint was filed in determining whether plaintiff exhausted her administrative remedy.we also have not found any such authority.on the contrary,the plain language of the statute and supreme court case law interpreting the statute point to the opposite conclusion.section a states,in relevant part,that a n action shall not be instituted upon a claim against the united states unless the claimant first presents the claim to the appropriate federal agency and the claim is finally denied.emphasis added.according to the supreme court,the word institute is synonymous with the words begin and commence.mcneil united states,d.pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,a civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.thus,an action is instituted for purposes of section a when the complaint is filed.see mcneil,at.rejecting the argument that an action is instituted when substantial progress has been made in the litigation.
plaintiff other arguments fare no better.plaintiff contends that since she complied with the ftca statute of limitations under b the only statutory provision referenced in the doj denial of her administrative tort have jurisdiction to review her ftca claim.this argument is incorrect.
section b states that 
a tort claim against the united states shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate federal agency within two years after such claim accrues or unless action is begun within six months after the date of mailing,by certified or registered mail,of notice of final denial of the claim by the agency to which it was presented.
even if we assume that plaintiff claim was brought within the time allotted by section b,this timeliness has nothing to do with whether plaintiff has satisfied the ftca exhaustion requirement under section a.section b limits the time a claimant has to file its administrative tort claim and complaint,respectively.specifically,the statute requires that a claimant present an administrative tort claim to the appropriate government agency within two years of accrual of the claim,and,assuming the claim is denied,file a complaint in district court within six months of notice of final denial by the agency.section a,on the other hand,prescribes what a claimant must do before bringing an ftca claim in federal court.specifically,the statute requires that the claimant wait for a final disposition from the agency or,in lieu thereof,the passage of six months without a final disposition before filing the complaint.plaintiff contention that her alleged compliance with section b statute of limitations relieved her of section a exhaustion requirement is therefore unavailing.
in a related argument,plaintiff contends that by waiting out the response time on the administrative claim under the ftca,the agency could cause the statute of limitations to expire on bivens claims or force separate suits.while that may be true in this case the remedy is for plaintiff to file separate claims,which would not be barred by the rule against.see torromeo fremont,cir see also restatement second of judgments c allowing exception to rule against where t he plaintiff was unable to rely on a certain theory of the case or to seek a certain remedy or form of relief in the first action because of the limitations on the subject matter jurisdiction of the courts and the plaintiff desires in the second action to rely on that theory or to seek that remedy or form of relief.we can
