shortly after on may,before departing to sea from the oregon inlet fishing center in cape hatteras national seashore park,north carolina,as captain richard harris and mate william martin prepared the oil screw fintastic for a fishing charter,martin slipped and fell on fish slime and gurry,which had been left on the dock,injuring his back 
martin commenced this action against richard harris,cheryl harris,and the fintastic,claiming that richard harris was liable to martin in negligence under the jones act,app.a now codified with minor changes at a,and that the fintastic was unseaworthy.after a bench trial,the district court found,on the jones act claim,that harris was negligent in not keeping the dock around the fintastic free of slime and gurry and that his negligence caused martin injuries.the court entered judgment against the defendants in the amount of,plus prejudgment interest.on the unseaworthiness claim,the court ruled against martin out of a concern over whether the unseaworthiness doctrine extended to the dock next to a vessel.from the district court judgment,dated june,the defendants appealed 
in his appeal,harris contends that the district court erred in finding the evidence sufficient under the jones act to hold him liable for martin injuries in declining to render a judgment on partial findings at the end of martin case,under federal rule of civil procedure c in admitting into evidence a photograph of the dolphin fish catch laid out on the dock behind the fintastic,taken on the evening before martin fall in awarding prejudgment interest on the jones act claim and in not reducing the damages award by the amounts that harris paid martin for maintenance and cure.
we conclude that the district court erred in awarding prejudgment interest on the jones act claim and vacate that part of the judgment,and we affirm the judgment as so modified.
in january,william martin went to work as a shipmate for richard harris,who was the charter captain,owner,and operator of the fishing vessel fintastic.the fintastic is a vessel designed for fishing in the waters of the atlantic ocean off cape hatteras.in furtherance of his business,captain harris leased a slip from oregon inlet fishing center,and the lease agreement required harris to keep the dock space surrounding the slip free of trash,litter,debris,and other clutter,and to spray the boardwalk after a charter catch had been removed at the end of the trip.as captain harris expressed the duty,they ask that every day after our fish are cleaned,or picked up by the fish cleaners,or the parties themselves dispose of the fish themselves,that we spray the dock off,keep it free of any slime.
each morning martin would arrive at the fishing center at approximately to begin prevoyage preparation by loading ice on the vessel,releasing the lines to bring the vessel closer to the dock,and placing boarding stairs from the dock to the vessel to enable charter parties to board.at the end of the day,martin would offload the day catch onto the dock immediately behind the vessel and arrange the fish in a line so that a photographer could photograph the day catch for use on the fishing center website.after the photograph was completed,captain harris and martin would clean the vessel and the dock.harris normally cleaned the inside of the vessel and martin,the outside.after the fish were removed from the dock,either martin or harris would hose the dock to wash away fish slime and gurry.
on may,martin took the day off,and keith biggs served as captain harris mate on the fintastic.that day,the charter group caught approximately dolphin fish.when the vessel returned to the dock,biggs offloaded the fish and placed them on the dock behind the stern of the fintastic for the customary photograph.after the photograph was taken,however,captain harris testified that he could not remember who then cleaned the dock off,if anyone.
the next day when martin arrived at the fintastic at to prepare for the day charter trip,he noticed that fishing lures and rods had been left out from the previous day and that the cockpit had not been washed down.there was offshore the fish box along with bags of ice and blood.martin testified,just everything was left out from the day before.when captain harris arrived,martin told him about the vessel condition,and harris responded that biggs had just gotten back from florida and was more interested in socializing with his buddies up and down the dock than cleaning the vessel.
as martin prepared for that day trip,he untied the lines to move the vessel closer to the dock to enable him to lay down the temporary steps.as he walked on the dock near the stern of the vessel,he slipped on fish slime or gurry immediately behind the vessel,landing hard on his buttocks.martin testified,both of my feet came out from under me and i slammed down on the dock on my tail bone.as the district court observed,b ecause of the early hour and limited lighting,martin could not see the slime as he worked.martin said that he got up as fast as he could and tried to shake it off,but he had pain,figuring that he had just bruised his tail bone.he also had slime all over his backside,a fact that captain harris later observed while they were at sea.when harris,who saw martin fall,asked martin if he was all right,martin responded that he thought he was okay he thought he had been bruised but could walk it off.but as the day progressed,martin had difficulty doing his job because he was suffering significant pain in his back.when he complained to harris about it,harris told him not to perform his usual duties and to go home and rest.
martin sought medical attention the next day,and his doctor instructed him to apply ice and take pain medication.the pain persisted over the days that followed,and martin was given an mri,which revealed that martin had suffered a disc herniation at the level of the lower spine and that a fragment in martin spinal canal was causing pressure on his sciatic nerve.a neurosurgeon performed a microdiskectomy,which eased the pain in martin leg,but not in his back.martin underwent physical therapy and,in october,was injected with steroids.by november,martin was released by his doctor to return to work,but with limitations.his doctor recommended that martin not return to work on a fishing vessel but thought that martin could engage in other work,provided he did not lift in excess of pounds or bend frequently.
martin incurred medical expenses totaling,all but of which were paid by harris as part of his cure obligation.harris also paid martin for his maintenance obligation.
martin commenced this action under the jones act for harris negligence in failing to provide a safe place to work and under general maritime law for the ship unseaworthiness.after a bench trial,the district court found harris liable to martin under the jones act and awarded him damages in the amount of,plus prejudgment interest.in finding negligence,the court stated 
on may,either harris or his employee,keith biggs,had negligently failed to remove slime and gurry from the dock.the slime and gurry made for an unreasonably safe condition,which in turn caused martin slip and fall on may,
harris negligence both directly and proximately caused martin injuries.martin suffered a disk herniation at the and levels of his spine,substantial physical pain and mental suffering,as well as permanent limitations.martin additionally suffered a loss of earnings and diminished earnings capacity.these mental,physical and economic injuries entitle martin to recover damages in the amount of plus interest from may,until march,and post judgment interest from the date of this order until the judgment is satisfied.
from the district court judgment,entered on june,the defendants filed this appeal.
for his principal argument,harris contends that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of negligence and causation,as required for a violation of the jones act.he argues that t he district court factual finding is simply an impermissible inference based upon multiple inferences that this court should not countenance.he notes particularly,the district court committed clear error when it impermissibly inferred the existence of fish slime on the dock from the previous day catch.it inferred that the fish slime that caused martin fall was left there by the fish from the previous day catch in the complete and total absence of any facts that suggest,let alone establish,that conclusion.
the jones act allows a seaman to recover for injury suffered during the course of his employment,providing 
any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may,at his election,maintain an action for damages at law,with the right of trial by jury,and in such action all statutes of the united states modifying or extending the right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply.

to prevail on a jones act negligence claim against his employer,a seaman must show that he is a seaman under the act that he suffered injury in the course of his employment that his employer was negligent and that his employer negligence caused his injury at least in part.id.to establish negligence by his employer,a jones act plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his employer breach ed a duty to protect against foreseeable risks of harm.id.at.the employer duty under the jones act is to provide seamen with a safe place to work.estate of larkins farrell lines,cir citing michalic cleveland tankers,d.and this duty extends from the vessel to the shore,provided the seaman is acting in the course of his employment.great lakes dredge dock.
although the elements of duty,breach,and injury draw on principles,the standard of causation in a jones act negligence action is relaxed.see hernandez,at.thus,an employer is liable if his negligence played any part,even the slightest,in producing the injury or death for which damages are sought.id.at quoting consol.rail gottshall,d internal quotation marks omitted.but the standard must not be relaxed to the point that the jones act becomes in effect a workers compensation statute.see id.at.t he basis of liability under the fela,and derivatively the jones act,remains grounded in negligence and not merely on the fact that injuries occur.id.at quoting gottshall,at.

in this case,the district court found that harris had a duty to provide martin with a safe place to work,estate of larkins,at,and that this duty applied not only to the vessel,but also to the dock surrounding the slip where the vessel was moored,see,at.moreover,under the lease agreement with oregon inlet fishing center,harris was contractually obligated to keep the area behind his vessel free of trash and debris and to spray off the boardwalk after the charter party catch had been removed.the court held that harris breached this duty,finding that o n may,either harris or his employee,keith biggs,had negligently failed to remove slime and gurry from the dock,that t he slime and gurry made for an unreasonably safe condition,which in turn caused martin slip and fall of may,and that harris negligence both directly and proximately caused martin injuries.the court awarded martin damages in the amount of.
in light of the record in this case,we can not conclude that the district court findings of negligence and causation were clearly erroneous.construing the evidence in the light most favorable to martin,we are not left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.evergreen int l,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
first,the evidence supports the district court finding that harris breached his duty by negligently failing to remove fish slime from the dock.the court based this finding on the following facts.after the charter group returned with their catch on may,which amounted to approximately dolphin fish,the catch was removed and placed on the dock at the stern of the fintastic.photographs of the catch confirmed this.and although it was the normal practice then to clean the vessel inside and out,as well as the dock,it was apparent the next morning,several hours later,that the normal practice had not been followed.when martin arrived at on may,he observed that lures and rods had been left out from the day before,that the back of the boat had not been washed down,that offshore seaweed remained in the fish box along with bags of ice and blood,and that rigs had been left out and various items were left on the countertop just everything was left out from the day before.harris himself testified that the vessel had not been properly cleaned,and he could not remember specifically if anyone had cleaned off the dock.when martin said something about the vessel being left in a mess,harris responded that mate biggs was more interested in going up and down the dock talking to his buddies than doing his job.from these facts a court could find that slime and gurry that may have been on the dock were not removed by harris or his mate.
the court could also reasonably find that slime was indeed on the dock and that martin slipped on it.martin slipped and fell at the stern of the where the catch of dolphin fish had been placed the previous when he got up from his fall,he had slime on his backside,a fact confirmed by harris own observation.moreover,immediately after martin fell,harry baum on the vessel rebait,hollered at captain harris that he needed to keep his dock cleaner.
finally,the district court could reasonably find that harris failure to clean the dock,or to ensure that his mate,biggs,did so,resulted in slime being left on the same slime that caused martin fall and resulting back injuries.harris himself recognized that fish have slime on them and therefore that after the catch is removed from the dock at the stern area of the vessel,the dock must be hosed down to keep it clean of slime and gurry.if the dock had not been hosed down on the evening of may,after the catch was removed,as may be inferred from the condition of the vessel the next morning,it is not unreasonable to assume that the dock remained in the same condition overnight,until,especially when the fintastic remained moored in its slip during that time.under the relaxed standard of causation for jones act actions,the district court was not clearly erroneous in finding that harris created the unsafe condition and that martin injured himself as a result of that condition.
in short,viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to martin,we conclude that the district court findings of negligence,causation,and injury were not clearly erroneous.
harris devotes a substantial portion of his brief to pointing to the absence of evidence that he had notice of the dangerous condition.although notice might be a separately required element when some third party creates the dangerous condition,it is not required when harris,or his agent biggs,created the unsafe condition,as the district court found.
harris also contends that the district court erred in declining to grant his motion to render a judgment on partial findings,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c,on the ground that martin failed to carry his burden of proving a prima
