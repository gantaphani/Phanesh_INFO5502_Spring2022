this appeal requires us to determine whether battery park city authority bpca,a public benefit corporation,has the capacity to challenge a new york state statute as unconstitutional under the new york state constitution,and whether that challenge succeeds on the merits.as we explain below,we believe we can not resolve those questions without first certifying two predicate questions to the new york court of appeals 
before new york state doctrine may be applied to determine whether a public benefit corporation has the capacity to challenge a state statute,must it first be determined whether the public benefit corporation should be treated like the state,see,long island,based on a particularized inquiry into the nature of the instrumentality and the statute claimed to be applicable to it,see john grace state.constr.fund,and if so,what considerations are relevant to that inquiry and 
does the serious injustice standard articulated in gallewski hentz,or the less stringent reasonableness standard articulated in robinson robins dry dock repair,govern the merits of a due process challenge under the new york state constitution to a statute 
accordingly,we certify these questions to the new york court of appeals.
background 
battery park city authority 
in,the new york state legislature decided to address the substandard,insanitary,deteriorated and deteriorating conditions affecting manhattan lower west side.pub.auth.law.accordingly,it created bpca and tasked it with replanning,reconstructi ng and rehabilitati ng the area,with significant participation by the private sector,for the prosperity and welfare of the people of the city of new york and of the state as a whole.id.the redevelopment was to include the creation of a mixed commercial and residential community.see id.
to accomplish this goal,bpca was created as a public benefit corporation id,and authorized to,inter alia,sue and be sued,acquire,lease,hold,mortgage and dispose of real property,fix,establish and collect rates,rentals,fees and other charges,and borrow money and issue negotiable bonds,notes or other obligations,id.bpca maintains its own general fund,see id,and is solely responsible for the repayment of its bond obligations,see id.it has seven members,each appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the new york senate.id.
bpca has successfully developed the site known as battery park city into a community that houses over million square feet of commercial space,residents,public schools,and acres of parks.see who we are,battery park city authority,last visited.
ii.plaintiffs claims against bpca 
this consolidated appeal involves claims for personal injuries sustained by eighteen workers who participated in the cleanup operations across lower manhattan following the terrorist attacks of september.in the years that followed,these plaintiffs developed a host of serious respiratory illnesses.plaintiffs believe their illnesses stemmed from the cleanup work they had performed at several properties impacted by the attacks.specifically,plaintiffs believe they had been exposed to harmful toxins as a result of bpca failure to adequately ensure worker safety at those sites.consequently,between and,plaintiffs filed personal injury suits against bpca in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,asserting claims under new york labor law and negligence plaintiffs suits,along with hundreds of others,were assigned to judge hellerstein and consolidated for pretrial purposes.
in july,the district court dismissed a substantial number of these cases,including plaintiffs,for failure to serve a timely notice of claim upon certain public defendants as required by new york law specifically,the district court dismissed more than suits against bpca,and another suits against other public and municipal entities.
iii.jimmy nolan law 
in the wake of these dismissals,the new york legislature enacted general municipal law,known as jimmy nolan law,which revived for one year all claims against public corporations for personal injuries sustained by workers who participated in rescue,recovery,or cleanup efforts.see mun.law a.the legislature explained that thousands of world trade center workers ha d developed disabling respiratory illnesses and other injuries at rates that greatly exceed those of the general population,and that those workers should not be denied their rights to seek just compensation simply because they were provided incorrect information about their work conditions,did not immediately recognize the casual connection between their injuries and their exposure,or were unaware of the applicable time limitations.state assembly mem.supp.legislation,reprinted in bill jacket for,ch,at july.following the law enactment,many workers,including plaintiffs,revived their claims against bpca.
iv.bpca challenge to jimmy nolan law 
in august,bpca moved for summary judgment against eight workers who had filed suit against bpca pursuant to jimmy nolan law,challenging the law as unconstitutional.bpca contended,first,that it had the capacity to raise such a challenge despite its status as a public benefit corporation,and,second,that the law violated its due process rights under the new york state constitution.the attorney general of the state of new york hereinafter the attorney general intervened to defend the law.
the district court hellerstein,agreed with bpca,and granted summary judgment in bpca favor.in re world trade ctr.lower manhattan disaster site,supp.in so ruling,the district court held that bpca is an entity independent of new york state and therefore has the capacity to challenge the constitutionality of state statutes.id.at.on the merits,the court held that jimmy nolan law does not fall within the narrow exception for revival statutes under new york law,and is unconstitutional under the due process clause of the new york state constitution,as applied to bpca.id.at.
on march,bpca moved to extend the district court ruling to an additional workers,including plaintiffs.finding no relevant factual differences between those workers and the eight whose claims were previously dismissed,the district court granted bpca motion.in re world trade ctr.lower manhattan disaster site,mc,ecf.plaintiffs and the attorney general now appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.matthews city of new york,cir.summary judgment is proper only if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.quoting fed.civ.a.we also review de novo a district court interpretation and application of state law.phansalkar andersen weinroth,cir.per curiam.
ii.bpca capacity to challenge jimmy nolan law 
a.the rule 
new york follows the traditional rule,which states that municipalities and other local governmental corporate entities and their officers lack capacity to mount constitutional challenges to acts of the state and state legislation.city of new york state of new york.such entities are purely creatures or agents of the state,and so can not have the right to contest the actions of their principal or creator affecting them in their governmental capacity.id.in other words,political power conferred by the legislature confers no vested right as against the government itself.id.quoting black river regulating dist.adirondack league club.this rule is also a necessary outgrowth of separation of powers doctrine it expresses the extreme reluctance of courts to intrude in the political relationships between the legislature,the state and its governmental subdivisions.id.at.
the new york court of appeals has recognized four exceptions to this general rule where a public corporation has express statutory authorization to bring suit where the legislation adversely affects a public corporation proprietary interest in a specific fund of moneys where the statute impinges upon home rule powers of a public corporation constitutionally guaranteed under article ix of the new york state constitution and where the public corporation asserts that,if it is obliged to comply with the statute,that very compliance will force the corporation to violate a constitutional proscription.see id.at.
resolution of the issue of whether bpca may mount its constitutional challenge would thus seemingly involve the straightforward application of the rule and its four recognized exceptions.however,bpca asserts that,before this rule may be applied,two criteria must first be met it must be determined that the public entity should be treated like the state,as determined by a particularized inquiry into the nature of the instrumentality and the statute claimed to be applicable to it and the statute must restrict the public benefit corporation governmental powers.we address each criterion in turn.
b.the particularized inquiry test 
in,long island rail road,the new york court of appeals recognized that public benefit corporations are not political subdivisions of the state but rather enjoy,for some purposes,an existence separate and apart from the state.the court explained that a particularized inquiry is therefore necessary to determine whether for the specific purpose at issue the public benefit corporation should be treated like the state.id.
consistent with this framework,the new york court of appeals has considered whether a public benefit corporation should be treated like the state for purposes of,inter alia,receiving immunity from punitive damages,id.at,falling within the scope of a statute prohibiting the defrauding of the state or any political subdivision thereof,people miller,internal quotation marks omitted,and providing economic relief on public construction contracts,john grace state.constr.fund.
it is unclear whether new york courts have applied the test in the present context that is,to determine whether a public benefit corporation should be treated like the state for the purpose of having the capacity to raise a constitutional challenge to a state statute.nonetheless,bpca urges us to apply the test here.were we to do so,bpca maintains,we would conclude that bpca should not be treated like the state and is therefore not subject to the bar imposed by the rule indeed,the district court concluded as much in its opinion below.see in re world trade ctr.lower manhattan disaster site,supp.at.
in response,the attorney general argues that,although public benefit corporations may not be identical to the state in every respect,they are indistinguishable from the state for the purpose of challenging a state statute.in other words,the attorney general contends that the rule is absolute,and does not turn on a particularized inquiry into the particular functions or purposes of the public corporation in question.rather,the relevant and dispositive factor is whether the entity remain s subject to the legislature ongoing control.intervenor reply br.at.
the attorney general asserts that these principles are plainly illustrated by the new york court of appeals decision in black river regulating district adirondack league club.in that case,the black river regulating district proposed a plan to build a reservoir and dam on the moose river to regulate river flow,and raised funds for the project by issuing certificates of indebtedness.black river,at.the legislature later passed a statute effectively barring the project.id.at.the district brought suit,challenging the statute as unconstitutional.id.at.the court of appeals held that the district lacked the power to raise such a challenge.id.at.
the court explained 
a regulating district charged with authority to carry out the public purpose is an agency of the state depending for its existence and performing its functions subject to the control and direction of the state.the number and nature of its powers are within the state absolute discretion and any alteration,impairment or destruction of those powers by the legislature presents no question of constitutionality.
id.at.the court further reasoned that the district had no special character different from that of the state,that its purpose was a state purpose,and that its issuance of certificates of indebtedness did not confer upon it an independent status by which it has standing.id.at.accordingly,the district suit was barred.see id.
although the attorney general argues that black river precludes bpca challenge,we believe that the decision significance is not so clear.as an initial matter,it is not evident whether,at the time of the court decision,the district was a public benefit corporation under new york law.the district enabling laws created river regulating districts as public corporations,and defined that term as including counties,towns,cities,villages,corporations created under this article and all other governmental agencies clothed with the power of levying general taxes.envtl.conserv.law.the law in effect in,meanwhile,defined public corporations as including municipal corporations,district corporations,and public benefit corporations,each of which were defined separately,ch.thus,we can not discern whether the district was,at the relevant point in time,a public benefit corporation as opposed to a municipal or district corporation a fact that potentially undermines black river significance to the present appeal 
even assuming the district was a public benefit corporation at the time of the court decision,it is not clear to us that black river altogether forecloses application of the test.as described above,the court observed that the district had no special character apart from that of the state,that its sole purpose was a state purpose,and that its financial authority conferred no independent standing.black river,at.this language is not inconsistent with the test.
our reading of black river is further complicated by a later decision by the new york court of appeals in patterson carey.in that case,the jones beach state parkway authority,a public benefit corporation,financed a new parkway through the sale of bonds,and charged tolls on the parkway to discharge its bond obligations.patterson.years later,the parkway authority announced a toll increase.id.at.the new york legislature quickly enacted a statute suspending the increase.id.at.the parkway authority and the institutional trustee for the authority bondholders filed suit against the state to declare the law unconstitutional.id.at.after concluding that the parkway authority and trustee had sufficient standing to bring suit,id.at,the court of appeals found the statute unconstitutional,id.at.
bpca interprets patterson as holding that a public benefit corporation has standing to bring a constitutional challenge to a state statute.appellee br.at.it is not clear,though,that patterson should be interpreted in this way for several reasons.first,the court of appeals discussion on standing is relegated to a footnote the main text of the opinion concerns the merits of the plaintiffs constitutional challenge and makes no mention of standing principles or the rule 
second,both the parkway authority and the institutional trustee for the bondholders served as plaintiffs.accordingly,the court had no need to consider whether the parkway authority,on its own,would have had the legal capacity to raise its challenge against the state.indeed,in concluding that the plaintiffs had standing,the court cited jeter ellenville central school district,apparently for the premise that,although a public entity might have procedural standing to participate in a suit challenging state legislation,it nevertheless lacks the substantive right to raise its own constitutional challenges.see jeter,at.this view is supported by the court merits discussion,which focuses on the constitutional rights of the bondholders,not the park authority.see patterson,at holding that the statute is arbitrary and deprives bondholders of a contractual right without due process of law emphasis added.
finally,although the court merits discussion reiterates the principle that a public authority enjoys an existence separate and apart from the state,even though it exercises a governmental function,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,that language speaks to whether the legislature impermissibly infringed the state comptroller exercise of his discretio
