church of scientology international csi appeals from judgments of the district court for the southern district of new york peter leisure,district judge dismissing appellant libel complaint.because we find that the challenged statements were not published with actual malice or were subsidiary in meaning to statements made without actual malice,we affirm the judgments of the district court.
background 
on may,time magazine published a,cover article entitled scientology the cult of greed the article.the article,written by richard behar behar,was highly critical of scientology,which it described as pos ing as a religion but being really a ruthless global scam,and narrated various instances of wrongdoing by a number of individual scientologists.csi filed a complaint alleging libel against behar and time.magazine and its parent company time warner,collectively,time.the complaint alleged as false and defamatory the following statements from the article 
paragraph of the complaint 
t he church survives by intimidating members and critics in a manner.
scientology is quite likely the most ruthless,the most classically terroristic cult the country has ever seen.
those who criticize the,doctors,lawyers and even find themselves framed for fictional crimes,beaten up or threatened with death.
paragraph of the complaint 
occasionally a scientologist business antics land him in jail.last august a former devotee named steven fishman began serving a prison term in florida.his crime stealing blank stock confirmation slips from his employer,a major brokerage house,to use as proof that he owned stock entitling him to join dozens of successful lawsuits.fishman made roughly million this way from to and spent as much as of the loot on scientology books and tapes.
scientology denies any tie to the fishman scam,a claim strongly disputed by both fishman and his longtime psychiatrist,uwe geertz,a prominent florida hypnotist.both men claim that when arrested,fishman was ordered by the church to kill geertz and then do an eoc,or end of cycle,which is church jargon for suicide.
paragraph of the complaint 
one source of funds for the los church is the notorious,stock exchange in vancouver,british columbia,often called the scam capital of the world.
baybak,who runs a public relations company staffed with scientologists,apparently has no ethics problem with engineering a hostile takeover of a firm he is hired to promote.
what these guys do is take over companies,hype the stock,sell their shares,and then there nothing left they stole this man property.
paragraph of the complaint 
the lotticks lost their son,noah,who jumped from a manhattan hotel clutching,virtually the only money he had not yet turned over to scientology.his parents blame the church and would like to sue but are frightened by the organization reputation for ruthlessness.
his death inspired his father edward,a physician,to start his own investigation of the church.we thought scientology was something like dale carnegie,lottick says.i now believe it a school for psychopaths.their therapies are manipulations.they take the best and brightest people and destroy them.
it was too late.from noah friends at dianetics read the card that accompanied a bouquet of flowers at lottick funeral.yet no scientology staff members bothered to show up.
paragraph of the complaint 
the next month the rowes flew to glendale,where they shuttled daily from a local hotel to a dianetics center.we thought they were brilliant people because they seemed to know so much about us,recalls dee.then we realized our hotel room must have been bugged.after bolting from the center,poorer,the rowes say,they were chased repeatedly by scientologists on foot and in cars.
paragraph of the complaint 
in a court filing,one of the cult many church of spiritual million in income just for.
in june of,the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that the statements,none of which mentioned csi by name,were not of and concerning csi.on november,the district court granted the motion to dismiss in part,finding that certain of the statements complained of could not be read as referring to csi.church of scientology int l time warner.time i.specifically,the court found that parts of statement and all of statements,and could not reasonably be considered to be of and concerning csi.see id.at.defendants then answered the complaint,and behar asserted counterclaims against csi for harassment and violation of the fair credit reporting act.the parties agreed to focus discovery on the issue of actual malice and to defer discovery on the issue of truth and falsity.
after two and a half years of discovery,the district court granted summary judgment to defendants as to all of the remaining statements,except for statement,on the grounds of lack of actual malice.church of scientology int l time warner,time ii.on reconsideration,the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on statement,that the vancouver stock exchange the vse was one source of funds for the church the vse statement,based on the subsidiary meaning doctrine,and dismissed the complaint.church of scientology int l time warner,time iii.
csi then moved for an order modifying the district court opinion in time iii,arguing that it was now stating a claim for nominal damages,for which it did not need to prove actual malice.the district court declined to address the merits of the claim because it found csi motion to be a procedurally defective motion for reargument.church of scientology int l time warner,civ,wl,at,time iv.
on september,csi moved for leave to amend the complaint to assert a claim for nominal damages premised on a finding that the disputed statements were demonstrably false.the district court denied the motion,holding that allowing csi to amend its complaint five years after it brought the action,and after summary judgment had been granted against it,would be unduly prejudicial to the defendants.church of scientology int l time warner,wl,at,time v.the district court also held that amendment would be futile,since a public figure claiming even nominal damages is still required to demonstrate actual malice under new york times sullivan,d.see time v,wl,at.although behar counterclaims were still pending,the parties agreed that these claims would be dismissed without prejudice,on the understanding that they could be refiled should the complaint be reinstated.csi moved for the district court to enter a final judgment dismissing its complaint.the court granted the motion,church of scientology int l time warner,civ,wl,at,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,csi challenges the district court rulings in time i through time v on the grounds that the district court improperly ruled that portions of the article allegedly defamatory statements were not of and concerning csi,improperly disregarded csi evidence that the statements were made with purposeful avoidance of the truth,committed plain error in dismissing the vse statement under the subsidiary meaning doctrine,and erred in refusing to permit csi to pursue a claim for nominal damages premised on a finding of falsity.csi has not appealed the district court decision with respect to statements and.
libel,a method of defamation expressed in writing or print,is a common law cause of action and applies separate standards to plaintiffs who are private individuals and those who are public figures.see celle filipino reporter,cir.csi concedes that it is a public figure therefore to prevail it must show that the statements it complains of were of and concerning csi,likely to be understood as defamatory by the ordinary person,false,and published with actual malice,that is,either knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard of the truth.see id.in contrast,a private plaintiff need only prove that false and defamatory statements of and concerning the plaintiff were made with gross negligence.see karaduman newsday.
of these inquiries,the first two should ordinarily be resolved at the pleading stage,while resolution of the falsity and actual malice inquiries typically requires discovery.in this case,we hold that csi has failed to establish ac
