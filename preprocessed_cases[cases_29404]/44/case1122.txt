opinion of the court 
federal mogul global and its affiliates filed for chapter bankruptcy and sought to resolve liability through the creation of a trust under g as part of its reorganization plan,it sought to transfer rights under insurance liability policies to the trust.appellants had provided liability policies to the debtors prior to bankruptcy and objected that the transfer violated the policies provisions.federal mogul contended that a b preempts those provisions,and the bankruptcy and district courts agreed.we will affirm.
for almost two decades,chapter bankruptcies have employed a statutory mechanism created by g to resolve massive asbestos liability and to evaluate claims and allocate payments to current and future asbestos claimants.when this provision requirements are satisfied,the bankruptcy court may issue an injunction channeling all current and future claims based on the debtor asbestos liability to a personal injury trust.this case centers on these trusts.
the salience of g trusts stems from the ongoing dilemma of asbestos liability,the mass tort litigation in the united states.stephen carroll et,rand inst.for civil justice,asbestos litigation as courts and commentators have noted,a just and efficient resolution of asbestos claims has often eluded the traditional tort system see in re congoleum,cir in re combustion eng g,cir see also richard nagareda,mass torts in a world of settlement.the aggregate pressure of such claims has led to a variety of approaches to asbestos liability but congress has yet to create the national asbestos scheme requested by the supreme court,amchem,windsor,d citing judicial conference of the,report of the judicial conference ad hoc committee on asbestos litigation,see also ortiz fibreboard,d initial attempts to employ the class action device to resolve the claims of present and future asbestos victims failed to adequately protect the interests of absent class members.amchem,at.ortiz,at.
a consequence of the failure to create a comprehensive resolution to asbestos litigation has been a reliance on the bankruptcy code to provide some predictability and regularity in addressing mass tort liability.bankruptcy has proven an attractive alternative to the tort system for corporations because it permits a global resolution and discharge of current and future liability,while claimants interests are protected by the bankruptcy court power to use future earnings to compensate similarly situated tort claimants equitably.elizabeth gibson,fed.judicial,judicial management of mass tort bankruptcy cases.the primary bankruptcy innovation for addressing mass tort liability has been the trust,which first appeared in the bankruptcy proceedings of the johns manville corporation,the largest producer of products.lloyd dixon et,rand inst.for civil justice,asbestos bankruptcy trusts an overview of trust structure and activity with detailed reports on the largest trusts hereinafter rand trust report.in that case,the bankruptcy court issued a channeling injunction under requiring future asbestos claims be brought against a trust created to compensate victims,and barring actions against the reorganized debtor,its subsidiaries,or any settling insurance company in re johns manville,aff,aff sub,kane johns manville in re johns manville,cir.
congress codified the johns manville trust mechanism as a creative solution to help protect future asbestos claimants,at,reprinted in,in the bankruptcy reform act of,stat,codified at g h.congress intended the trusts as a means to give full consideration to the interests of future claimants by ensuring their claims would be compensated comparably to present claims,while simultaneously enabling corporations saddled with asbestos liability to obtain the fresh start promised by bankruptcy,at.to achieve these goals and protect the due process rights of future claimants,section g imposed many statutory prerequisites that must be satisfied before a channeling injunction may issue combustion eng g,at.
as of may,there were asbestos trusts,with several more in process.lloyd dixon geoffrey mcgovern,rand inst.for civil justice,asbestos bankruptcy trusts and tort compensation.through,the trusts have paid about million claims valued at roughly billion.gov t accountability office,supra,at.there is substantial similarity among the various trusts in structure and function.nearly all the trusts are governed by trustees who manage financial affairs,while a committee of advocates,consisting of representatives of current and future claimants,must approve substantial trust activities rand trust report,supra,at.moreover,like the johns manville trust on which they are modeled asbestos trusts receive funding from three primary sources debtor cash,debtor stock,and insurance settlements.see id.at app.b categorizing the initial funding of the largest asbestos trusts as cash from debtor s,stock from debtors s sic,insurance settlements,or other assets.while some trusts have been funded primarily with an initial infusion of cash from the debtor,id.at,and others have consisted primarily of funds obtained from insurance,id.at,most rely on a mix of assets.finally,all trusts have trust distribution protocols tdps to govern how claims are processed and compensated these procedures are approved as part of the bankruptcy reorganization plan but may later be modified.id.at.
as a scheme,g trusts have drawn considerable commentary while congress sought to protect the interests of current claimants by requiring that of them approve the trust,some have suggested that this provision,without the cram down otherwise available in bankruptcy,grants plaintiffs attorneys a de facto veto over reorganization,allowing them to leverage concessions at the expense of other stakeholders todd brown,section g without compromise voting rights and the asbestos bankruptcy paradox,colum.bus,in re congoleum,at noting that,in the absence of a cramdown provision,t he realities of securing favorable votes from thousands of claimants to meet the approval requirement in g forc e debtors to work closely with the few attorneys who represent large numbers of injured claimants.others criticize the voting procedure because it allows the more numerous holders of small claims to outvote those with mesothelioma and other serious injuries,who,unlike in a class action settlement,can not opt out of the trust mechanism.see nagareda,supra,at.our case law has acknowledged some of these concerns.in combustion engineering,we held that the use of a structure that granted current asbestos claimants privileged treatment prior to voting on the reorganization plan may have lacked both the good faith and indicia of support among creditors required by the bankruptcy code,as well as likely contravening the constitutional guarantee of procedural due process.at.we also noted that the apparent preferential treatment granted to slightly impaired claimants was especially problematic in the asbestos context,where a voting majority can be made to consist of claimants whose interests may be adverse to those of claimants with more severe injuries.id.at.a later case presented an allegation of collusion between the debtor and the asbestos claimants counsel suggesting that the debtor had sold out insurers by setting up a system in which they would pay newly silica claims in exchange for the asbestos claimants casting their votes in favor of the reorganization plan.in re global indus,cir en banc.we characterized this assertion as a profoundly serious charge not without record support.id.
unlike in our earlier cases,these issues are not properly before us.conflicts of interest or other procedural and structural deficiencies are properly raised in proceedings to confirm the reorganization plan.nevertheless,london market insurers contend the plan here did not satisfy the confirmation requirements of g because the debtor employed complicated financial maneuvers to avoid adequate trust funding.but no objection was raised before the bankruptcy court in the confirmation proceedings,and we decline to entertain a collateral attack on a final,judgment.moreover,none of the parties here allege,nor does the record provide,evidence of collusion of the sort that was so troubling in combustion engineering and global technologies.
furthermore,the trusts appear to have fulfilled congress expectation that they would serve the interests of both current and future asbestos claimants and corporations saddled with asbestos liability.in particular,observers have noted the trusts effectiveness in remedying some of the intractable pathologies of asbestos litigation,especially given the continued lack of a viable alternative providing a just and comprehensive resolution.empirical research suggests the trusts considerably reduce transaction costs and attorneys fees over comparable rates in the tort system.compare rand trust report,supra,at xiv citing evidence that the claimants received of trust expenditures,while limiting attorneys contingent fees at around,with carroll,supra,at determining that in the tort system claimants ultimately received of total spending on asbestos litigation,with contingency fee rates averaging of claimants recoveries,and judicial conference of the,supra,at,noting that transaction costs in asbestos litigation exceeded victims recoveries by nearly two to one.recently,the trusts have required more rigorous medical evidence,and significantly reduced the valuation for claims.francis mcgovern,the evolution of asbestos bankruptcy trust distribution plans,ann.surv.am.others have stressed that problems over the difficulty of reconciling competing interests of present and future claimants are not limited to the creation of g trusts,but extend to the current state of asbestos and mass tort litigation generally.see nagareda,supra,at observing that the challenge raised in combustion engineering of setting terms for both present and future claimants is not limited to the bankruptcy context but forms the fundamental problem posed by any peace arrangement for mass tort litigation.nevertheless,we leave such systemic public policy questions to congress.
in sum,section trusts are the only national statutory scheme extant to resolve asbestos litigation through a process.in function,the trusts are similar to workers compensation or other administrative remedies that employ valuation grids to compensate injuries,subject to individualized and judicial review.unlike those schemes,the trusts place the authority to adjudicate claims in private rather than public hands,a difference that has at times given us and other observers pause,since it endows potentially interested parties with considerable authority.
with this context,we turn to the specific facts of this case.
on october,federal mogul global,one of the world largest manufacturers of automobile parts,and over affiliates filed chapter bankruptcy petitions in the district of delaware.the principal purpose of the petitions was the resolution of federal mogul enormous liabilities.the company alleges that claims were pending on the petition date,with many more anticipated in the future,and asserts it expended over million in the preceding year defending and indemnifying asbestos claims.see generally in re federal mogul global,cir describing the origins of the federal mogul bankruptcy and the t ens of thousands of asbestos claims against the debtor at issue on appeal.
in its proposed plan for reorganization,federal mogul sought to obtain an injunction under g to channel present and future claims to a trust.the plan assigned various assets to the trust,including federal mogul rights to recovery under liability insurance.the plan also contained insurance neutrality provisions granting insurers the right to assert against the trust any defense to coverage already available under the policies,excepting only the defense that the transfer to the trust violated the policies provisions.
insurers here had issued liability policies to federal mogul prior to bankruptcy.they objected to the plan confirmation,asserting the plan violated the policies provisions standard clauses in liability policies that bar the insured from transferring the policies or insurance rights without the insurers consent.see lee russ,couch on insurance ed.federal mogul argued the provisions were preempted under a b,which provides that a chapter reorganization plan shall provide adequate means for its implementation,potentially including transfer of estate property,notwithstanding otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law.the parties agreed to bifurcate the proceedings and resolve this issue separately,with the right to appeal the bankruptcy court preemption judgment.on november,with all other objections resolved,the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan of reorganization,and the district court affirmed.the plan went into effect on december.
on march,the bankruptcy court issued its preemption order and memorandum opinion,holding the bankruptcy code preempted the provisions within the insurers policies.in re federal mogul global.it reasoned that permitted the assignment of the insurance rights to the bankruptcy estate,and a allowed transfer of the rights to the g trust.id.at citing in re combustion eng g,at.it also relied on state doctrine that assignment after the occurrence giving rise to liability does not violate provisions,since there will be no additional risk to the insurance companies by virtue of the assignments.id.at.the court also rejected a number of the insurers contentions,holding that the presumption against preemption was inapplicable given the plain meaning of a,that the preemptive scope of a reaches private contracts,and that the asbestos insurance policies were not executory contracts subject to.id.at.
the district court affirmed.in re federal mogul global.the court first determined that the notwithstanding clause in a evinced clear congressional intent to expressly preempt conflicting state law.id.at.it then turned to the scope of preemption,declining to entertain the insurers various arguments to distinguish the holding in combustion engineering and agreeing with the bankruptcy court that the case was dispositive on the question of whether a preempted insurance policies provisions.id.at.although the court believed that this conclusion effectively ends the matter,it went on to address insurers statutory interpretation claims.id.at.it distinguished as contrary to circuit precedent and plain statutory meaning a ninth circuit holding,rooted in legislative history,that limited the scope of a to that of a similar clause in a preempting only nonbankruptcy law relating to financial condition.id.at citing pac.gas cal.ex.rel.cal.dep t of toxic substances control,cir.turning to the parade of horribles the insurers claimed would ensue from a broad preemptive reading the court dismissed them as speculative and declined to construct a limiting principle when the relief sought fell within the heartland of a.id.at citing cable telecomms.ass gulf power,d.the court concluded by noting that the assignment of the insurance policies was consistent with public policy,since the contrary result would grant the insurers a windfall because debtors with sizeable insurance assets could never avail themselves of the very trust meant to alleviate crushing asbestos liability.id.at.

insurers contend the disputed issue is one of first impression.federal mogul argues,and the bankruptcy and district courts agreed,that our opinion in combustion engineering,determined that a preempts provisions that would otherwise bar the transfer of insurance rights to a g trust.
like the present case,combustion engineering arose from the bankruptcy proceedings of a corporation that sought to channel liabilities to a g trust funded in part through insurance.at.as here,various of the debtor insurers claimed assignment to the trust would violate the terms of their policies.id.at.unlike here,the plan at issue in combustion engineering involved the participation of affiliates in the trust in return for a bar against asbestos claims,a provision we ultimately determined exceeded the scope of the bankruptcy court jurisdiction.id.at.
the preemption of provisions was not one of the paramount issues on appeal,id.at,but the question was raised in the proceedings below and the parties briefs,and we discussed it briefly in a section on the appellate standing of london market insurers to challenge the reorganization plan.we held that,w ith respect to the provisions,we agree with the district court that even if the subject insurance policies purported to prohibit assignment of combustion engineering insurance proceeds,these provisions would not prevent the assignment of proceeds to the bankruptcy estate.combustion eng g,at.in a footnote,we expanded 
section effectively preempts any contractual provision that purports to limit or restrict the rights of a debtor to transfer or assigns sic its interest in bankruptcy.c a n interest of the debtor in property becomes property of the estate notwithstanding any provision in an agreement,transfer instrument,or applicable nonbankruptcy law a that restricts or conditions transfer of such interest by the debtor.the bankruptcy code expressly contemplates the inclusion of debtor insurance policies in the bankruptcy estate.section a provides 
notwithstanding any otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law,a plan shall 
provide adequate means for the plan implementation,such as 
b transfer of all or any part of property of the estate to one or more entities,whether organized before or after the confirmation of such plan.
this statement is clearer in context.there was no dispute over whether combustion engineering could transfer its insurance rights to the bankruptcy estate,a right under circuit law at the time.see estate of lellock prudential ins.of,cir we hold that an insurance policy is property of the estate within a.rather,as we noted elsewhere in the opinion,the assignment issue hinged on whether combustion engineering could contribute its rights to proceeds under certain insurance policies to the asbestos pi trust.combustion eng g,at see also id.at the bankruptcy court found the assignment of insurance proceeds to the asbestos pi trust did not impair the rights of insurers.further context comes from our stated agreement with the district court on this issue,since that court had held that the provisions did not bar transfer to the trust moreover,although the language refers to the bankruptcy estate alone,the reference to section which describes transfers from the estate to other entities makes it clear that we contemplated transfers to a trust as well as inclusion in the estate,since the citation would otherwise be superfluous.see in re congoleum,wl,at,describing the two stage analysis necessarily implicated in combustion engineering requiring first transfer to the estate and then to the asbestos trust,and noting that any other conclusion would make the citation to a nonsensical.
as this context demonstrates,the question we addressed in combustion engineering was the same we confront here whether a debtor could transfer its insurance rights to a g trust notwithstanding the policies antiassignment provisions footnote sets forth our conclusion that any objection to the reorganization plan based on the provisions could be overcome through a combination of and.furthermore,in a recent en banc holding,we held that the discussion of provisions in combustion engineering should suffice to resolve whether insurance policies could be transferred to a trust.in re global indus,at internal citations removed id.at nygaard,dissenting o ur holding in combustion engineering validated the bankruptcy code authorization to preempt policy provisions.see also motor vehicle cas.thorpe insulation in re thorpe insulation,cir citing combustion engineering for the proposition that congress has expressly preempted appellants contract rights restricting the transfer of insurance rights to a g trust,amended by cir collier on bankruptcy alan resnick henry sommer,ed.citing combustion engineering for the proposition that a preempts state law 
nevertheless,the proper scope of a was not the focus of the many disputes in combustion engineering,and our brief discussion of the provision did not examine the statutory language,structure,and legislative history of for a thorough preemption analysis.we turn to these factors now.
section of the bankruptcy code establishes the contents of a plan for reorganization under chapter.subsection a,at issue here,reads in part 
a notwithstanding any otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law,a plan shall 
provide adequate means for the plan implementation,such as 
b transfer of all or any part of the property of the estate to one or more entities,whether organized before or after the confirmation of such plan.
besides the transfer of estate property,a a j lists nine other transactions that can constitute adequate means for plan implementation.collier notes,the types of means listed in section a are clearly illustrative and not exclusive.collier on bankruptcy.
when a federal law contains an express preemption clause,we focus on the plain wording of the clause,which necessarily contains the best evidence of congress preemptive intent.chamber of commerce of whiting,d quoting csx,easterwood,d.the plain language of a evinces congress clear intent to preempt state law.
the critical words here are notwithstanding any otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law the supreme court has held that a notwithstanding clause clearly signals the drafter intention that the provisions of the notwithstanding section override conflicting provisions,noting numerous instances when the courts of appeals have interpreted similar notwithstanding language to supersede all other laws,stating that a clearer statement is difficult to imagine.cisneros alpine ridge,d alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted quoting in part air guard fed.labor relations,cir,and citing in re fcx,cir.we have specifically cited a as an instance where congress used explicit language to demonstrate its intent to displace state nonbankruptcy law,integrated solutions,at,and two other courts of appeals have determined that the notwithstanding clause in a expressly preempts state law,pac.gas,at in re fcx,at.
our conclusion that a preempts state law does not end our inquiry,since we must still identify the domain expressly by the statutory language.lohr,at.quoting cipollone liggett,d.even in instances of express preemption,the presumption in favor of state law applies,requiring us to accept a plausible alternative reading that disfavors preemption.bates dow agrosciences llc,d.federal mogul argues that the plain text of forecloses any alternative reading and requires a preemptive scope that reaches the transfer of insurance rights at issue here.but insurers offer several limiting principles they contend construe just as sensibly while comporting with traditional respect for state law.
insurers first argue from the structure of a.section a contains eight numbered subsections,specifying the required elements of a reorganization plan.as discussed,under subsection it also contains ten transactions,a j,that can constitute adequate means for the plan implementation as required by a.these means include the transfer of the property of the estate,a b,at issue here,but also,among others,the debtor retention of estate property,a sale or distribution of estate property,d cancellation or modification of any indenture,f and curing or waiving of a default,g.
insurers propose a reading of a that excises a a j from the scope of a,contending the means listed there are not subject to the notwithstanding clause.in other words,insurers draw a sharp dichotomy between what they style as the illustrative examples of transactions enumerated as adequate means and the rest of subsection a.br.for certain appellants at.
we disagree.it is hardly natural to read the notwithstanding clause in a as applying only to some,but not all,of subsection a,an approach that contravenes any normal method of statutory interpretation.the presumption is that the statute flows in orderly progression from general statement to specific instance so that ordinarily the qualification of a later clause upon an earlier one is to be expected.norman singer shambie singer,sutherland statutes and statutory construction ed.this approach is also at odds with the interpretation of the fourth circuit,which held that,b y its plain language,the notwithstanding clause encompassed a d.in re fcx,at.it could hardly be read otherwise no other express preemption provision is necessary.we also agree with the district court that the contrary interpretation would have absurd results many of the means listed would be impossible to accomplish without preempting nonbankruptcy law for these reasons,we conclude the preemptive scope of a reaches all the provisions in subsection a.
london market insurers further contend the phrase otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law in a does not encompass private contracts.they note that elsewhere in the bankruptcy code congress used language that explicitly preempts private contracts as well as governmental enactments.see,l notwithstanding any provision in a contract,a lease,or applicable law notwithstanding any contractual provision or applicable law.
we agree with the district court in rejecting this interpretation.many of the transactions listed under a implicate contractual rights,and so demonstrate clear congressional intent that the phrase nonbankruptcy law encompass private contracts.the fourth circuit endorsed this view when it held that a preempts the contractual provisions of patronage certificates.in re fcx,at.moreover,the supreme court has held that the phrase all other law in a preemption provision preempts private contracts.norfolk ry.am.train dispatchers ass n,d.since a contract has no legal force apart from the state law that acknowledges its binding character,the court concluded that the preemptive language at issue effects an override of contractual obligations by suspending application of the law that makes the contract binding.id.at.this reasoning applies to a and the insurance policies at issue.accordingly,on the strength of statutory language and precedent,we conclude the phrase otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law encompasses private contracts,including the insurance policies at issue here.
insurers also claim that the context and structure of the bankruptcy code support a narrow reading of preemption.see united sav.ass of timbers of inwood forest,d describing the interpretation of the bankruptcy code as a holistic endeavor where a single ambiguous provision is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme.they point to other code provisions they argue would be rendered superfluous by a broad interpretation of a scope,contending that congress could not have intended to make a hash out of a carefully defined and balanced statutory scheme.
as an initial matter,a by its express terms does not displace other portions of the bankruptcy code.other code provisions that place specific limitations on the satisfaction of a lien,b a,on the curing of a default,id.b,on the issuance of securities notwithstanding certain securities laws,id,or on the use or sale of estate property,id.l,still operate to condition a had congress wanted to limit the preemptive scope of based on specific sections of the bankruptcy code,as insurers suggest,it knew how to do so the bankruptcy code features many instances when the exercise of a statutory right is expressly subject to the provisions of another part of the code but rather than addressing the relationship between a and the rest of the code,congress unambiguously limited the scope of the notwithstanding clause in a to nonbankruptcy law,leaving other code provisions intact.
insurers particularly urge that a broad reading of the preemptive scope of a is inconsistent with,which governs the implementation of the reorganization plan.section a provides,notwithstanding any otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law,rule,or regulation relating to financial condition,the debtor and any entity organized or to be organized for the purpose of carrying out the plan shall carry out the plan and shall comply with any orders of the court.insurers argue it would be illogical for the scope of preemption in,which provides what the plan should contain,to exceed that provided for in,which provides for the plan implementation,and so the two provisions must be read in pari materia.
this contention finds support in pacific gas,where the court confronted a bankruptcy reorganization plan that would have allowed the debtor,a public utility,to contravene state law by disaggregating.id.at.the court limited the express preemptive scope of a to that of a that is,to state laws relating to financial condition and remanded.id.the court reached this conclusion based primarily on legislative history,which we will discuss,but also reasoned that importing the language of a into a made structural sense,because the two sections work in tandem a establishes what a confirmable reorganization plan must contain,while a provides for the implementation of the plan.id.at.
although we regard pacific gas as factually distinguishable from this case we are also unconvinced that and are so similar that they must be read together.see tooahnippah hickel,d declining to read two sections dealing with the same subject in pari materia when the coverage of these sections is not identical.collier describes the plan provisions under as,collier,which would seem to obviate the need for subsequent implementation under.federal mogul suggests that,since appears in a subchapter addressing postconfirmation matters,it implicates a different stage in the bankruptcy proceeding from and provides a safe harbor for certain actions taken in conformity with the plan.this interpretation is at least plausible,especially in light of the absence of any contrary case law examining preemption under a section is also distinguishable from because it encompasses orders of the court,suggesting that the limited preemptive language might serve primarily as a check on the court authority to trump law in supplemental orders enacting the plan.case law supports this interpretation,since nearly all of the cases construing have involved the proper scope of the bankruptcy court postconfirmation jurisdiction and authority 
we need not resolve the scope of a,however,because principles of statutory interpretation militate against assimilating the two sections where congress employed different words.w here the legislature has inserted a provision in only one of two statutes that deal with closely related subject matter,it is reasonable to infer that the failure to include that provision in the other statute was deliberate rather than inadvertent.sutherland statutes and statutory construction.thus,limiting words that appear in one provision are not ordinarily read into another that omits them,because we presume that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.burlington santa fe ry.white,d quoting in part russello united states,d moreover,even if and were properly read in pari materia,where two statutes deal with the same subject matter,the more recent enactment prevails as the latest expression of legislative will.sutherland statutes and statutory construction.pacific gas reversed this presumption by making the reading of the amendment of conditional on the earlier passage of in.we believe the logical course is to assume that congress was aware of the preemptive language of when it subsequently amended to contain a preemptive provision with a different scope.therefore,we decline to limit the preemptive scope of a to those state laws relating to financial condition 
in sum,we find no textual support to limit the scope of the notwithstanding clause only to part of a,to state enactments,or to the preemptive reach of a.the plain language of a evinces clear congressional intent for a preemptive scope that includes the transactions listed under a as adequate means for the plan implementation,including the transfer of property authorized by a b.the plain language also reaches private contracts enforced by state common law,and overcomes the presumption against preemption.as we will discuss,we do not believe that the scope is limitless,but it is broad enough to encompass the provisions of insurance policies that purport to bar transfer to a g trust.
insurers also urge a narrow reading of a on the basis of prior practice and legislative history.they suggest preemption deviates from bankruptcy practice and should be disfavored,and legislative history establishes that congress intended the revisions to the code to be minor.but the evidence from these sources is too equivocal to overcome the plain meaning of the text,which provides compelling evidence of congress intent to preempt contrary law.
the legislative history of the notwithstanding clause in a is thin and inconclusive.section,enacted as part of the bankruptcy code in,codified a similar provision at b of the earlier bankruptcy act.pac.gas,at.in its original form,a specified,as it does now,the elements a chapter reorganization plan shall contain,mandating that it provide adequate means including the transfer of all or any of the property of the estate.an act to establish a uniform law on the subject of bankruptcies,a,stat.it contained no preemption provision.but a,also enacted as part of the bankruptcy code,provided for the execution of a reorganization plan notwithstanding any otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law relating to financial condition.id,at.during debate,one senator read this preemptive language to encompass as well,noting that under i f the reorganization plan is confirmed,then any action proposed in the plan may be taken notwithstanding any otherwise applicable bankruptcy law in accordance with section a of title.cong.rec.statement of deconcini 
the addition of the clause notwithstanding any otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law to a was first proposed in,reintroduced in,and enacted as part of the bankruptcy and federal judgeship act of.this modification occasioned little discussion.when originally proposed as part of a package of technical amendments intended to redress errors in printing,spelling,punctuation,grammar,syntax,and numeration,the changes to were described as mak ing it clear that the rules governing what is to be contained in the reorganization plan are those specified in this section,at,in,a senate report described the amendment as making technical stylistic changes,at.the amendment,including the notwithstanding clause,passed the following year as part of a subsection labeled miscellaneous amendments to title,subtitle h,stat.
insurers argue that the relative congressional silence on the amendment of is telling.courts will not presume a departure from bankruptcy practice in the absence of clear congressional intent.hamilton lanning,d cohen de la cruz,d pac.gas,at.insurers characterize practice as requiring reorganization plans to conform to state law,arguing that an amendment characterized as technical and stylistic does not demonstrate congressional intent to substantially revise bankruptcy practice.this argument was endorsed by the ninth circuit in limiting the preemptive scope of to laws relating to financial condition,pac.gas,at,and it also finds support,insurers claim,in the supreme court ruling in cohen,which found that a stylistic change enacted in the same amendments at issue here did not alter the meaning of a different provision of the bankruptcy code,at.
we see no reason to question insurers account of bankruptcy practice,which seems borne out by case law and commentary but we disagree with the inference that this practice,coupled with the thin legislative history of,establishes their proposed narrow preemptive scope for.
pre code bankruptcy practice was not the law when the notwithstanding clause was added to in the existing law was the bankruptcy code.the code substantially altered earlier practice,see generally david skeel,debt dominion a history of bankruptcy law in america describing the code transformative effect on bankruptcy as we know it,including the addition of the preemptive language in that modified prior practice and allowed the implementation of a plan notwithstanding some nonbankruptcy laws the fifteenth edition of collier,which came out after the code,broke with prior editions admonition that a plan terms may be required to conform to state law,and stated instead that under,a plan may propose such actions notwithstanding nonbankruptcy law or agreements.in re kizzac mgmt,quoting collier on bankruptcy at ed.case law from the period between and generally,although not unanimously,held that preempted state law.see in re taddeo,cir holding that,since a g provides the authority to cure a default in a chapter proceeding,a state law to the contrary must fall before the bankruptcy code valente sav.bank of rockville,concluding that a g allows for the curing of defaults notwithstanding state court judgments under the supremacy clause in re kizzac mgmt,at holding that a e grants the bankruptcy court the power to compel an assignment rather than a satisfaction of a mortgage but see in re celeste court apartments,finding no evidence in the unamended text of or its legislative history that congress intended it to upset a state court judgment on a defaulted mortgage.taken together,this evidence suggests that the amendment did not mark a sharp break with earlier practice under the code,but rather clarified and expanded the scope of preemption under.notably,this conclusion was endorsed by the fourth circuit.see in re fcx,at we do not understand the amendment to a to have effected a substantive change in prior law.
but whatever the proper characterization of prior practice,it deserves little weight here.we decline to rely on it,or on a thin and vague legislative history that says nearly nothing about the intended preemptive scope of a,to overcome the plain and unambiguous meaning of the words congress chose.as always,the most authoritative indicators of what congress intended are the words that it chose in drafting the statute.united states lavin,cir.thus,while practice informs our understanding of the language of the bankruptcy code,it can not overcome that language.hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.w here the meaning of the bankruptcy code text is itself clear its operation is unimpeded by contrary prior practice.id.alteration and omissions in original quoting bfp resolution trust,d.here,congress chose words that it employed throughout the bankruptcy code to mandate preemption,words the supreme court has interpreted as the clearest possible statement of preemptive intent.it would be an odd method of interpretation to rummage deep into the legislative history,and,finding practically nothing,conclude that this silence implies that congress could not have meant what it said when it wrote the statute.the more sensible course reads the statutory text itself as indicative of congressional intent,which,based on the unambiguous language here,was to preempt nonbankruptcy state and federal law.
the supreme court opinion in cohen supports this view.there,the petitioner argued the addition of the phrase to the extent obtained by to a a,which barred discharge from liability for fraud,limited recovery from his estate to the actual amount of fraud and did not include the treble damages awarded by the bankruptcy court in an adversary proceeding.cohen,at.in rejecting this argument,the court turned first to the plain language of the provision,noting that the petitioner proposed interpretation was at odds with both the most straightforward reading of the statute as well as the phrase meaning in parallel provisions.id.at.only after exhausting the statute wording did the court turn to the provision history,noting that,in addition to its description in the legislative history as only a stylistic change,the language of the amendment in no way signals an intention to narrow the established scope of the fraud exception.id.at.if congress wished to limit the exception to the amount of actual fraud,the court continued,one would expect congress to have made unmistakably clear its intent.id.
as this overview makes clear,the legislative history of the amendment to the bankruptcy code was a minor piece of corroborating evidence in an opinion that looked primarily to plain text of the provision to discern congressional intent.fidelity to this approach in this case demonstrates that congress made its intent clear.as we have discussed,the most straightforward reading of a cuts against insurers proposed narrow interpretation.moreover,unlike the ambiguous amendment in cohen,the addition of the notwithstanding clause to is an unmistakably clear signal of congressional intent to preempt that overcomes any inference based on passing references to technical or stylistic changes.in short,we believe cohen mandates rather than undermines an interpretation derived from a statute plain text.
having examined the history of,we find nothing that indicates we should read its preemptive scope narrowly.while practice may suggest that historically courts did not allow a reorganization plan to preempt contrary state law,the code altered that prior practice.the thin legislative history of the amendment of characterizing the change as stylistic and technical does not overcome the plain and explicit language of the preemption provision.that language unambiguously provides for preemption,at least in this context,and we give its meaning effect.
although our discussion resolves the legal question before us,it bears noting that preemption here furthers the purposes of the bankruptcy code.the debtor here seeks to use its existing assets to address current and future claims arising out of past occurrences and resolve its asbestos liability,a goal consonant with the fresh start purpose of bankruptcy.because a g trust is created only through a chapter proceeding,a contractual limitation on the assignment of the debtors property to a trust functions analogously to contract provisions that alter a debtor rights in the event of insolvency.such provisions are preempted under c b,which provides that an interest of the debtor in property becomes property of the estate notwithstanding any provision in an agreement,transfer instrument,or applicable nonbankruptcy law that is conditioned on the debtor insolvency.the purpose of this provision is to prevent creditors and others from employing a debtor bankruptcy filing to diminish contractual rights.its inclusion in the code establishes that preemption in this instance where the transfer of insurance rights corresponds with the transfer of the debtor preexisting liabilities into an asbestos trust authorized by the code furthers the purposes of bankruptcy.in re thorpe insulation,at holding that c itself preempts provisions that bar transfer to a g trust 
preemption in this instance also furthers the purposes of g.congress created g as the best course to harmonize the interests of asbestos claimants and reorganized debtors alike.see,at.this approach would help asbestos victims receive maximum value,cong.rec.statement of heflin,but also ensure a company continued profitability,converting it into the goose that lays the golden egg by remaining a viable operation and maximizing the trust assets to pay claims,id.at statement of brown.the trust mechanism furthered the fundamental rationale of chapter,that a reorganized debtor emerges from bankruptcy free and clear other than the liability set by the plan.see also,at noting that the uncertainties surrounding bankruptcies had undermined the fresh start objectives of bankruptcy.as these statements demonstrate,congress believed the transfer of a corporation assets to a trust to ensure the equitable compensation of present and future claimants,in return for a release from future liability,served the fundamental purposes of bankruptcy.the provisions at issue would impede these objectives by depriving both debtors and claimants access to assets specifically intended to compensate for potential losses.in these circumstances,construing a to preempt these contracts is consonant with congressional intent and public policy.in re thorpe insulation,at holding that provisions barring transfer to a trust are impliedly preempted because they are an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress in enacting g.
insurers argue,however,that the provisions serve an important purpose in protecting them from covering a risk different from the one they bargained for.although insurance neutrality language in the reorganization plan preserves all other defenses to coverage,insurers contend that the transfer here nonetheless increases their exposure because the trust allows claims that would be barred in the tort system.
we doubt whether transfer in this instance materially alters insurers risk.the bankruptcy here shifted debtor liabilities based on events which had already occurred and for which the insurers were already potentially responsible to the trust.we have questioned whether such a transfer in the asbestos context changes the risk an insurer agreed to cover see global indus,at observing that in the combustion engineering reorganization plan,the quantum of asbestos liability was known from four decades of asbestos litigation,and moving the asbestos claims out of the tort system and into a trust system did not increase in any meaningful way the insurers exposure to asbestos liability.see also couch on insurance the purpose of a no assignment clause is to protect the insurer from increased liability,and after events giving rise to the insurer liability have occurred,the insurer risk can not be increased by a change in the insured identity.here,both the district and bankruptcy court strongly challenged insurers argument that their risk was substantially altered.in re federal mogul global,at appellants have no economic incentive to prevent this assignment,particularly whereas here,the events creating exposure to asbestos liability have already occurred.in re federal mogul global,at collecting cases to establish that i n this case,to the extent that the events giving rise to liability have already occurred,there will be no additional risk to the insurance companies by virtue of the assignments.coverage issues are all preserved.insurers have presented no evidence that the transfer here alters their risk except,perhaps,through the procedural shift that provides recovery through trust distribution protocols rather than through the tort system.significantly,those tdps are mandated by congress for asbestos trusts and must be approved by the bankruptcy court.g b ii v.we can not seriously entertain a claim that the insurers had a contractual right to a particular public policy.if,as has been proposed,congress removed all asbestos claims to a nationwide asbestos trust that could recover from federal mogul and other responsible parties,with procedures identical to those currently provided in the g trusts,the insurers would have no claim.as this hypothetical demonstrates,insurers true objection seems to be against the public policy congress chose to enact 
insurers also allege the trust mechanism might distort ordinary incentives between insurer and insured,encouraging the debtor to collude with claimants and impose costs on the insurer.but as federal mogul points out,this shift in incentives is not unique to the asbestos context and occurs in bankruptcy where there is a discharge of the liability of the debtor but not that of the insurer.see e d ischarge of the debt of the debtor does not affect the liability of any other entity on,or the property of any other entity for,such debt.nor do the insurers provide any evidence of such collusion in this case.such bare speculation does not establish an increase in risk.
although not present here,there may be circumstances where the creation of a trust does alter an insurer exposure for instance,when its mere existence attracts dramatically more claimants although this is less likely given the lengthy history of asbestos liability.see in re global indus,at detailing how the creation of a silica trust alone staggeringly increased by more than times the liability exposure,while distinguishing the asbestos context because the quantum of liability has been established from four decades of asbestos litigation.as our precedent has also recognized,there may also be instances where the evidence suggests possible collusion between the debtor and the claimants.see id.at.but granting a private party powerful leverage that may amount to a de facto veto over the reorganization proceeding does not seem a promising solution to these potential problems.in re thorpe insulation,at e nforcing the provisions would subject virtually all g reorganizations to an insurer veto.
congress sought to address these issues when it enacted g by codifying the exceptional precautions at every stage of the proceeding employed in the original manville case,at.section g accordingly contains many requirements that must be satisfied before such a trust can be approved.see combustion eng g,at.in conjunction with the requirements for plan approval and the rest of the bankruptcy code,these provisions are intended to protect the interests of all affected parties.id.we recently ruled that insurers have standing to participate in bankruptcy proceedings when the creation of a trust staggeringly increase s insurers risk and exposure.in re global indus,at,see also in re thorpe insulation,at holding that insurers have bankruptcy standing to participate in the proceedings culminating in approval of a g plan.we have redressed procedural deficiencies in bankruptcies that did not adequately satisfy the requirements of the code,including g.in re congoleum,at in re combustion eng g,at.as these examples underscore,we believe careful consideration of the protections of the bankruptcy code,together with traditional requirements of procedural due process,adequately guard the interests of all affected parties.
insurers raise hypotheticals proposing scenarios where chapter debtors might employ the bankruptcy code to avoid the strictures of federal or state law,and argue congress could not have intended this absurd result.because the bankruptcy code clearly provides preemption in this instance,we need not decide whether it would also be proper in the situations imagined by insurers.nonetheless,we would find problematic attempts under a to disregard large swaths of state and federal regulatory schemes.pac.gas,at rejecting an,preemption strategy in which the debtor,a public utility,sought to disaggregate notwithstanding contrary state law under a,thereby avoiding regulation by the california public utility commission.eighteen states have previously filed an amicus brief with us on this issue,cautioning that an overly broad reading of a would destroy their ability to preserve their regulatory authority in the face of a bankruptcy filing.br.and app.of amicus curiae states at,in re global indus,cir,wl,at.
but the scope of preemption under a is not unlimited,and our holding does not suggest otherwise.any reorganization plan must still comply with all aspects of the bankruptcy code and be approved by the bankruptcy court.in particular,it must satisfy a,which provides that a court shall confirm a reorganization plan only if it has been proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law.we have stated that this good faith standard ensures that a plan will fairly achieve a result consistent with the objectives and purposes of the bankruptcy code.in re pws holding,cir quoting in re abbotts dairies of,cir.
moreover,although the text of a does not explicitly state a limitation on its preemptive scope,principles suggest that its scope is not unbounded.one important restriction is the presumption against preemption of state police power laws and regulations rooted in federalism concerns and the historic primacy of state regulation of matters of health and safety.lohr,at.the supreme court relied on similar principles to hold that the trustee of a debtor in chapter liquidation proceedings could not abandon property in contravention of state environmental law,despite enjoying the authority under a to abandon any property of the estate that is burdensome to the estate.midlantic bank dep t of envtl,d.notwithstanding the language of the statute,the court reasoned that congress did not intend the abandonment power under to preempt all state laws,citing as evidence practice,the bankruptcy code general solicitude for state safety and health regulations,and congressional interest in enforcing similar laws.id.at.although prior practice is more mixed in this case the other justifications the court invoked to construct a limitation also apply to a.in montgomery county,barwood,the district of maryland applied the court holding in midlantic,as well as other relevant precedent,to the preemptive scope of a.it concluded that a does not preempt otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy laws that are concerned with protecting public health,safety,and welfare.id.at.
the provisions at issue here do not implicate public health,safety,and welfare.but limitation of a preemptive scope on these grounds is sensible,and seemingly consonant with congressional intent,the purposes of the bankruptcy code,and precedent.it has often been noted that the code exists not to provide a haven for wrongdoers,but to relieve the honest debtor from the weight of oppressive indebtedness and permit him to start afresh.in re davis,cir quoting in part local loan hunt.extending the presumption against preemption of state police powers to a seems to balance these aims,and might also forestall some of the more problematic hypotheticals advanced by insurers.
for the foregoing reasons,we hold that the provisions in the relevant insurance policies are preempted by a b to the extent they prohibit transfer to a g trust.we will affirm the judgment of the district court.
besides the reorganized debtors federal mogul,there are two additional appellees the official committee of asbestos claimants and the legal representative for future asbestos claimants.for the sake of brevity,we will refer to the appellees collectively as federal mogul.

asbestos liability has also fit poorly into the usual dynamics of insurance coverage.while the dangers of asbestos were becoming known when insurers drafted comprehensive general liability policies in the and,they likely did not foresee the rise of enormous mass tort liability decades later.see kenneth abraham,the maze of mega coverage litigation,colum.written on an injury or,the policies were to address diseases based on prolonged exposure.id.courts interpreted the policies coverage language to impose a continuous trigger of insurance coverage for asbestos liability,holding that every policy on the risk between first exposure to manifestation often a period of decades was triggered.see keene ins.of,james fischer,insurance coverage for mass exposure tort claims the debate over the appropriate trigger rule,drake,summarizing the development and justifications for the continuous trigger of coverage.the result of the continuous trigger rule has been the apportionment of liability among numerous insurers,often posing difficult questions of allocation and likely incentivizing policyholders to file suit against all insurers who sold them coverage during the trigger period.abraham,supra,at.further complicating the situation is the distorting effect of multiple insurance layers on insurers incentives.primary insurers had the duty to defend against claims that exceeded their policy limits,so they allegedly minimized defense costs by rushing into aggregate settlements that included claims of dubious value while passing the settlements cost onto excess insurers.richard nagareda,mass torts in a world of settlement michelle white,why the asbestos genie wo stay in the bankruptcy bottle,cin.
both courts and corporations have attempted to implement innovative solutions to remedy the perceived deficiencies of the tort system to address the flood of asbestos claims,but these have proved unsuccessful because of the limitations on the powers of courts and of private parties.in the eastern district of texas,judge robert parker sought to implement a trial procedure for addressing three thousand asbestos claims by using statistical sampling and test trials to create a compensation grid that would be extrapolated to all pending claims.cimino raymark.this plan was overturned on appeal for violating the defendants seventh amendment rights.cimino raymark,cir.owens corning,a major asbestos manufacturer,sought to create a national settlement program outside the judicial system by entering private contracts with plaintiffs firms that would have settled the claims of the firms clients based on an administrative grid.nagareda,supra.but owens corning could not create a universal binding system through private contract,and so the innovation failed.id.the company filed for bankruptcy,creating a g trust to address its asbestos liability.id.

another significant question that has received attention is the relationship between tort and trust compensation,which are linked in complex ways that vary from state to state.see dixon mcgovern,asbestos bankruptcy trusts and tort compensation,supra,at outlining the linkages between the trusts and tort claims.some have contended that the confidentiality of the trust system allows claimants to in both the tort and trust system and permits reliance on dubious medical reports,while others have disagreed with this assessment.see how fraud and abuse in the asbestos compensation system affect victims,jobs,the economy,and the legal system hearing before the subcomm.on the constitution of the comm.on the judiciary,cong.presenting testimony on both sides of this question gov t accountability office,supra,at summarizing differing views and various proposals on whether and how trust claimant information should be made available to outside parties.

in its unpublished oral opinion,that court rebuffed the insurers contention that the assignment of insurance proceeds to the personal injury trust violates provisions in their policies.transcript of oral opinion at,in re combustion eng g.july.it reasoned that,since contracts that provide for forfeiture in the event of bankruptcy are void under section of the code i f the insurers were correct in reading the provisions of combustion engineering insurance policies to bar even a simple assignment of proceeds to a trust fund for claimants created by the reorganization,then these provisions,too,should be considered void.id.at.
insurers other attempts to distinguish combustion engineering are unavailing.they suggest the term proceeds in the opinion referred only to liquidated insurance coverage,rather than insurance rights,as are at issue here.but the opinion itself refers to rights to proceeds,and makes it clear that the actual value of many of combustion engineering insurance policies had yet to be determined.combustion eng g,at.insurers also suggest that we would not have reached a different conclusion from the ninth circuit in pacific gas without more than a brief discussion in a footnote.but pacific gas had been brought to our attention,letter pursuant to rule j from elit felix,counsel for allianz insurance,in re combustion eng g,cir.may,and it did not alter our conclusion.we agree with the district court that these contentions are at base an argument that we did not mean what we said.in re federal mogul global,at.insurers also claim that a broad reading of combustion engineering would conflict with our precedent in integrated solutions,service support specialties,cir.there,we held the bankruptcy code did not preempt state law restrictions on the transfer of tort claims.id.at.insurers argue that this transaction would be allowed under a broad reading of a.this assertion is incorrect.the issue in integrated was preemption under b and,neither of which contained an express preemption clause.at.we contrasted these sections with other provisions of the bankruptcy code where congress had employed explicit language that showed it intend ed to displace state nonbankruptcy law,particularly the notwithstanding clause contained in a.id.moreover,the sale of the tort claim at issue in integrated was not part of the reorganization plan,and so a was not applicable.id.at.

we also find relevant d,which provides notwithstanding subsection a of this section and sections b,a,and b of this title,if it is proposed in a plan to cure a default the amount necessary to cure the default shall be determined in accordance with the underlying agreement and applicable nonbankruptcy law.the reference to subsection a indicates that,absent this provision,would operate to preempt nonbankruptcy law governing the curing of defaults.the only reference to curing a default in appears at a g,in the list of transactions that could constitute adequate means.we find this strong evidence that congress interpreted a to reach the ten transactions listed under a.
london market insurers attempt to distinguish norfolk on the ground that the collective bargaining agreement at issue in that case was required by law,a fact that played no role in the court reasoning or conclusions about the preemptive scope of the statute in that case.they also point to two other supreme court cases,cipollone liggett group,d,and american airlines,wolens,d,where the court refused to apply preemption clauses to contract provisions.but in both cases,the court specifically disting
