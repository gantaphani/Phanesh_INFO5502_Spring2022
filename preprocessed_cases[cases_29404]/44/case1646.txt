plaintiff,william lincoln,appeals the district court opinion and order granting summary judgment to the defendant,reksten management reksten.lincoln reksten management.lincoln was injured while loading reksten ship,the green tundra the green tundra,with frozen chicken,and he filed this negligence action against reksten under b of the longshore and harbor workers compensation act.lincoln claims the district court erred because a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether reksten breached its turnover duty to lincoln and because reksten owed lincoln,as a beneficiary to the charter party contract,a heightened duty to supervise,inspect,intervene in the stevedore activities.we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand.
at the time of his accident,lincoln was employed by stevens shipping and terminal company stevens as a longshoreman.stevens is a stevedore and was hired to load the green tundra,a refrigerator vessel owned by reksten,with a load of frozen chicken destined for russia pursuant to a charter party agreement between reksten and hudson foods.the charter party agreement included provisions that reksten would provide a ship that had decks capable of holding up to five tons and that was fit in every way for the loading of frozen food packed in cartons.
the green tundra has three cargo holds or decks,designated a,b,and c from top to bottom.longshoremen access these decks through four cargo hatches,numbered one through four moving from fore to aft on the ship.the stevedore is required to lower pallets full of boxes of frozen chicken with a crane through the cargo hatches into the cargo holds.once the crane deposits the pallets in the cargo holds,the stevedore uses forklifts to move the pallets of chicken boxes to designated areas in the cargo hold.the longshoremen remove the chicken boxes from the pallets and hand stack them on the ship decks in their appropriate locations within the hold.
at the time of his accident,lincoln was working on deck the floor of deck b consists of wooden deck boards bolted to supporting steel.the deck boards in deck b are approximately ten inches wide and two to three inches thick,and there is an approximately one and a half inch space between each of the boards that allows refrigerated air to circulate between decks b and c.there is no other barrier between decks b and c,so if a board broke on deck b,an object,with no interruption,would fall straight to the floor of deck 
the green tundra arrived in charleston,south carolina on july,to receive the load of frozen chicken.prior to the ship arrival,the ship crew had the ship cargo holds to degrees fahrenheit,cleaned the holds,and inspected the holds to ensure they were safe and ready for loading.prior to the loading operations,stevens stevedore superintendent conducted a inspection of the ship holds to ensure that they were safe for the longshoremen to work in.stevens commenced loading the frozen chicken that same day.the evidence is in conflict as to whether lincoln accident or the condition of the ship which caused it was reported to the vessel before lincoln suit was filed.
at approximately on july,lincoln was on deck b when his right foot went through the deck boards.lincoln right foot and leg went through the boards,causing him to fall down so that he was resting on his tailbone,leaving his foot and leg dangling inside hold lincoln fellow longshoremen working on deck b helped lincoln out of the hole after it appeared that he could not extricate himself.lincoln then climbed out of the cargo hold using the ladder.on the dock,he spoke to lawrence mixson,the stevedore in the dock office,who states that he reported the accident to the vessel and told lincoln to go to the hospital.as a result of this fall,lincoln sustained injuries to his wrist,back,neck,and knee.another stevedore acting as the safety director for the operation,david leblanc,filled out two accident reports documenting lincoln fall,one dated july,and another that is not dated.
on march,lincoln filed this action against reksten under b,which provides in relevant part 
in the event of injury to a person covered under this chapter caused by the negligence of a vessel,then such person,or anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages by reason thereof,may bring an action against such vessel as a third party in accordance with the provisions of section of this title,and the employer shall not be liable to the vessel for such damages directly or indirectly and any agreements or warranties to the contrary shall be void the liability of the vessel under this subsection shall not be based upon the warranty of seaworthiness or a breach thereof at the time the injury occurred 
b.after completing some of the discovery in the case,reksten moved for summary judgment arguing that it had not breached any duties owed lincoln.the district court granted the motion after finding that lincoln did not provide sufficient evidence that reksten breached its turnover duty to lincoln and that reksten did not owe lincoln a heightened duty to supervise and to inspect the hold under either osha regulations or its charter party contract with hudson foods.lincoln appeals,claiming the district court improperly granted summary judgment when material issues of fact exist as to whether reksten breached its turnover duty to lincoln and claiming the district court erred as a matter of law in concluding that lincoln was not a beneficiary of a heightened duty of care contained in the charter party contract.
we review a district court decision granting summary judgment de novo.shaw stroud,cir.a party is entitled to summary judgment only if,after viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party,it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.shaw,at.
while congress created a cause of action against the shipowner in negligence in b,it left to the courts the task of defining the duties the shipowner owed to the longshoreman.scindia steam navigation de los santos,d.in scindia steam,the court defined three general duties shipowners owe longshoremen under b the turnover duty,which relates to the condition of the ship upon the commencement of stevedoring operations once stevedoring operations have begun,the duty to exercise reasonable care in order to prevent injuries to longshoremen in areas where the shipowner remains in active control of the vessel and the duty to intervene concerns the vessel obligations with respect to cargo operations in areas under the principal control of the independent stevedore.howlett birkdale shipping,d construing scindia steam,at.in this appeal,we first consider lincoln argument that reksten breached the first of these duties,the duty to exercise reasonable care when turning the ship over for stevedoring activities 
the turnover duty has two components.the first involves the shipowner duty with respect to the ship gear,equipment,tools,and work space that the stevedore will utilize during its operations.the shipowner must at least exercise ordinary care under the circumstances to have the ship and its equipment in such condition that an expert and experienced stevedore will be able by the exercise of reasonable care to carry on its cargo operations with reasonable safety to persons and property.scindia steam,at.
as a corollary to this initial turnover duty,the shipowner must 
warn the stevedore of any hazards on the ship or with respect to its equipment that are known to the vessel or should be known to it in the exercise of reasonable care,that would likely be encountered by the stevedore in the course of his cargo operations and that are not known by the stevedore and would not be obvious to or anticipated by him if reasonably competent in the performance of his work.
scindia steam,at.the duty to warn attaches only to latent hazards,including those in cargo areas,and a bsent actual knowledge of a hazard,the duty to warn may attach only if the exercise of reasonable care would place upon the shipowner an obligation to inspect for,or discover,the hazard existence.howlett,at.if a defect is open and obvious and the stevedore should be able to conduct its operations around it safely,the shipowner doe
