this appeal,which arises out of a february gasoline spill in maine portland harbor,requires us to interpret both historic and contemporary maritime law in the united states.on the one hand,appellees present a seventh amendment argument that involves the state of federal admiralty jurisdiction in the early days of the constitution.appellant,on the other hand,raises questions of federal preemption and statutory interpretation in relation to two issues of much current interest oil spills and punitive damages.finally,both parties dispute the sufficiency of evidence presented to the jury on various aspects of appellant alleged damages.
we conclude that the district court disposition of these issues must be affirmed in part and reversed in part.
factual and procedural background 
a.the parties 
appellant south port marine,llc,south port is a marina located on a cove in portland harbor,maine.the marina is principally designed to accommodate recreational motor and sailing vessels by allowing them to tie up to floating dock segments that are connected with fixed docks leading to the marina onshore facilities.the floating dock segments are identical in function and purpose to ordinary fixed docks,but are designed in sections with styrofoam flotation which allows them to rise and fall with the tides.
in the winter of,south port owners planned to dredge the marina and parts of the surrounding cove to allow access by larger boats.the owners also intended to increase the number of slips in the marina from approximately one hundred to closer to one hundred and.
appellee gulf oil is a petroleum company.it operates a distribution facility on portland harbor where,inter alia,petroleum products such as gasoline are pumped into barges for transportation to other ports.appellee boston towing and transportation operates tug boats and tank barges for the purpose of oil transportation.gulf oil was pumping gasoline into a barge owned and operated by boston towing at the time of the incident involved in this appeal.
b.the february,spill 
in the early morning hours of february,a boston towing tank barge was tied to the gulf oil pier in portland harbor,while a crew member transferred gasoline from a gulf onshore storage facility into individual tanks on the barge.the gasoline transfer process required the crew member to monitor the filling of each tank and to manually switch the flow of gasoline to the next empty tank when the prior tank reached its full capacity.
sometime after in the morning,under severe weather conditions,the crew member assigned to monitor the gas flow left the barge and boarded a nearby tug boat,leaving the gasoline transfer completely unattended.while the crew member was absent,the gasoline overflowed the recipient tank and subsequently overflowed the barge safety transom,flowing into portland harbor.between and gallons of gasoline spilled into the water.
a large portion of the spilled gas entered the cove on which south port marine is located,and by two to three inches of gasoline floated on the surface of the water at the marina.the styrofoam flotation of the dock segments began to disintegrate,causing the docks to sink,list,and in many cases,fully submerge.as this happened,a number of electrical posts at least some of which were apparently awaiting installation fell off the docks and into the water.
alleged effects of the spill on south port marine 
at trial,south port alleged damages falling into three general categories extensive property damage,lost profits,and other economic losses including loss of goodwill and business stress.the spill allegedly destroyed between sixty and eighty styrofoam floats and severely damaged dock segments.according to south port,the repair and cleanup of this damage was both costly and,at a critical time in its development,very.south port further alleged that the spill set back its dredging plan an entire year and put the construction of new slips on indefinite hold due to the cash flow crisis caused by the accident and the diversion of south port employees from gainful work to cleanup and repair tasks.south port claimed the economic injury caused by the spill eventually forced it to restructure its debt and threatened its owners entire investment of almost.
procedural history 
on january,south port filed a complaint in federal district court raising claims under the federal oil pollution act of opa and asserting several state common law tort actions.the complaint demanded trial by jury on all claims.appellants argued that south port was not entitled to a jury trial because its claims sounded in admiralty.the court initially reserved judgment on that issue and proceeded to try the case before a jury.
on april,the first day of trial,appellees conceded liability under the opa in response to questioning from the court.however,the court then ruled that south port state common law claims which included strict liability,negligence,private nuisance,and trespass were barred by maine law,see.ann.tit,d west see also portland pipe line envtl.improvement comm n,me,because south port failed to bring its state law claims under maine oil pollution statute,which displaces state common law claims.the court also decided that punitive damages were unavailable under the opa.
on april,the jury returned a verdict in favor of south port.the jury awarded south port in damages for injury to property,for lost profits,and for injury to good will and business stress.after the jury verdict,appellees renewed their motion for judgment as a matter of law,moved for a new trial,and also renewed their challenge to appellant right to trial by jury.
the district court denied appellees challenge to the jury trial in an order and opinion issued july.the motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial,however,were granted in part and denied in part by order and opinion issued october.the court held that the evidence presented to the jury was insufficient as a matter of law to support the award of damages for lost profits and other economic loss and reduced the jury award by.ruling in the alternative in case its decision should be overturned on appeal,the court also granted appellees motion for a new trial unless appellant would agree to a remittitur of.
appellant filed this timely appeal challenging the district court rulings on the availability of punitive damages and sufficiency of the evidence,and appellees have the district court decision that appellant was entitled to trial by jury.we will address the jury issue first,the punitive damages issue second,and the sufficiency of the evidence arguments last.
ii.law and application 
appellant seventh amendment right to trial by jury 
in the district court,appellees moved to strike south port jury demand on the basis that the opa claim was comparable to a claim in admiralty to which the seventh amendment guarantee of trial by jury does not apply.the district court initially reserved judgment on the motion and impaneled a jury with the caveat that the jury verdict would be merely advisory if the court later determined that appellant had no right to a jury trial.following trial,on july,the district court ruled that the seventh amendment did in fact guarantee south port a trial by jury on its opa claim,and entered judgment according to the jury verdict.appellees now challenge that determination.
south port demand for a jury trial in its complaint bound the district court to federal rule of civil procedure,which required the court to try the case before a jury unless it found that south port was not entitled to a jury trial under the constitution or laws of the united states.see.a.because the opa does not create a statutory right to trial by jury,south port entitlement to such jury trial must stem,if at all,from the seventh amendment to the constitution,which states,in suits at common law,where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars,the right of trial by jury shall be preserved const.amend.vii.
as the supreme court has declared,
although the thrust of the amendment was to preserve the right to jury trial as it existed in,the seventh amendment also applies to actions brought to enforce statutory rights that are analogous to causes of action ordinarily decided in english law courts in the late century,as opposed to those customarily heard by the courts of equity or admiralty.
granfinanciera,nordberg,d.the issue before us,then,is whether south port opa claim is analogous to a cause of action in admiralty in,to which no right to trial by jury would apply,or to a cause of action at law,which carries the seventh amendment guarantee.we agree with the district court that in,south port would have brought its claim for damages to its marina under the common law rather than in admiralty,and we therefore affirm the use of a jury to hear the claim at trial.
the earliest cases from the united states courts on the scope of admiralty jurisdiction applied a locality test to determine whether a tort fell under the admiralty or common law jurisdiction.justice story,riding the circuit in,stated his understanding that the jurisdiction of the admiralty is exclusively dependent upon the locality of the act.the admiralty has not i believe deliberately claimed to have any jurisdiction over torts,except such as are maritime torts,that is,such as are committed on the high seas,or on waters within the ebb and flow of the tide.thomas lane.more recently,the supreme court summarized the locality test as follows 
the traditional test for admiralty jurisdiction asked only whether the tort occurred on navigable waters.if it did,admiralty jurisdiction followed if it did not,admiralty jurisdiction did not exist.this ostensibly simple locality test was complicated by the rule that the injury had to be wholly sustained on navigable waters for the tort to be within admiralty.thus,admiralty courts lacked jurisdiction over,say,a claim following a ship collision with a pier insofar as it injured the pier,for admiralty law treated the pier as an extension of the land.
jerome grubart,great lakes dredge dock,d citations omitted.
as suggested by grubart,the location of a tort sometimes depended on the nature of the injured structure,whether the structure was considered an extension of the land.beginning with the plymouth,wall,which found no admiralty jurisdiction over damage to a warehouse destroyed in a fire started on board a ship,admiralty jurisdiction has not been construed to extend to accidents on piers,jetties,bridges,or even ramps and railways running into the sea.rodrigue aetna cas.sur,d.using this rubric,south port contends that the injury to its docks would not have fallen within the admiralty jurisdiction of the federal courts in.
appellees,however,argue that several cases,most notably evans the blackheath,support the opposite conclusion.in the blackheath,justice holmes distinguished the plymouth and announced the court decision that a collision with a beacon would lie in admiralty since it served as a navigational aid.this remained so despite the fact that the structure is technically land,through a connection at the bottom of the sea,id.at.
appellees have failed to persuade us,however,that the blackheath or any of the other cases cited in their briefs invalidated the rule established in the plymouth.in fact,in cleveland terminal valley cleveland,the supreme court addressed the tension between the plymouth and the blackheath and concluded that the two decisions were not incompatible.after discussing both cases,the court reaffirmed that admiralty jurisdiction did not extend to injuries inflicted by a vessel upon a bridge,its protective pilings,and an adjacent dock,stating that the bridges,shore docks,protection piling,piers,pertained to the land.they were structures connected with the shore and immediately concerned commerce upon land.none of these structures were aids to navigation in the maritime sense,but extensions of the shore and aids to commerce on land as such.id.at.
moreover,courts specifically examining the nature of floating docks have consistently held that they do not possess the characteristics associated with maritime objects.in cope vallette,for example,the supreme court decided that the salvage of floating could not properly fall under admiralty jurisdiction because they had no means of propulsion and were not designed for navigation.id.at.circuit cases in this century have reached similar conclusions.see,atkins greenville shipbuilding,cir holding that as a matter of law,a floating dock was not a vessel owing a maritime warranty of seaworthiness royal ins.of america pier.partnership,cir ruling that policies insuring floating docks did not fall under admiralty jurisdiction because the subject matter was not maritime digiovanni traylor,cir stating that if a float is not in actual navigation,the test for whether it qualifies as a vessel is whether its purpose or primary business is navigation or commerce.thus,appellees emphasis on the floating nature of south port docks is insufficient and misplaced.see id.floating is not enough.although these structures move with the ebb and flow of the tides,they remain moored to a fixed location and serve no navigational function.indeed,their purpose is precisely the same as that of traditional fixed piers or docks to facilitate commerce on land,presumably conducted in and around whatever retail and repair facilities are operated by south port.in essence,south port floating docks are extensions of the land in the sense of that phrase in eighteenth century admiralty jurisprudence.consequently,a tort that causes damage to them does not occur wholly on the navigable waters and would have constituted an action at law,rather than in admiralty,in the late eighteenth century 
we therefore agree with the district court that south port opa claim is analogous to a claim under the common law at the time of the seventh amendment ratification in,and that south port was entitled to trial by jury.
punitive damages 
plaintiff contends that the district court erred in ruling that punitive damages were unavailable as a matter of law.we affirm the district court ruling.
plaintiff complaint alleged six counts a claim under the opa,four state law tort claims,and a count entitled simply punitive damages.punitive damages,however,do not constitute a separate cause of action,but instead form a remedy available for some tortious or otherwise unlawful acts.consequently,plaintiff claim for punitive damages must relate to some separate cause of action which permits recovery of punitive damages.
despite a valiant effort,plaintiff has been unable to point to a legal basis for its punitive damages claim.one of the four tort claims alleged in the complaint might have been adequate those claims,however,were dismissed by the trial court,a decision which plaintiff has not challenged on appeal.the remaining possibilities,therefore,are the opa,or general admiralty and maritime law.
opa does not provide for punitive damages 
in,in the wake of the exxon valdez and other oil spill disasters,congress established a comprehensive federal scheme for oil pollution liability in the opa.see et.the opa sets forth a comprehensive list of recoverable damages,including removal costs damage to natural resources and real or personal property loss of subsistence use of natural resources loss of government revenues,lost profits and earning capacity and costs of increased or additional public services occasioned by the unlawful act.see b.absent from that list of recoverable damages is any mention of punitive damages.the question before us,therefore,is whether,by leaving punitive damages out of the opa,congress intended to supplant the general admiralty and maritime law that existed prior to the enactment of the statute,which permitted the award of punitive damages for reckless behavior.see,ceh,seafarer,cir punitive damages long recognized in admiralty actions for willful or reckless conduct.
congress intended the opa to be the exclusive federal law governing oil spills 
first,we note that,although the parties have referred to this issue as one of preemption,it does not present any of the federalism concerns normally associated with that word,because we are concerned only with the opa effect on preexisting federal law.the question,therefore,is not c
