background and procedural history 
on february,anders ellis bjorgung competed in a giant slalom race at whitetail ski area in franklin county,pennsylvania,as a member of the ski liberty race club.the race was sponsored by the ski snowboard association usssa,which obtained signed liability releases from both bjorgung and his father as a condition of his participation.bjorgung was seventeen years old at the time,an expert skier and an experienced downhill competitor.however,during his run,bjorgung failed to negotiate one of the turns,delineated by racing gates,and skied into the woods where he struck a tree and was injured.while bjorgung can not recollect any of the events of the race day,he and his father both stated that his normal practice was to inspect a race course before competing.
on november,bjorgung,a citizen of maryland,brought suit in diversity for his injuries in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania against usssa,a utah corporation,and two other business resort,lp,registered in delaware,and whitetail ski company,a pennsylvania corporation.bjorgung alleged in his complaint that the defendants were negligent in designing and maintaining the ski trail and race course.on january,all three defendants filed an answer.whitetail resort and whitetail ski company denied that they owned the ski area on the date of bjorgung injuries.on january,usssa,pursuant to,filed a complaint against bjorgung father seeking indemnity based on the release he signed.in october the case was referred to magistrate judge smyser for management and discovery.
in february,the two whitetail defendants moved for partial summary judgment based on their denial of ownership,and all three defendants filed a motion for summary judgment based on pennsylvania skier responsibility act and a separate motion based on hold harmless releases signed by the bjorgungs.also in february,bjorgung father moved for summary judgment on the complaint against him.on june,the plaintiff filed his response to the first motion for summary judgment the response included a request for leave to amend his complaint to name the proper owner of the resort.
magistrate judge smyser submitted his report and recommendation on all the motions to chief judge kane on july.chief judge kane adopted these recommendations,following her de novo review,and granted summary judgment to whitetail resorts and whitetail ski,finding they did not own the ski area at the time of the accident.the judge also granted summary judgment to all three defendants on the issue of tort liability.lastly,chief judge kane denied as moot both the defendants summary judgment motion based on the releases and bjorgung father motion for summary judgment to dismiss the third party complaint.
ii.denial of leave to amend the complaint 
the mountain resort where bjorgung crashed had been sold in,two years before bjorgung accident,to snow time,which operated it through a subsidiary,whitetail mountain operating.accordingly,the former owners,whitetail resort and whitetail ski company,named as defendants by bjorgung,moved for summary judgment and the district court granted it.in doing so,the district court also denied plaintiff motion to amend his complaint,in order to name the proper defendants,under.plaintiff appeals this procedural denial.
the version of rule applicable to this case stated that,beyond the time for amendment as of right at the start of a lawsuit,a party may amend the party pleading only by leave of the court or by written consent of the adverse party and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.a.the third circuit reviews a district court decision refusing leave to amend under rule a for abuse of discretion cureton collegiate athl.ass,cir.district courts are the experts in the field of applied trial procedure,so appellate courts should not be quick to reverse such decisions.that said,we also have acknowledged that the liberal pleading philosophy of the federal rules does limit a district court discretion to deny leave to amend.adams gould,cir.delay alone will not constitute grounds for denial.cureton,at.the district court has discretion to deny the request only if the plaintiff delay in seeking to amend is undue,motivated by bad faith,or prejudicial to the opposing party.adams,at.delay becomes undue,and thereby creates grounds for the district court to refuse leave,when it places an unwarranted burden on the court or when the plaintiff has had previous opportunities to amend.cureton,at citing adams,at lorenz csx,cir.thus,our review of the question of undue delay in this appeal will focus on the movant reasons for not amending sooner,cureton,at,and we will balance these reasons against the burden of delay on the district court.coventry steel,cir.
finally,as we proceed in this review,we defer to the district court findings of fact which may underlie its findings of the magistrate judge adopted by the district court following its de novo we find clear error.morales sun constructors,cir.we note,however,that the appellant does not appear to challenge any of the district court factual findings on this issue.he does seem to read the district court record differently than the district court matter we will address below.
the district court found that the defendants alerted bjorgung to the fact that he was suing the wrong entities in early,and that he delayed three and one half years before seeking leave to amend memorandum opinion of,at.the district court also stated that bjorgung did nothing about the problem with his complaint,despite being on notice for this length of time,until he filed a response to the defendants motion for summary judgment.id.first,we find that these circumstances represent previous opportunities to amend under cureton.second,while chief judge kane did not say so expressly,we read her observation that the motion to amend was filed long after the close of discovery as referring,inter alia,to the burden tardily placed on the district court.
bjorgung had a straightforward,but very necessary,job to do.he had to correct his complaint and begin to sue the proper entities.the defendants placed him immediately on notice of his error.and yet he waited over three years and allowed the district court to reach the brink of ruling dispositively on the entire suit before he undertook to fulfill his responsibility.to allow amendment at that point might send the court through a substantial period of additional discovery and motions.we find a considerable potential burden in this,one that would warrant denial of leave to amend under rule and cureton unless bjorgung produced a persuasive explanation for his delay.
bjorgung offered no excuse or explanation to the district court for his delay,nor does he offer any reason for it on appeal.instead,he propounds an argument that the district court was barred under pennsylvania law,and hence under erie tompkins,from denying him leave to amend.bjorgung claims that defendants lack of compliance with commonwealth business law,specifically the registration provisions of.and caused him to sue the wrong entities because he had no official notice of the change in ownership.he then argues that the district court,as the result of defendants alleged noncompliance,was required to permit him to amend,even at the eleventh hour.he cites treatises and case law that he claims establish the proposition that a business e
