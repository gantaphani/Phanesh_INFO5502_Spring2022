background 
michael kirschbaum maintained a medical practice in the gsb building,where he had been a tenant since.on average,kirschbaum worked six days a week,often arriving at the building parking garage before,when the building opened.because the building was still closed at the time of kirschbaum arrival,he would walk up a flight of stairs that led to a door to the building,a key to which he had been supplied by insignia,the building manager.this flight consisted of steps,and it was walled on both sides.a handrail ran up one of these walls,but,at the bottom of the stairwell,the handrail had become detached from the wall and was resting on the stairs.while kirschbaum was aware of the broken handrail it had been broken ever since he became a tenant in the gsb building,he nonetheless continued to use the stairs.
at approximately on september,kirschbaum arrived at the building and parked in the lower parking garage.as he was climbing the stairs leading to the building,kirschbaum stumbled while attempting to place his foot on the fifth step.because the stairway handrail was broken and resting on the stairs at the fifth step,kirschbaum was unable to catch himself,and he fell to the bottom of the stairs.as a result of the fall,kirschbaum suffered not only from fractured bones,but also from a chronic infection of the right leg that may require the amputation of that leg.see kirschbaum wrgsb associates,wl,slip op.at.
kirschbaum sued wrgsb,the owner of the building,and the district court properly asserted jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to.kirschbaum alleged that he tripped on a step also known as a riser that was of an inch taller than the other steps in the stairwell,and further stated that he was subsequently unable to arrest his fall due to the broken handrail.as such,kirschbaum alleged two causes of his fall the riser height discrepancy and the broken handrail.
because wrgsb had hired insignia to not only manage,but also maintain and repair,the the stairwell in which kirschbaum was brought a action against insignia,seeking contribution or indemnification.the district court exercised supplemental jurisdiction over insignia pursuant to.wrgsb maintained that it relied on insignia to manage and maintain the gsb building,and that insignia was paid handsomely to do so.wrgsb further stated that it did not have any employees on site because insignia provided several management and engineering personnel pursuant to the property management agreement.as a result,wrgsb maintained that insignia ought to be solely responsible for the injuries kirschbaum sustained as a result of the riser height discrepancy and broken handrail,both of which wrgsb believed that insignia was responsible for correcting under the property management agreement.
all of kirschbaum claims were settled on september,with wrgsb and insignia each contributing half of the settlement amount,but retaining their respective rights of indemnity and contribution.subsequently,both parties filed motions for summary judgment,seeking to have the other bear the full cost of settlement.the parties based their motions for summary judgment on contradictory interpretations of the property management agreement wrgsb argued that,under the terms of the agreement,insignia was wholly responsible for maintaining the stairwell,while insignia contended that wrgsb was required,under the agreement,to purchase insurance and fully indemnify insignia.
following the motions for summary judgment,the magistrate judge assigned to the case issued a report and recommendation which concluded that both parties were equally negligent in causing kirschbaum fall.in accordance with this determination,the magistrate judge recommended that the parties bear the cost of settlement equally.the district court adopted most of the magistrate judge report and recommendation,but referred the apportionment of liability issue back to the magistrate judge for an evidentiary hearing.
at the evidentiary hearing,wrgsb presented the testimony of various insignia employees.this testimony was somewhat cumulative and can be summed up as generally showing that the employees believed insignia job was to repair and maintain the gsb building.in addition to this testimony,dan grinnan,insignia chief engineer at the gsb building,testified that he attempted to the broken brackets holding the handrail to the wall before kirschbaum accident,knew those repairs had failed and was aware that the handrail was still broken on the day of the accident.nonetheless,grinnan never notified wrgsb or kirschbaum that the handrail was broken.insignia countered by calling charles goedken,a civil engineer,as its expert witness.he testified that there was a inch discrepancy in one of the stairway risers,that such a discrepancy did not conform to generally accepted engineering standards and that such a discrepancy created a foreseeable risk of falling.
following the hearing,the magistrate judge again found that wrgsb and insignia were equally liable for the settlement cost.the magistrate judge held that wrgsb had a duty to discover and remedy the riser height discrepancy,and that insignia had a separate duty to repair the broken handrail.accordingly,the magistrate judge ordered them each to pay one half of the settlement amount.wrgsb appeals,and insignia.we have jurisdiction under c.
ii.discussion 
not surprisingly,wrgsb believes that insignia is solely responsible for kirschbaum injuries because the property management agreement required insignia to take responsibility for the physical condition of all aspects of the staircase,including the handrail and the stair risers.insignia,arguing that wrgsb should pay the entire settlement amount because the agreement required wrgsb to provide primary insurance coverage for insignia wrgsb should not have been able to seek contribution or indemnity from insignia without first establishing that wrgsb was liable to kirschbaum for his injuries and kirschbaum assumed the risk of injury presented by the handrail.
because this is a diversity case,we must first determine the substantive state law that is to govern our decision.in making this determination,we first look to the conflict of laws rules of the forum state,pennsylvania.see assicurazioni generali,clover,cir.for substantive tort law issues,pennsylvania uses a combination of the government interest and significant relationship approaches to conflict of laws analysis.under this analysis,a court must evaluate the extent to which one state rather than another has demonstrated,by reason of its policies and their connection and relevance to the matter in dispute,a priority of interest in the application of its rule of law.troxel dupont,quoting norman.neither party disputes that pennsylvania law applies to the tort aspects of this case,and our review of the facts confirms that the parties are correct this case involves an accident in pennsylvania on a stairwell that is subject to pennsylvania building codes and regulations.as such,pennsylvania has a priority interest in the application of its tort law to this cause.however,because the property management agreement so specifies,see agmt.at,illinois substantive law of contracts applies to interpretation of the agreement.see kruzits okuma mach.tool,cir pennsylvania law generally respects parties choice of law.
wrgsb appeal 
before reaching wrgsb main argument,we review three inadequately supported claims that wrgsb raises in the footnotes of its opening brief.these arguments are that the magistrate judge erred in allowing insignia to call goedken as its expert witness because insignia never identified goedken as its expert witness as required by the court rulings,see appellant br.at that the magistrate judge erred in determining that wrgsb was a possessor of the premises at the time of the accident,see id.at and that the magistrate judge erred in concluding that the riser height discrepancy constituted a structural defect instead of being a consequence of normal wear and tear,see id.at.wrgsb has not presented any of these holdings as a basis for its appeal,and wrgsb does not mention these arguments in its statement of the issues for review,as required by rule a of the federal rules of appellate procedure.see appellant br.at.we therefore will not reach any of these arguments.see travitz northeast ilgwu health welfare fund,cir.but,even if we were to reach wrgsb arguments,we could not decide them on their merits since they are poorly briefed and deserve more development than passing mention in a footnote for us take them seriously.as a result,we will not examine whether the magistrate judge erred in allowing insignia to call goedken as its expert witness.further,we accept the magistrate judge finding that wrgsb possessed the building at the time of the accident and that the riser height discrepancy constituted a structural defect.
wrgsb remaining arguments can all be reduced to one claim that insignia should be responsible for the entire settlement amount because the property management agreement obligated insignia to discover and correct defects in both the stair risers and the handrail.both parties agree that insignia was solely responsible for repairing the defective handrail therefore,our discussion focuses primarily on which party must accept responsibility for the injuries arising out of the riser height discrepancy.
as owner of the gsb building,wrgsb is charged with the following duty 
a possessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm caused to his by a condition on the land if,but only if,he 
a knows or by the exercise of reasonable care would discover the condition and should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk of harm to such invitees,and 
b should expect that they will not discover or realize the danger,or will fail to protect themselves against it,and 
c fails to exercise reasonable care to protect them against the danger.
restatement second of torts adopted by the pennsylvania supreme court in carrender fitterer,footnote added.thus,wrgsb is obligated to discover and repair the riser height discrepancy that caused kirschbaum fall if,by the exercise of reasonable care,wrgsb is capable of discovering the defect,and wrgsb should expect that kirschbaum would not discover the defect himself.
the magistrate judge determined that wrgsb met these requirements,and wrgsb does not dispute this finding except to argue that the riser height discrepancy is a trivial argument that is related to wrgsb ability to discover the riser height discrepancy.in support,wrgsb cites several older pennsylvania cases where approximately inch sidewalk and roadway discrepancies were found to be trivial.see,bosack pittsburgh railways,german city of mckeesport.while the riser defect here was only inch,it occurred on a stair riser,a place where the defect is likely to be far less obvious than on a flat surface such as a road and thus more difficult to protect against.relatedly,discrepancies of this kind are far more common and therefore foreseeable on a sidewalk than on a flight of stairs.indeed,insignia expert the district court found more credible than wrgsb expert that a inch discrepancy created a foreseeable risk of falling.as such,the district court did not err in determining that wrgsb was required to discover and remedy the riser height discrepancy.
while wrgsb is thus charged with the duty to discover and repair the riser height discrepancy,wrgsb argues that its relationship to insignia is such that insignia is primarily liable to kirschbaum for the injury he suffered as a result of the riser height discrepancy.as a result,wrgsb believes that it is entitled to indemnification from insignia,a right that enures to a person who,without active fault on his own part,has been compelled,by reason of some legal obligation,to pay damages occasioned by the initial negligence of another,and for which he himself is only secondarily liable.builders supply mccabe.wrgsb maintains that it is only secondarily insignia primarily the damage to kirschbaum because the agreement between itself and insignia obligated insignia to correct not just the broken handrail,but the riser height discrepancy as well.
accordingly,we must look to the agreement between wrgsb and insignia in order to determine which party assumed the primary obligation for discovering and correcting the riser height discrepancy.as noted,we interpret the contract in accordance with standards dictated by illinois law.under illinois law,a contract express provisions govern when the contract is unambiguous.see wright chicago title ins,d.if a contract language can not be interpreted in more than one way,a court must construe the meaning of the contract by looking at words used and can not interpret the contract in a way contrary to the plain and obvious meaning of these words.beals enterprises,industrial hard chrome,d.unless the contract clearly specifies its own meanings,the court must interpret the words or language of the contract with their common and generally accepted meanings.id.at.further,the court must place the meanings of words within the context of the contract as a whole.id.at.
on appeal,wrgsb bases its argument primarily on of the agreement,which reads in relevant part 
insignia shall maintain the buildings,appurtenances and common areas of the gsb building in good condition according to local standards for comparable properties in the immediate market area surrounding the property,and,in any event,in accordance with the standards and conditions specified by wrgsb associates from time to time.maintenance and repair items shall include,but shall not be limited to,interior and exterior janitorial services,exterior grounds and landscaping services,repairs and alterations to existing improvements,plumbing,parking areas,electrical systems,painting,carpentry,maintenance and repair of mechanical systems and such other maintenance and repair work as is reasonably necessary.
emphasis added.wrgsb also cites two other sections of the agreement as evidence of insignia alleged obligation to correct the riser height discrepancy.section of the agreement states that insignia must use due care in the selection and supervision of its personnel.in addition,of the agreement requires insignia to use its best efforts to ensure that the gsb building is kept in compliance with applicable building codes.wrgsb argues that these contract provisions clearly transfer to insignia the building owner duty to discover and remedy all hazardous conditions on the premises.
as an initial matter,wrgsb reliance on sections requiring due care in the selection of personnel and requiring compliance with applicable laws and building codes is misplaced.wrgsb has simply failed to produce any evidence that kirschbaum accident is due to insignia negligently hiring personnel.neither has wrgsb shown that kirschbaum accident resulted from insignia failure to maintain the gsb building in accordance with applicable building codes.consequently,neither nor of the agreement aids wrgsb argument.
we also disagree with wrgsb reliance on of the agreement,for wrgsb appears to confuse insignia obligation to maintain and repair the building with an obligation to discover structural defects,such as the riser height discrepancy.that the agreement does not require insignia to discover latent structural defects is apparent from the language of,which repeatedly emphasizes insignia duty to undertake maintenance and repairs.the two bases of liability at issue i
