are insurance companies collectively,the insurance companies which brought a subrogation suit against,inter alia,city of new orleans the city to recover payments that they had made to their insured for losses incurred in a warehouse fire.the insurance companies now appeal the district court grant of the city motion for summary judgment based on louisiana discretionary function immunity statute.concluding that the insurance companies successfully raised genuine issues of material fact on the first prong of the test used to determine whether applies,we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
facts and proceedings 
west coast liquidators wcl operated a vast warehouse in eastern new orleans and used it as a distribution center to serve the retail outlets of macfrugal,macfrugal in the southeastern united states.early on the morning of march,wcl employees called the new orleans fire department nofd after discovering a fire in the portable storage racks in the warehouse.the sensors for the automatic sprinkler system were located on the high ceiling,more than feet above the portable shelves where the fire had started.this allowed the fire to grow and spread for some minutes before the temperature at the ceiling rose sufficiently to activate the sprinkler system.
the result was a fire.four engines and ladder trucks were dispatched initially,but a total of engine companies ultimately participated.in the course of efforts,the nofd called on the local electrical utility company,new orleans public service,to turn off all power to the building,after first confirming that doing so would not deactivate the sprinkler system.the nofd later ordered the power restored,but did so without first either having the electrical system checked by an electrical engineer or obtaining a permit.during the course of its continuing efforts following its declaration that the fire was under control,the nofd ordered the automatic sprinkler system turned off in an effort to reduce the water damage to merchandise in the areas of the warehouse that were unaffected by the fire.in addition,the nofd commander at the scene ordered that the large bay doors of the warehouse be opened to ventilate the building,notwithstanding a wind velocity in excess of miles per hour.
the firefighters continued their activities,finally declaring the fire out at and thereafter conducting overhaul search for materials or hot spots that were not completely extinguished and could.in this search,however,they did not inspect the upper levels of the fixed racks which covered the majority of the warehouse,but confined their search to the shorter portable racks.six minutes after declaring the fire before nofd returned responsibility for the facility to wcl employees and departed,leaving one engine and a company of four firefighters as a fire watch.when the nofd left,the bay doors were still open and the automatic sprinkler system was still off.
at,the fire rekindled in the upper level of the fixed racks,over feet away from the area of the first fire.as the insurance companies put it,w ithout any sprinkler system,and with the wind blowing through the open doors,the fire quickly spread and destroyed the warehouse and its contents.
the first fire was determined to have resulted from arson,but the cause of the later fire is disputed.materials ignited by the first fire might have,or the second fire might have resulted from the of the electrical power rails following the first fire.in any event,the insurance companies paid the full claim submitted by their insured for the loss of the merchandise in the warehouse,then filed this subrogation suit to recover their payments from the parties the insurance companies allege were actually responsible for the the city,which the insurance companies insist was vicariously liable for the acts of nofd personnel.
the insurance companies alleged that the nofd negligent actions and omissions included attempting to restore electrical power before an electrical inspection had been conducted,in violation of code and policy turning off the sprinkler system without posting personnel with radios at the sprinkler valves,in contravention of a specific regulation opening the large bay doors before the fire was declared out,despite wind velocities of mph failing to overhaul any of the upper level racks even though they had been subjected to intense heat and departing the scene under these conditions within six minutes after declaring the fire out,without leaving adequate personnel and equipment for a fire watch.
the city filed a motion for summary judgment based on its contract with wcl,but that motion was ultimately denied in response to the insurance companies motion for reconsideration.the city then filed a second motion for summary judgment,this one based on two louisiana statutes that immunize the city and its employees from civil suits for damages based on allegations of acts negligently taken in the course of their duties forbidding the imposition of liability on public entities or their employees when they perform policymaking or discretionary acts within the course and scope of their lawful powers and duties,and denying a cause of action against a public entity for damage caused by remedial acts reasonably taken to abate a public emergency.the district court granted this second motion for summary judgment,ruling that the city was immune from suit under the district court denied the insurance companies motion for reconsideration or relief from judgment,or,in the alternative,certification of the judgment as final for immediate appeal.after all other defendants in the case were dismissed through settlement,voluntary dismissal,or summary judgment,the insurance companies appeal of summary judgment in the city favor became ripe.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court a motion for summary judgment is properly granted only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact an issue is material if its resolution could affect the outcome of the action in deciding whether a fact issue has been created,we must view the facts and the inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party 
the standard for summary judgment mirrors that for judgment as a matter of law thus,the court must review all of the evidence in the record to which the parties invite the court attention but make no credibility determinations or weigh any evidence in reviewing all the evidence,the court must disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe,and should give credence to the evidence favoring the nonmoving party as well as that evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached 
we also review the district court interpretation of state statutes de novo,resolving questions of louisiana law the way the louisiana supreme court would interpret the statute based upon prior precedent,legislation,and relevant commentary.
