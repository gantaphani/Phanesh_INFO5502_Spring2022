on this appeal we must determine if the district court abused its discretion when it dismissed appellant complaint with prejudice and,therefore,rendered appellees counterclaims moot.appellant jeffrey silverstein,the executor of his father marvin silverstein estate,brought this action seeking partition of a brokerage account held in the name of marvin silverstein and marvin brother and sister,edward silverstein and rita chase,as tenants in common.appellees,rita chase and her husband jack chase,counterclaimed alleging that,prior to his death,marvin silverstein had agreed to relinquish his interest in the brokerage account then worth,to rita chase as reimbursement to her for money she spent on behalf of morris silverstein,who was marvin and rita father.rita claims of the value of the account or from the estate plus an additional amount of for monies allegedly loaned to marvin silverstein.pursuant to.b,the district court,during a bench trial,held that the statements contained in a document entitled cancellation of indebtedness coi were admissible.although marvin silverstein did not sign the coi,the district court held that the document established that marvin silverstein did relinquish his interest in the securities at issue to his sister rita chase.therefore,the district court dismissed the appellant complaint and rendered appellees counterclaims moot.
we conclude that the district court abused its discretion when it admitted the coi into evidence in its entirety.we therefore vacate the decision to dismiss the complaint and counterclaims.despite this error by the district court,we also suggest,but do not decide,that a portion of the coi may be admissible pursuant to.or.therefore,the case is remanded to the district court with instructions to reinstate appellant claim and appellees counterclaims and to retry the case,considering whether the portion of the coi that states w e,edward and marvin silverstein had agreed to reimburse rita silverstein chase at the time of the settlement of the morris silverstein estate matter with marion silverstein is admissible pursuant to rule or rule.
background 
jeffrey silverstein,son of marvin silverstein,commenced this action as executor of the estate of marvin silverstein in an attempt to recover the interest of the decedent marvin in certain securities that were obtained by marvin,his brother edward silverstein edward,and his sister rita chase rita from the estate of their father,morris silverstein morris.the securities were held by marvin,edward,and rita as tenants in common.
according to the district court findings of fact and consistent with the record,it is apparent that rita spent approximately on behalf of morris before he died in.after a stipulation was entered into in the westchester county surrogate court in,the three children marvin,edward,and rita received equal distributions from morris estate.included in the distribution to the children were certain securities that the children were to own each as tenants in common.these securities were deposited in a common account at shearson lehman now solomon smith barney.the account was registered in the names of edward,marvin,and rita,as tenants in common,but only rita social security number and signature were listed with the account.
in an attempt to reimburse rita for the money spent on behalf of their father,edward,on or about may,assigned his interest in the account to rita in a document labeled cancellation of indebtedness.the coi reads as follows 
we,edward and marvin silverstein for ourselves,our heirs,and assigns do transfer all of our rights,title and interest,to our sister rita silverstein chase,in the brokerage account number,maintained as tenancy in common with or at shearson lehman brothers at greenwich plaza,greenwich.
we authorize our financial consultant timothy nuland to make such transfer on the books of shearson lehman brothers,either to an account solely in the name of rita silverstein chase or by deleting our names from the above said account or by any other method.
this transfer is made in recognition of the expenditures for labor and services made by rita silverstein chase since october,for our mutual interest,in the estate of our father morris silverstein.
we,edward and marvin silverstein had agreed to reimburse rita silverstein chase at the time of the settlement of the morris silverstein estate matter with marion silverstein.
this transfer is in consideration of the cancellation of all prior indebtedness and interest thereon owed by either of us to our sister rita silverstein chase.
although marvin name appears in the coi and is typed under the signature line,marvin did not sign the document.in fact,marvin did not show up on the day that both brothers were to sign the coi document.after edward assignment to rita,of the shares of stock in the common account were transferred to an account held by rita the stock in controversy is the that remained in the common account.appellant does not challenge the fact that rita owned of the stock in the common account following edward transfer of his share to her.
the remaining in the common account,which appellant claims belonged to marvin,was transferred from street name into certificate form in or about june in certificate form,this stock was held in the names of marvin,rita,and edward as tenants in common.the common account in which it resides is apparently controlled by rita.appellant claims that the remaining in the common account belonged to marvin and that it should now be transferred to marvin estate.
the issue that we must address in this case is evidentiary.more specifically,we must determine whether the coi through which edward transferred his interest in the common account to rita should be admissible to determine whether marvin also relinquished his interest to rita.the district court considered the issue of the admissibility of the coi thoroughly.it concluded that the entire coi was admissible pursuant to.b,and therefore the collateral statements included in the coi that affect the interest of marvin were admissible as well.see silverstein smith barney,civ.jsm,wl,april.the district court concluded that,based on the coi,marvin intended to transfer his interest to rita.this is a diversity case,and this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.
ii.discussion 
a.did the district court abuse its discretion when it admitted the coi document in its entirety 
this court reviews a district court decision to admit evidence for an abuse of discretion.see pescatore pan am.world airways,cir.appellant does not challenge the admissibility of the coi for purposes of establishing that edward transferred his interest in the common account to rita.appellant agrees that the coi meets the requirements of a statement against interest for edward and thus,with respect to edward,is admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule pursuant to.b appellant does challenge the admissibility of the collateral statements included in the coi that affect marvin interest in the common account.therefore,in this case and in the context of rule b,we must consider if collateral statements included in a statement against interest,which do not adversely affect the declarant edward,are admissible.the district court concluded that the entire coi was admissible,and therefore the collateral statements included in the coi that affect the interest of marvin were admissible.see silverstein,wl,at.we disagree.in addition,it is necessary to address the residual hearsay exception and the hearsay exception for statements in documents affecting an interest in property.
admissibility under.b 
the admissibility of the coi for purposes of affecting marvin interest in the common account boils down to an analysis of the admissibility of collateral statements in statements against interest.the issue of the admissibility of collateral portions of statements against interest that affect a third party has been addressed by the supreme court in the context of a criminal case.see williamson united states,d holding that the statement against interest exception to the rule against hearsay does not extend to collateral statements within a statement
