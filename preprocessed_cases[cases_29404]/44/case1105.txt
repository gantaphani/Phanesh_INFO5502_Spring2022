as this is an appeal from the district court grant of a motion to dismiss,we,like the district court,accept the factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable to appellants.see lora pena fbi,cir per curiam.the allegations contained in appellants complaint are derived substantially from a page report prepared by the sec office of investigations the oig report,which describes in detail the sec failed investigation of madoff ponzi scheme

appellants bear the burden of demonstrating that their claims fall within the scope of the ftca waiver of government immunity,while the government has the burden of proving the applicability of the discretionary function exception.merando,at internal quotation marks omitted.as we explain,the district court correctly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.
the ftca waives the federal government sovereign immunity with respect to tort claims for money damages.see b.the discretionary function exception limits that waiver,eliminating jurisdiction for claims based upon the exercise of a discretionary function on the part of an employee of the government.see a.specifically,pursuant to the dfe,the government retains sovereign immunity with respect to a ny claim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the government,whether or not the discretion involved be abused.id.in this way,the discretionary function exception draws a boundary between congress willingness to impose tort liability upon the united states and its desire to protect certain governmental activities from exposure to suit by private individuals.united states varig airlines.congress enacted the dfe to prevent judicial of legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social,economic,and political policy through the medium of an action in tort.id.at.
to determine whether the dfe applies,courts employ a test.first,a court must consider whether the action is a matter of choice for the acting employee.this inquiry is mandated by the language of the exception conduct can not be discretionary unless it involves an element of judgment or choice.berkovitz united states.second,a court must determine whether the judgment exercised is of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.id.this is because the dfe protects only governmental actions and decisions based on considerations of public policy.id.at.notably,if a regulation allows the employee discretion,the very existence of the regulation creates a strong presumption that a discretionary act authorized by the regulation involves consideration of the same policies which led to the promulgation of the regulations.united states gaubert.

in most respects,appellants arguments repeat those uniformly rejected by other courts that have considered suits against the sec brought by victims of the madoff ponzi scheme.after briefly describing how we reach the same conclusions as these other courts on the overlapping issues,we focus on the two bases on which appellants seek to distinguish their complaint.
appellants contend that the sec violated several mandatory internal procedures during the blmis investigation by failing to obtain trading verifications failing to commence investigations promptly failing to draft closing reports and failing to log investigations into the sec examination tracking system.appellants have not demonstrated,however,that the procedures on which they rely are anything more than discretionary guidelines for sec personnel.
