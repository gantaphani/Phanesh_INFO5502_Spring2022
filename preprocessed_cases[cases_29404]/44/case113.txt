katherine cady,on behalf of the estate of her son,paul victor galambos,iii,brought this action after galambos death from injuries that he suffered while he was a pretrial detainee at the cumberland county jail ccj.the action alleged that employees of corizon,the private company providing healthcare services at ccj,were deliberately indifferent to galambos serious medical needs in violation of his fourteenth amendment rights.the defendants sought summary judgment,arguing that they were within a category of private employees protected by qualified immunity by virtue of their duties,and were also entitled to immunity on the particular facts.
the district court assumed dubitante that the employees fell into a category of private employees eligible for qualified immunity,and denied the summary judgment motions filed by defendants michael trueworthy,barbara walsh,and linda williams,all employees of corizon.it reasoned,after a detailed review of the facts,that there remained material and disputed issues of fact as to the claims against all three individuals which precluded the grant of immunity at this point.
the three defendants now appeal,arguing that they are entitled to qualified immunity.the plaintiff,noting there are material issues of fact in dispute,including conflicts in the opinions of expert witnesses,argues that there is no appellate jurisdiction under the doctrine of johnson jones,even if the defendants were theoretically eligible for the protections of qualified immunity.like the district court,we bypass the question of whether qualified immunity is categorically unavailable to these defendants,because the district court denial of immunity turned on findings that there remain disputed issues of material fact and inference.we do not have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal under johnson.we dismiss this appeal for want of appellate jurisdiction.
we have jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal of a denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity only insofar as the appeal rests on legal,rather than factual grounds.see johnson,u.at.we therefore summarize the facts in the light most favorable to the party,taking as unchallenged any inferences that the district court drew in that party favor.
background and named defendants 
corizon is a private independent contractor that provided healthcare services to inmates at ccj under a contract with ccj effective january,through december,corizon was responsible for healthcare at ccj,and to that end developed a set of governing policies and procedures.corizon was also required to regularly confer with the cumberland county sheriff or his designee concerning both existing healthcare procedures and any changes to those procedures.
michael trueworthy 
defendant michael trueworthy,a psychiatric nurse practitioner,worked as a per diem employee of corizon from august through december,and reported directly to alfonso corona,corizon psychiatrist for ccj.trueworthy saw inmates for medication evaluation and management,and renewed prescriptions for inmates who had already been prescribed those medications.he was never during his employment at ccj,and was not present at the facility for all emergencies.generally,social workers at ccj would provide trueworthy with lists of inmates for him to attend to during his shifts.
barbara walsh 
defendant barbara walsh,a registered nurse,became corizon director of nursing in,and she was employed in that position during the events that gave rise to this case.she supervised the infirmary and the nursing staff.she described ccj as chaotically busy.she reported directly to corizon health services administrator,diane north.north is not a named defendant.walsh was a party to the constant discussion among the corizon staff regarding sending inmates out to the emergency room er.the cost of having an inmate transported to a local er by ambulance had risen dramatically,and was nearly,in the fall of.corizon apparently wanted to keep costs contained,and also assure that nurses were performing only medically necessary actions.in light of these concerns,walsh instructed the nursing staff to contact her at any time,even when she was not on duty,so that she could assess a given situation before deciding to send an inmate out to the er for additional care.according to the parties stipulated facts,the reason given for this policy was that the staff nurses excuse of their nursing licenses being at risk was not an acceptable basis for a decision to send an inmate out to the er.
linda williams 
defendant linda williams,a licensed clinical social worker,was responsible for assessing inmates current mental health status.she undertook these health assessments from outside inmates cells,and never entered galambos cell to assess him.when galambos first came to ccj,williams took part in his intake and initial evaluations and subsequent evaluations.from december through december,williams observed galambos each day and spoke with him on some days.
events at ccj 
galambos entered ccj as a pretrial detainee on august,following his arrest for robbery,refusal to submit to arrest,and violation of bail conditions.he had an extensive history of mental illness and substance abuse,was diagnosed at the time with schizoaffective disorder,had a history of suicide attempts,and had previously received psychiatric treatment.
on his arrival at ccj,galambos resisted being fingerprinted and headbutted an intake officer.his condition was described by the plaintiff expert as actively psychotic,and a jury could so conclude.he initially refused his medications and he was placed on suicide watch,where he remained for a few days.at this point,corizon mental health staff,including williams,was aware of galambos history of mental illness.they had access to his past records,including from his stay at an treatment program at spring harbor hospital called access,where galambos had been admitted in the past,most recently in june.grassian,one of the plaintiff experts,said the record shows no evidence that trueworthy ever reviewed those records.
galambos agreed to take an oral dose of haldol on august,at which point he was stepped down to psych watch from suicide watch.he was taken off psych watch on august.
during september,galambos underwent additional evaluations that resulted in a medication recommendation.trueworthy offered a recommendation and medication plan on september,which recommended continued use of the medications he was on when he entered ccj zyprexa for psychosis and cogentin for potential side effects of zyprexa.trueworthy was aware that galambos had a history of suicide attempts and believed that galambos prognosis was poor without proper medication management.nonetheless,trueworthy said he believed that because galambos was logical and involved as of september,trueworthy did not need to see him regularly.the plaintiff expert,grassian,has noted that on september,galambos was observed to be actively psychotic grassian opined that trueworthy september plan,which left galambos medication regimen unchanged,was a violation of any standard of care.he also opined that the failure of the record to note galambos activity from september to november was unacceptable.
by november,williams did note that galambos exhibited a pattern of irregular acceptance of his medication.there is a dispute over whether ccj could forcibly administer medication to inmates.on november,galambos submitted a medical request slip asking that he be given seroquel instead of zyprexa.there was no response and,according to the plaintiff expert,the record contains no explanation for ignoring galambos request.trueworthy and corona had previously discussed safety issues surrounding prescribing seroquel in a correctional setting,but it was listed on corizon medication formulary at the time.
on november,galambos was placed in maximum security after assaulting another inmate,and he remained there until november.during this period,galambos asked to see the psychiatrist and reiterated his medication change request.on november,debra konieczko,a licensed clinical social worker who had treated galambos when he was in the access program,visited galambos in ccj.after meeting with galambos and observing that he was highly agitated and anxious,demonstrating psychomotor agitation,and was difficult to interrupt,konieczko spoke with a corizon social worker about galambos.the corizon social worker met with galambos and reportedly did not observe the problems that konieczko noted.after galambos was allowed out of maximum security on november,he continued to ask to switch to seroquel,saying that zyprexa made him feel sedated in the morning and unable to sleep at night.
on november,corizon accepted from galambos a signed release of responsibility form that allowed him to refuse the zyprexa.on november,he again asked to see a psychiatrist for a change in medication,and also asked for a change of housing,reporting that other inmates were threatening to kill him.no change in medication took place,and on november,trueworthy renewed galambos zyprexa and cogentin prescriptions.
galambos chart indicates that at some point on december,he completed a request slip seeking mental health services,on which he indicated i need to find out what meds will work for me.also on december,galambos met with trueworthy to discuss his medication situation for the first time since galambos began requesting new medication in early november.galambos told trueworthy that he had not taken the zyprexa for a week.trueworthy did not discuss substitute medications with galambos.that galambos was no longer on his medication did not concern trueworthy,because trueworthy believed that galambos already would have had problems due to stopping his medication since he had not been taking zyprexa for a while as of that date.
as of this december meeting,trueworthy discontinued all of galambos psychiatric medications,which meant that galambos would no longer be offered medication on a daily basis.trueworthy did not see galambos again,and he maintains that he never saw galambos december request slip.
sometime in the hours following his meeting with trueworthy,galambos verbally threatened to commit suicide to a correctional officer.social worker williams met with galambos on december to discuss the threat,and at the meeting he told her that he was not serious about committing suicide and that he wanted to change his housing assignment so he was not housed with pedophiles.according to williams,it was common for inmates to complain about being housed with inmates charged with sex crimes.but according to grassian assessment of galambos records,williams made no effort to determine whether galambos was or was not housed with pedophiles and so did not make the differential diagnosis as to whether his fears were reasonable or delusional.grassian opined that williams should have undertaken such an inquiry.on december williams was not concerned that galambos was suicidal based on her overall assessment,which included that galambos told her he was not suicidal.grassian called williams assessment at this juncture and failure to inquire further into galambos mental state a cavalier dismissal of his suicidality,and opined that it was grossly negligent and a failure to meet her professional responsibilities.the record suggests that williams did not discuss galambos medication situation with him on this date.the information that he was not on any medication was set forth in his file.
despite williams assessment,galambos in fact tried to commit suicide that night.on the evening of december,galambos was found in his cell with a stab wound in his neck,made with a pencil that was found under his bed.the stab wound narrowly missed his carotid artery.the plaintiff characterizes this as a suicidal action and a sign of how very sick and in need of care galambos was.he was sent outside the jail to brighton first care,an affiliated medical center,for appropriate medical services.he was placed on suicide watch upon his december return to ccj.on december,williams observed that galambos was talking to himself,laughing,and standing naked in front of the window.he was not responsive to her attempts to engage him in conversation.williams placed a call to corona regarding galambos condition,and corona recommended giving him a dose of abilify,which was done.the next day,williams again observed galambos and thought that he was talking to someone who was not there and did not appear to be thinking coherently.
on december and,galambos continued to regress.he reported to williams that he was hearing voices and that he felt like someone had stolen his brain.corona observed that galambos was floridly psychotic when he examined him on december.corona and williams both observed galambos standing on the table in his cell,talking to the wall.the facility hot book indicates that on december the water was turned off in galambos cell because he had been trying to fill the sink and inhale the water.on december,galambos condition continued to worsen,and he was unable to hold a conversation.
in the afternoon,galambos did what is referred to at several points in the record as a swan dive he stood naked on top of the table in his cell,and while a staff member was trying to talk him down,he jumped into the air and spun around to land on his upper back and shoulders on the cement floor of the cell.the staff members were concerned and immediately brought galambos to the medical unit to receive emergency attention.however,he was not sent out to a hospital that day for treatment of his injuries.
he was badly bruised by the fall,and though the diagnosis would not be confirmed until two days later when he was sent out to a hospital following a different incident,he sustained several broken ribs and a transverse process fracture.one of the plaintiff experts also opined that galambos likely suffered a concussion and had a serious head injury.
when galambos was in the medical unit following this incident,director of nursing walsh performed a walk through assessment of him,but did not document her observations.galambos was placed on suicide observation in a cell in the medical unit,but was not admitted to the medical infirmary,where he would have been seen by a doctor.walsh could not recall galambos receiving any services in the medical unit either.walsh asserts that she did not consider this incident to be an emergency situation,and that she considered galambos jump from the table aberrant behavior rather than a serious suicide attempt.
until this point,williams said that she felt that ccj was capable of treating galambos.it was only after the swan dive incident that williams felt that galambos should be transferred to riverview,a psychiatric facility acting within her authority,she then faxed the transfer requests for galambos and another inmate on the morning of december.she had not done so for galambos before and in particular had not done so after galambos stabbed himself in the neck with a pencil.soon after making this inquiry,she learned that riverview did not have the capacity to admit galambos at that point and that he would be put on the waiting list.a riverview staff member suggested to williams that spring harbor,a private hospital,might be an alternative placement.there is no evidence that williams attempted to follow up on the spring harbor option.williams did not contact corona at this point,nor did anyone else.
rather than being placed in some sort of outside medical facility,galambos remained in his cell,on suicide watch,in the medical unit.
on december,williams found galambos lying on the floor of his cell with blood on his face.he was not responsive to her.a nurse treated his wounds,and galambos told her that he fell off his toilet and was suicidal.williams placed a call to the maine attorney general office to explore the possibility of securing an expedited transfer to riverview.later that afternoon,a correctional officer observed galambos lurch forward and down and after making no attempt to break his fall,hitting his nose and face on the floor.this,in addition to his injuries from the december jump from the table,would have caused him significant pain.walsh spoke with galambos and asked if she could give him some medication.he responded,yes,i take anything at this point.based on this consent,walsh sought and received an order for a heavy dose of emergency psychotropic medication to be administered.in the view of the plaintiff expert,galambos was overdosed in a dangerous manner,and that may have been a contributing factor in his death.
to deal with galambos obviously behavior,several staff members,including walsh and health services administrator north,decided that the use of restraints was necessary.galambos was put into a chair,covered with a blanket to preserve his privacy,and was given this heavy,emergency dose of medication before he was strapped in.at this point,he was observed to be calm and cooperating.when he was strapped into the chair at approximately pm,he began yelling loudly.he was told that he would be released from the restraint chair when he calmed down and stopped yelling.one of the plaintiff experts,jagminas,opined that given galambos injuries from the december broken strapped into a chair would have been very painful.about ninety minutes later,after he had calmed down,he was released from the restraint chair,and was released back to his cell in the medical unit at about pm.
walsh believed the use of the restraint chair was appropriate because galambos was in a crisis,consisting of his various actions of,but also being completely undressed,urinating,and yelling.by contrast,the plaintiff experts believe the appropriate response was not overmedication and restraint,but placement in a psychiatric hospital.grassian has opined that under the circumstances and given how bruised galambos was from jumping off the table and landing on his back and shoulders putting him in a restraint was very,very dangerous.grassian also opined that the emergency dose of medication given to galambos that afternoon overmedicated him in a dangerous manner.
by pm that evening,after his release from the restraint chair,galambos was observed pacing and banging his head off the wall in his cell.at about pm,he was given an intramuscular injection of ativan while officers restrained him.the needle broke off the syringe as the medication was being administered,so after the treating nurse obtained a new syringe,galambos received the full dose at about pm.by pm,he was naked on the floor of his cell,had urinated on the floor,and was largely incoherent.the treating nurse called corizon medical director,todd tritch to evaluate galambos.
tritch found contusions on the front of galambos head with fresh blood,along with contusions on his right shoulder.tritch recommended galambos be sent to the hospital er at maine medical center mmc for a comprehensive assessment.the responding emergency medical technicians that arrived to take galambos to the er were told about galambos most recent,presenting problems,but were not told about galambos somersault from the table in his cell two days earlier.walsh asserts that there was no need to advise the medical center about that incident.galambos was admitted to mmc with fractures of the transverse process and multiple rib fractures,and was kept overnight at the hospital for observation.
on december,williams,working with galambos attorney,began the process of having galambos civilly committed so that he could be transferred to riverview upon his release from the emergency room.however,riverview required intake to take place during the facility regular hours,and so galambos could not go directly from mmc to riverview.he was discharged back to ccj at around pm on december.upon his return to ccj,galambos was housed in a cell under suicide watch observation.that cell was under watch,which required a ccj correctional officer to keep constant visual contact on galambos at all times.that evening,galambos complained to the correctional officers that he was in pain,and he was given ibuprofen.he then shoved the paper medication cup into his nostril,where it was removed by the nurse on duty with tweezers.galambos was then given a dose of haldol for a psychiatric or behavioral emergency.
at approximately in the morning on december,a correctional officer observed galambos get up and then fall face down on the floor,and then get up and fall again,striking his head against the wall.when the staff members entered his cell to assist him,they discovered that galambos was not responsive and had no pulse.he was pronounced dead soon after.
the cause of death was later determined to be acute pulmonary thromboemboli,caused by deep leg vein thrombosis,caused in turn by blunt force trauma.according to two physicians testifying as experts on behalf of the plaintiff,the heavy dose of emergency medication on december which rendered galambos nearly comatose and the use of the chair following the injuries galambos sustained when he jumped off the table both significantly increased the risk of developing thrombosis and were likely contributing factors in causing galambos death.
procedural history 
on january,cady filed a third amended complaint in the district of maine raising a claim under that defendants trueworthy,walsh,and were deliberately indifferent to galambos serious medical needs on october,trueworthy,walsh,and williams each filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that their performance did not fall so low as to constitute deliberate indifference and that they were entitled to qualified immunity.
on march,the magistrate judge issued a thorough,page recommended decision denying the defendants motions for summary judgment.the recommendation expressed doubt that these defendants,as employees of a private corporation performing state functions,would be entitled to qualified immunity under richardson mcknight,but in light of the relative uncertainty surrounding that question of law,the magistrate judge included an alternative recommendation,in which she assumed that qualified immunity would be available to these defendants.
under that alternative recommendation,the magistrate judge concluded that as to each of the three defendants,there remained genuine issues of fact in dispute as to whether their acts and omissions constituted deliberate indifference.see coscia town of pembroke,cir a state and its subdivisions are under a substantive obligation imposed by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to refrain at least from treating a pretrial detainee with deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to health.on that basis,the magistrate judge recommended denying the defendants motions for summary judgment.
as to each defendant,the magistrate judge concluded that even if they were not categorically disqualified from claiming qualified immunity,the record was sufficient for a reasonable finder of fact to conclude based on the evidence and permissible inferences therefrom that each defendant knew or should have known that galambos psychotic condition reflected an extremely serious medical need that,if left untreated,would generate a substantial risk of serious harm to his health and safety.cady cumberland cnty.jail,cv,wl,at,coscia,at noting that for pretrial detainees,proof of deliberate indifference requires a showing of greater culpability than negligence but less than a purpose to do harm and may consist of showing a conscious failure to provide medical services where they would be reasonably appropriate.
as to trueworthy,the magistrate judge concluded that a jury could find that the decision to order a stop to the offering of prescribed medications on december was an act of deliberate indifference that may have been a substantial factor in bringing about galambos rapid decompensation in the days that followed.the magistrate judge also noted that a reasonable juror could consider the absence of counseling to be further evidence of deliberately indifferent medical care trueworthy contends that corizon policies called for counseling at the december juncture,but also contends that there is no evidence that counseling did not occur,even if he did not do it himself.
the magistrate judge found that based on the record,a reasonable finder of fact could have concluded the following as to walsh she knew about galambos rapid regression in december she was directly involved in his care based on her
