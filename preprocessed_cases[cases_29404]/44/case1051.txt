opinion of the court 
michael lucht and his company,mrl development i,llc,purchased treated lumber for a deck on his vacation home in the virgin islands.the lumber allegedly decayed prematurely.after replacing rotten deck boards,lucht brought suit against the retailer,wholesaler,and treatment company of the lumber.
lucht purchased the lumber between and.he began replacing deck boards in,but he claims he did not discover the severity of the problem until the fall of.lucht and mrl filed suit in february,alleging the following claims against the appellees a uniform commercial code contract claim a common law contract claim a breach of warranty claim a negligence claim a strict liability claim and a deceptive trade practices claim under the virgin islands deceptive trade practices act dtpa.the appellees are the retailer,whitecap investment corporation,paradise lumber paradise the wholesaler,putnam lumber export company and putnam family properties,putnam and the treatment company,great southern wood preserving,great southern.
the district court granted summary judgment against lucht and mrl on the basis that all claims were.we agree,except that we will review the tort claims under the gist of the action doctrine,and will affirm on that basis.
the underlying product at the heart of this dispute,the lumber,was pressure treated by great southern.it offers various services,one of which is called yellawood and one designated as treatment services only tso.under the tso process,great southern does not purchase the lumber itself,but rather treats lumber purchased by the customer to the customer requested treatment level.great southern does not test the lumber for retention or penetration levels when it fills a tso lumber order.yellawood is lumber that has been purchased and pressure treated by great southern.it is tested for retention and penetration levels and includes a warranty.
great southern supplied primarily tso lumber to putnam on a wholesale basis.the tso lumber has a green tag.the appellees assert that the appellants purchased tso lumber rather than yellawood lumber,and lucht stated on the record that he believes the tags on the lumber were green.
the lumber that the appellants purchased was for a home that mrl acquired in the virgin islands to serve as a vacation home for lucht and a rental property for mrl.lucht began renovating the home,a project which extended from to december.as part of this project,lucht added a deck which he constructed with lumber that was purchased from paradise.
after finishing the deck,at the latest in december,lucht visited the home every three months.lucht alleges that,starting in,each time he visited the home he had to replace a few boards in the deck.a year after he started replacing the boards,in the fall of,he asserts that he had a meeting with a carpenter friend who informed lucht that he had been replacing bad lumber all over the island.lucht contends that he then realized that the problem with his deck was widespread and would likely continue.
the appellants filed their complaint in this action in the virgin islands superior court in february.they amended their complaint on march.the appellees thereafter removed the case to the district court of the virgin islands based on diversity jurisdiction.in addition,the appellees asserted various against each other.
putnam filed the first dispositive motion pertinent to this appeal,requesting that the district court dismiss the appellants contract,breach of warranty,and dtpa claims.the district court granted this motion thereafter,great southern and putnam filed motions for summary judgment,and paradise joined in each motion.the appellees also filed motions for summary judgment on the.the district court granted the appellees motions for summary judgment against appellants,dismissed the motions regarding the as moot,and entered judgment in favor of the appellees.
the district court found that the appellants contract claims were because they were subject to the statute of limitations the discovery rule is inapplicable under the and the statute of limitations had thus expired in december prior to the filing of the complaint.similarly,the district court found the warranty claim was.as to the negligence and strict liability claims,the district court found that although the applicable statute of limitations is subject to the discovery rule,lucht discovered the rotting lumber in,his investigation of the issue was insufficient,and he was therefore ineligible for tolling of the limitations period.finally,the district court found that the dtpa claims were subject to the statute of limitations in the version of the dtpa in place at the time of filing the complaint,rather than under the amended statute which provided a statute of limitations because the claims accrued at or before the time of purchase in.accordingly,the district court held that the dtpa claims were.
the appellants timely appealed the district court dismissal.
the district court had jurisdiction under a and a and because the parties meet the requirements for diversity jurisdiction.this court has appellate jurisdiction under the appellants appealed only the district court order granting summary judgment.we apply a plenary standard in reviewing orders entered on motions for summary judgment,applying the same standard as the district court.blunt lower merion sch,cir.we must therefore consider whether there are any genuine issues of material fact such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the appellants.banks int l rental leasing,cir.in doing so,we must apply the substantive laws of the virgin islands,including its statutes of limitations.hovensa,at the fact that the district court of the virgin islands is an article iv court rather than an article iii court does not preclude the application of erie.
the appellees have advanced some arguments that were not relied upon by the district court in granting summary judgment.the appellants argue that this court should not consider any grounds other than those considered by the district court.new castle cty.union fire ins.of pittsburgh,cir a s a general rule,we will consider only issues passed upon by the court below.however,i nasmuch as our review is plenary,we may affirm the district court on any grounds supported by the record,even if the court did not rely on those grounds.blunt,at quoting nicini morra,cir.accordingly,this court may consider the other arguments that have been advanced by the appellees.
we will undertake a review of the appellants claims in the order they appear in the appellants amended complaint,starting with the breach of contract and warranty claims,moving next to the tort claims,and ending with the dtpa claims.
the appellants asserted two breach of contract claims one against putnam and one against paradise pursuant to the and common law and a breach of warranty claim against all of the appellees.common law contract and warranty claims have a statute of limitations under the virgin islands code.tit,a.the parties agree that the discovery is applicable to common law claims.the parties disagree,however,about whether the supplants the common law claims in this action and precludes the application of the discovery rule,which would in turn bar the appellants claims.tit.
in order to apply the correct statute of limitations,we must first determine whether the appellants common law claims may stand or are supplanted by the.this will allow us to then determine the applicability of the discovery rule and apply the correct statute of limitations.
in assessing whether the displaces a common law claim,this court begins with two basic principles.first,the must be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policies.tit,a bank,bradford sec.operations,cir.second,u nless displaced by the particular provisions of the,the principles of law and equity supplement its provisions.tit,b.thus,the displaces the common law only insofar as reliance on the common law would thwart the purposes of the code.bank,at.where the supplants common law contract claims,the common law action will be barred.id.
we must decide whether the virgin islands supplants the appellants common law claims.the virgin islands supreme court has not spoken on this issue.where this occurs,we are required to predict how the supreme court of the virgin islands would decide an issue of territorial law,and should seek guidance from superior court decisions in undertaking this endeavor.hovensa,at.the superior court of the virgin islands,however,is not the highest court of the territory or even an intermediate appellate court,but rather a trial court.id.at.accordingly,we are not bound by superior court decisions.see also commissioner of internal revenue estate of bosch,d d ecrees of lower state courts should be attributed some weight but the decision is not controlling where the highest court of the state has not spoken on the point.internal quotation marks omitted.
the parties have cited two territorial court decisions for their separate positions regarding the applicability of the statute of limitations.the superior court has subsumed the role of the territorial court and we will review those decisions as if they were decided by the superior court.
the virgin islands territorial court in white s e bakery,found that the plaintiff in that action could go forward with claims under both the and the common law statutes of limitation.white,at.however,white has never been cited by any other virgin islands court,and the opinion did not address the purview of the additionally,the plaintiff in white had filed his action within the statute of limitations that is provided by the,and thus the finding that the claim qualified under both statute of limitations was unnecessary.id.
six years earlier in fombrun controlled concrete,the territorial court addressed the purview of the and found that a contract for the sale of goods was supplanted by the id.at.although earlier,fombrun provides a clearer analysis and the white court failed to cite it or discuss the prior holding in fombrun.
despite fombrun persuasive qualities,these cases do not provide a clear picture of what the current law is on this issue as we would be forced to pick between two contradictory holdings one of which failed to recognize that it was creating such a division.thus,given that the territorial court decisions are not controlling on this court because the virgin islands supreme court has not spoken on the subject,estate of bosch,at,and no other virgin islands courts have cited either case other than the district court in citing fombrun,we will have to look elsewhere to make our prediction.
consequently,we will analyze the application of the by applying a plain meaning interpretation of whether lumber qualifies as a good to determine whether the appellants common law contract and warranty claims should be supplanted by the see in re am.home mortg.holdings,cir.goods are all things including specially manufactured goods which are movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale.tit.the contracts at issue in this case are clearly governed by the.the appellants allege that they had oral contracts,memorialized by invoices,with putnam and paradise,for the purchase of lumber.lumber is a thing that is movable at the time of identification to the alleged contract for sale.under a plain reading of the definition of goods,lumber is included and the appellants claims fall within the purview of the 
this conclusion is bolstered by the purpose of the t o introduce a uniform statute of limitations for sales contracts,thus eliminating jurisdictional variations and providing needed relief for concerns doing business on a nationwide scale.tit,cmt.as such,failure to apply the in this situation would thwart the purpose to provide uniform limitations periods for claims involving contracts for the sale of goods,including lumber.
because the applies,we will now address the appellants argument that the discovery rule applies to the 
the virgin islands code provides a statute of limitations for actions involving a contract except when,in special cases,a different limitation is prescribed by statute.tit.the virgin islands,on the other hand,provides that an action for breach of contract is subject to a statute of limitations.tit.this statute of limitations is restricted by the subsection that follows,subsection two,which provides that a cause of action accrues when the breach occurs,regardless of the aggrieved party lack of knowledge of the breach.tit,hereinafter referred to as subsection two.subsection four of that provision,however,states that t his section does not alter the law on tolling of the statute of limitations nor does it apply to causes of actions which have accrued before this title becomes effective.tit,hereinafter referred to as subsection four.
the appellants argue that,despite subsection two instruction that the aggrieved party knowledge is not to be considered,subsection four pronouncement allows for the application of the discovery rule to claims.the appellees argue,and the district court found,that subsection two prohibits the application of the discovery rule and subsection four refers to equitable tolling.
one virgin islands court has found that the discovery rule does not apply to the fombrun,at.this case is a territorial court case,however,and the court did not undergo a review of subsection two in conjunction with subsection four.the fombrun court did not undertake a review of what comprises the law on tolling.this court must therefore interpret the statute to determine whether the discovery rule is applicable because neither the virgin islands legislature nor the virgin islands supreme court has provided the parameters for what constitutes the law on tolling.
when interpreting a statute,this court must give effect to the legislature intent.in re am.home,at.this determination begins with the statute and if the text is plain,this court need not inquire further.id.at.if the legislature intent is made plain,it is unnecessary for us to refer to other canons of statutory construction,and indeed we should not do so.id.at.moreover,just because party opponents may proffer different interpretations of the statutory language does not make the language ambiguous.it just makes the court role difficult in deciding which interpretation is persuasive.id.at.
given the parties differing interpretations,this court must determine which interpretation of the two subsections is correct.we have indicated that both the discovery rule and equitable tolling require diligence on the part of the plaintiff with the potential consequence of losing the benefit of either doctrine the two doctrines differ,however,as to their purposes in application,at,citing william graham haughey,cir oshiver,at.
the discovery rule focuses on the plaintiff knowledge of injury,whereas equitable tolling focuses on the time to bring an action despite discovery of the injury.id.at.given the difference between the two doctrines,the two subsections each stand alone,subsection two referring to the discovery rule and subsection four referring to equitable estoppel.such a reading is consistent with this court preference to construe a statute in a way that gives meaning to all provisions.kendall russell,cir it is a well known canon of statutory construction that courts should construe statutory language to avoid interpretations that would render any phrase superfluous.
subsection two encompasses the discovery rule because it relies on the plaintiff knowledge or imputed knowledge,coinciding with subsection two prohibition on considering the aggrieved party lack of knowledge of the breach.tit.this leaves subsection four,which refers to tolling,to be applied where equitable tolling is at issue.in contrast,reading the two subsections together as the appellants request would essentially read subsection two out of the statute,rendering the phrase superfluous.see kendall,at see also hull eaton,finding that identical language of a statute was clear and weighed against the application of the discovery rule.such a result is consistent with our prior holdings.
we have previously found the discovery rule inapplicable to conversion actions under pennsylvania menichini grant,cir.in making that finding,o
