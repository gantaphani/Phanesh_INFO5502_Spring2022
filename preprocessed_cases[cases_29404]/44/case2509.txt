on may,the district court granted the ahpd motion for summary judgment because solomon had not alleged that a policy,procedure,or custom of the city of auburn hills was the cause of the alleged deprivation.moreover,the district court ruled that solomon should be allowed to amend her complaint to clarify that she was suing officer miller in his individual capacity.the district court denied officer miller motion for summary judgment after finding that he was not entitled to qualified immunity as to the fourth amendment claims because a jury question existed as to whether his conduct was objectively reasonable under the circumstances.the district court also left standing the state claims against officer miller for assault and battery and gross negligence.
