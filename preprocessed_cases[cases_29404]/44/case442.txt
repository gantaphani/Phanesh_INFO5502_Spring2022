in this case,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of john hainey,a state trooper,on a false arrest claim under.john cox iii assigns error to the court determination that qualified immunity shielded hainey from suit.after careful perscrutation of an oddly configured factual record including consideration of how,if at all,an officer consultation with a prosecutor affects the qualified immunity calculus,we affirm the district court order.
background 
on an appeal from a summary judgment order,an appellate court is held to the same ground rules that bound the trial court in the proceedings below it must construe the record and all reasonable inferences from it in favor of the nonmovant.perez volvo car,cir.we rehearse the facts with this construct in mind.because the reasonableness of trooper hainey conclusion that he had probable cause to make an arrest is the axis of this appeal,we concentrate on the information available to him at the time of the arrest.
our saga starts in norway,maine.members of the norway police department arrested joseph cox,the appellant son,for alleged involvement in a series of snowmobile thefts that occurred during the winter of.in the course of the ensuing investigation,an informant volunteered that joseph had sold drugs to high school students.the informant expressed a willingness to participate in a controlled buy,and the local gendarmes arranged a sting.the maine state police were asked to assist.
on april,dates are in that year unless otherwise informant,fitted with an electronic listening device,drove to the appellant residence in woodstock,maine.hainey and a local police officer followed in a second vehicle.once there,the informant went inside and purchased four tablets of roxicodone a version of oxycontin from joseph cox.hainey,who listened to the conversation by transmitter,overheard joseph tell the informant that his father recently had returned from a drug run to north carolina and that he could have his father procure an eighth of marijuana for future purchase.
based on what he knew to that point,hainey obtained a warrant to search the cox home for scheduled drugs,drug paraphernalia,and kindred items related to furnishing or trafficking in drugs.hainey and other officers conducted the search on the morning of may.in joseph bedroom,they found two roxicodone tablets and drug paraphernalia.in the kitchen,they found a scale with marijuana residue,a bottle containing roxicodone tablets,and an empty roxicodone bottle.the appellant was present during the search.he told the officers that the roxicodone had been legally prescribed for his back condition,that he never had provided pills to his son or to anyone else but,rather,had kept them on his person at all times except while sleeping,and that he had called his pharmacist on april because he was concerned that a few of his pills were missing.
later that morning,trooper hainey consulted with richard beauchesne,an assistant district attorney.the two reviewed the evidence obtained during the search discussed whether that evidence,together with the information previously known to hainey,amounted to probable cause to arrest the appellant and agreed that it did.hainey then made the arrest.the appellant was booked and released on bail that day.the bail bond indicated that his arrest had been for aggravated furnishing of a schedule w drug see.ann.tit,a.after some jockeying,see supra note,the assistant attorney general assigned to the case determined that he would not issue a complaint.
once all charges had been dropped,the appellant filed suit in a maine state court against various officers and entities.he alleged,under,that the named defendants had violated his constitutional rights and,in the bargain,had committed a variety of tortious acts.the defendants removed the case to the united states district court for the district of maine.see.
the sole count relevant to this appeal charges that hainey violated the appellant fourth amendment rights by arresting him without probable cause for simplicity sake,we eschew any reference to other defendants and claims.when hainey moved for summary judgment on that count,the district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge.see b b.b.the magistrate judge recommended that the count proceed to trial.
hainey lodged a timely objection to the recommendation.upon de novo review,see.b,the district court rejected the magistrate judge view and found hainey entitled to qualified immunity on the ground that an objectively reasonable police officer could have understood that there was probable cause to arrest the appellant.cox me.state police,d.accordingly,the court granted summary judgment in hainey favor.id.at.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
the appellant asseverates that hainey was not entitled to qualified immunity and,therefore,that the district court erred in granting summary judgment.after limning the standard of review and the doctrinal hereditaments appurtenant to qualified immunity,we proceed to determine whether hainey was deserving of sanctuary.
standard of review.
we afford plenary review to the district court disposition of a summary judgment motion.garside osco drug,cir.we will affirm a grant of summary judgment as long as the record demonstrates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in conducting this tamisage,we utiliz e the same criteria as the trial court,drawing all reasonable inferences from the record in the nonmovant favor.acosta ames dep t stores,cir.a decision to affirm a summary judgment order may be grounded on any rationale revealed by the record,whether or not the lower court employed that rationale.houlton citizens coalition town of houlton,cir.
in this instance,the appellant abjures any claim that a trialworthy factual dispute exists.he nonetheless insists that the undisputed facts do not sustain the qualified immunity defense and,thus,as a matter of law,do not entitle hainey to summary judgment.this posture is important because,in the absence of a genuine issue of material fact,a defendant right to qualified immunity presents a question of law.rivera murphy,cir.
b.the legal landscape.
before plunging into the qualified immunity inquiry,we deem it useful to marshal the general principles that steer that inquiry.the appellant sues under,which imposes liability upon an individual who,acting under color of state law,deprives a person of federally guaranteed rights.hoyos,cir.withal,a public actor liability under section is not absolute the doctrine of qualified immunity provides a safe harbor for a wide range of mistaken judgments.hatch dep t for children,youth their families,cir see also anderson creighton,d.this strain of immunity aspires to balance the desire to compensate those whose rights are infringed by state actors with an equally compelling desire to shield public servants from undue interference with the performance of their duties and from threats of liability which,though unfounded,may nevertheless be unbearably disruptive.buenrostro collazo,cir.in that way,the doctrine of qualified immunity protects public officials from civil liability insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.
qualified immunity serves not only as a defense to liability but also as an entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation.mitchell forsyth,d.seen in this light,many of the benefits of qualified immunity are squandered if an action is incorrectly allowed to proceed to trial.it follows that the applicability vel non of the qualified immunity doctrine should be determined at the earliest practicable stage in the case.hunter bryant,d per curiam.
the supreme court has set up a sequential analysis for determining whether a defendant violated clearly established rights of which a reasonable person would have known.see saucier katz,d.this court has construed that framework to consist of three inquiries i whether the plaintiff allegations,if true,establish a constitutional violation ii whether the constitutional right at issue was clearly established at the time of the putative violation and iii whether a reasonable officer,situated similarly to the defendant,would have understood the challenged act or omission to contravene the discerned constitutional right.limone condon,cir.under ordinary circumstances,the development of the doctrine of qualified immunity is best served by approaching these inquiries in the aforestated sequence.see saucier,at.wilson layne,d.we proceed accordingly.
qualified immunity.
we have noted that the first variable in our the plaintiff has alleged facts that show that the defendant conduct violated a constitutional be treated as a threshold question.limone,at.here,the appellant premises his section claim on an allegation that the facts and circumstances known to hainey at the time of the arrest did not give rise to a reasonable likelihood that he the appellant had furnished roxicodone to his son or any other minor and,therefore,that the arrest transgressed the fourth amendment.the first prong of the qualified immunity analysis operates at a high level of generality,and hainey,based on cox allegations,concedes this prong.see appellee br.at cox alleged conduct that amounts to a violation of a constitutional fourth amendment right to remain free of an arrest unless there is probable cause.accordingly,he has satisfied the first part of this court qualified immunity inquiry.
we accept this concession.the fourth amendment undoubtedly recognizes the right to be free from unreasonable seizures of the person.see,beck ohio,d.hence,the undisputed facts,construed in the light most favorable to the appellant,make out a colorable claim of constitutional dimension.no more is exigible to satisfy the first part of the tripartite inquiry.
we can be equally quick in executing the second step of the qualified immunity pavane.as said,cox alleges that hainey arrested him with insufficient information to constitute probable cause.the right to be free from arrest without constitutionally adequate probable cause is clearly established.see wagenmann adams,cir.that satisfies the second part of the tripartite inquiry.
even though the right to be free from an arrest without probable cause is clearly established,a further hurdle remains.in anderson,the supreme court clarified the qualified immunity analysis by explaining that,although it was firmly established that warrantless searches,not subject to any recognized exception,violate the fourth amendment,more was needed before qualified immunity could be deemed irrelevant.at.the court below was required to determine whether the defendant had confronted particular circumstances in which the application of general principles did not yield a certain answer and,if that were the case,to determine whether the defendant had responded reasonably to that idiosyncratic fact pattern.see id.in short,to set aside the buckler of qualified immunity the right the official is alleged to have violated must have been clearly established in a more particularized,and hence more relevant,sense.id.at.
this guidance is pertinent here.in settings that invite balancing tests,it is often the case that the first two prongs of the qualified immunity inquiry do not satisfy anderson requirement of heightened specificity.this is particularly true of alleged false arrests,given the nature of the probable cause determination.no two probable cause equations are exactly alike and,therefore,in most of these situations precedent will take a court only so far.thus,such cases frequently turn on the third prong of the qualified immunity inquiry,which channels the analysis from abstract principles to the specific facts of a given case.see limone,at hatch,at.under that prong,a defendant is entitled to immunity if a reasonable officer could have believed that probable cause existed to arrest.rivera,at.we turn to that requirement.
probable cause exists when the arresting officer,acting upon apparently trustworthy information,reasonably concludes that a crime has been or is about to be committed and that the putative arrestee likely is one of the perpetrators.acosta,at.the test is objective in nature,united states figueroa,cir,and the proof must be such as to give rise to a reasonable likelihood that the putative arrestee committed the suspected crime,valente wallace,cir.
qualified immunity,however,requires a somewhat lesser showing.for that purpose,the operative inquiry is not whether the defendant actions actually abridged some constitutional right,see quintero de quintero,cir,but,rather,whether those actions were obviously inconsistent with that right,see zapata,cir.thus,in the case of a warrantless arrest,if the presence of probable cause is arguable or subject to legitimate question,qualified immunity will attach.see ricci urso,cir.
this is as it should be after all,the reasonableness standards underlying the probable cause and qualified immunity inquiries are not coterminous.iacobucci boulter,cir.the qualified immunity doctrine is designed to afford officials an added measure of protection against civil liability.to achieve that goal,the doctrine eschews a line that separates the constitutional from the unconstitutional and instead draws a line that separates unconstitutional but objectively reasonable acts from obviously unconstitutional acts.see zapata,at.when properly drawn,that line provides ample protection to all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.malley briggs,d.it follows that this suit may go forward only if the unlawfulness of the arrest would have been apparent to an objectively reasonable officer standing in hainey shoes.see anderson,at.limone,at.
we now consider what hainey knew and when he knew it.the point of our inquiry is to determine whether,at the time of the arrest,an objectively reasonable officer could have concluded that the salmagundi of facts added up to probable cause.
hainey had reason to believe,from joseph cox comments,that the appellant was likely involved in furnishing marijuana to his son and possibly to others.the discovery of the scale in the family kitchen tended both to corroborate the teenager remarks and to confirm hainey understanding.the trooper knew that the roxicodone tablets found during the search had been prescribed for the appellant and were,by his own admission,in his nearly exclusive control.but hainey also had reason to doubt the appellant claim that he was scrupulous in guarding the pills after all,the search disclosed two roxicodone bottles one empty and one full in the kitchen and two loose tablets in joseph cox bedroom.hainey knowledge that joseph cox had obtained and sold four other roxicodone tablets to the informant cut in the same direction.
given joseph indication that his father was willing to supply marijuana to minors,the presence of roxicodone and drug paraphernalia the scale in plain view in the kitchen of the appellant home,and joseph actual possession of roxicodone,it was objectively reasonable for hainey to infer that the appellant had furnished those pills to his minor son though hainey judgment call may walk a thin line between probable cause and mere suspicion,it can not be shrugged off as plainly incompetent.
to cinch matters,hainey took the precaution of reviewing the known facts with the local prosecutor.this consultation,and the assistant district attorney agreement with hainey preliminary assessment that probable cause existed,buttress the conclusion that hainey actions were objectively reasonable.although the existence vel non of probable cause is regard that question as very close,but see no need to decide it simply can not be said,on this record,that probable cause clearly was lacking at the time of the arrest.see topp wolkowski,cir.qualified immunity therefore attaches.
the appellant resists this conclusion on four grounds.we find none of them persuasive.
the appellant first line of attack is that the search yielded no evidence that he had furnished roxicodone to his minor son.this ignores the fact that police officers are allowed to draw on their own experience and specialized training to make in
