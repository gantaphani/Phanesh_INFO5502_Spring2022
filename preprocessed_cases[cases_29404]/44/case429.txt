this case arises out of the death in prison of orlando ocasio alsina ocasio and the subsequent suit of his mother and heir,maría alsina ortiz alsina,against various puerto rico prison officials.
on november,an inmate at the bayamón prison in puerto injured by a blow to the head in a prison riot.he received medical attention at a regional hospital but was left with head pain,convulsions,and one side of his body paralyzed.ct scans showed no brain damage and ocasio was returned to his cell at bayamón on november.it is his treatment,or the lack of it,during the next six weeks that is the present subject of this litigation.
drawing permissible inferences in favor of alsina,it appears likely that during this period ocasio was in considerable pain,was seriously disabled,cried and screamed in pain and,half paralyzed,could not get about.there is some evidence that emilio castillo,then a prison guard lieutenant in contact with ocasio,was aware of his plight but did nothing to secure medical care for him.
within a few weeks after the injury,family members visited ocasio his mother made efforts to secure a wheelchair and further medical care for him,and made pleas to the prison staff on ocasio behalf.a wheelchair was provided on december,two days after a request was made.on december,a local court granted a motion brought by ocasio,requiring that he be provided with further medical evaluation and treatment.
on january,ocasio was transferred to the infirmary at the río piedras prison hospital,where he was diagnosed with aids and toxoplasmosis a parasitic infection.medical records indicate that there was a threat by this time that his brain function would be impaired by lack of oxygen due to inflammation.starting the next day,ocasio was treated for approximately two weeks at an outside medical center,and he continued to take medication after his return to bayamón in march he was again admitted for medical care,sometimes receiving treatment in hospital facilities and sometimes in prison facilities under supervision.
ocasio died on may,an autopsy found his cause of death to have been brain inflammation associated with aids.on august,his mother brought suit in federal court asserting claims under and under state law against a number of defendants,charging both prison officials and medical personnel with a variety of derelictions.over the next months there was extensive discovery and eventually motions for summary judgment by the defendants.
ultimately the magistrate judge recommended that the motions be granted,relying in part on his assessment of the merits and in part on what he found to be alsina failure to comply with a local rule requiring that the party opposing summary judgment file a concise statement of material facts allegedly in dispute.the district judge wrote his own opinion along the same lines,sustaining the recommended disposition and dismissing the federal claims with prejudice and the local law claims without prejudice.this appeal followed.
on appeal alsina has abandoned her federal claims against everyone,medical personnel except for three defendants zoe laboy,who was in december administrator of corrections in puerto rico sixto marrero,then of the bayamón correctional complex and castillo,the prison guard already mentioned.we confine our discussion to these defendants.
as to all three,the central charge was that they were liable under section for violation of the eighth amendment protecting against cruel and unusual punishment by exhibiting deliberate indifference to ocasio patent and severe medical needs.see estelle gamble,d.however,alsina theories as to just how the defendants were individually liable were multiple and presented with less than perfect clarity.
in some renditions,alsina seemingly claimed that the three defendants were responsible for providing medical care to ocasio and failed in this duty.the district court rejected any such theory it said that under the governing division of responsibilities,based in part on a federal consent decree the actual furnishing of prison health care in bayamón was the duty of the commonwealth department of the administration of corrections with which all three defendants were alone associated.alsina does not challenge this ruling on appeal.
instead,she argues that at least the prison authorities have a duty to notify the health professionals if and when prisoners need medical attention.estelle,at.miranda munoz,cir.the defendants do not deny such a responsibility instead,they say that alsina failed to file a compliant motion of contested facts and that,on the resulting record,the three defendants lacked knowledge sufficient to trigger a responsibility to summon medical help any earlier than it was provided.
a local rule of the district court then rule,now revised and renumbered as rule requires that a party seeking summary judgment supply a list of the allegedly uncontested facts on which it relies together with record citations and that the opposing papers include a separate,short,and concise statement of the material facts again with specific record references that the opponent asserts require a trial.this rule aims to make the parties organize the evidence rather than leaving the burden upon the district judge.
where the party opposing summary judgment fails to comply,the rule permits the district court to treat the moving party statement of facts as uncontested,cir,and we have regularly upheld its enforcement.see,morales orssleff eftf,cir.however,whether the rule has been violated is a different question,easily answered where the opponent fails to file any statement or omits all record citations but less so where the deficiency is of a different kind.
in this instance,laboy and marrero offered paragraphs of allegedly uncontested facts in four pages alsina corresponding statements as to just these two defendants spanned pages and being irrelevant,repetitive or unsupported by record citation.there is no mechanical rule rendering a long statement insufficiently short and concise after all,a case could have a great many material contested facts.and in this instance alsina was making a number of quite different claims against different defendants based on different theories.
nevertheless,having reviewed the opposing statements filed by alsina,we do not think the statements even arguably comply with the spirit or letter of the rule.burying the district court in a mass of supposedly material contested facts,many irrelevant and many unsupported by citations,creates the very morass from which the rule aims to protect the district judge.in this case,alsina simply dumped an undigested record on the judge,expecting him to do counsel job.
that fact alone is not necessarily decisive of the outcome in this case.it mainly means that the district judge can accept the moving party allegedly uncontested facts as true,but whether or not this justifies summary judgment for the moving party depends upon the legal and factual configuration that results.see,united parcel,wl,at cir.in the case of castillo,summary judgment was not appropriate but as to laboy and marrero,we think summary judgment was properly granted.we begin with the claims against the latter two defendants.
in this instance,the complaint charged that the two supervising officials laboy and marrero knew or should have known that ocasio was getting inadequate care and as to marrero it alleged that he must have known because family complaints about ocasio condition were made to the prison staff.however,any claim that either of them knew is defeated by defendants explicit assertions in their statement of uncontested facts that they did not know about ocasio suffering.as it happens,there is no direct evidence to show that they did.
specifically,no evidence suggests that the top of the any knowledge of ocasio situation that could be the premise for a claim of deliberate indifference.alsina points us to some evidence that the family complained to marrero staff,which depending upon the circumstances might or might not permit an inference of knowledge.but,under the rule,marrero flat denial of notice is conclusive.as to the should have known clai
