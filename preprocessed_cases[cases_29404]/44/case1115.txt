kelley mala sued crown bay marina after his boat exploded.the district court conducted a bench trial during which mala represented himself and after which the court rejected his negligence claims.mala now contends that the court should have provided him with additional assistance because of his status as a pro se litigant.he also contends that the court wrongfully denied his request for a jury trial and improperly ruled on a variety of motions.we reject these contentions and we will affirm.
mala is a citizen of the united states virgin islands.on january,he went for a cruise in his powerboat near thomas,virgin islands.when his boat ran low on gas,he entered crown bay marina to refuel.mala tied the boat to one of crown bay eight fueling stations and began filling his tank with an automatic gas pump.before walking to the cash register to buy oil,mala asked a crown bay attendant to watch his boat.
by the time mala returned,the boat tank was overflowing and fuel was spilling into the boat and into the water.the attendant manually shut off the pump and acknowledged that the pump had been malfunctioning in recent days.mala began cleaning up the fuel,and at some point,the attendant provided soap and water.mala eventually departed the marina,but as he did so,the engine caught fire and exploded.mala was thrown into the water and was severely burned.his boat was unsalvageable.
more than a year later,mala sued crown bay in the district court of the virgin islands mala pro se complaint asserted two claims first,that crown bay negligently trained and supervised its attendant,and second,that crown bay negligently maintained its gas pump.the complaint also alleged that the district court had admiralty and diversity jurisdiction over the case,and it requested a jury trial.at the time mala filed the complaint,he was imprisoned in puerto rico.although the record is silent on the reason for his imprisonment,it is fair to say that he is a seasoned litigant in fact,he has filed at least twenty other pro se lawsuits see appellee br.at.
mala original complaint named crown bay marina as the sole defendant.but mala soon amended his complaint by adding other defendants including crown bay dock attendant,chubb group insurance company,crown bay attorney,and marine management services inc,a registered corporation entity duly licensed to conduct business in the state of florida,crown bay marina inc,a corporate entity duly licensed to conduct business in thomas virgin islands of the unites states.ja.the district court allowed mala to amend his complaint a second time by adding his wife as a plaintiff though the court dismissed her claim shortly thereafter.mala later attempted to amend his complaint a third time by adding texaco as a defendant.the district court rejected this attempt for failing to comply with federal rule of civil procedure a requiring the other side consent or the court leave 
as the trial approached,two significant incidents took place.first,the district court decided on its own to identify the parties to the case.it concluded that the only parties were mala and marine services management crown bay marina,ja.it thereby dismissed all other defendants that mala had named in his various pleadings.
next,crown bay filed a motion to strike mala jury demand.crown bay argued that plaintiffs generally do not have a right in admiralty when the court also has diversity jurisdiction.and crown bay asserted that the parties were not diverse in this case,which the court itself had acknowledged in a previous order.in response to this motion,the district court ruled that both mala and crown bay were citizens of the virgin islands.the court therefore struck mala jury demand,but nevertheless opted to empanel an advisory jury.
the trial began at the end of nearly four and a half years after mala filed his complaint.the delay is partly attributable to the district court decision to postpone the trial until after mala release from prison.at the close of mala,crown bay renewed a previous motion for summary judgment.the court granted the motion on the claim but allowed the claim to go forward.at the end of the trial,the advisory jury returned a verdict of for mala for pain and suffering and in compensatory damages.it concluded that mala was percent at fault and that crown bay was percent at fault.the district court ultimately rejected the verdict and entered judgment for crown bay on both claims.
after his loss at trial,mala filed a flurry of motions,asking the court to vacate its judgment and hold a new trial.these motions contained numerous overlapping objections.a magistrate judge prepared three reports and recommendations that summarized mala claims and urged the district court to reject all of them.judge sanchez adopted these recommendations and explained his reasoning in an opinion.
this appeal followed.mala argues that the district court made three reversible errors.first,the court failed to accommodate mala as a pro se litigant.second,it improperly denied his request for a jury trial.third,it erroneously adopted the magistrate recommendations.we consider and reject these arguments in turn 
mala first argues that the district court did not give appropriate consideration to his status as a pro se litigant.specifically,he claims that the district court should have provided him with a pro se manual a manual that is available to pro se litigants in other districts in the third circuit and throughout the country.we conclude that pro se litigants do not have a right to general legal advice from judges,so the district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to provide a manual.
according to mala,t here is comparatively little case law regarding the responsibility of courts to provide information and assistance to the pro se party.appellant br.at.a more accurate statement is that there is no case law requiring courts to provide general legal advice to pro se parties.in a long line of cases,the supreme court has repeatedly concluded that courts are under no such obligation.see,mckaskle wiggins,d a defendant does not have a constitutional right to receive personal instruction from the trial judge on courtroom procedure.nor does the constitution require judges to take over chores for a pro se defendant that would normally be attended to by trained counsel as a matter of course.mcneil united states,d faretta california,d.
the supreme court revisited this line of cases nearly a decade ago.in pliler ford,d,the court rejected the idea that district courts must provide a specific warning to pro se litigants in certain habeas cases.it concluded that d istrict judges have no obligation to act as counsel or paralegal to pro se litigants.id.at.after all,a trial judge is under no duty to provide personal instruction on courtroom procedure or to perform any legal chores for the defendant that counsel would normally carry out.id.quoting martinez court of appeal of,fourth appellate,d quotation marks omitted.because of this general rule,courts need not,for example,inform pro se litigants of an impending statute of limitation.see outler united states,cir n o case has ever held that a pro se litigant should be given actual notice of a statute of limitations.
the general rule,then,is that courts need not provide substantive legal advice to pro se litigants.aside from the two exceptions discussed below,federal courts treat pro se litigants the same as any other litigant.this rule makes sense.judges must be impartial,and they put their impartiality at risk or at least might appear to become partial to one side when they provide trial assistance to a party.see pliler,at requiring district courts to advise a pro se litigant would undermine district judges role as impartial decisionmakers.jacobsen filler,cir see also julie bradlow,comment,procedural due process rights of pro se civil litigants,chi,e xtending too much procedural leniency to a pro se litigant risks undermining the impartial role of the judge in the adversary system.moreover,this rule eliminates the risk that judges will provide bad advice.see pliler,at noting that warnings and other legal advice run the risk of being misleading themselves see also robert bacharach lyn entzeroth,judicial advocacy in pro se litigation a return to neutrality,g iving legal advice is prohibited by multiple canons of judicial conduct.
to be sure,some cases have given greater leeway to pro se litigants.these cases fit into two narrow exceptions.first,we tend to be flexible when applying procedural rules to pro se litigants,especially when interpreting their pleadings.see,higgs att y,cir the obligation to liberally construe a pro se litigant pleadings is.this means that we are willing to apply the relevant legal principle even when the complaint has failed to name it.dluhos strasberg,cir.and at least on one occasion,we have refused to apply the doctrine of appellate waiver when dealing with a pro se litigant.tabron grace,cir.this tradition of leniency descends from the supreme court decision in haines kerner,d.in haines,the court instructed judges to hold pro se complaints to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.id.at see erickson pardus,d.
we are especially likely to be flexible when dealing with imprisoned pro se litigants.such litigants often lack the resources and freedom necessary to comply with the technical rules of modern litigation.see moore florida,cir pro se prison inmates,with limited access to legal materials,occupy a position significantly different from that occupied by litigants represented by counsel.the supreme court has insisted that the pleadings prepared by prisoners who do not have access to counsel be liberally construed and has held that some procedural rules must give way because of the unique circumstance of incarceration.mcneil united states,d citations omitted.accordingly,the supreme court has concluded that pro se prisoners successfully file a notice of appeal in habeas cases when they deliver the filings to prison authorities not when the court receives the filings,as is generally true.houston lack,d such prisoners can not take the steps other litigants can take to monitor the processing of their notices of appeal and to ensure that the court clerk receives and stamps their notices of appeal before the day deadline.
yet there are limits to our procedural flexibility.for example,pro se litigants still must allege sufficient facts in their complaints to support a claim.see riddle mondragon,cir.and they still must serve process on the correct defendants.see franklin murphy,cir.at the end of the day,they can not flout procedural rules they must abide by the same rules that apply to all other litigants.see mcneil,at w e have never suggested that procedural rules in ordinary civil litigation should be interpreted so as to excuse mistakes by those who proceed without counsel.kay bemis,cir.
the second exception to our general rule of evenhandedness is likewise narrow.we have held that district courts must provide notice to pro se prisoners when converting a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.see renchenski williams,cir.in particular,courts must tell pro se prisoners about the effects of not filing any opposing affidavits.see also somerville hall,cir neal kelly,klingele eikenberry,cir concluding that the rule applies only to pro se prisoners.but see williams browman,cir holding that such notice is unnecessary martin harrison cnty.jail,cir same.
similarly,the supreme court has required district courts to provide notice to pro se litigants in habeas cases before converting any motion into a motion to vacate under.see castro united states,d.the underlying principle is simple when a court acts on its own in a way that significantly alters a pro se litigant rights for example,by converting one type of motion into a different type of motion the court should inform the pro se party of the legal consequences.but as the supreme court made clear only a few months after castro,notice is the exception.nonassistance is the rule.see pliler,at.
that brings us back to mala claim.mala argues that the district court should have provided him with a pro se manual.various district courts have created manuals to help pro se litigants navigate the currents of modern litigation.see,district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,clerk office procedural handbook,http.pdf district court for the western district of pennsylvania,pro se package a simple guide to filing a civil action,http district court for the district of new jersey,procedural guide for pro se litigants.these manuals are generally available online and in the clerk office.they explain how to file a complaint,serve process,conduct discovery,and so forth.in addition,organizations have supplemented these manuals by publishing their own guides for pro se litigants.see,columbia human rights law review,a jailhouse lawyer manual ed.toc.
these manuals can be a valuable resource for pro se litigants.they may help litigants assert and defend their rights when no lawyer is available.and they can reduce the administrative burden on court officials who must grapple with inscrutable pro se filings.because these manuals do not provide advice and because they are available to all litigants not just to pro se litigants they do not impair judicial impartiality.see nina vanwormer,note,help at your fingertips a twenty first century response to the pro se phenomenon,vand,by providing pro se litigants with easy,understandable,and reliable access to both procedural and substantive law,court systems can uphold their mandate to impartially administer justice to all,while at the same time increasing the efficiency with which they can manage their dockets.without a doubt,these manuals are informative,and inexperienced litigants would do well to seek them out.
that said,nothing requires district courts to provide such manuals to pro se litigants.see pliler,at district judges have no obligation to act as counsel or paralegal to pro se litigants.to put it another way,pro se litigants do not have a right constitutional,statutory,or otherwise to receive legal manuals from judges.see mckaskle,at t he constitution does not require judges to take over chores for a pro se defendant that would normally be attended to by trained counsel as a matter of course.and mala has less reason to complain than the neophyte pro se litigant,having filed more than twenty suits in the past.see appellee br.at.his experiences have made him well acquainted with the courts.see davidson flynn,cir refusing to be flexible when interpreting a complaint because the plaintiff was an extremely litigious inmate who was quite familiar with the legal system and with pleading requirements cusamano sobek,d.the district court failure to provide mala with a pro se litigation manual was not an abuse of discretion 
mala also suggests that the district court abused its discretion by not considering his status as a prisoner during the early stages of litigation.his problem,however,is that he has not identified anything in particular that the court should have done differently.in fact,the court was solicitous of mala needs as an incarcerated litigant delaying the trial until his release from prison and allowing him to amend the complaint at least once despite his noncompliance with rule a.contrary to mala suggestion,the court accommodated his status as a prisoner.
mala next argues that the district court improperly refused to conduct a jury trial.this claim ultimately depends on whether the district court had diversity jurisdiction.the court concluded that it had only admiralty jurisdiction,and mala urges us to conclude otherwise.we generally exercise plenary review over jurisdictional questions,but factual findings that underline a court determination of diversity jurisdiction are subject to the clearly erroneous rule.frett smith vanterpool,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.here,the district court found that both mala and crown bay were citizens of the virgin islands.these findings were not clearly erroneous,and so we conclude that mala did not have a right.
