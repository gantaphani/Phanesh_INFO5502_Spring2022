opinion of the court 
rule of the federal rules of civil procedure is intended to promote the amicable resolution of cases.although it usually serves its intended purpose,rule presents a trap for the unwary.this trap manifests itself most frequently when a defendant erroneously believes that an accepted rule offer of judgment finally resolves a civil action,only to be assessed substantial attorney fees and costs thereafter by the court.
in this appeal,plaintiff roberto lima argues that the rule offer of judgment he accepted did not include attorney fees and costs.as in many cases,the question is significant because counsel for lima seek fees well in excess of the value of his settled claims.
the historical facts of this case are incidental to the issue presented on appeal,so we summarize them only briefly.in september,a photographer working for lima newspaper,brazilian voice,discovered and photographed a decomposed body covered by debris in the ironbound section of newark,new jersey.lima reported the incident to police and showed them the crime scene.at the crime scene,two police officers allegedly intimidated lima and the photographer,seized the camera,and ordered lima not to publish any photographs of the scene.at the precinct office,lima gave police a statement but refused to turn over the original photographs though he offered to make copies for them.lima further alleged that he was handcuffed and released from custody only after he agreed to turn over all copies of the photographs.the police then followed him to his office where they seized cds containing digital copies of the pictures.
in january,lima filed suit in new jersey district court against the newark police department and certain police officers.he amended his complaint once to add an additional officer,and then again,in january,adding police director garry mccarthy,another officer,and a monell claim against the city of newark collectively,newark.
lima second amended complaint stated seven causes of action arising under both federal and state law and concluded with a prayer for relief stating 
wherefore,plaintiff respectfully requests judgment against the defendants as follows 
a compensatory and consequential damages in an amount to be determined at trial 
b punitive damages on all claims allowed by law,in an amount to be determined at trial 
c attorney fees and costs associated with this action 
d any further relief as this court deems just and proper and any other relief as allowed by law.
before discovery commenced,and before filing his second amended complaint,lima offered to settle the case for,and an admission of the event an apology and consent to training.after some discovery,the filing of the second amended complaint,further settlement negotiations,and a failed attempt at mediation during which lima demand went as high as and newark offer went as high as newark made a rule offer of judgment offer.the offer was attached to a november,email stating attached is an offer of judgment from the city of newark and garry mccarthy.the offer is,however,as to all defendants and all claims.the city makes this offer with the intention and expectation that,if accepted,this litigation will be resolved in its entirety.the offer itself stated 
pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,defendants city of newark and improperly pled newark police department,and garry mccarthy,hereby offers sic to allow judgment to be entered against these defendants in this action in the amount of,including all of plaintiff claims for relief against all defendants,including those not represented by this counsel.this offer of judgment is made for the purposes specified in federal rule of civil procedure,and is not to be construed as either an admission that any of the defendants are liable in this action,or that the plaintiff has suffered any damage.this offer of judgment shall not be filed with the court unless a accepted or b in a proceeding to determine costs which includes counsel fees that could be awarded pursuant to statute.
lima timely accepted the offer and simultaneously filed a request for judgment seeking judgment against defendants in the amount of,with costs to be taxed by the court upon application by plaintiff pursuant to rule d of the federal rules of civil procedure and.upon receiving lima acceptance of the offer,newark promptly wrote to the magistrate judge assigned to the case,stating 
just to be clear,the defendants offer of judgment was for all of plaintiff claims against all defendants.there should be no confusion about any remaining claims,whether for costs or anything else no such claims remain.but if there is any confusion,let me clarify that the defendants offer of judgment was not designed to expose the citizens of the city of newark to any further expense other than the offered.
if the plaintiff intends to seek costs and attorneys fees,the defendants seek immediate relief and clarification from your honor.
lima counsel responded the next day,countering newark by asserting the offer and plaintiffs acceptance are binding,so that the only remaining question for resolution is the amount of costs and fees to which plaintiff is entitled.
after receiving the aforementioned correspondence,the magistrate judge ordered counsel to meet and confer,but they were unable to come to an agreement.because the parties could not resolve the dispute over fees without judicial intervention,the district court ordered briefing on the matter and,on february,entered an order granting lima request for judgment in the amount of and denying his request to file an application for attorneys fees because the offer of judgment included attorneys fees.lima newark police dep t,slip op,lima.
in support of its decision,the district court reasoned that newark was not silent as to costs,but rather used three different phrases to state that the offer was a lump sum,single offer to cover all claims in the case and end the litigation while specifically disclaiming any liability.id.at.the three phrases the district court found significant were

this is not to be construed as either an admission that any of the defendants are liable in this action,or that the plaintiff has suffered any damage,in the offer of judgment,which is a statement that disclaims plaintiff as a prevailing party under buckhannon principles 
i f accepted,this litigation will be resolved in its entirety,in the email conveying the offer,which further confirms that newark offer precludes additional litigation regarding whether plaintiff is a prevailing party to earn an attorney fee award
