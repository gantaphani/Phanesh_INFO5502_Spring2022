this is a dispute between an extremely dissatisfied shipper and a rail carrier,springfield terminal railway.the shipper,rymes heating oils,says it was stymied in its efforts to get satisfactory rail service from springfield by springfield misrepresentations to it that springfield had exclusive trackage rights to the side track connecting to rymes propane distribution center.rymes took the exclusive rights dispute to the surface transportation board stb in september and,over springfield objection,obtained an order in july declaring that springfield did not have such exclusive trackage rights.rymes then sued in federal court,invoking a provision of the interstate commerce commission termination act iccta,b,and saying,based on the administrative order,that it was entitled to damages flowing from the misrepresentations.in the complex world of federal regulation of railroads,we affirm the dismissal of rymes damages claim,which was never presented to the stb.
the parties agreed before the district court to treat this as a case stated.where facts are in dispute,we describe the dispute.those disputes,however,are immaterial,given the grounds for our decision.
the story starts with a series of orders by the interstate commerce commission icc,now known as the surface transportation board stb,in the late and early.springfield is the successor in interest of the boston maine corporation.at one time owned the portion of the connecticut river line involved in this case.in august,the icc ordered to convey the connecticut river line to the national railroad passenger corporation amtrak under d.passenger of.interests in.river line in,hereinafter amtrak i.in a related petition,the icc then allowed amtrak to turn around and sell the line to central vermont railway.id.at.the icc required,however,that be paid just compensation and allowed to retain some trackage rights on the line after these transactions took place.id.at.
and central vermont were to negotiate the precise scope of the trackage rights to be retained by,but negotiations failed and the icc stepped in to resolve the dispute.the icc imposed a trackage rights order,passenger of.interests in.river line in,hereinafter amtrak ii,that was still in effect at the time of the events in this suit.under amtrak ii,springfield,as successor,has the exclusive right to serve all existing shippers and shippers facilities that were located on the line as of september,including any and all new shippers that locate at such existing facilities after that date,provided that springfield makes available a minimum three day per week service.id.at.springfield can compete with new england central railroad necr,central vermont successor,to provide rail service to remaining shippers not covered by the exclusive right.that exclusive right is at the heart of rymes case.
rymes sells propane to customers in central and southern new hampshire.between and,rymes built a propane distribution center in claremont,new hampshire.rymes also laid a new stretch of railroad track that connected the distribution center to an existing side track,which in turn connected to the connecticut river line.
in november,after construction of the distribution center was completed,springfield began to provide rail service to the center.in his affidavit,james rymes,the owner of rymes heating oils,said that his company was harmed by incessant delays in springfield service and by springfield constant failures to make deliveries and pick up empty cars after delivery.as a result,rymes said that his company had to purchase more expensive propane imported by other means,arrange for deliveries by road,buy a fleet of trucks,build an expanded storage facility,and restructure its bank financing to pay for the new storage facility.
rymes said that he knew that springfield had competitors on the rail line,namely necr,but that his company did not switch carriers because springfield repeatedly and inaccurately represented to him that it had the exclusive right to provide service to the claremont distribution center springfield,however,denies making any such representations.by affidavit,kenneth berg,springfield director of marketing,stated that springfield and rymes never actually discussed whether springfield had the exclusive right to serve rymes.springfield of marketing,joseph crawford,stated by affidavit that both springfield and rymes simply believed that springfield had the exclusive right to serve the claremont distribution center.according to crawford,springfield thought that rymes was a new shipper located at an existing facilit y under amtrak ii because the distribution center was connected to the connecticut river line through a side track built prior to september.whether or not springfield made the representations complained of is immaterial to the outcome here.
in september,rymes petitioned the stb,seeking a declaration that,under amtrak ii,it was entitled to receive competitive service at its claremont distribution center from necr as well as from springfield.rymes did not seek any damages in its petition.the stb instituted a declaratory order proceeding pursuant to e and of the iccta.springfield opposed the petition,arguing that rymes did not have standing to seek relief because rymes was not a party to amtrak ii,that the stb did not have jurisdiction to grant relief,and on the merits,that springfield had an exclusive right to serve the claremont distribution center because rymes was a new shipper located at an existing facility.on july,the stb issued an order declaring that rymes had standing to seek relief under amtrak ii and that the stb had jurisdiction to interpret amtrak ii and to grant any appropriate relief.rymes heating for declaratory order,stb finance docket july,hereinafter rymes order.proceeding to the merits,the stb then held that rymes is neither an existing shipper nor a new shipper located at an existing facility within the meaning of amtrak ii.id.the net effect of the order was that springfield did not have the exclusive right that it thought it had and which,perhaps,it had represented it had.the stb reasoned that even though rymes distribution center was connected to the rail line through an existing side track,the center was located at a new facility namely,the new side track laid by rymes.id.the stb therefore entered a declaratory order that rymes is entitled to obtain competitive service from necr.id.that was the full extent of the relief granted.
rymes then decided to pursue a damages action,taking the position that it had been hoodwinked by springfield into believing that springfield had the exclusive right to serve the claremont distribution center.rymes argues that if it had not been hoodwinked,it would have changed sooner to a different carrier,and,if it had changed sooner,it would not have suffered the damages that it did.
on december,rymes sued springfield in federal district court,seeking damages.count one of the complaint alleged that springfield had wrongfully excluded competition in rail service to the claremont distribution center from to in violation of b of the iccta.count two,which was eventually dismissed without prejudice and is of no relevance to this appeal,alleged that springfield had failed to provide the timely and reasonable service to rymes required by amtrak ii and had thus violated and of the iccta.rymes sought damages including but not limited to a the costs of constructing and maintaining expanded storage facilities,b the cost of acquiring additional trucks to obtain and move the product,c additional acquisition costs of propane on the spot market,and d additional financing costs due to the impact these expenditures had on rymes credit with its major lender,fleet bank.
on january,springfield moved to dismiss.springfield argued that rymes had no cause of action for count one under b because that statute provides a private right of action only for violations of the interstate commerce commission termination act iccta.amtrak ii,springfield argued,was issued under the rail passenger service act rpsa,d current version at c,under which no private right of action is available.moreover,springfield contended that even if amtrak ii had been issued under the iccta b provides a private right of action only for violations of the iccta itself,not for violations of administrative orders issued pursuant to the iccta.springfield then argued that the carmack amendment,a,which governs claims for loss or damage of goods in shipping,provided the exclusive remedy for the type of injuries claimed by rymes in both count one and count two.treating both counts as carmack amendment claims,springfield argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and that even if there were jurisdiction,the claims were.in the alternative,if the court did not agree that the action was founded entirely on the carmack amendment,springfield moved to refer the case to the stb under the primary jurisdiction doctrine for,inter alia,a determination whether springfield could be held liable for damages based on the rymes order.
the district court held a hearing on the motion to dismiss on february,at which the parties agreed that the dispute over count one involved mostly legal issues and that,at most,very limited factual development was necessary.the court denied the motion to dismiss.with the agreement of the parties,the court adopted an accelerated schedule for the filing of for summary judgment on count one,noting that discovery would not be necessary,and deferred consideration of count two until after those motions were resolved.
less than a month later,on march,rymes and springfield filed cross motions for summary judgment on count one springfield asserted substantially the same arguments as in its motion to dismiss.at the april hearing on the motions,rymes conceded that there are no genuine issues of material fact on the liability as to count one,and the parties agreed to treat the issue of liability under count one as a case stated.
on april,the court raised sua sponte the question whether springfield owed any legal duty at all to rymes as to count one.the court apparently viewed the case as turning on rights arising under state contract and law,despite the heavy federal regulation of this area.on may,after additional briefing by both sides on the issue,the court granted summary judgment to springfield on count one,concluding that rymes had no cause of action after the court granted summary judgment to springfield on count one,rymes voluntarily dismissed count two without prejudice and requested entry of a final order to allow an immediate appeal of the court ruling on count one.
the court entered a final order,and rymes appealed.springfield urges alternative grounds for affirmance namely,that rymes had no claim under b for the reasons advanced in springfield motion to dismiss and that,to the extent rymes claim is based on state law,it is preempted by the carmack amendment and is under that amendment.
at oral argument,we asked the parties whether the carmack amendment provides the exclusive remedy under count one.rymes responded,inter alia,that the carmack amendment would not apply to its claim for damages based on the difference in the rates charged by springfield and by necr we ordered supplemental briefing on this issue and on whether a rate differential claim should be adjudicated by the stb rather than by a federal court.in the supplemental briefing,rymes stressed that it was not bringing a carmack amendment claim at all in count one.
in its complaint and district court filings,rymes pled count one as a claim under b.although springfield and the district court have spent much time discussing whether rymes might have a viable state law claim for breach of contract and whether that claim would be preempted by the carmack amendment,rymes did not assert any such claim in the district court proceedings,so we do not address it.similarly,because rymes insisted in its district court filings and on appeal that it is not asserting a carmack amendment claim,we do not address any possible carmack amendment claim by rymes or the possible interaction between the carmack amendment and b.
count one was brought under b,which states that a rail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the surface transportation board is liable for damages sustained by a person as a result of an act or omission of that carrier in violation of the rail portion of the iccta.section c then provides a private right of action for such liability a person may bring a civil action under subsection b of this section to enforce liability against a rail carrier.c.here,rymes makes no claim that the statute itself independently imposed a duty that was violated.rymes claim in count one depends instead on the language of amtrak ii,as further interpreted in the rymes order.rymes argues that springfield inaccurate assertion of monopoly rights violated amtrak ii and that this violation of amtrak ii was tantamount to a violation of the iccta itself.
the first issue raised by rymes position is whether amtrak ii was issued pursuant to the iccta or pursuant to the rail passenger service act.if amtrak ii was issued pursuant to the rpsa,rymes would clearly have no cause of action under it no private right of action is available for violations of the rpsa,passenger ass of passengers,d,and b would not apply because there would be no violation of the iccta.
it is not clear,however,whether the trackage rights order in amtrak ii was issued pursuant to the rpsa or the iccta.amtrak ii does not expressly state the statute under which it was issued,but several clues suggest that amtrak ii may,in fact,have been decided under the iccta.
first,the rpsa does not authorize the icc to set trackage rights between private railroads such as and central vermont only the iccta authorizes such an order springfield argues that amtrak ii does not set trackage rights between ordinary private railroads,but rather between amtrak and,and that the rpsa does authorize the icc to set trackage rights between a private railroad and amtrak when amtrak is buying rail property.see c.springfield argues that amtrak ii sets rights between and amtrak,with central vermont merely standing in amtrak shoes as the eventual owner of the rail line.the weakness of this argument is that amtrak ii extends trackage rights to on sections of the connecticut river line that central vermont already owned before its transaction with amtrak.see amtrak ii,at.the icc had authority to set those rights only under the iccta,not the rpsa.
second,the icc imposed labor protective conditions on central vermont purchase of the rail line.the iccta requires the icc to consider labor interests,see b,but the rpsa does not,see c.
third,the rymes order,which explicates amtrak ii,recites that the declaratory order proceeding was instituted,inter alia,under,which enumerates the powers of the board under the iccta.
in light of those clues,we assume arguendo,in rymes favor,that amtrak ii was issued under the iccta,and we move to the next step in the analysis whether and when b provides a cause of action for damages based on the violation of an stb or icc order.
most commonly,liability under b and its predecessor statute,is invoked in cases in which a shipper complains that rates charged by the railroads are unjust and unreasonable and seeks reimbursement reparations of unlawful transportation charges.see,interstate commerce comm atlantic coast line,d.by contrast,where the claim for damages is for actual loss or injury to the property caused by the carrier,it is usually brought under the carmack amendment to the iccta.see,norfolk peninsula produce exch.of.carmack amendment covers all damages resulting from any failure to discharge a carrier duty with respect to any part of the transportation to the agreed destination rini united van lines,cir.
leaving issues of primary jurisdiction aside,b clearly provides a damages action for a direct statutory violation of the iccta itself,pejepscot indus.park,me.cent,cir claim that unlawful refusal to provide rail service violates a of the iccta,but rymes has not claimed any such violation in count one.
section b also clearly provides a cause of action to enforce an stb order awarding damages.this is because d lays out a series of procedural
