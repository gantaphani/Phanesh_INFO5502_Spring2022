selestino calbillo calbillo appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of allied polygraph services,and polysoft products,collectively allied on calbillo negligence and employee polygraph protection act of eppa,et,claims.for the following reasons,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
calbillo was employed by cavender oldsmobile,cavender as a parts counter technician in january.in april,rohda smid smid,the parts manager,began noticing that quantities of freon were missing.edward hollas hollas,the general manager,confronted several employees,including calbillo,about the missing freon.in response to hollas questioning,calbillo claimed that he did not know who was stealing the freon.
in the fall of,the decision was made by cavender management to hire donald trease trease,a licensed private investigator and polygraph examiner,who is the principal operator of allied.when hollas asked trease what could be done about the missing freon,trease recommended that hollas interview the employees of the parts department.trease complied with hollas request that trease interview the employees on his behalf instead.trease came to the dealership,toured the parts department,talked to management,and interviewed all of the employees in the parts department.during calbillo interview,he explained that he did not have a key to the cabinet where the freon was stored.according to calbillo,trease told him that the other employees had agreed to take polygraph examinations and trease asked whether he was willing to take the test as well.calbillo agreed to take a polygraph examination however,immediately after the interview,some of calbillo told him that they refused to take a polygraph examination.
trease gave a verbal report to hollas regarding the information that he gathered from the employees interviewed,which included other employees suspicions that calbillo stole the freon.trease also provided hollas with a standard package about polygraph testing,which included information on the eppa,rules and regulations pertaining to polygraph examination,and termination of employees.at hollas request,trease spoke with cavender attorneys and discussed the eppa,general procedures involved in a polygraph examination,and information acquired during the employee interviews.following the employee interviews,hollas requested that trease administer a polygraph examination to calbillo.
hollas then demanded that calbillo take a polygraph examination to prove that he was innocent of the theft as a condition of continued employment.hollas explained that as a result of the investigation,calbillo was chosen to take a polygraph examination based upon the way he answered trease questions.hollas then gave calbillo a piece of paper with an appointment time for the polygraph examination,and calbillo signed it as instructed.according to calbillo,hollas also told him not to speak with an attorney or to bring an attorney to the examination.
calbillo took the polygraph examination on october.he was read his rights relating to the polygraph examination prior to taking the examination.the examination consisted of three sets of twelve questions,with about to thirty seconds between the individual questions and a few minutes between the sets of questions.after the first set of questions,trease told calbillo that he had a deception of.at the end of the full examination,trease reported the results to calbillo and gave him a copy of the results.calbillo claims that trease also told him to tell him who took the freon and said that he was hiding something.calbillo again responded that he did not know who took the freon.further,trease reported the test results to hollas.on the morning of october,hollas informed calbillo that he was terminated because he did not pass the polygraph examination.

ii.the employee polygraph protection act 
the district court entered summary judgment in favor of allied on calbillo eppa claims after concluding that allied was not an employer subject to liability under the eppa.calbillo cavender oldsmobile,no,wl,at.the court observed that in order for calbillo to recover under the eppa,allied must qualify as an employer as defined by the eppa.id.at.the court further adopted the view that the determination of whether a polygraph examiner is an employer under the eppa requires consideration of whether the examiner exerted control,as a matter of economic reality,over the employer compliance with the eppa.id.at.after reviewing calbillo allegations and the evidence put forth in support thereof,the court noted that most of the allegations concerned actions taken by trease in his role as a private investigator,not as a polygraph examiner.id.at.placing much emphasis on hollas uncontroverted affidavit concerning trease role,the court concluded that,other than calbillo speculation to the contrary,there was no evidence that trease,acting in his role as investigator or polygraph examiner,exerted control over cavender compliance with the eppa.id.at.the court found it compelling that t he decision to polygraph,who to polygraph,and the decision to terminate were all ultimately made by cavender.id.
calbillo argues that summary judgment on his eppa claim was inappropriate because a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether allied qualified as an employer under the eppa.calbillo appeal thus presents an issue of first impression in this circuit whether and under what circumstances a polygraph examiner is an employer within the meaning of the eppa definition of that term.the eppa makes it illegal for an employer to require or request that an employee take a polygraph examination.employers are also prohibited from discharging any employee who fails or refuses to take a polygraph examination.id.at.congress created a limited exemption that permits an employer to request an employee to submit to a polygraph examination if it is administered in connection with an ongoing investigation involving economic loss or injury to the employer business,such as theft.id.at.the eppa provides for private enforcement by creating a cause of action for employees against an employer who violates the eppa for such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate.id.at c emphasis added.the eppa defines an employer as any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee or prospective employee.id.at.pursuant to the secretary of labor duty to issue such rules and regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the eppa,id.at a,the secretary promulgated the following regulation 
the term employer means any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee or prospective employee.a polygraph examiner either employed for or whose services are otherwise retained for the sole purpose of administering polygraph tests ordinarily would not be deemed an employer with respect to the examinees.
although we have found no circuit court of appeals case law considering whether a polygraph examiner can qualify as an employer under the eppa,the existing district cour
