facts and proceedings below 
on july,morris obtained a credit report through truecredit internet website the report purported to show morris account history information as provided by the three major credit reporting bureaus experian,transunion,and equifax the report from july contained several pieces of information about morris that he wanted either changed or deleted.morris wrote a letter to on july,identifying these items and stating,false information in the credit report that you disseminate about me is causing me harm.one of the items identified by morris for correction was a charge account with target.the report showed that experian,transunion,and equifax all reported that morris had joint responsibility for this account,that the account condition was derogatory and its pay status was of the past due amount of.in his letter to equifax,morris stated,i owe target nothing,and explained that the account in question had been opened by rebecca morris while she was married to morris,that the account was never a joint account,that morris divorced rebecca in april,and that the charge in question had been effected by rebecca in late after the divorce.in the letter to equifax,morris stated that he had informed target of his position on this account,and he also stated that target bureaucratic bungling is solely responsible for this false information that target has furnished to you.morris demanded that equifax correct the information about the target account and also that equifax show the information as disputed in the meantime.morris letter also requested that equifax give its immediate attention to the disputed items and stated that morris was in the process of refinancing his home mortgage and that he would hold equifax responsible for substantial damages in the event he could not obtain the lowest interest rate available because of an incorrect credit report.
equifax received morris letter on july.equifax took none of the action demanded by morris,but instead responded by sending morris a letter dated july,stating that equifax does not maintain or service the information contained in your credit file.equifax letter also informed morris that his letter of july had been forwarded to csc credit services csc,which,according to equifax,is the credit reporting agency which researches the credit file concerns of consumers living in morris area.the july letter from equifax also provided morris with contact information for csc and directed morris to contact csc if he had any further concerns or needed additional help.
it is not clear from the record when equifax actually mailed morris july,letter to csc,but it is clear that csc received the forwarded letter on july.in response to morris letter,csc sent an automated consumer dispute verification acdv to target on august.in its august,response to csc,target did not tell csc to stop reporting the account in question as a joint account with morris.equifax admittedly,and csc allegedly,did not report the results of this reinvestigation to morris in august.in september,csc sent another acdv to target.in its september,response to csc,target again did not tell csc to stop reporting the account as a joint account.while equifax again did not report the results of this reinvestigation to morris,csc did report the results to morris by letter dated october,days after equifax received morris dispute letter and days after csc received morris letter forwarded from equifax.
on october,morris obtained a bureau online credit report from this bureau report,like the report from july,purported to show morris account history information as provided by the three major credit reporting bureaus experian,transunion,and equifax.on the bureau report from october,the past due amount of from the disputed target account was still displayed under all three of the major bureaus,although equifax no longer reported it as a account as did experian and transunion,but instead reported it under the account heading of retailers national the remarks in the equifax column for retailers national b stated,consumer says acct.is responsibility of separated or divorced spouse.in addition,the payment status for this account was shown in the equifax column as bad debt placed for collection skip.on january,morris filed suit in texas state court against both equifax and csc asserting claims for violations of the reinvestigation requirements of the fair credit reporting act,and also a state law libel claim.in this original petition,morris alleged damages from receiving higher insurance quotes and from being unable to refinance his mortgage at a more favorable rate.equifax,with csc consent,timely removed the case to the united states district court for the southern district of texas.
in,morris received a letter from capital one disapproving morris request for a capital one credit card.in its letter,known as an adverse action letter from the requirements of,capital one provided the following reasons,inter alia,for not approving morris request the presence of a collection record and too many delinquencies on installment trades.the capital one letter also stated that its decision was based in whole or in part on information contained in consumer credit report sic obtained from the credit bureau s listed below.the letter then listed equifax,experian,and transunion.about the same time,morris received a letter from citibank disapproving morris application for a citi platinum select mastercard account.citibank identified the following reason for its disapproval a delinquent credit obligation s,either paid or unpaid,was recorded in your credit bureau report.much like the capital one letter,the citibank letter stated that the decision was based in whole or in part on information obtained in a report from the consumer reporting agency listed below.unlike capital one,however,the citibank letter listed only one consumer reporting.neither the capital one letter nor the citibank letter made any mention of csc 
on january,morris filed his first amended complaint,which incorporated the january denials of credit by capital one and citibank.at some point morris sued target in a separate action and following that suit target sent to precisely whom is unclear a universal automated data form resulting in the challenged information being removed from consumer credit reports on file respecting morris.morris and csc settled and on march,morris filed an unopposed motion to dismiss without prejudice his claims against csc,which was granted on march,dismissing csc from the present case.
on march,morris filed a motion for partial summary judgment based on equifax admission that it did not comply with the fcra reinvestigation provisions.also on march,equifax filed a motion for summary judgment on both of morris claims,arguing that its receipt of morris dispute letter did not trigger any obligation on its part to comply with section,and on the ground that morris libel claim was barred under section e and conditional privilege under texas state law.the case was referred to a magistrate judge who,on june,recommended that the district court deny morris motion for partial summary judgment and grant equifax motion for summary judgment.the magistrate judge recommended summary judgment for equifax on morris fcra claim because csc,not equifax,owned morris file and only csc had the authority to modify the information in morris file.the magistrate judge also recommended summary judgment for equifax on the libel claim because the court finds that plaintiff failed to raise a fact issue on malice or willful intent.in addition,the magistrate judge noted that,although t he record demonstrates that equifax published plaintiff credit information,n othing in the record suggests that equifax knew or should have known at that time that the information was false.
morris filed objections to the magistrate judge memorandum and recommendation,arguing that the language of the fcra does not allow a consumer reporting agency to avoid the reinvestigation obligations of simply because it does not own the file.in his objections,morris also argued that he had raised a fact issue concerning equifax malice in that his evidence shows equifax knew of the falsity because morris told them of the falsity,and equifax did nothing but continue to publish the same false information without any effort to ascertain the truth.after reviewing morris objections,the district court,on june,adopted the magistrate judge memorandum and recommendation and entered a final judgment that morris take nothing against equifax.morris timely appealed.

discussion 
the fair credit reporting act claima.background 
the purpose of the fair credit reporting act fcra is to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter.b emphasis added.in july,when morris sent his dispute letter to equifax,the fcra provided the following general requirements for reinvestigations by a consumer reporting agency 
if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly of such dispute,the agency shall reinvestigate free of charge and record the current status of the disputed information,or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph,before the end of the period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer.a a amended by fair and accurate credit transactions fact act of,stat,
morris alleges that equifax failed to meet the requirements of section after morris notified equifax directly of his dispute with the credit information that equifax had reported to truecredit and that morris had seen on the credit report in its motion for summary judgment,equifax does not argue that it met the section requirements,but instead argues that equifax does not have a duty to reinvestigate consumer disputes on credit files owned by affiliates.to understand this argument,one needs first to understand the relationship between equifax and csc.although equifax is a nationwide consumer reporting agency,it does not own credit files on consumers living in certain geographic areas.in these certain areas,equifax contracts with a wholly separate to perhaps misleadingly as an does own a credit file on the consumers in that area.one such is former defendant csc,whose territory encompasses all or parts of eight states,including the area of texas in which morris lives,and whose consumer files number in the tens of millions.like equifax,csc is generally a consumer reporting agency.equifax and csc have entered into a contract under which csc stores its credit files in an computer system known as acropac when a file such as morris is stored in acropac,apparently any customer of either equifax or of any of equifax affiliates including csc can obtain the information contained in the csc file.it likewise appears that csc pays equifax a fee for each billable inquiry that is made into the acropac system as to any file in addition,the revenue associated with each billable inquiry is shared between the file owner in this case,csc and the company either equifax or one of the affiliates whose customer makes the billable inquiry.thus,as we generally understand it when a csc customer requests morris credit report,all of the revenue from that billable inquiry would go to csc,and csc would then pay equifax the billable inquiry fee on the other hand,when an equifax customer requests morris credit report,csc and equifax divide the revenue and csc then pays equifax the same billable inquiry fee.
file ownership 
equifax argument relied on its contractual relationship with csc.at the district court,equifax did not dispute that it is in general a consumer reporting agency instead,equifax simply argued that it was csc equifax to reinvestigate morris dispute.according to equifax,because csc owns morris file and only csc can lawfully make any deletions,additions or alterations to it,only csc is subject to the requirements of section respecting that file.
the district court,by adopting the magistrate judge memorandum,noted that,although t he parties agree that equifax and csc are consumer reporting agencies,t he question is whether equifax is the consumer reporting agency on which the statute places the burden of investigation for plaintiff credit file.the district court accepted equifax argument,holding that t he better interpretation of section is that the consumer reporting agency that owns the consumer file and has the authority to modify the information therein is the only agency obligated by section to reinvestigate the challenged credit report.
while no federal court of appeals has addressed this question,equifax has successfully made this argument in at least two other federal district courts.see zotta nationscredit financial services,d,in light of plaintiffs concession that equifax does not own and maintain plaintiffs credit files,the court concludes equifax is entitled to summary judgment.slice choicedata consumer services,wl.march,b ecause equifax does not own plaintiff credit file,it can not be liable for conducting a reinvestigation of that file.citing the lower court opinion in the present case.gohman equifax information services,d,t he court declines to hold that equifax is not subject to section merely because it does not own or maintain plaintiff file.section b is not limited to consumer reporting agencies who own and maintain credit files.
the district court in this case did not mention gohman,but it did cite zotta.the court acknowledged that the zotta case is wanting in legal analysis,but held that zotta seems to reach the correct conclusion.we disagree.
the version of section that governs this case does not distinguish between the consumer reporting agency cra that owns the consumer credit file and the cra that sells,or,to use equifax term,distributes the consumer credit file.the more recent version of section,however,as amended by the fact act,does distinguish between a cra and a cra that operates as a reseller.see supra note.it is possibly helpful to understand why congress added the reseller provisions to section.under the act version of section,the federal trade commission ftc seems to have enforced the requirements of section generally against cras involved in reporting the consumer against just the cra that owned the consumer credit file,but also against cras that acted as resellers of that file.see in the matter of first american real estate solutions,llc.in hearings on,which became the fact act,the ftc testified,persons who purchase consumer reports for resale also known as resellers are covered by the fcra as consumer reporting agencies and have all the obligations of other cras,including the duty to reinvestigate and accurate credit transactions act of hearing before the comm.on financial services,cong.july,prepared statement of the federal trade comm n.although the ftc applied the requirements of section to resellers,it recognized that these requirements do not work well when applied to resellers.id nonetheless,prior to the fact act amendments,the ftc seems to have considered the requirements of section to be generally applicable to cras that were notified of a dispute directly by the consumer,whether they be the owner of the file or a reseller of the file.while the ftc position on this question is only advisory in nature,it may provide helpful guidance to the courts.see fischl general motors acceptance,cir.because the governing version of section does not distinguish between a cra that owns the consumer credit file and a cra that distributes the consumer credit file,we hold that the mere fact that a cra does not own a consumer file does not of itself necessarily relieve that cra of the reinvestigation requirements of the fcra,
our opinion in this respect is bolstered by the precise scenario presented in this case,in which csc initially was not notified directly by morris of the dispute.under the governing version of section,csc arguably did not have a statutory obligation to conduct a reinvestigation when equifax forwarded morris dispute letter to csc because morris did not notify csc directly of his dispute.see whelan trans union credit reporting agency,granting summary judgment for cras alleged to have violated because the consumer did not notify the cras directly of his dispute but instead notified the creditor who had furnished the disparaging information and that creditor then notified the cras see also ftc statement quoted supra note.if equifax interpretation is combined with such an application of the notify directly requirement of section,neither equifax nor csc were obligated under section to reinvestigate morris dispute while equifax forwarded morris letter to csc,equifax says it did this due to its own internal policy,not due to any fcra requirements 
the purpose of the fcra is to require consumer reporting agencies to adopt reasonable procedures in accordance with the requirements of the fcra.b.here,morris viewed adverse credit information apparently transmitted to truecredit from the equifax computer,and morris then contacted equifax directly to dispute the accuracy of that information in accordance with the fcra.section provides the procedure in case of disputed accuracy and includes specific time requirements to ensure that consumer disputes are handled expeditiously.the procedures adopted by equifax,while arguably reasonable,are not in accord with the requirements of section.
c.other section liability issues 
equifax also argues that,although equifax is a consumer reporting agency,it did not act as one here because it did not assemble or evaluate the consumer credit information contained in morris credit file equifax role here was merely that of distributor.the fcra defines a consumer reporting agency cra as follows 
a ny person which,for monetary fees,dues,or on a cooperative nonprofit basis,regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or other information on consumers for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties,and which uses any means or facility of interstate commerce for the purpose of preparing or furnishing consumer reports.f 
the district court did not address whether equifax either assembled or evaluated consumer credit information with respect to morris,or acted as a cra respecting morris,within the meaning of section f.equifax did not expressly make that argument in the district court and it is not clear to us that the present record evidence adequately resolves those questions or whether equifax prepared a consumer credit respecting morris in these circumstances we conclude that it is preferable that equifax contentions in this respect be addressed in the first instance by the district court on remand 
the libel claim 
in his texas law libel claim morris alleges that equifax libeled him by continuing to publish the adverse credit information regarding the target account after morris notified equifax that the information was false.in its motion for summary judgment,equifax argues that morris state law libel claim is precluded under both e and texas law of conditional privilege.
section e bars a consumer from bringing any claim in the nature of defamation with respect to the reporting of information against any consumer reporting agency,any user of information,or any person who furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency except as to false information furnished with malice or willful intent to injure such consumer.e.in addition,the supreme court of texas has agreed,with certain limitations not applicable here,that reports of mercantile or other agencies,furnished in good faith to one having a legitimate interest in the information,are privileged.dun bradstreet,quotations omitted.as the texas supreme court explained,such privilege is termed conditional or qualified because a person availing himself of it must use it in a lawful manner and for a lawful purpose.the effect of the privilege is to justify the communication when it is made without actual malice.id.at emphasis added quotations omitted.morris does not allege that equifax willfully intended to injure him,but he does allege malice.although the fcra does not define malice,we have previously applied the standard for malice when both parties agreed to such application.see cousin trans union,cir requiring the plaintiff to show that the defendant when he published the words either knew they were false,or published them in reckless disregard of whether they were true or not.in this case,we can not say the parties agree to such application because equifax has not addressed the malice exception to preemption under section e.morris has relied on thornton equifax,cir,an fcra case in which the eighth circuit cite d the new york times standard as an example of a type of malice necessary to overcome a qualified privilege.id.at.citing new york times sullivan,d we apply that standard in this case,and we agree with the district court that morris presented no evidence that equifax published false statements about morris knowing the statements were false or with a reckless disregard of whether they were false.
while morris has presented evidence that equifax knew that morris claimed that there were false statements in the information that equifax was publishing about morris,this evidence does not show that equifax knew these statements were false.morris also argues that equifax had a reckless disregard for whether the statements were false because equifax continued to publish the same false information about morris without lifting a finger to determine whether the information was false or not.to show reckless disregard,however,morris must present sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.amant thompson,d emphasis added in this case,there is no such evidence.as there is no evidence of malice,morris libel claim fails under both section e and the conditional privilege under texas law 
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the summary judgment on the fcra claim,affirm the summary judgment on the libel claim,and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith on the fcra claim.
reversed in part,affirmed in part,and remanded.
the truecredit website states that truecredit is m ajority owned by transunion.see last visited june.in addition,the printout of morris truecredit credit report includes the following statement brought to you by transunion.
the report also showed a list of the companies that had recently requested morris credit report and the date of each request.for each entry on this list,a credit bureau was also listed presumably,the bureau listed was the one that provided to truecredit the data on that entry on the list.the only three credit bureaus identified in this list were experian,transunion,and equifax.
morris also wrote letters to transunion and experian,but only the letter to equifax is involved in this case.
