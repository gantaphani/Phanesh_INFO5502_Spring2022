william mcavey brought this diversity action against lee lee,his wife,lee lee,and ming chun,tomfort lodge ming chun collectively,the insureds or the innkeepers,and first financial insurance company first financial,the insureds commercial liability insurer,for damages for personal injury to mcavey caused by the negligence of the insureds and their employees in failing to take reasonable precautions and to exercise proper vigilance for the safety and security of their hotel guests.mcavey alleged that he fractured his heel while chasing two unidentified robbers who had taken his wallet by force in his tomfort lodge motel room.he further averred that the criminals entered the motel and the hall outside his room without detection by the motel employees,tricked him into opening his door,committed the robbery,and escaped without being identified or detained,because of the defendants inadequate motel security and safety precautions and the negligence of the motel clerk in failing to exercise reasonable efforts to monitor and protect hotel guests against such dangers.at the close of the plaintiff case at trial,the district court entered a judgment as a matter of law jmol dismissing the action against and lee.after completion of the trial,the jury returned a verdict in favor of mcavey,fixing damages and apportioning fault between him and the innkeepers.the district court rendered a judgment in mcavey favor against first financial.
first financial appealed,contending,inter alia,that its policy excluded coverage for bodily injuries arising from assault or battery that all of mcavey injuries arose from a battery by the robbers that the dismissal of the suit against two of first financial insureds,and lee,and the plaintiff failure to properly serve the third insured,ming chun,effectively extinguished the plaintiff right to a direct action and judgment against the insurer and that the district court erred in not instructing the jury to determine whether the fault of the unidentified criminals was a legal cause of mcavey injuries,and,if so,to apportion a share of the fault and liability to them.
mcavey,a truck driver,arrived in new orleans,louisiana,on the evening of november,with a load of household goods to be delivered the next morning.mcavey checked into the tomfort lodge,a modestly priced motel on tulane avenue.
and lee had purchased the building in which the tomfort lodge was located in,and lee had managed a motel business in the building from to.at some point prior to,the motel business was taken over by ming chun,ming chun.the lees leased the building to ming chun for minimum and rentals,pursuant to an oral agreement.in,the lees and ming chun signed a written lease formalizing their existing oral lease agreement.lee continued to manage the motel business for ming chun.
according to mcavey,he was awakened around the night of his stay at the tomfort lodge by a man who knocked on the door and announced himself as motel security.when mcavey opened the door,two men forced their way in and hurled him onto the bed.as mcavey struggled with one assailant,the other grabbed mcavey wallet and ran.mcavey pursued the robber outside the room and down the motel stairs.during the chase,the second robber made contact with mcavey as he passed mcavey on the stairs mcavey bare right heel landed on the edge of one of the steps,fracturing his heel bone.
mcavey filed suit in district court initially only against lee.first financial,the innkeepers commercial liability insurer,refused to defend the claim against lee on the ground that mcavey claim arose from a battery,a risk it alleged was excluded from coverage under the policy.mcavey added lee as a defendant in his first amended complaint,and added ming chun and first financial as defendants in his second amended complaint.
first financial moved for summary judgment on the basis that mcavey loss arose from a battery,which it claimed was excluded from coverage by the policy.on november,the district court denied the insurer motion,holding that the documents constituting the insurance contract were ambiguous as to whether an assault and battery exclusion had been incorporated by reference and therefore must be construed in favor of coverage.on august,for the same reasons,the district court granted and lee motion for a partial summary judgment,decreeing that the policy did not include an assault and battery exclusion.
during trial,after mcavey rested his,the lees attorney,james swanson,moved orally for a jmol to dismiss the action against the lees on the ground that t here is no evidence that lee did anything that was unreasonable under the circumstances.the evidence seems to be that at worse the desk clerk should have done something and he was lee employee,he was the corporation employee.the district court granted jmol dismissing the action against the lees for the reasons argued by the plaintiff sic.evidently,the district court meant for the reasons argued by the defendants attorney,swanson.after the defendants presented their,first financial moved for dismissal of ming chun on the grounds that the corporation had not been properly served pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.after that motion was denied,first financial moved for a jmol pursuant to rule a to dismiss mcavey suit on the grounds that louisiana direct action statute did not permit the maintenance of a direct action against an insurer when the insureds were no longer parties to the action,arguing that the lees had been dismissed and ming chun,the only other insured,had not been properly served.the district court denied the motion and,after closing arguments and instructions,submitted the case to the jury.
the jury returned a verdict finding that the negligence of the innkeeper and mcavey were legal causes of mcavey injury,charging the insureds with eighty percent of the fault and mcavey with twenty percent.the district court entered final judgment against first financial as insurer of ming chun,awarding mcavey a net sum of in damages after discounting his recovery by his apportioned fault.first financial motions for a jmol and a new trial were denied.first financial appealed from the district court final judgment.mcavey appealed from the jmol dismissing his action against the lees.and lee appealed from evidentiary and legal rulings made during the trial and the final judgment.after appellate briefs had been filed,however,mcavey and the lees settled the dispute between them.upon a joint motion by mcavey and the lees,their appeals were dismissed by order of the clerk of court on july,
first financial contends that the policy for,the applicable policy year,excluded coverage for losses arising from assault or battery and that mcavey injuries resulted from a battery.we conclude,however,that the policy did not exclude coverage for such losses and,therefore,whether mcavey injuries arose from a battery is irrelevant to determination of the insurer liability.this coverage issue was raised by and lee partial motion for summary judgment,which the district court granted,and first financial motion for summary judgment,which was denied by the trial court.
the general standard that an appellate court applies in reviewing the grant or denial of a motion is the same as that employed by the trial court initially under rule c a summary judgment is proper when it appears that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.charles alan wright,arthur miller,mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure civil quoting.c citing,inter alia,gatx aircraft courtney leigh,cir mccrae hankins,cir.o n summary judgment the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts contained in such materials such as affidavits,depositions,and exhibits must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.united states diebold,d.w e look at the record on summary judgment in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion poller columbia broad,d see also john.bd.of trustees,cir simon united states,cir.

each policy incorporated deleted by reference other documents,forms,and endorsements governing various aspects of coverage.the policies referred to the separate documents by company form numbers.consequently,the contours of coverage of each policy can not be determined without laboriously tracking down each pertinent document incorporated or deleted by reference among the numerous documents,forms,and endorsements in the record.
the policy,in pertinent part,provided form s and endorsement s made a part of this policy at time of issue.footnote and other forms listed omitted.that form,entitled general commercial liability coverage part declarations,filed of record with the policy,in pertinent part provides forms and endorsements applying to this coverage part and made part of this policy at time of issue.numerous others omitted.intermediate form contains exclusion entitled or battery,which provides 
exclusion a of coverage a section is replaced by the following bodily injury,property damage,or personal injury expected or intended from the standpoint of any insured or arising out of assault or battery,or out of any act or omission in connection with the prevention or suppression of an assault or battery.
the replaced exclusion a provides this insurance does not apply to bodily injury or property damage expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.this exclusion does not apply to bodily injury resulting from the use of reasonable force to protect persons or property.thus,the policy plainly excluded coverage of bodily and personal injury and property damage arising out of assault or battery.
the policy in effect at the time of mcavey injury,however,failed to continue or the assault or battery exclusion.the policy,in pertinent part,provides 
in consideration of the payment of the premium,it is agreed that the policy designated herein is renewed for the period stated,subject to all its terms unless otherwise specified below.

but the foregoing quoted policy provisions clearly deleted and made inapplicable form,the original commercial general liability coverage form,which had been amended by the intermediate form that contained the assault or battery exclusion.the policy contains only the much narrower exclusion of injury or damage expected or intended by the insured,unless resulting from use of reasonable force to protect persons or property.consequently,it is evident that the policy did not continue or the assault or battery exclusion.thus,mcavey injuries arising out of assault or battery are not excluded from coverage under the policy.
furthermore,assuming arguendo that it is reasonable to interpret the insurance documents as first financial proposes,that the parties unexpressed intention was that the assault and battery exclusion would affect all future contracts unless expressly abrogated,that would only provide an alternative reading of an ambiguous contract.we have recognized that louisiana courts have required that insurance policy ambiguities be resolved in favor of coverage of the insured.huey littleton claims,employers reinsurance,cir citing benton casing,avemco ins,so d stewart.farm bureau mut.ins,so d d cir accord.ann.art.west in case of doubt that can not be otherwise resolved,a provision in a contract must be interpreted against the party who furnished its text.a contract executed in a standard form of one party must be interpreted,in case of doubt,in favor of the other party.crabtree state farm ins,so d,if after applying the other general rules of construction an ambiguity remains,the ambiguous contractual provision is to be construed against the insurer who issued the policy and in favor of the insured.accordingly,even if we accept first financial contractual interpretation as a reasonable choice,we are constitutionally required,as erie held to apply louisiana law,which here mandates that we resolve the ambiguity by adopting the other reasonable interpretation that favors coverage for the benefit of the insured.
first financial next argues that the district court erred in rendering judgment against the insurer alone,because louisiana direct action statute.ann.west,provides that such action may be brought against the insurer alone only when the insured is deceased,insolvent,unable to be served,engaged in bankruptcy proceedings,or a spouse,child,or parent of the plaintiff,and none of these exceptions applies in the present case.id.b a e.in the absence of a louisiana case on point,first financial urges us to erie guess that the supreme court of louisiana would hold that the statute bars the district court judgment against the insurer because none of the insureds was a party to the direct action against the insurer when final judgment was rendered against the insurer.according to first financial argument,mcavey has no right of action without the presence of at least one of the insureds.
we do not think the state highest court would reach that conclusion in the present case.on the contrary,as indicated by that court previous decisions,we believe that it would hold that the injured plaintiff substantive right and remedial direct action against the insurer and the insured tortfeasor accrues immediately upon the commission of the tort under the opening provisions of section b.because those provisions of the direct action statute have not been changed,we think that the supreme court of louisiana would conclude that the accrual of the injured plaintiff right and remedy against the insurer under the direct action statute has not been substantively altered.instead,we believe that the court would decide that the section b a e provisions restricting suits against an insurer alone,which were added to the end of that section by amendment in,set forth a procedural joinder requirement that authorizes the insurer,subject to specified exceptions,to object to of an insured and seek dismissal of the direct action if the insured is not joined.
first financial argument misinterprets the procedural joinder requirement of section b,ending in subparagraphs a e,as a substantive condition precedent to the injured plaintiff right,remedy,and judgment against the insurer under the direct action statute.consequently,first financial erroneously contends that the dismissal by directed verdict of mcavey action against two of the insureds,and lee,and his alleged failure to properly serve the insured corporation,ming chun,nullified his substantive right,remedial action,and judgment against the insurer.
we are convinced that the supreme court of louisiana would reject first financial theory of interpretation,however,because it is incompatible with the text,structure,history,and jurisprudential environment of the direct action statute.under first financial proposed reading of the direct action statute,the opening provision of section b would be effectively repealed and the basic historical public purpose of the statute would be defeated for it is the beginning provision of section b that establishes for automobile accident victims and other injured plaintiffs substantive rights and remedial actions,accruing immediately with the insured tortfeasor wrongful act,which are enforceable directly against the insurer to the same extent as against the insured tortfeasor,subject to the coverage and limits of the liability insurance policy.the express purpose of the direct action statute,to ensure that all liability policies inure to the benefit of people injured through the fault of the insured.ann.d west,can be effectuated only through the substantive rights and direct remedial actions established by the initial provision of section b.
the first provision of section b,which has been the principal substantive part of the direct action statute since,plainly states 
the injured person or his or her survivors or heirs at their option,shall have a right of direct action against the insurer within the terms and limits of the policy and,such action may be brought against the insurer alone,or against both insured and insurer jointly and in solido 
id.emphasis added.without the creation of a substantive right for the injured plaintiff against the insurer by that provision,all else in the statute would be useless and meaningless.it is axiomatic that without a right there can be no remedy or action and it is that without the plaintiff right and action or remedy against the insurer there would have been no need for the legislature to create a procedural method whereby the insurer may have the court require the joinder of insureds.unless the three elements of section b substantive right,remedial action,and procedural understood as fulfilling three different legal purposes,they are irreconcilable and can not all be given meaning as required by one of the paramount principles of statutory construction.see.ann.art.west laws on the same subject matter must be interpreted in reference to each other.id.art.each provision in a contract must be interpreted in light of the other provisions so that each is given the meaning suggested by the contract as a whole.ann.west words and phrases shall be read with their context and shall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language.see also abl management,bd.of supervisors of southern,so d,it is presumed that every word,sentence or provision in the statute was intended to serve some useful purpose,that some effect is to be given to each such provision,and that no unnecessary words or provisions were used the legislature is presumed to have enacted each statute with deliberation and with full knowledge of all existing laws on the same subject where it is possible,the courts have a duty in the interpretation of a statute to adopt a construction which harmonizes and reconciles it with other provisions a construction of a law which creates an inconsistency should be avoided when a reasonable interpretation can be adopted which will not do violence to the plain words of the statute and will carry out the legislature intention.
accordingly,we calculate that the supreme court of louisiana would hold that section b of the direct action statute consists of three complementary elements the injured plaintiff substantive right against the insurer,which accrues derivatively with his substantive right against the insured tortfeasor the injured plaintiff direct action or remedy against the insurer and the procedural requirements,set forth in the provision ending with subparagraphs a e of section b,which,in effect,provide the insurer a procedural means to avoid defending a direct action alone,except in the circumstances listed,by objecting to the of the insured.
reading the pertinent provisions of the direct action statute together and in light of their historical development,the state and federal jurisprudence,and scholarly commentary further supports the foregoing conclusions.the direct action statute,in pertinent parts,provides 
the injured person or his or her survivors or heirs mentioned in subsection a,at their option,shall have a right of direct action against the insurer within the terms and limits of the policy and,such action may be brought against the insurer alone,or against both the insured and insurer jointly and in solido,in the parish in which the accident or injury occurred or in the parish in which an action could be brought against either the insured or the insurer under the general rules of venue prescribed by code of civil procedure only.however,such action may be brought against the insurer alone only when 
a the insured has been adjudged a bankrupt by a court of competent jurisdiction or when proceedings to adjudge an insured a bankrupt have been commenced before a court of competent jurisdiction 
b the insured is insolvent 
c service of citation or other process can not be made on the insured.
d when the cause of action is for damages as a result of an offense or between children and their parents or between married persons or 
e the insured is deceased.
d.it is also the intent of this section that all liability policies within their terms and limits are executed for the benefit of all injured persons and their survivors or heirs to whom the insured is liable and,that it is the purpose of all liability policies to give protection and coverage to all insureds,whether they are named insured or additional insureds under the omnibus clause,for any legal liability said insured may have as or for a tortfeasor within the terms and limits of said policy.
bold and emphasis added.
the original act that became part of the present direct action statute was act of.that law made it illegal to issue a liability policy without a provision that,in case of the insured insolvency or bankruptcy,the insurer would not be released,but subject to a direct action within the terms and limits of the policy by the injured person or his or her heirs.acts.in edwards fid.cas,so,the court of appeals upheld under the statute the right and action of a person injured by an insured tortfeasor to recover from the latter insurer the amount of his unsatisfied judgment against the insured.the court held that the purpose of the statute was to create,immediately upon the happening of the accident,a cause of action in the injured party against the insurer or the party at fault conditioned upon the obtaining of a judgment against the party at fault and upon unsuccessful efforts to collect that judgment.id.at.
in its next session,the legislature enacted act of,codifying the edwards holding and providing that the injured person,at his option,shall have a right of direct action against the insurer either against the insurer company alone or against both the assured and the insurer jointly and in solido.that provision,without significant change,has been the principal part of the direct action statute ever since.see supra,at.

of course,the injured person right against the insurer,which is derived by the direct action statute from the plaintiff right against the insured tortfeasor,generally is dependent upon that substantive delictual right for its existence and scope.see,cacamo liberty mut.fire ins,so d holding that the direct action statute gives special rights to tort victims,not to insureds with contractual claims against their own insurer descant adm rs of the tulane educ.fund,so d,holding that the insured medical malpractice act cap also limits plaintiff direct recovery from insurer.
the state supreme court and appellate courts,the united states supreme court,and this circuit have recognized,however,that when the injured plaintiff acquires a valid right against the tortfeasor insurer under the direct action statute,that right is substantive in nature.see quinlan liberty bank trust,so d,on reh g when the statute is applicable and authorizes a direct suit against a tortfeasor insurer,the statute is read into and becomes a part of a policy written pursuant thereto,even though the policy does not contain the language required by the statute,or contains language prohibited by the statute t he direct action statute is a mandate for a tort victim to bring a direct suit to recover damages for personal injury or corporeal property damage from the tortfeasor insurer,regardless of whether the insurer has framed the policy as a liability or an indemnity contract.internal citations omitted west monroe bakery,so d,the direct action statute has been treated consistently as conferring substantive rights on third parties to contracts of public liability insurance,which become vested at the moment of the accident in which they are injured zimmerman int l consulting,cir quoting quinlan,supra auster oil gas,stream,cir quoting quinlan,supra citing west,supra in re combustion,quoting quinlan,supra accord lumbermen mut.cas.elbert.the louisiana courts have characterized the statute as creating a separate and distinct cause of action against the insurer which an injured party may elect in lieu of his action against the tortfeasor william mckenzie alston johnson iii,insurance law practice,at louisiana civil law treatise noting that lumbermen mutual approved the view that the statute created substantive rights which the federal court was bound to enforce 
the legislature did not affect the plaintiff substantive and remedial rights under the direct action statute in the amendment that added the italicized portion quoted at note,supra.the amendment merely added a procedural method by which the insurer can object to the of the insured other than in the exceptional circumstances listed,which operates as an exception to the principle of louisiana code of civil procedure article,which provides that the injured plaintiff,as a solidary obligee,may enforce his claim against either the insurer or the insured,as a solidary obligor,or together,at the plaintiff option.the legislature intention to preserve the injured person substantive right and remedial action against the tortfeasor insurer is clear.by continuing the provision verbatim and intact when it added the joinder provision in,the legislature obviously did not intend to abrogate the right and remedy which had been enforced for years instead it meant simply to add a procedural rule of joinder to accompany the right and remedy.if the legislature had intended to drastically limit or hamper the substantive rights and remedial actions under louisiana venerable and unique direct action statute,surely it would have said so in explicit,clear,and unambiguous terms.for this reason,and to give meaning to every provision of the whole direct action statute,as amended,we conclude that the statute must now be read as establishing a substantive right,a remedial action,and a joinder procedure 
in this case,first financial motion for jmol was not based on a procedural objection to but on its misconception that the injured plaintiff right,remedy,and judgment against the insurer are substantively dependent upon joinder of the insureds.even if the motion for jmol could be construed as a procedural objection to of an insured,however,the district court denial was not an abuse of discretion because the motion came so late in the the conclusion of all the evidence in the case,two years after the filing of the initial granting it would have prejudiced the parties present with undue delay the district court did not err or abuse its discretion because its denial of the motion will not result in first financial incurring multiple or inconsistent obligations,or in ming chun being subjected to liability for which it had no opportunity to defend itself.see pulitzer,cir schutten shell oil,cir wright,at.
as we have suggested above,the judgment against first financial was based only on the delictual right which mcavey had against first financial insured,ming chun,not on any delictual right which mcavey had against either or lee,who were also first financial insureds.first financial challenge to the service on ming chun plainly came too late and was hence waived.
consequently,we conclude that in the present case mcavey right,remedy,and judgment against first financial was not affected by the directed verdict dismissing and lee or the failure to serve ming chun properly 
first financial next argues that the district court erred when it ruled in limine that the jury would not be instructed,or requested in response to an interrogatory,to assign a percentage of fault to the unidentified criminal intruders who intentionally attacked and robbed mcavey.
the district court instructions to the jury and special interrogatories are reviewed for abuse of discretion.eeoc manville sales,cir.s o long as the jury is not misled,prejudiced,or confused,and the charge is comprehensive and fundamentally accurate,it will be deemed adequate and without reversible error.davis avondale,cir.

the jury assigned eighty percent of the fault to the innkeeper and twenty percent to mcavey.first financial contends that the jury should have been instructed to assign fault to the unidentified criminal intruders,and that if the jury had done so mcavey recovery from first financial would have been reduced substantially.
on november,when mcavey rights under delictual law and the direct action statute accrued and became vested against first financial and its insured tortfeasors,neither louisiana civil code article nor louisiana code of civil procedure article c,or any other pertinent lousisiana law,required a trial court to cause a diminution of mcavey full recovery for his injuries by instructing a jury to assign percentages of fault to unidentified intentional criminal tortfeasors.see cavalier cain hydrostatic testing,so d s ince the legislature did not specify which should have their fault quantified by the jury,the appropriateness,and indeed the necessity,of quantifying the fault of a particular as a substantive requirement of the overall statutory scheme of comparative fault is inherently a question to be decided by the courts.veazey elmwood plantation,so d,louisiana law is broad enough to allow comparison of fault between intentional tortfeasors and negligent tortfeasors,but whether such a comparison should be made must be determined by the trial court on a case by
