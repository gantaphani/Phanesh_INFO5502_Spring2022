for this negligence action arising out of a collision at a crossing between a train and a vehicle,primarily at issue is whether the federal railroad safety act frsa,and a regulation promulgated thereunder,which set maximum train speeds for different classes of tracks,preclude a railroad employee negligence action under the federal employers liability act fela,the employee claiming the train was proceeding at an excessive speed when involved in the collision,even though it was traveling below the speed limit established by the regulation.railroad employee donald lane appeals the summary judgment granted csx transportation,the railroad,and the denial of his motion for a new trial as to sims,the vehicle csx the denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law on its against sims.we affirm.
lane fela action against csx and sims alleged he was injured when the train on which he was working as an engineer for csx collided with sims,driven by wallace,at a crossing in gulfport,mississippi.immediately prior to the collision,the train was traveling miles per hour.the csx speed limit for that crossing was miles per hour,while the speed limit established for that crossing by federal railway administration track safety standards,was miles per hour.among other things,lane negligence claim against csx asserted the train was traveling at an excessive and unsafe speed under the circumstances heavy lunchtime traffic at a downtown crossing.
csx against sims,asserting,inter alia its employee,wallace the vehicle driver,was negligent for failing to yield the to the train and sims failed to comply with a mississippi statute requiring it to notify csx in advance of its travel over the crossing.lane made similar negligence claims against sims.
the district court granted partial summary judgment for csx on lane fela claim.the remaining issues were tried to a jury,which found no negligence on the part of csx,sims,or lane.the district court denied new trial motions by lane and csx.
lane challenges the summary judgment granted csx on his fela claim and the denial of a new trial on his negligence claim against sims.csx contests the denial of judgment as a matter of law on its against sims.
the fela provides the exclusive remedy for a railroad employee injured as a result of his employer negligence.see,wabash hayes.janelle seaboard coast line,cir.it authorizes an injured railroad employee to recover damages from his employer for injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the railroad negligence.but,by summary judgment,the district court held lane fela claim was precluded by the frsa and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
frsa stated purpose is to promote safety in every area of railroad operations and reduce accidents and incidents.it authorizes the secretary of transportation to prescribe regulations and issue orders for every area of railroad safety,a and provides that l aws,regulations,and orders related to railroad safety shall be nationally uniform to the extent practicable.emphasis added.
the secretary of transportation has promulgated regulations pursuant to this authority,including establishing maximum train speeds for various classes of railroad tracks.it is undisputed that the train involved in the collision was not exceeding the speed limit established by those regulations for the subject crossing.
the frsa goal of national uniformity for laws and regulations relating to railroad safety does not preclude a fela claim,according to lane,because the frsa and fela are not in conflict.he asserts frsa speed regulations are minimum safety requirements,compliance with which is evidence of due care,but does not preclude finding negligence if reasonable railroads would have taken additional precautions to prevent injury to their employees.
the supreme court considered the frsa speed limit regulations in csx transportation,easterwood,d.a state common law action,arising out of a truck driver death in a crossing collision,was filed against the railroad the action claimed,inter alia,the train was traveling at an excessive speed.it was conceded,however,that the train was traveling at less than the maximum speed established in.id.at.the court held the claim preempted by the frsa express preemption provision.id.at.that provision allows states to regulate railroad safety until the secretary of transportation prescribes a regulation or issues an order covering the subject matter of the state requirement.emphasis added.
the easterwood plaintiff contended that the maximum speed limits established in the regulations were merely ceilings,permitting imposition of liability against the railroad if plaintiff could establish the conditions required a lower speed.id.at.the court held otherwise because the secretary of transportation had considered the hazards posed by track conditions before adopting the regulations,the speed limits must be read as not only establishing a ceiling,but also precluding additional state regulation of the sort plaintiff urged.id.at.
because the case at hand involves a claim under another federal statute,fela,easterwood,which dealt with a state common law claim subject to frsa express preemption provision,is not controlling.nevertheless,the seventh circuit found easterwood persuasive in concluding that a fela claim was inconsistent with frsa goal of national uniformity.waymire norfolk ry,cir,cert.denied,d.the waymire plaintiff was the conductor on a train that collided with a truck at a crossing.id.at.the train was traveling at miles per hour,well under the speed limit set by the federal regulations.noting that the operation of the trains in waymire and easterwood was identical traveling at less than the frsa approved speed,the seventh circuit stated it would seem absurd to reach a contrary conclusion when the supreme court has already found that the conduct is not culpable negligence.id.at emphasis added.
two other district courts considering similar fela claims have reached the same conclusion,reasoning that the railroad safety uniformity intended by the frsa would be compromised if an negligence claim were permitted under the fela,but not under state law.see rice cincinnati,new orleans pac.ry,fela claim precluded by frsa and regulations where train traveling at speed exceeding railroad speed limit,but below limit established in regulations thirkill hunt,fela claim precluded by frsa and regulations where train was traveling within speed limit set by regulations.
only one court has decided otherwise.earwood norfolk southern railway,on which lane relies,held frsa speed regulations did not preclude a fela claim.the court reasoned the regulations were not directed at employee safety and established only minimum safety requirements.id.
in the light of congress intent that railroad safety regulations be nationally uniform to the extent practicable,we find waymire,thirkill,and rice far more persuasive than earwood.such uniformity can be achieved only if the regulations covering train speed are applied similarly to a fela plaintiff negligence claim and a plaintiff state law negligence claim.otherwise,a railroad employee could assert a fela claim,but a motorist involved in the same collision would be precluded from doing so.dissimilar treatment of the claims would have the untenable result of making the railroad safety regulations established under the frsa virtually meaningless the railroad could at one time be in compliance with federal railroad safety standards with respect to certain classes of plaintiffs yet be found negligent under the fela with respect to other classes of plaintiffs for the very same conduct.waymire norfolk ry,d,aff,cir.moreover,allowing juries in fela cases to find negligence based on excessive speed,even though it did not exceed that set by the frsa regulations,would further undermine uniformity,because it would result in the establishment,through such verdicts,of varying,uncertain speed limits at different crossings,as well as different speed limits at the same crossing,depending on the time of day,traffic conditions,and other variables.
earwood conclusion that the regulations promulgated pursuant to the frsa were not d
