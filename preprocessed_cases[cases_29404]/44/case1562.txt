in this action for damages brought against it by relatives of american sailors killed in the terrorist bombing of the cole plaintiffs,the republic of sudan sudan appeals an order of the district court largely denying its motion to dismiss.on appeal,sudan argues both that the district court erred in denying its motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and also that this court should exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over,and reverse,the district court denial of its motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue.sudan also argues that this court should exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over and consider for the first time its motion to dismiss for lack of standing,an issue on which the district court deferred action.because we find that the district court exercise of subject matter jurisdiction was proper and that there is no basis to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over the remaining issues,we affirm the district court denial of sudan motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and dismiss the remainder of sudan appeal.
this case arises out of the october,bombing of the cole in which seventeen american sailors were killed.the bombing,alleged in the amended complaint to have been planned and executed by the terrorist organization,occurred while the ship was berthed in aden harbor in yemen.plaintiffs,consisting of more than fifty surviving family members of the sailors who were killed,brought this action to recover for damages resulting from their deaths.
the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,west supp,generally immunizes foreign states such as sudan from suit in federal court.see.section a of fsia,however,provides an exception for suits against state sponsors of terrorism for damages arising from certain terrorist acts identified in the statute.a.plaintiffs invoked a based on allegations that sudan had provided various forms of support to both during the years preceding and in the orchestration of the bombing of the cole.
plaintiffs filed their original complaint on july,and subsequently amended it several times.they effected service of process on sudan on december.when sudan failed to answer within the prescribed time,the clerk of court entered default against it.plaintiffs then moved for default judgment,which the district court scheduled for hearing.before the date of the hearing,sudan filed a motion to vacate entry of default and cancel evidentiary hearing.in that motion,sudan argued that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction because of insufficient process and service of process.following a hearing on sudan motion,the district court vacated the entry of default with plaintiffs consent but held that sudan had waived its right to contest personal jurisdiction and that plaintiffs had effected proper service on sudan.
on august,sudan filed its motion to dismiss plaintiffs amended complaint with prejudice.in that motion,sudan argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under fsia because plaintiffs failed to plead sufficient jurisdictional facts that sudan lacked sufficient minimum contacts with virginia to support personal jurisdiction that venue was improper in the eastern district of virginia that plaintiffs process was insufficient that plaintiffs service of process was insufficient and that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted for various reasons,including lack of standing.
on august,the district court entered the order,which is at issue in this appeal,denying most of sudan motion to dismiss.in that order,the district court held that plaintiffs had pleaded sufficient facts to support subject matter jurisdiction under a that sudan had waived its right to contest personal jurisdiction,service of process,and venue that plaintiffs had nevertheless effected proper service of process on sudan that the district court had personal jurisdiction over sudan and that the eastern district of virginia was a proper venue for the suit.the district court took under advisement sudan motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim until after sudan filed an answer.in so doing,the district court specifically deferred ruling on sudan argument that plaintiffs lacked standing.sudan timely appealed.
in this appeal,sudan argues that the district court erred in denying its motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under fsia,an issue that is subject to interlocutory review.sudan also asks us to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction to review the district court rulings on the issues of personal jurisdiction and venue.sudan finally asks us to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over and decide the issue of standing,even though the district court has not yet ruled on it.we consider each of sudan arguments in turn.
we first address sudan argument that plaintiffs failed to allege sufficient facts in the amended complaint to establish subject matter jurisdiction under fsia the existence of subject matter jurisdiction under fsia is a question of law that we review de novo.eckert int l,gov t of the sovereign democratic republic of fiji,cir.for reasons that follow,we reject sudan argument.
fsia provides that,subject to certain limited exceptions,a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states.one exception to such immunity arises in claims against a foreign state for injuries resulting from certain acts of terrorism.see a under a,victims of terrorism can sue countries that have been designated state sponsors of terrorism by the state department for those countries provision of material support for terrorist acts.hegna islamic republic of iran,cir citing a.this terrorist exception has the following jurisdictional requirements the provision of material support by a state sponsor of terrorism the provision of such support by an official of the state while acting within the scope of his or her office,employment,or agency and a causal link between the material support and damage resulting from an act of terrorism.see a.
a foreign state challenge to subject matter jurisdiction in an action brought pursuant to the terrorist exception to fsia may be based on either the inadequacy of the pleadings as a matter of law or a denial of the allegations in the complaint.phoenix consulting,at.in the first instance,the foreign state does not challenge the plaintiff allegations of fact in the second,the district court must resolve the factual dispute in ruling on the motion to dismiss.id.sudan motion to dismiss here was based solely on the legal sufficiency of the pleadings.in other words,this appeal presents no contested issues of fact and we accept plaintiffs allegations as true for purposes of determining jurisdictional sufficiency.see price socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,islamic republic of iran.
the standard we apply in assessing sudan challenge is similar to that of rule b,under which dismissal is warranted if no plausible inferences can be drawn from the facts alleged that,if proven,would provide grounds for relief.price,at.plaintiffs need not set out every fact on which jurisdiction under a depends.id.rather,they must include sufficient facts to support a reasonable inference that their claims satisfy the terrorist exception and,therefore,that an exercise of subject matter jurisdiction is appropriate.owens,d at see price,at.
the amended complaint broadly alleges that sudan provided material support in the form of funding,direction,training and cover to,a worldwide terrorist organization whose operatives facilitated the planning and execution of the bombing of the cole.am.compl.at.more specifically,the amended complaint contains the following jurisdictional allegations 
defendant republic of sudan,by and through officials,employees or agents acting knowingly and willfully,used funds and other assets belonging to the republic of the sudan to provide material support and resources to osama bin ladin and to al qaeda,the perpetrators of the bombing of the cole referenced herein above on october,in port in yemen,which bombing resulted in the wrongful deaths of the plaintiffs decedents.the provision of material support or resources was engaged in by officials,employees and agents of the republic of the sudan while such officials,employees or agents were acting within the scope of their office,employment or agency.
the bombing of the cole was an act of international terrorism knowingly and deliberately aided and abetted by defendant republic of the sudan.the providing to osama bin ladin of safe harbor and shelter during a period of time up to and including and to other members of al qaeda through,created liability,on the part of defendant republic of the sudan.defendant republic of the sudan provided material support and resources to some of the actual perpetrators of the bombing of the cole.the republic of sudan aided and abetted the actual perpetrators in carrying out such acts of terrorism.agents,servants or employees of the republic of the sudan knew that the acts of osama bin ladin were acts of terrorism designed to cause death or serious injury to the victims of its terrorism.agents,servants or employees of the republic of the sudan participated in the providing of the shelter to osama bin ladin and to,the perpetrators of the acts complained of herein.among the acts providing support or resources were the following a the gum arabic company,ltd,a company operating in the republic of sudan was jointly owned by the government of sudan and osama bin ladin b use of a diplomatic pouch to send explosive materials belonging to osama bin ladin for al qaeda outside the republic of sudan c the establishment of a bank primarily financed by osama bin ladin,the islamic bank in khartoum,which bank is jointly owned by the republic of the sudan d omar hassan ahmad al bashir,president of the republic of sudan,authorized the entry into the republic of sudan by al qaeda operatives and gave al qaeda special authority to avoid paying taxes and duties ordinarily due to the republic of the sudan e osama bin ladin founded,a trading company which was allowed unrestricted shipping by the sudanese government f the sudanese government allowed osama bin ladin and al qaeda to operate training camps within the republic of sudan for the purpose of training terrorists including training such people in how to manufacture bombs and explosives g the republic of sudan failed to comply with un security council resolutions,and,which were passed in,and as of april,continued to harbor various terrorist groups including but not limited to al qaeda h the sudanese government allowed al qaeda operative jamal ahmed to ship four crates of explosive from sudan to yemen,the site of the bombing of the uss cole i defendant republic of the sudan sent its minister of foreign affairs,mustafa osman ismail in may to the united states to issue a public apology for the prior harboring and assisting of terrorists including but not limited to al qaeda and osama bin ladin,which apology was aired on cspan 
the attack on october,against the cole while in a harbor in the waters of yemen was part of a plan of international terrorism directed at the united states of america and its citizens that was conceived and implemented pursuant to an international conspiracy of terrorists,usually referred to as al qaeda,which conspiracy was joined and supported by defendant republic of the sudan.al qaeda could not have existed or planned its acts of terrorism,including an act directed at an american naval vessel,without the support of state sponsors of terrorism including defendant republic of the sudan.between and defendant republic of the sudan provided shelter and a safe haven for the operations of al qaeda leader,osama bin ladin.after,defendant continued to render support and shelter to other operatives including yemeni militant terrorists who planned the attack on the cole.
commencing in,osama bin ladin and his al qaeda organization were welcomed in the republic of the sudan by the leader of the national islamic front haza al turabi and the president of the republic of the sudan,omar bashir,who provided entry to and departure from the republic of the sudan for members of al qaeda without the normal customs inspections and payment of fees to which all other persons were subjected.
id.sudan argues that these allegations do not satisfy the three jurisdictional requirements of a listed above.we therefore turn to a consideration of each.
a.the sufficiency of plaintiffs allegations of material support or resources by a state sponsor of terrorism 
sudan argues that plaintiffs allegations of material support or resources under a do not meet the statutory definition of that term.under a,
the term material support or resources means any property,tangible or intangible,or service,including currency or monetary instruments or financial securities,financial services,lodging,training,expert advice or assistance,safehouses,false documentation or identification,communications equipment,facilities,weapons,lethal substances,explosives,personnel,and transportation.
b west supp see a incorporating the definition of material support or resources from b.plaintiffs may therefore satisfy the first requirement of a by identifying conduct by sudan that falls within the meaning of any one of these listed forms of material support.because b does not define the forms of material support that are relevant in this case,we will construe each in accord with its ordinary or natural meaning.smith united states,d.in doing so,however,we also bear in mind the need to interpret statutory language in a manner that effectuates congressional intent.see united hosp,richardson,cir.with these principles in mind,we consider various forms of material support referenced in b.
sudan focused much of its argument on the parameters of the term safehouses.as we have set forth above,plaintiffs allege that sudan provided safe haven and a base of operations from which to conduct its terrorist operations.am.compl.a,c,d,e,f alleging that sudan allowed entry of operatives into sudan provided financial support to in the form of joint business ventures and relief from taxes and duties and allowed to operate terrorist training camps in sudan.sudan argues that these allegations are not sufficient to state material support under the safehouses provision because the term should be limited to discrete buildings or structures.we disagree.
the term safehouse is normally defined as a place where one may engage in secret activities or take refuge.webster ninth new collegiate dictionary.while one could certainly read the type of spatial limitations that sudan advocates into this definition,we discern nothing inherent in the normal meaning of the term that necessarily warrants those limitations.rather,it is entirely consistent with this definition to construe the statutory term to include the making available of locations within a country that serve as a base of operations for terrorists.
the underlying purpose of a,which guides our analysis,supports the more expansive construction of the term.congress adopted a to give american citizens an important economic and financial weapon against state sponsors of terrorism by allowing suits against countries responsible for terrorist acts where americans suffer injury or death,at.congress based this expansion of jurisdiction on its recognition that state sponsors of terrorism have become better at hiding their material support for their surrogates,which includes the provision of safe havens,funding,training,and the like.id.thus,the ordinary meaning of the term safehouses does not require,nor does the legislative history underlying the statute support,the restrictive interpretation of the term for which sudan argues.
moreover,the only other court to have construed comprehensively the scope of the term safehouses reached a similar conclusion.in rejecting a nearly identical argument by sudan in an action for damages arising out of bombings of the embassies in kenya and tanzania,the district court for the district of columbia held that i nsofar as the government of the republic of sudan affirmatively allowed encouraged and hizbollah to operate their terrorist enterprises within its borders,and thus provided a base of operations for the planning and execution of terrorist attacks sudan provided a safehouse within the meaning of,as incorporated in a.owens,d at.similarly,here,allegations that sudan provided with locations within the country where its members could meet,engage in business activities and operate terrorist training camps satisfy the safehouses provision of b for purposes of meeting the jurisdictional requirements of a.
in addition,plaintiffs allegations meet the financial services and transportation elements of the definition of material support as well.as explained above,we will construe each in accordance with its ordinary meaning.see smith,at.
the term financial services normally means the function of providing a service relating to finance or financiers.webster ninth new collegiate dictionary,definitions of financial and service.plaintiffs meet this definition by alleging that sudan formed a trading company and a bank with,and that it granted members of special tax and customs allowances.each of these actions on the part of sudan provided services of a financial nature to.am.compl.a,c,d.
the term transportation commonly means an act,process,or instance of conveying passengers or goods from one place to another.webster ninth new collegiate dictionary.plaintiffs meet this definition by alleging that sudan allowed to use its diplomatic pouch,authorized entry of members of into the country,allowed a company run by osama bin laden unrestricted shipping,and allowed a member of to ship explosives to yemen.am.compl.b,d,e and f.each of these alleged actions involve sudan exercise of control over the movement of passengers or goods from one place to another.
at bottom,plaintiffs allegations meet numerous elements of the definition of material support set out in b and incorporated into a.we therefore conclude that there is no basis to dismiss the amended complaint on the ground that plaintiffs allegations failed to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement of material support.
b.the sufficiency of plaintiffs allegations of the provision of material support by an official,employee or agent of sudan while acting within the scope of his or her governmental authority 
sudan further argues that plaintiffs failed to allege that a sudanese official acting within the scope of his or her governmental authority provided the alleged material support,as required by a.again,we disagree.
plaintiffs easily satisfy this requirement with their allegation that omar hassan ahmad al bashir,president of the republic of sudan,authorized the entry into the republic of sudan by operatives and gave special authority to avoid paying taxes and duties ordinarily due to sudan.am.compl.d emphasis added.at times relevant to these proceedings,president bashir was an official,employee,or agent of sudan by virtue of his elected position and the broad governmental authority he wielded under the constitution of sudan in force at the time.see generally constitution of the republic of sudan repealed,available at http.
moreover,president bashir alleged actions fell within the scope of his office,employment,or agency because each involved the exercise of the governmental authority vested in the office of president by sudan constitution.as noted above,plaintiffs allege that president bashir authorized the entry of operatives into sudan and granted those operatives special tax considerations.am.compl.d.the authority to control both immigration and taxation in sudan were constitutionally allocated to the federal government.constitution of the republic of sudan c,j,b repealed.the power of the federal government under that document was exercised by the president of sudan,along with a council of ministers who were appointed by the president.constitution of the republic of sudan,repealed.based on this governmental structure and allocation of power,we conclude that president bashir alleged actions were within the scope of his office and,therefore,that the actions set forth in the amended complaint satisfy a requirement that plaintiffs allege the provision of material support by an official of the government acting within the scope of his authority 
c.the sufficiency of plaintiffs allegations of jurisdictional causation 
sudan argues that plaintiffs failed to allege sufficient facts to draw a causal connection,for pleading purposes,between the alleged provision of material support to and the deaths caused by the bombing of the cole.for the reasons that follow,we must reject this argument as well.
section a strips a foreign state of its sovereign immunity only where damages are sought for an injury that was caused by the provision of material support or resources for certain acts of terrorism.a emphasis added.courts have interpreted this statutory language to create a jurisdictional causation requirement that a plaintiff must meet to overcome a sovereign challenge to subject matter jurisdiction under a.see kilburn socialist people libyan arab jamahiriya,owens,d at.
jurisdictional causation under a is distinct from the substantive causation element of a claim.see kilburn,at.our decision today reaches only the type of causation that a requires to overcome foreign sovereign immunity and establish subject matter jurisdiction over an action against a foreign state.to succeed in the end,the plaintiff s must go beyond jurisdiction and provide proof of causation that satisf ies a substantive cause of action.id.that a plaintiff must ultimately establish substantive causation addresses any lingering concerns that a foreign state could be exposed to damages for remote or attenuated acts of support.id.
sudan argues that plaintiffs allegations do not satisfy jurisdictional causation because they contain factual gaps that break the causal chain between sudan support of and the bombing of the cole.sudan appears to advocate the same standard for jurisdictional causation that the circuit confronted in kilburn,discussed below.see id.at.rejecting libya argument that a requires allegations that the acts of terrorism would not have occurred without its support.in practical terms,sudan position would require a plaintiff to plead sufficient facts to chart a direct and unbroken causal line between a state provision of material support and an ultimate act of terrorism.however,neither the text of the statute nor relevant authority warrants adoption of such a stringent standard for purposes of surviving a motion to dismiss.
in kilburn,the circuit interpreted the caused by language of a to require only a showing of proximate cause.at.proximate cause is normally satisfied where there is a reasonable connection between the act or omission of the defendant and the damages which the plaintiff has suffered.keeton et,prosser keeton on the law of torts ed.the circuit based its conclusion on the supreme court interpretation of identical jurisdictional language in the extension of admiralty jurisdiction act extension act,app.west supp kilburn,at citing jerome grubart,great lakes dredge dock,d.in construing the extension act in grubart,the supreme court rejected an attempt to require close temporal and spatial proximity between a harm and the action that allegedly caused it.grubart,at.instead,the court held that the concept of proximate cause provided the proper measure for jurisdictional causation.in kilburn,the circuit applied grubart analysis to reject the defendant attempt to subject jurisdictional causation under a to a standard.kilburn,at.
guided by these decisions,we agree that proximate cause is the appropriate standard to apply at this juncture.it serves simultaneously to weed out the most insubstantial cases without posing too high a hurdle to surmount at a threshold stage of the litigation.we find nothing in the relevant authority nor in the text of a to support sudan call for a more stringent standard.see kilburn,at.instead,plaintiffs must establish jurisdictional causation by alleging facts sufficient to establish a reasonable connection between a country provision of material support to a terrorist organization and the damage arising out of a terrorist attack.see kilburn,at owens,d at.
plaintiffs allegations satisf
