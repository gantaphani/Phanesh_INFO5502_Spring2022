opinion of the court 
this case involves competing rights over the pharmaceutical paroxetine hydrochloride controlled release tablets paroxetine in generic form.holds patent and fda rights to market and sell paroxetine for the treatment of depression under the brand name paxil cr as part of a settlement agreement,gsk granted mylan jointly and severally referring to mylan and mylan pharmaceuticals certain rights to produce,market,and sell generic paroxetine.then,in,gsk agreed as part of an unrelated settlement to begin supplying apotex jointly and severally referring to apotex and apotex with generic paroxetine for marketing and sale to downstream customers.mylan filed suit against gsk and apotex,claiming the agreement violated its licensing agreement with gsk,which did not permit gsk to provide its own form of generic paroxetine to another generic drug company such as apotex to be marketed and sold in direct competition with mylan.
the district court found that the terms of the gsk mylan agreement were unambiguous,and they did not limit to whom gsk was permitted to market and sell its own version of generic paroxetine.it thus held gsk did not breach its agreement by agreeing to provide apotex with generic drugs,and granted summary judgment against mylan on all claims.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the court grant of summary judgment on the cause of action against gsk,and remand for the parties to proceed to trial on that claim.we affirm its grant of summary judgment on all other claims.because the district court denied gsk motion to strike mylan expert damages report as moot on the basis of its summary judgment rulings,we will vacate that denial for reconsideration on remand 
background 
gsk mylan patent settlement license agreement 
in june,gsk sued mylan for patent infringement after mylan sought fda approval to introduce a generic version of paroxetine into the market before gsk patent had expired the parties settled the case shortly thereafter,signing a patent license and settlement agreement in august license agreement.section ii c of the license agreement granted mylan exclusive rights to market and sell generic paroxetine for the remaining life of gsk patent,nearly nine years of complete generic exclusivity.this included manufacturing,marketing,and selling mylan own generic paroxetine drug products,as well as sales rights for ag paroxetine manufactured by gsk.mylan generic rights were exclusive even as to gsk.see at quoting license agreement,section ii c.
the parties submitted to the federal trade commission ftc the license agreement,in accord with its terms and as required by federal law.see medicare prescription drug,improvement,and modernization act of,title xi,stat,codified at.in response to concerns raised by the ftc about the length and absoluteness of mylan exclusive generic rights,the parties amended the license agreement in september the second amendment the first amendment to the license agreement is irrelevant to this opinion.it provided two specific exceptions to the complete generic exclusivity provided under the license agreement.first,in the settlement of subsequent patent litigation with other companies that had filed andas for generic paroxetine,gsk was permitted to grant nonexclusive licenses as part of a settlement agreement with those third parties 
if gsk receives a third party notification and gsk initiates an action for patent infringement,gsk can enter into a settlement agreement with respect to such action at any time and mylan agrees to waive its exclusivity under section ii c in order to permit gsk under such settlement agreement to grant such third party a license under the gsk patents to sell generic paroxetine product s in the dosage form s specified in the third party anda 
at quoting second amendment,section ii e para.a the anda clause.
second,and more relevant here,gsk or a gsk affiliate was entitled to market and sell ag paroxetine beginning two years after mylan launched its generic products 
also,gsk or its affiliate may commence marketing and selling generic paroxetine hydrochloride controlled or modified release products pursuant to its paxil cr nda authorized generic products at the end of the second year after mylan launches its generic paroxetine products.
id.quoting second amendment,section ii e para.b the authorized generic clause.
the second amendment alleviated the ftc concerns.thereafter,mylan launched its generic paroxetine drug products in may.
gsk apotex antitrust litigation supply agreement 
in may,gsk settled an unrelated antitrust lawsuit brought against it by apotex.the terms of the settlement agreement provided for a million cash payment to apotex in addition,apotex was entitled to a guaranteed minimum of million to be earned through the sale of gsk products,transfers.during negotiations regarding the potential products gsk would provide for the transfers,apotex became aware that mylan i had certain licensing rights with respect to paroxetine,for which mylan paid gsk royalties,and ii was the only generic paroxetine market participant.while it refused apotex request for a copy of the license agreement due to confidentiality concerns,gsk did advise apotex that its supply obligation to mylan ended by june.see at.
the parties agreed that one of the products from which apotex would produce sales revenues would be ag paroxetine.thus,to implement the transfer arrangement,gsk and apotex subsequently entered into an exclusive supply distribution agreement for ag paroxetine s d agreement.id.apotex subsequently began sales activities for ag paroxetine,which led to the filing by mylan of this lawsuit in september.
district court proceedings 
mylan brought claims against gsk for breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and against apotex for tortious interference with and inducement to breach a contract.the crux of mylan claims was that the terms of the amended license agreement only allowed generic companies that had filed their own andas to sell generic paroxetine,and that,even after mylan exclusivity period,only gsk was permitted to engage in marketing and sales activities for ag paroxetine that were directed to downstream customers,wholesalers,retailers,pharmacy chains,mail order pharmacies,pharmacists,hospitals,clinics,and managed market companies.see mylan br.at.mylan asserted this was consistent with its position during negotiations that to allow otherwise would force it to compete against other generic companies that were not required to expend the time and resources to secure fda approval by filing an anda.mylan thus argued that gsk violated the license agreement by entering into the s d agreement and supplying apotex an intermediary drug company with ag paroxetine for marketing and sale in competition with mylan 
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of gsk and apotex.in doing so,it ruled that the authorized generic clause of the second amendment was clear and unambiguous,thus permitting gsk to market and sell ag paroxetine to whomever it wished,including apotex,after mylan period of generic exclusivity.hence the court declined to consider any of the intent evidence submitted by the parties,as well as the industry and custom evidence offered by mylan,on the ground that such evidence can not be used to create an ambiguity where none exists in order to preclude summary judgment.id.at quoting int l union,uaw skinner engine,cir.
the court thus held gsk did not violate the license agreement or,in the absence of proof of bad motive,the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.because it found no protectable contract right,the court also held mylan claims against apotex necessarily failed this meant that gsk and apotex were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all claims brought by mylan.
on appeal,mylan challenges the district court interpretation of the authorized generic clause and its consequent grant of summary judgment in favor of i gsk on mylan contractual claims,and ii apotex with respect to mylan tortious interference claim 
standard of review 
our review of the grant or denial of summary judgment is plenary,and we apply the same standard as the district court.tri m,llc sharp,cir citing ruehl viacom,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only where,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.ruehl,at quoting lexington ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in a contract interpretation action,summary judgment is appropriate only where the contractual language is unambiguous,subject to only one reasonable interpretation.see arnold diamond,gulf coast trailing,cir citations omitted.if the nonmoving party presents a reasonable alternative reading of the contract,then a question of fact as to the meaning of the contract exists which can only be resolved at trial.newport assocs.dev.travelers indem,cir citing tigg dow corning,cir landtect state mut.life assurance,cir.whether a contract is ambiguous is an issue of law subject to plenary review.sumitomo mach.alliedsignal,cir citing teamsters indus.emps.welfare fund rolls royce motor cars,cir.
under new jersey law which the parties do not dispute governs here,courts must always consider all of the relevant evidence that will assist in determining the intent and meaning of the contract when making ambiguity determinations.conway.ctr.evidence of the circumstances is always admissible in aid of the interpretation of an integrated agreement.this is so even when the contract on its face is free from ambiguity.sumitomo mach,at quoting atl.airlines,schwimmer.in aid of interpretation,courts should consider,for example,the particular contractual provision,an overview of all the terms,the circumstances leading up to the formation of the contract,custom,usage,and the interpretation placed on the disputed provision by the parties conduct.kearney pba local town of kearney.thus,courts must consider all relevant evidence to determine if any ambiguity exists and,if the contested provisions fall in that gray area,summary judgment is improper 
breach of contract 
the district court concluded that,as amended,the license agreement did not limit to whom gsk could market and sell ag paroxetine after mylan period of generic exclusivity.mylan argues there is a reasonable alternative interpretation,that the authorized generic clause only allowed gsk to market and sell ag,whereas supplying a generic competitor with ag paroxetine for marketing and sale to downstream customers was impermissible and thus the district court erred in refusing to consider the evidence offered in support of this reading.for the reasons explained below,we agree.
in support of its alternative meaning,mylan presented various forms of intent evidence first,it submitted extrinsic evidence of the license agreement negotiations,including the parties respective objectives and their actions taken to mollify the ftc concerns about mylan exclusivity amendment.mylan also offered custom and usage evidence,including expert testimony regarding industry understanding of the phrase marketing and selling.mylan pointed as well to rules of contract construction,affording meaning to the use of different words in particular,affiliate and third party and reading provisions in light of other relevant sections of the license agreement specifically the section regarding the consequences of a negative response from the ftc to support its interpretation of the authorized generic clause.
the district court needed to take into account the alternative meaning suggested by mylan,and the nature of the objective evidence offered in support of its suggested meaning,to determine whether that extrinsic evidence demonstrate d the existence of a latent ambiguity.duquesne light westinghouse,cir quoting samuel rappaport family meridian bank,internal quotation marks omitted.yet it refused to consider the extrinsic evidence submitted by mylan.new jersey law,which is expansive as to extrinsic evidence in aid of contract interpretation,requires otherwise.see conway,at permit ting a broad use of extrinsic evidence to achieve the ultimate goal of discovering the intent of the parties and to uncover the true meaning of contractual terms.the district court was not free to reject such evidence on the ground that it found the agreement on its face free from ambiguity.see atl.airlines,at 
this is especially so when the alternative reading of the contested language suggested by mylan was both reasonable and supported by objective evidence of the parties intentions.this demonstrates latent ambiguity in the contractual language.hence summary judgment was not appropriate on mylan cause of action.the construction of a written contract is usually a legal question for the court,but where there is uncertainty,ambiguity or the need for parol evidence in aid of interpretation,then the doubtful provision should be left to the jury.schor fms fin.the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of gsk on mylan cause of action is therefore reversed and remanded for that claim to proceed to trial 
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
the district court identified two grounds on which mylan breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim failed.first,to the extent mylan cause of action was based on on its right to preclude generic companies from selling ag paroxetine,the court rejected the claim because it had already determined the contract language unambiguously did not give mylan that right.given our holding with respect to the contract claim,this reasoning is without continuing force.
the court also found,however,that mylan had failed to prove that gsk acted with the requisite bad motive or intent when entering into the s d agreement with apotex.see wilson amerada hess,requiring that a party have acted with the objective of preventing the other party from receiving its reasonably expected fruits under the contract to establish a breach of the implied covenant.mylan retorts that bad motive turns on the parties intentions,and thus is a question for the jury,citing seidenberg summit bank.however,seidenberg reference to the trier of fact was meant to illustrate that defining bad faith is unrealistic,not to relieve a party of its obligation to set out sufficient evidence of bad intention,to demonstrate an issue of material fact in order to survive a motion for summary judgment.id.concluding it best to entrust the drawing of the bad faith line to trial judges and juries but admonishing against an unduly expansive version of bad faith.
while the s d agreement arguably frustrated expected profits of mylan from sales of its generic products by introducing a direct competitor,it has not produced any evidence that gsk entered into that subsequent agreement with bad faith or improper motive.see id.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on mylan good faith and fair dealing claim.
tortious interference with a contract 
as to the alleged tortious interference of contract by apotex,the district court again rested its dismissal of this claim on its conclusion that mylan had no protectable right to prevent third parties from selling ag paroxetine after its period of exclusivity.with that absence,mylan failed to make the threshold showing of an existing or prospective contractual relationship required for a tortious interference claim.see,velop,kaplan,citing printing mart morristown sharp elecs,per curiam.given our determination that mylan arguably had a protectable contract right,we can not conclude that was a proper ground to conclude apotex was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this claim.
summary judgment was nonetheless appropriate here.under new jersey law,a plaintiff must demonstrate interference with a contractual relationship that is knowing,intentional,and wrongful.see lightening lube,witco,cir citing fineman armstrong world,cir printing mart morristown,at.mylan falls short of establishing that interference here.
as an initial matter,the record does not suggest that apotex had knowledge of mylan asserted contractual right to preclude other generic pharmaceutical companies from marketing and selling ag
