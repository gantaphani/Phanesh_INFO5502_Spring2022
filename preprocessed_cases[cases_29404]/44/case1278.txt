opinion of the court 
plaintiff donald benn,who had been a probation and parole officer for the first judicial district of pennsylvania judicial district brought suit against his former employer alleging violations of title i of the americans with disabilities act ada,et.the district court,by order dated september,granted summary judgment to the judicial district.the district court held that the judicial district is a state agency and therefore is entitled to eleventh amendment immunity,a holding benn vehemently opposes.the judicial district states that t he present case is an opportunity for this court to finally issue a published precedent which holds that state courts have eleventh amendment immunity,in order to guide district courts and to quell repeated and unnecessary litigation of this issue.appellee br.at.
we will proceed to consider that issue.before we do so we must consider the judicial district contention that benn appeal was untimely.
benn was employed by the judicial district as a probation and parole officer from until.throughout most of that period he was engaged in clerical and administrative tasks.in,he was transferred to work in the enforcement unit and was appointed a special deputy by the united states marshals office.it is apparent from the record that benn was not pleased by the transfer.as his brief recites,in the new position he had to wear a firearm and a vest,use handcuffs,and locate and apprehend dangerous criminals.in his complaint,benn alleges that he was not mentally suited for this position and,shortly after his transfer,began experiencing anxiety and stress.app.at.he allegedly suffered shock after seeing a assaulted.in october,he was accidentally struck by a car after seeing a probation violator on the street.he took leave from work for the next eight months,citing physical injuries from the accident,shock disorder,and chronic depression.benn alleges that the judicial district refused to offer any accommodation for his stress disorder,and that he was wrongfully terminated.
benn filed a formal charge with the eeoc and received a right to sue letter on august.he filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania on october,claiming not only discrimination and retaliation in violation of the ada but also violations of state law by the judicial district,the city of philadelphia,and the board of pensions and retirement municipal pension fund of the city of philadelphia board of pensions after some activity in the district court,the judicial district filed a motion for summary judgment on september,on the ground of its entitlement to eleventh amendment immunity.that motion was granted by order of the district court dated september,and entered on the docket on september.
the jurisdiction issue 
on the same day that the district court entered the summary judgment order,september,it also entered an order dismissing without prejudice defendant board of pensions and defendant city of philadelphia.it is the coincidence of two orders on the same day in the same case that gives rise to the judicial district argument that we lack jurisdiction to consider the case because benn did not file a proper,timely notice of appeal.
rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure requires that a notice of appeal designate the judgment,order,or part thereof being appealed.fed.c b.rule requires that the notice be filed within days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.fed.a a.
benn filed a notice of appeal dated october,that reads,in full 
notice is hereby given that plaintiff donald benn by and through his undersigned counsel hereby appeals to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit from the order of the honorable eduardo robreno,entered in the above captioned proceeding on the day of september.
pl.notice of appeal emphasis added.
when benn filed the october notice,which was admittedly timely,he mistakenly attached a copy of the order dismissing the claims against the board of pensions and the city of philadelphia,rather than a copy of the order entering summary judgment in favor of the judicial district.when benn recognized his mistake,he filed another notice of appeal dated october which was intended to clarify that i t was his intention to appeal the order of september,issued regarding the judicial district.pl.amended notice of appeal emphasis added.if we regard the october,notice of appeal as the operative notice,the judicial district would be correct that the appeal was untimely because filed outside the period prescribed by rule.
compliance with the rules of appellate procedure for proper filing of a notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional.lusardi xerox,cir.a court may not waive the jurisdictional requirements of rules and,even for good cause shown under rule.torres oakland scavenger,d.benn argues that,because the rules do not require an attachment of the order that is the subject of the appeal,we may and should disregard the copy of the incorrect order that he attached to the october notice.we approach the issue somewhat differently.
in shea smith,cir,this court stated that we liberally construe the requirements of rule.moreover,the supreme court has stated that even if a notice does not meet the letter of rule,there is appellate jurisdiction if the appellant has filed a functional equivalent of a proper notice.torres,at.see also shea,at.
although we have not previously been presented with a case precisely like this one,where the ambiguity in the notice of appeal arises from the district court issuance of two orders on the same day,we have sustained our jurisdiction in cases where the appellant notice of appeal implicated two different orders in the same action and failed to specify the correct order appealed.see,shea,involving notice of appeal specifying order granting summary judgment in favor of two defendants,when appeal was actually also intended from prior order granting summary judgment in favor of a third defendant ctc imports exports nigerian petroleum,cir involving notice of appeal specifying order granting summary judgment in favor of another party in the case,when appeal was actually intended from prior order imposing sanctions on appellant gooding,cir involving notice of appeal specifying order granting summary judgment on one claim,when appeal was actually also intended from prior order dismissing another claim in the case.for all intents and purposes,the defect in benn october notice was a failure to specify the correct order that was being appealed.
we have held that a notice may be construed as bringing up an unspecified order for review if it appears from the notice of appeal itself and the subsequent proceedings on appeal that the appeal was intended to have been taken from the unspecified judgment,order,or part thereof.see elfman motors,chrysler,cir citing foman davis,d.to determine whether appellate jurisdiction vests over an order that is not specified in the notice of appeal,we consider in particular whether there is a connection between the specified and unspecified orders,whether the intention to appeal the unspecified order is apparent,whether the opposing party was prejudiced by the appellant failure to specify the correct order,and whether the opposing party has had a full opportunity to brief the issues.shea,at citing williams guzzardi,cir.
in benn case,treating the order attached to the complaint as the specified order and the order benn sought to appeal as the unspecified order,it is apparent that both orders were connected in that they were dispositive of the same case and issued on the same day,albeit as to different parties.the judicial district had notice of benn intention to appeal the grant of summary judgment in a telephone conference held with the district court on september,the day on which the relevant orders were issued.indeed,the judicial district does not dispute that it had notice of benn intention to appeal the grant of summary judgment,nor does it argue that it was in any way prejudiced by the defective october notice.nor could it so argue realistically,as benn mistake was caught and corrected in tim
