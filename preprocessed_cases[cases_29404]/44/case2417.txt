deputy sheriff marty dunn appeals the district court denial of his motion for summary judgment based on the defense of qualified immunity.on april,dunn shot and killed glen smith,an arrestee who had gained control of dunn police cruiser.the district court denied dunn qualified immunity.because smith right not to be seized by deadly force when fleeing arrest was clearly established at the time he was killed,we affirm the district court denial of summary judgment.
on april,deputy sheriff marty dunn was on patrol in north hamilton county,tennessee.during his shift,dunn responded to a report of harassing telephone calls being received at the home of janice quarles,the mother of cheri smith.cheri smith was living with quarles at the time because she was separated from her husband,the decedent glen smith.dunn spoke with quarles about the calls and left.
later in his shift,dunn coincidentally observed glen smith driving erratically.dunn initiated a traffic stop and had smith perform several field sobriety tests.although dunn believed that smith had been drinking,he came to the conclusion that smith was not so impaired as to justify an arrest.consequently,dunn suggested that smith find a friend to pick him up,and smith left his car in the parking lot of an adjacent mcdonald restaurant.
later that evening,dunn responded to another report from quarles home concerning harassing telephone calls.in this second encounter,quarles told dunn that some of the calls had been recorded by the answering machine,and that she recognized smith voice and heard the name dustin in the background.dunn listened to some of these recordings and heard someone in the background refer to an item being smothered and covered,an apparent reference to a method of hash brown preparation at waffle house restaurants.the calls continued in dunn presence,with dunn answering a few of the calls and identifying himself as a police officer.
dunn left quarles home and went by the mcdonald parking lot where he had left smith earlier.dunn observed that smith car was still in the lot however,the car had been moved to a different spot,and dunn saw a man that looked like smith get into another car parked nearby.dunn approached the second vehicle and spotted smith in the backseat.dunn questioned the driver of the vehicle,kate smith smith sister,and another passenger,dustin craig,and these persons indicated that glen smith had used craig cell phone to make several calls from a waffle house restaurant.at this point,dunn proceeded to arrest smith for making harassing telephone calls in dunn presence.
pursuant to the arrest,dunn advised smith of his miranda rights,cuffed smith hands behind his back,the handcuffs,put smith in the back seat of dunn police cruiser,and secured the seat belt around smith.additionally,dunn patted smith down to be sure that he did not have any weapons or other contraband.dunn also called for a tow truck to pick up smith car.during this period of time,smith was cooperative with officer dunn.however,dunn did believe smith to be somewhat impaired.dunn left the engine running to provide air conditioning.unfortunately,dunn police cruiser was not equipped with a security partition separating the front seat from the back seat.when dunn left the vehicle to talk to the tow truck driver,named richard rutherford,smith climbed into the front seat and took control of dunn cruiser.the facts from this point forward are heavily disputed.the supreme court and this court have repeatedly held,however,that a defendant,entitled to invoke a qualified immunity defense,may not appeal a district court summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial.johnson jones,d see also carter city of detroit,cir.accordingly,although we note the presence of disputes,we take the facts in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs,the family of glen smith.the district court carefully set out the differing versions of events leading to smith death.
w hen the wrecker arrived dunn got out of the patrol car to speak to its driver,richard rutherford,and fill out the necessary paperwork to have smith vehicle towed.during this time,smith was left unsupervised in the patrol car with the engine running and the keys in the ignition.
as they were going about the business of preparing smith car to be towed,both dunn and rutherford claim they heard the patrol car being placed into gear and turned to see smith had made his way into the front seat and was now behind the wheel of the vehicle.because dunn had left the dome light in the patrol car on,dunn claims he was able to clearly see smith looking directly at him while rutherford claims he could see smith in the driver seat turning the steering wheel.dunn asserts he heard tires squealing and the sound of hard acceleration.rutherford does not believe the patrol car went into a pe e l out,but does confirm smith floorboarded the accelerator.
rutherford states his immediate reaction was to move backwards and around to the front of smith vehicle while dunn claims he rutherford ran in the opposite direction towards the mcdonald restaurant.rutherford asserts dunn ran towards the moving patrol car with his firearm drawn and recalls thinking he was fixing to watch officer dunn get run over.rutherford claims smith was turning the patrol car to the left,but stated he was not sure whether smith swerve to the left was for the purpose of redirecting the car at dunn or following the roadway around the building and presumably out of the parking lot.dunn claims he and rutherford were standing not more than a vehicle length from the patrol car original position and that smith was clearly trying to run him and rutherford over rather than attempting to leave the parking lot.
dunn claims smith rapidly accelerated directly at him and rutherford and,fearing for his life and that of rutherford,he drew his gun and fired four times in rapid succession at smith.according to dunn,three of the shots hit the car,the fourth hit smith above the left ear,and the patrol car shot past officer dunn barely missing him and ran off the parking lot and collided with a tree.plaintiffs,however,contend dunn was not acting in and fired at least the final,fatal shot after the car had passed by dunn.plaintiffs claim the fatal shot entered through the driver side window of the patrol car and struck smith in the ear.for his part,rutherford recalls dunn firing three or four shots in rapid succession from a position near the lane as the vehicle was going by him.dunn appears to concede that he fired while the patrol car was passing him,but claims he did so while jumping out of the direct path of the vehicle.rutherford did indicate dunn was moving out of the way of the passing patrol car as he fired and,at least at one point,rutherford believed dunn had actually been hit by the vehicle.
smith cupp,slip op.at.
in short,dunn essentially argues that smith directed the cruiser at him and rutherford,or at least dunn perceived the events in this manner,and that he shot smith in as the cruiser was bearing down on them.dunn continues to argue this version of facts on appeal.the plaintiffs,on the other hand,describe a scene where smith was merely trying to flee in the cruiser and dunn purposefully shot smith under circumstances of no threat to dunn or others.in addition to the testimony of rutherford and dunn described above,the plaintiffs point to the autopsy report as proof that all of the shots were fired either after the cruiser had passed dunn or,at the very earliest,while the cruiser was passing dunn with the officer on the of the vehicle.the autopsy report described the path of the fatal gunshot the bullet entered into the left ear,direction left to right,slightly back to front,and downward,passing through the left ear emphasis added.finally,the plaintiffs provided evidence that dunn lied when describing his overall description of events.another officer responding to the scene reported that dunn stated immediately after the shooting that smith had gone for dunn gun.this statement has essentially been shown to be a lie,as dunn stated in deposition that smith was left sitting in the police cruiser with the windows rolled up,and dunn has since abandoned any argument that his actions were motivated by an alleged attempt by smith to go for his gun 
on april,smith minor children and widow filed suit against sheriff john cupp and deputy sheriff dunn,both individually and in their official capacities,pursuant to.the claims against dunn included the wrongful deprivation of smith liberty,the use of excessive and unreasonable force in shooting smith,and the deliberate indifference to smith safety and welfare based on the lack of a security partition in dunn police cruiser.following discovery,dunn moved for summary judgment on all of the plaintiffs claims,asserting the defense of qualified immunity and arguing that the plaintiffs could not present a prima facie case to support the claims against dunn.dunn argued in his memorandum in support that his actions were objectively reasonable because smith constitutional rights were not violated and it can not be said that marty dunn would have been aware that his actions,which constituted,violated glen smith constitutional rights.on april,the district court granted the defendants motions for summary judgment on all of the plaintiffs claims except the claim that dunn used excessive force in seizing smith.as to the plaintiffs excessive force claim against dunn and dunn motion based on qualified immunity,the district court first held that a reasonable jury could find that dunn use of deadly force was constitutionally unjustifiable.the court next held that if the jury accepted the plaintiffs version of the facts,it could find that a reasonable officer would have known that the use of deadly force was unconstitutional.the district court therefore held that because genuine issues of material fact remained,dunn was not entitled to qualified immunity,and the court accordingly denied his motion for summary judgment on the excessive force claim.
on may,dunn filed a motion to supplement the record and to request that the district court reconsider its order denying dunn motion for summary judgment.anticipating that dunn would file an interlocutory appeal on the excessive force claim,the plaintiffs sought certification for an immediate appeal with respect to the district court dismissal of the plaintiffs deliberate indifference claims.on may,while these motions were pending,dunn filed a notice of appeal to this court.the district court ultimately denied the plaintiffs motion to certify,granted dunn motion to supplement the record,and denied dunn motion for reconsideration.this appeal followed.
jurisdiction 
this court has jurisdiction to hear dunn appeal notwithstanding his failure to purposes of this interlocutory facts that are favorable to the plaintiff.it is clear that this court is without jurisdiction to review any argument that depends upon a dispute of facts.a defendant who is denied qualified immunity may file an interlocutory appeal with this court only if that appeal involves the abstract or pure legal issue of whether the facts alleged by the plaintiff constitute a violation of clearly established constitutional law.berryman rieger,cir.dunn argument concerning whether there is a dispute of facts,however,is only one of the arguments presented in his brief.dunn also argues that the district court misapplied saucier katz,d,by failing to consider whether the right dunn was alleged to have violated was clearly established.see appellant br.at.in this regard,dunn states that the district court found what it considered to be questions of fact on the first part of the saucier test and granted summary judgment,but that the district court failed to ask whether the right is clearly established by considering whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.id.at quoting saucier,at.
dunn has therefore made two main arguments and this court has jurisdiction to hear dunn purely legal argument.if,aside from the impermissible arguments regarding disputes of fact,the defendant also raises the purely legal question of whether the facts alleged support a claim of violation of clearly established law,then there is an issue over which this court has jurisdiction.therefore,this court can ignore the defendant attempts to dispute the facts and nonetheless resolve the legal issue,obviating the need to dismiss the entire appeal for lack of jurisdiction.carter city of detroit,cir quoting berryman,at internal quotation omitted see also phelps coy,cir where the legal issues are discrete from the factual disputes,we may exercise our jurisdiction to resolve the legal issues only.fultz whittaker,cir,recognizing that exercise of appellate jurisdiction would be proper over issue of law even if that issue was presented only as an alternative to an argument concerning the facts.
the supreme court has found no error in this approach.in johnson,the petitioners argued that it was unworkable for the court to decide that issues of law were immediately appealable but not issues of disputed fact.the argument was that a defendant could easily tack on a reviewable claim to an unreviewable claim and thus gain review.johnson,at.the court addressed this concern not by saying that jurisdiction would be lacking over the entire appeal,but rather by expressing confidence in the courts of appeals ability to determine when it would be inappropriate to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction over the factual dispute.id.the supreme court analysis clearly contemplates that an appellate court would have jurisdiction over the issue of law even when paired with an issue of disputed fact,or there would otherwise be no way for even the possibility of pendent appellate jurisdiction to arise.furthermore,in response to the petitioners next argument that if appellate courts try to separate an appealed order reviewable determination that a given set of facts violates clearly established law from its unreviewable determination that an issue of fact is genuine,they will have great difficulty doing so,id.at,the court again indicated that the courts of appeals could distinguish between the two.in such a situation,the court held,the court of appeals can simply take,as given,the facts that the district court assumed when it denied summary judgment for that purely legal reason.id.therefore,dunn decision to argue an unreviewable issue of disputed fact does not impair our jurisdiction over the legal issue presented following johnson,we simply take,as given,the facts that the district court assumed when it denied summary judgment.id.
qualified immunity 
the district properly denied dunn motion for summary judgment based on the defense of qualified immunity.the issue is close,given the very short period of time in which dunn had to react.however,the facts,taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,demonstrate that dunn use of deadly force violated smith constitutional rights.the particular right at issue was clearly established.thus,dunn is not entitled to qualified immunity.
the united states supreme court has mandated the use of the following analysis when ruling on a defendant claim of qualified immunity.see saucier katz,d.t he first inquiry must be whether a constitutional right would have been violated on the facts alleged second,assuming the violation is established,the question whether the right was clearly established must be considered id.at.the answer to both inquiries is yes.
constitutional violation 
the plaintiffs have put forward sufficient evidence to show that dunn actions violated smith constitutional rights.according to the plaintiffs evidence,dunn shot smith after the police cruiser was past dunn and there was no immediate danger to anyone in the vicinity.dunn use of force was made even more unreasonable by the fact that smith had been cooperative up to this point,and was arrested for the nonviolent offence of making harassing phone calls.although there was some danger to the public from smith driving off in a stolen police car,the danger presented by smith was not so grave as to justify the use of deadly force.
