the appellants in this tort action profess disappointment with the jury verdict and invite us to order a new trial.finding their disappointment understandable but their arguments unpersuasive,we decline the invitation.
background 
the facts are straightforward.on february,beverly correia and john carvalho were passengers in a car heading eastbound on route in seekonk,massachusetts.the driver,russell machado,was proceeding in the far lane of a divided highway.at the same time and place,roderick davol,a firefighter,was driving a fire engine owned by the city of east providence,rhode island the city.although seekonk and east providence repose in separate states,they are contiguous communities.
davol was responding to an accident that had occurred in east providence.to reach the scene of the accident,he needed to make a and access the westbound lanes of route.as he attempted to guide the fire engine through that maneuver,it collided with machado vehicle.the crash occurred in broad daylight.
there is considerable dispute about the etiology of the collision.according to davol,the fire truck was traveling in the far lane in front of machado car with its siren blaring.as he approached an emergency vehicle turnaround in the median strip,he slowed the truck,swung to the right straddling the far left and center lanes in order to execute the wide left turn,and activated the directional signal.the appellants tell a different tale.they maintain that the fire engine was fully in the center lane all along and veered to the left without activating either its siren or blinker lights.
the parties agree that machado car which was trying to pass on the left collided with the fire truck which was trying to enter the turnaround.both vehicles were badly damaged and the appellants sustained severe injuries.
relying on diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount,a,the appellants brought suit against the city,the city treasurer as an official capacity defendant,and davol in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.the city retorted by filing a complaint against machado for the cost of repairing the fire engine.
for the most part,pretrial proceedings were uneventful.we mention only one aspect.the district court set the case for trial in december of.on november,the appellants asked the court to postpone the trial for three months,expressing concern that the jury would be prejudiced in favor of a due to the publicity surrounding the events of september,and the sentiment engendered by those events the district court denied the motion.
as matters turned out,the court subsequently delayed the trial for a few weeks in hopes of achieving a settlement.negotiations proved fruitless and a trial commenced on january.the district court submitted a verdict sheet to the jury that incorporated several special interrogatories.these questions addressed both the appellants personal injury claims and the city property damage claim.in connection with the former,the jury returned a verdict.in connection with the latter,the jury apportioned negligence to machado and to davol,and awarded the city.the district court entered judgment for the defendants on the verdict and for the city on the property damage award albeit in a modified amount 
the appellants filed a timely motion for a new trial.the verdict,they said,confirmed their fears about the ripple effect of the september tragedy,contravened both the law and the weight of the evidence,and highlighted an irreconcilable inconsistency in the jury answers to the special questions.the district court rebuffed this asseverational array in a thoughtful rescript.see carvalho fitzgerald,d.this appeal followed.
in this venue,the appellants assign error to i the lower court denial of their motion for a continuance,and ii the court denial of their motion for a new trial.we address these claims sequentially.
denial of the continuance 
the appellants argue that the widespread publicity about the cataclysmic events of september and the consequent outpouring of emotion negated the jury ability to render an impartial verdict and that,therefore,the district court blundered in failing to postpone the trial.we review a district court denial of a motion to continue for abuse of discretion.macaulay anas,cir.this makes sense because even the most scrupulous study of an algid appellate record can not put the reader on an equal footing with the trial judge,who has gained knowledge of the nuances of a particular case.given this deferential standard of review,we will not deem the denial of a continuance erroneous unless our canvass of the record indicates that the trial court indulged a serious error of law or suffered a meaningful lapse of judgment,resulting in substantial prejudice to the movant.united states saccoccia,cir.
here,the appellants core contention is that the district court grossly underestimated the prejudicial effects of the shock waves surrounding the september tragedy.the lower court rejected this contention both before trial and in its opinion.on the later occasion,it explained that the jury most likely shared in the respect that fire fighters have earned from those for whom they risk their lives,but that the appellants nonetheless received a fair trial.carvalho,d at.
we note at the outset that the appellants argument is an unusual one.typically,a motion for a continuance on the ground of pretrial publicity involves publicity directly related to the litigants or the matters at issue in the litigation.see,united states moreno morales,cir delaney united states,cir.here,however,the allegedly prejudicial publicity is exogenous in the sense that it bears no direct connection to either the litigants or the litigation.while publicity of this sort occasionally may necessitate postponement of a trial,we suspect that such occasions will be rare.
in all events,the appellants argument depends upon the notion that the events of september so exalted first responders that,for many months thereafter,no one who sat across a courtroom from a police officer or a firefighter could get a fair shake.we think that argument underestimates a trial court ability to cope with public sentiment.the best way to ensure that jurors do not harbor biases for or against the parties is for the trial court to conduct a thorough voir dire examination.see patton yount,d v oir dire has long been recognized as an effective method of rooting out such bias,especially when conducted in a careful and thoroughgoing manner.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.assuming that venirepersons pass through this screen,the trial court thereafter may operate on the presumption that the chosen jurors will obey the judge instructions to put extraneous matters aside and decide each case on its merits.see richardson marsh,d blake pellegrino,cir.while the presumption that jurors follow the court instructions is rebuttable,rebutting it takes more than empty rhetoric.
in this case,the appellants have wholly failed to rebut the presumption.to warrant a continuance on the ground of potential jury contamination,the appellants had to do more than show that the jurors were exposed to pervasive and potentially influential news accounts.they had to carry the added burden of demonstrating that the exposure was likely to result in unfair prejudice.united states,cir moreno morales,at.the requisite prejudice can be shown either directly say,by proof of actual bias among the seated jurors or indirectly say,by inferences arising out of circumstantial evidence.see moreno morales,at.
the appellants have not shown any cognizable prejudice here.the district court conducted a thorough voir dire.it queried all the potential jurors about their biases firefighters and excused the one juror who expressed such a bias the juror in question had a son who was a firefighter.the appellants counsel neither sought to have the court augment its inquiry nor suggested any other questions that might usefully be posed.the questioning did not reveal anything even remotely indicating actual bias on the part of any seated juror.
by like token,the circumstantial evidence falls far short of what would be needed to raise a presumption of prejudice.the fact that only one member of the venire had to be excused because of a bias is itself telling.see murphy florida,d.and to cinch matters,the district court instructed the jurors,both at the commencement of the trial and in the charge,to decide the case based strictly and solely on the evidence.the court language was firm and pointed.there is nothing in the record before us that casts doubt upon the presumption that the jurors followed these instructions.
the short of it is that the district court handled this issue with great sensitivity.the careful voir dire examination,the clear instructions,and the absence of any evidentiary basis for a finding of prejudice speak volumes.those features impel us to hold that the court acted well within the realm of its discretion in denying the requested continuance.united states capelton,cir rejecting defendants claim that jury could not dispassionately evaluate police testimony and upholding denial of mistrial motion in trial commenced prior to the events of september and concluded thereafter.
denial of a new trial 
we turn now to the appellants motion for a new trial.that motion implored the lower court to nullify the verdict as i contrary to law,ii against the weight of the evidence,and iii based upon irreconcilably inconsistent answers to the special questions that were incorporated into the verdict sheet.the district court rejected these importunings,and so do we.
we pause first to make a procedural point.the parties have briefed this case as if state law here,the law of massachusetts describes the appropriate standard for granting a new trial in a diversity action,and the district court acquiesced in this view.see carvalho,d at citing turnpike motors,newbury group.we do not agree.
federal courts sitting in diversity apply state substantive law and federal procedural rules.hanna plumer,d dichner liberty travel,cir.classifying a particular matter as substantive or procedural can sometimes be a challenging endeavor.see,hanna,at.guaranty trust york.but classification is generally a straightforward exercise when a federal rule of civil procedure covers the point.see gasperini ctr.for humanities,d burlington woods,d.
this is such a case.the granting or denial of a motion for a new trial is a procedural matter governed by a directly applicable federal rule.a.see charles wright et,federal practice procedure,at ed.supp james moore et,moore federal practice,at.ed.we consistently have looked to federal law for the standard for deciding new trial motions in diversity cases,see,am.airlines,cir putnam res.pateman,cir,and state practice generally has no place in that endeavor 
we deem it worthwhile to clarify this procedural point even though it has no practical implications here.when a trial court applies an incorrect legal standard to a motion for a new trial,one possible course of action is to remand for reconsideration.see,wagner fair acres geriatric,cir.that course is unnecessary in this case because the federal and massachusetts standards for granting or denying a new trial are identical in all relevant respects.compare,wagenmann adams,cir,with,turnpike motors,at.we therefore proceed with our assessment of the district court decision.
our starting point is the standard of review.we will overturn the denial of a motion for a new trial only for abuse of discretion.milone moceri family,cir hubbard faros fisheries,cir.a mistake of law is,of course,tantamount to an abuse of discretion,cir.
the appellants initial argument is that the jury verdict flouts the applicable law.this is a somewhat convoluted argument and must be placed into workable perspective.
the jury verdict was underpinned by its answers to special questions.in response to question,the jury declared that davol had been negligent while turning his fire truck into the route crossover.in response to question,it declared that davol negligence was not a substantial or proximate cause of the appellants injur ies and damages.the appellants concede that negligence was an open question appropriate for jury consideration.they argue,however,that once the jurors found davol negligent,they were legally obliged to find that his negligence proximately caused their injuries and damages.
the appellants cobble together this theory out of a series of stipulations entered into among the parties in connection with the authentication and admissibility of various medical bills and reports.the operative language of each stipulation identified the bills and reports as relating to treatment for injuries sustained as a result of the motor vehicle accident of february.the appellants construe this language as a legally binding admission of proximate cause.this interpretation elevates hope over reason.
determinations as to a stipulation meaning and legal effect are determinations of law,and,thus,engender de novo review.gómez rivera rodríguez,cir.courts should construe stipulations in accordance with accepted principles of general contract law.id.context can often decretory significance.see,newport plaza assocs.durfee attleboro bank in re newport plaza assocs,cir.
in this instance,the trial court read the stipulations as falling well short of an admission of proximate cause and charged the jurors that causation was for them to determine.this was undeniably correct.fairly read,the stipulations conceded that the appellants had suffered injuries in the collision and had incurred reasonable hospital and medical expenses in an effort to cure and relieve those injuries.the stipulations also admitted that the injuries and damages flowed from the not that anyone negligence caused the accident.because nothing in the stipulations even remotely approaches a concession of causation the occurrence of the accident,the stipulations supply no basis for overturning the verdict.
the appellants next contend that the jury answer to question was against the weight of the evidence.they hammer the version of the accident that they espoused to the jury and note that their accident reconstructionist,one mcnally,opined that davol turning maneuver was the primary cause of the collision.they also excoriate the district court rejection of their claim.
this line of argument does not hold water.a party challenging a trial court determination that a verdict did not contradict the weight of the evidence faces a steep uphill climb.the challenger must show that the evidence so far preponderates against the verdict that upholding it will perpetuate a manifest miscarriage of justice.putnam,at wagenmann,at.
the appellants effort to carry this burden fails their brief does not present a balanced view of the facts,but,rather,insupportably discounts and,to some extent,blithely overlooks the evidence favorable to the verdict.taken as a whole,the proof in this case was not.it could well have led rational minds to differ as to the issue of causation.see carvalho,d at highlighting permissible inferences from the evidence that supported the jury verdict.
if more were we doubt that it appellants argument succumbs to the law of the case.the lower court instructions laid out the ground rules.the court told the jurors,without objection,that returning a verdict for the appellants required them to find not only that davol breached an actionable duty,that he was negligent but also that this negligence was a proximate cause of the accident.the court instructions included the following explanation 
proximate cause is defined as any cause which in a natural and continuous sequence,unburdened by any intervening cause,produces the injury complained of and without which the injurious result would not have occurred.in plainer english,a defendant negligent conduct is the proximate cause of harm to another if his conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about that harm.emphasis supplied.
question reflected the substance of this instruction was fireman davol negligence a substantial or proximate cause of injur ies and damages to the appellants 
both the instruction and the question jibe with substantive principles of massachusetts law.see,jorgensen.por
