this is a civil suit seeking damages against police officers for illegally and with excessive force arresting plaintiffs rubens mesa and julieta tarazona.this appeal concerns the summary judgment granted in favor of one of the officers on the basis of qualified immunity.we affirm as to the claims brought by mesa but reverse and remand in part the claims brought by tarazona.
facts and procedural background 
the plaintiffs rubens mesa and julieta tarazona are married and own guama restaurant and bar in lafayette,louisiana.in the hours of april,one of the defendants,lafayette police officer dwayne prejean,was on duty patrolling an area near downtown where guama and many other bars were located.patrons were in the businesses and on the sidewalks.officer prejean visited a few establishments to have owners move tables and chairs that were obstructing sidewalks in a manner that he believed to be violating state statute and local ordinance.
after stopping at guama,officer prejean walked across the street to another business.there,he arrested tyler guilbeau for disturbing the peace due to intoxication.officer prejean placed guilbeau inside his police car and then stood next to the car while preparing paperwork on the arrest.mesa approached prejean while he was writing in order to discuss the tables and chairs on the sidewalk and to inquire about or object to guilbeau arrest.
officer prejean instructed mesa to wait on the sidewalk.mesa walked across the street to the opposite sidewalk.tarazona arrived and heard mesa version of events.tarazona and guilbeau girlfriend,an employee of guama,both walked over to officer prejean mesa remained on the sidewalk.officer prejean testified that when tarazona first approached,he had already arrested guilbeau and was in the process of writing up a misdemeanor summons to give to guilbeau before releasing him.tarazona asked officer prejean why guilbeau was being arrested and about prejean earlier demand that guama chairs and tables be moved off the sidewalk.
at this point,the facts diverge as to officer prejean initial response to tarazona.officer prejean testified that he gave at least three clear orders for tarazona to remove herself from the street.tarazona asserts that officer prejean gave directions only twice.moreover,the first was not an imperative command but an invitation to discuss the matter of the tables and chairs when he finished processing guilbeau.despite these assertions about the lack of urgency of officer prejean initial directive,tarazona deposition testimony confirms that officer prejean told her twice to get out of the street and move on,and she did not immediately comply with his initial directive.there is evidence,though disputed,that tarazona crossed the street to the opposite sidewalk after the second request.
upon reaching the sidewalk,tarazona turned back toward officer prejean and made some comments in his direction.officer prejean testified that tarazona began yelling again about the media and she going to call the governor and have my job.tarazona testified that she made a comment to the following effect if you did have that badge you would be treating me like that.after tarazona made her comments,officer prejean immediately informed her that she was under arrest and started toward her.
when officer prejean approached tarazona to place her under arrest,mesa moved toward him in what officer prejean described as an aggressive manner.at least two officers became involved physically with mesa while detaining him.as a result,mesa was bleeding and was taken to the hospital for examination.while mesa was being restrained,officer prejean placed his hand on tarazona shoulder near her upper back and neck because he had already used his handcuffs on guilbeau.tarazona perceived the presence of officer prejean hand as a requirement for her to kneel,and tarazona knelt down.tarazona testified that,while she thought this manner of arrest was unusual,officer prejean did not force her to the ground or otherwise inflict physical harm upon her.still,she complains that she was injured by officer prejean forcing her to watch the other officers beat her husband,mesa.tarazona was approximately eight feet away from the incident between mesa and the other officers.less than one minute passed between tarazona comments to officer prejean and the point at which both she and mesa were detained.
tarazona was charged with disturbing the peace by intoxication and with remaining after forbidden.mesa was charged with resisting an officer,battery of an officer,obstruction of a public passage,and disturbing the peace by intoxication.after a trial,a municipal court judge held that mesa and tarazona were not guilty of the charges.
following the acquittals,mesa and tarazona brought this suit for violation of constitutional rights under and under louisiana law for false arrest,false imprisonment,use of excessive force,defamation,and malicious prosecution.
officer prejean filed a motion for summary judgment,seeking dismissal of all of the claims brought against him.the district court granted the motion on the basis of qualified immunity.the court denied summary judgment motions by the other defendant officers.the city of lafayette received a partial summary judgment for matters related to prosecutorial immunity.
the court entered a rule b judgment certifying the finality of the order favoring officer prejean.mesa and tarazona appeal from that judgment.
ii.discussion 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo and evaluates the evidence as the district court would.xl specialty ins.kiewit offshore,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.the issue of qualified immunity is a question of law,but in certain circumstances where there remain disputed issues of material fact relative to immunity,the jury,properly instructed,may decide the question.presley city of benbrook,cir.
when an officer argues that he is entitled to qualified immunity from suit,we first view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury and decide if the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right.saucier katz,d.if that view reveals no constitutional violation,there is no claim.however,if a violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties submissions,the next,sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established.id.this second inquiry must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case,not as a broad general proposition.id.for immunity to apply,the actions of the officer must be objectively reasonable under the circumstances,such that a reasonably competent officer would not have known his actions violated clearly established law.evett deep.reg l narcotics trafficking task force,cir.
we apply these standards first to tarazona claims and then to mesa.
tarazona fourth amendment claims 
the validity of summary judgment on tarazona claims turns on whether officer prejean had probable cause to believe that a criminal offense has been or is being committed.devenpeck alford,d.probable cause exists when the totality of the facts and circumstances within a police officer knowledge at the moment of arrest are sufficient for a reasonable person to conclude that the suspect had committed or was committing an offense.united states mccowan,cir.a mistake reasonably made as to probable cause justifies qualified immunity.tarver city of edna,cir.
two offenses were the alleged basis for the arrest tarazona remaining after forbidden and her disturbing the peace by intoxication.we examine each offense in turn.
remaining after forbidden 
officer prejean first argues that he had probable cause to arrest tarazona under louisiana criminal trespass statute,which provides as follows 
no person shall without authority go into or upon or attempt to go into or upon or remain in or upon any structure,watercraft,or any other movable or immovable property,which belongs to another,including public buildings or structures,ferries and bridges,or any part,portion,or area thereof,after having been forbidden to do so,either orally or in writing by any owner,lessee,or custodian of the property or by any other authorized person.
a.the louisiana court of appeal has held that this statute does not prohibit standing on a public sidewalk.melancon trahan,so d,writ denied,so d see also state brooks,so d.though quite likely an officer has the right in louisiana to require someone to move even from a sidewalk to avoid interfering with an arrest,the issue framed for us is whether refusing to do so violates this trespass statute.the state supreme court has not ruled on these points,but these precedents at least raise doubt that a sidewalk can be the situs for application of this specific statute.
there is some evidence that tarazona was in the street,not on the sidewalk.this statute applicability to public streets has not been the subject of any louisiana court opinion.it may not criminalize every instance of remaining on a public street after being forbidden.see melancon,so d at.because the issue regarding the statute applicability to kinds of locations has not been raised or briefed by the parties,and because resolution of the point is not dispositive on appeal,we leave this issue to be decided by the district court on remand after full presentation by the parties.
regardless of the legal issue of whether an officer may expel an individual from a street or sidewalk,the violator must be given a reasonable time to actually accomplish his departure.state kology,so d.these disputed facts do not indicate whether tarazona only briefly and reasonably hesitated after an initial request to move on.further,if tarazona explanation is accepted that officer prejean at first used what would be a neighborhood policing technique of making a suggestion and not issuing a still telling her to move resolution of disputed facts could be that she promptly moved at the first clear command.
the district court determined that tarazona failure to obey the first order to move gave officer prejean probable cause to arrest.see murray town of mansura,so d.the murray court held that a town police chief had probable cause to arrest two individuals who did not leave the mansura city hall premises after being given two warnings to move on.id.at.we do not find the answer in murray.first,the violators in murray refused to leave after being given two warnings and only departed from the premises after being told they were under arrest.id.in contrast,there is some evidence that tarazona complied with the one clear request and,arguably,moved within a reasonable time after officer prejean first request.second,the individuals who refused to leave city hall violated section,as it applies to public buildings and structures.sidewalks and streets,though,may not be proper places for applying the statute as we have discussed.
therefore,when viewing the evidence favorably to tarazona,we conclude that there are fact questions about a violation of a constitutional right to be free from unreasonable seizures.see saucier,at.because of that uncertainty,we must take the next sequential step in qualified immunity analysis and ask whether a reasonably competent officer would not have known his actions violated clearly established law.evett,at.here,too,the factual ambiguities regarding what officer prejean said and how many times he said it,how quickly tarazona moved,and whether no reasonable officer would have thought he could arrest a person for her failure to move from a sidewalk,make summary judgment inappropriate.
we should not be read as failing to distinguish the two analytical steps.if there is no probable cause to arrest,the question of whether qualified immunity nonetheless applies is a separate legal and factual issue.in one precedent,we reversed a decision regarding probable cause and remanded on the next appeal,judge clark wrote that whether a search was reasonable is not the equivalent of whether an officer participating in an unreasonable search is entitled to qualified immunity.bigford taylor,cir.we later examined the trilogy of bigford appeals and concluded that the analysis of facts that might not support probable cause to arrest needs to be distinguished from the analysis of whether a reasonable officer would have known that he was violating clearly established law when making an arrest.wren towe,cir.we find the facts relevant to each analysis sufficiently disputed to require reversal.
disturbing the peace by intoxication 
even though officer prejean should not have been granted qualified immunity on summary judgment as to the first offense,we must examine the alternate basis for arrest due to disturbing the peace by intoxication.probable cause to arrest for either offense gives immunity.tarazona submitted sworn eyewitness statements that she was not intoxicated.officer prejean posits that tarazona actual intoxication is not dispositive in the probable cause inquiry.
the relevant statutory language for the offense is this 
disturbing the peace is the doing of any of the following in such manner as would foreseeably disturb or alarm the public 
appearing in an intoxicated condition 
a.this crime requires that a defendant was disturbing the peace by appearing drunk and in such a manner as would foreseeably disturb or alarm the public.state trepagnier,so d.for a conviction,the intoxication element is satisfied when the defendant is present while intoxicated,and not when he merely looks like he is intoxicated.id.quoting state champagne,so d.that test does not answer what is needed for arrest.
cases interpreting section a suggest that probable cause for an arrest for violating the statute requires that an officer observe evidence both of actual intoxication and a likelihood that the public will be endangered or disturbed.state stowe,so d,probable cause existed based on defendant offensive and derisive language in the middle of a public highway,plus his visibly intoxicated condition state chauvin,so d,no probable cause because no evidence of actual intoxication and no evidence the defendant actions had the intent to deride,offend or annoy the people he approached or that they were violent or boisterous in a manner that would induce a foreseeable physical disturbance.
the pertinent facts as to probable cause under section a are not in this record.officer prejean moved for summary judgment and argued that he had probable cause to arrest under each of the statutes we have discussed.the district court did not reach officer prejean arguments on disturbing the peace by intoxication,finding the arrest under the criminal trespass statute to be justified.on appeal,tarazona has disputed the existence of probable cause only by arguing she was not actually intoxicated.the appropriate inquiry,though,is whether the officer had probable cause to believe that she was.see gibson rich,cir.
while tarazona evidence of her sobriety is not decisive on the probable cause issue,there also is little evidence that would support a finding that,based on tarazona conduct preceding her arrest,a reasonable person could conclude that she was violating the intoxication statute 
even under our de novo review,the litigants must present this court with material facts before we can determine whether such facts are in dispute.the district court made no finding of fact regarding probable cause to arrest under louisiana disturbing the peace by intoxication statute.office prejean has shown little justification for the arrest,and terazona has not shown an absence of justification.under these circumstances,we decline the opportunity to affirm summary judgment on this alternative basis of probable cause.see united states ex rel.riley luke episcopal,cir.
because we have found that summary judgment based on qualified immunity should not have been granted under either alleged basis for the arrest,we reverse the dismissal of tarazona claim of an illegal arrest 
excessive force 
tarazona alleged that officer prejean used excessive force when placing her under arrest.tarazona admits that she suffered no physical injuries as a result of the arrest but argues that the arrest caused psychological inj
