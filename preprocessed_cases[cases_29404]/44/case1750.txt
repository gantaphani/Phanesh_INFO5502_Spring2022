once again we address the scope of the absolute pollution exclusion in an insurance policy under texas law.concluding that the exclusion unambiguously applies to exclude liability coverage for injuries caused to kaia alvarado by the pollutant carbon monoxide seeping,discharging,releasing and dispersing into an apartment owned by appellant and leased by kaia mother,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
background 
appellant country oaks apartments country oaks purchased a commercial general liability cgl policy from appellee nautilus insurance company nautilus.some time during the policy period,some workers accidentally blocked the vent to the furnace in several country oaks apartments,including the one in which kelly schenks,who was pregnant with kaia,lived.as a result,carbon monoxide that otherwise would have been dispersed into the outside atmosphere was dispersed into the apartment.tragically,young kaia was born with a number of difficulties that continue to this day,including almost daily seizures her family attributes these conditions to her in utero exposure to the carbon monoxide 
schenks sued country oaks in a texas state court on behalf of kaia,and country oaks tendered the defense of that case to nautilus.nautilus,in turn,refused to defend,contending that it owed no duty to defend or indemnify due to its policy absolute pollution exclusion.that exclusion says that coverage does not apply to 
bodily injury or property damage which would not have occurred in whole or in part but for the actual,alleged,or threatened discharge,dispersal,seepage,migration,release,or escape of pollutants at any time.
the policy defines the term pollutant as any solid,liquid,gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant,including smoke,vapor,soot,fumes,acids,alkalis,chemicals and waste.waste includes material to be recycled,reconditioned or reclaimed.
the exclusion quoted above was added to the policy by way of an amendatory endorsement.the original text of the policy contained a pollution exclusion clause that was amended by the endorsement.the pollution exclusion clause in the original text of the policy included the following language however,this subparagraph the original exclusion does not apply to i bodily injury if sustained within a building and caused by smoke,fumes,vapor or soot from equipment used to heat that building 
nautilus then filed the instant declaratory judgment action to determine its duties.nautilus moved for summary judgment on the duty to defend and indemnify.country oaks on its counterclaim seeking a defense and associated fees and costs.the district court granted summary judgment in full to nautilus,and denied summary judgment to country oaks which timely appealed.though not a party to the declaratory judgment action,kaia family filed an amicus brief before the district court,as well as this court,and participated in oral argument in this court.

iii.discussion 
rules of insurance contract construction 
under texas law,which applies to this diversity case,
t he rule provides that when an insured is sued by a third party,the liability insurer is to determine its duty to defend solely from terms of the policy and the pleadings of the claimant.resort to evidence outside the four corners of these two documents is generally prohibited.

in this case,nautilus is not arguing about whether the incident in question was an occurrence under the policy.it rests its denial solely upon the single exclusionary endorsement.w hen the plaintiff petition makes allegations which,if proved,would place the plaintiff claim within an exclusion from coverage,there is no duty to defend.gulf states ins.alamo carriage,cir.texas law places the burden of proving that an exclusion applies on the insurance company.ann.vernon.exclusions are narrowly construed,and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in the insured favor.gore design completions,hartford fire ins,cir citing star indem.gulf coast marine,dist,pet.denied.

thus,this case presents purely legal questions is carbon monoxide a pollutant within the meaning of the policy and,if so,did it discharge,disperse,release,or seep into the apartment in question we address each question in turn.
is carbon monoxide a pollutant 
country oaks contends that carbon monoxide,even at toxic levels,is not a pollutant within the meaning of the pollution exclusion.under the pollution exclusion,pollution means any solid,liquid,gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant,including smoke,vapor,soot,fumes,acid,alkalis,chemicals,or waste.
country oaks admits that carbon monoxide is a gas.it contends,however,that carbon monoxide is not an irritant or contaminant,because it does not generally or probably irritate or contaminate.rather,country oaks notes that carbon monoxide is a naturally occurring substance in the environment that individuals encounter at various concentrations on a daily basis.
