this case requires us to decide whether a passenger state tort claim against an international air carrier was preempted by the warsaw convention and therefore properly dismissed by the district court.for the reasons set forth below,we vacate the district court judgment granting the motion to dismiss and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the following facts are drawn from the complaint.michel is a citizen of cuba with legal residence in the united states.at the time of this action,resided in puerto rico.in october,a banking executive,was invited to participate in an annual convention hosted by the mortgage loan officers association association in madrid,spain.the association contracted with a travel agency,the travel place,to coordinate all travel arrangements for attendees to the convention.the travel place assured that he would not require a visa,and instead need only show his cuban passport and resident alien card upon entry to spain.on november,and his partner,maria,a citizen collectively,plaintiffs,arrived at the iberia líneas aéreas españolas,iberia airline counter in puerto rico to check in.the iberia agent informed and that all immigration documents were in place and gave them their tickets and boarding passes.
upon arriving in spain on november,a spanish immigration officer requested passports from all passengers.when showed his cuban passport,the spanish government ordered his immediate detention.was questioned,represented by counsel appointed by the spanish government,and detained with other allegedly illegal immigrants in a closed room in the airport.meanwhile,suffered great anguish at seeing her partner detained in front of his peers in the banking industry,mocked by spanish immigration officers,and humiliated.appointed counsel provided him with several documents for his review.at the behest of a spanish officer who told him the documents were for his own benefit,signed the documents without reading them,and was subsequently told that he would be deported to his country of.suffered great anguish thinking about the punishment he would face at the hands of cuban authorities upon returning to a country he was forced to leave many years ago,and the and his partner and two children who would be forced to live without him in puerto rico.
later that evening,was taken to another room where he was and humiliated by a female spanish officer.he was then taken to a detention room with hundreds of allegedly illegal immigrants,where he was served his first meal of the day and was ordered to pass the night in a cold room that included a row of bunk beds without sheets or blankets.during this time,observed spanish officers beating a young adolescent from ecuador who stood up to visit the restroom.the following morning,after speaking with about a letter she had obtained from the general manager of the hotel in spain assuming responsibility for him during his stay,inquired whether he could be sent back to puerto rico.spanish officers declined to accept this proposition.was extremely nervous about her partner future and the of herself and her children.the following day,was escorted by several spanish guards to an iberia airplane bound for san juan,puerto rico,detained until airline crew boarded the airplane,and thereafter released.
as a result of the humiliation,emotional distress,and mental anguish they experienced,plaintiffs sued iberia,a foreign entity,in federal court,alleging negligence under puerto rico law on february,iberia brought a motion to dismiss for failure to join as indispensable parties the travel company and its owner.that motion was denied.iberia then filed its answer to plaintiffs complaint.after discovery and the entry of a pretrial order,iberia filed a second motion to dismiss,based on plaintiffs failure to state a claim under the convention,and,in the alternative,under puerto rico law.the district court dismissed plaintiffs action for failure to state a claim under the convention.appealed

applicability of the warsaw convention 
the warsaw convention 
the convention,as amended by the montreal agreement governs the liability of international air carriers for passenger injuries occurring on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.el al israel airlines,at.quoting convention see langadinos american airlines,cir.the convention is preemptive a carrier is not subject to liability under local law for passenger injuries covered by the convention,that is,all personal injury cases stemming from occurrences on board an aircraft or in embarking or disembarking.el al israel airlines,at.adopting government construction of convention see also convention stating that in personal injury cases covered by the convention,any action for damages,however founded,can only be brought subject to the conditions and limits set out in this convention.the corollary is also true 
the convention preemptive effect on local law extends no further than the convention own substantive scope.a carrier,therefore,is indisputably subject to liability under local law for injuries arising outside of that scope,for passenger injuries occurring before any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.
el al israel airlines,at.internal citations and quotation marks omitted see also commercial union ins.alitalia airlines,cir as a treaty adhered to by the united states,it is the supreme law of the land and trumps local law when it applies.emphasis added.
treaty interpretation,we have noted,is a purely legal exercise.mccarthy,at interpreting meaning of embarking and disembarking under convention.therefore,the question of whether a passenger injury was sustained on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking,convention,is a question of law to be decided by the court based on the facts of each case,marotte american airlines,cir.see also schmidkunz scandinavian airlines,cir same.since t he terms embarking and disembarking are not specifically defined in the convention,marotte,at,and absent some direction from the supreme court,which has not yet had occasion to define them,we have found the passenger activity at the time of injury,his or her whereabouts when injured,and the extent to which the carrier was exercising control highly relevant in determining the applicability of the convention.mccarthy,at.
if the convention applies and local law is thereby preempted,the next question is whether the carrier is liable under the convention.this inquiry involves a determination of whether there was an accident,an unexpected or unusual event or happening that is external to the passenger,air france saks,d whether the passenger suffered a compensable injury,death,physical injury,or physical manifestation of injury,eastern airlines,floyd,d and whether the accident was a proximate cause of the passenger injury,see langadinos,at.
the district court proceeding 
the district court held that plaintiffs puerto rico tort claim was preempted by the convention because plaintiffs failed to state a claim for liability under the convention.according to the district court,plaintiffs may not sue a carrier pursuant to state law if they are barred from recovering under the convention.the district court noted that plaintiffs did not allege that they suffered death,physical injury or physical manifestation of an injury one of the requirements for proving liability under the convention rather,plaintiffs alleged only humiliation,embarrassment,and great anguish none of which is compensable under the convention.since plaintiffs were barred from recovering under the convention,the court held that their claim under puerto rico law was likewise barred.
application of the warsaw convention 
echoing the district court,iberia notes that since t he warsaw convention dispositions provide the exclusive source of an airline liability in international flights claims,claim falls short because he does not allege any physical injury or an accident,on the other hand,argues that the court erroneously assumed the convention applicability without resolving the threshold issue of whether his injuries were sustained on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.convention.according to,the convention does not his puerto rico tort claim is therefore not he was not embarking or disembarking when he sustained his injuries.rather,argues,his injuries were sustained in spain in a detention jail and in being deported back to puerto rico in front of all the members of the association.
we agree with that the district court erroneously conflated the applicability of the convention with liability under the convention.the convention applicability rests on a determination of whether the passenger injury occurred on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.convention.if the convention applies in a particular case,it is preemptive,and the trier of fact must then determine whether the carrier is liable under the convention.see el al israel,at.r ecovery for a personal injury on board an aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking,if not allowed under the convention,is not available at all.internal citation and quotation marks omitted see id.at.i n all questions relating to the carrier liability,it is the provisions of the c onvention which apply and the passenger does not have access to any other remedies,whether under the common law or otherwise,which may be available within the particular country where he chooses to raise his action.quoting sidhu british airways plc,all,at.if the convention is not applicable,it is not preemptive,and the passenger is free to pursue his or her claim under local law.id.at.t he convention addresses and concerns,only and exclusively,the airline liability for passenger injuries occurring on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.quoting convention.
here,the district court assumed the applicability of the convention,stating that pursuant to el al israel,plaintiffs only basis of redress is the convention passenger liability provision.but el al israel does not support such an assumption.in that case,applicability of the convention was not at issue because the parties explicitly agreed that the occurred in international transportation in the course of embarking.el al israel,at.in this case,by contrast,the parties dispute whether damages were sustained in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking,and,thus,whether the convention is applicable.
argues that iberia failure to advise him at the ticket counter of the need for a visa to enter spain preceded his boarding the plane,and that his subsequent arrest upon arrival in spain came well after he disembarked from the plane.iberia,on the other hand,contends that its alleged failure to warn at the airport in puerto rico and his ensuing arrest in spain took place during the process of embarking and disembarking,respectively.because the district court did not address this dispute,there was never any determination that the convention was applicable and therefore preemptive of claim.see marotte,at holding that the convention preempted plaintiffs state law claims where plaintiffs injuries occurred in the process of embarking,as contemplated by the warsaw convention see also mccarthy,at holding that plaintiff was not engaged in the course of embarking under the convention,based on the passenger activity at the time of injury,his or her whereabouts when injured,and the extent to which the carrier was exercising control at the moment of injury.the district court therefore erred in dismissing claim under the convention without first determining whether injury occurred on board the airplane or in the process of embarking or disembarking.
liability under puerto rico law 
even if the convention is not applicable and therefore not preemptive,iberia asks us to affirm on a different basis,arguing that the motion to dismiss was properly granted because does not state a claim under puerto rico law.
contract claim 
iberia contends that while characterizes his claim as sounding only in tort,his claim also sounds in contract,based on the allegation in the complaint that iberia breached its contract to travel with acevedo.iberia further argues that,as between these two sources of law,in puerto rico contractual law control s the scenario depicted in the complaint.as a result,acevedo can not resort to general principles of tort law but must submit himself to the provisions applicable to contracts.furthermore,because the parties did not contract for iberia to assume the duty of verifying that acevedo papers were in order for entering spain,a task that was acevedo personal obligation to comply with,iberia argues that claim fails to state a claim for breach of contract under article of the civil code of puerto rico,laws,tit,
aside from language in the complaint briefly alluding to a contractual claim,nowhere argues that iberia breached a contract.on the contrary,asserts that his claim is without a doubt one in tort,and states in the complaint that his state law claims are based on article of the civil code of puerto rico the puerto rico statute governing tort claims,laws,tit,nevertheless,even if we assume that claim sounds in both tort and contract,it does not follow that puerto rico contract law provides the remedy.in fact,the opposite is true where the event that caused the damage results from the breach of both a contractual obligation as well as a noncontractual duty not to cause harm to another,puerto rico law holds that an action for damages for breach of contract does not lie.according to the puerto rico supreme court 
an action for damages for breach of contract article only lies when the damage suffered exclusively arises as a consequence of the breach of an obligation specifically agreed upon,which damage would not occur without the existence of a contract.however a claim for noncontractual damages resulting from the breach of a contract lies if the act that caused the damage constitutes a breach of the general duty not to injure anyone and,at the same time,a breach of contract.
ramos lozada orientalist rattan furniture,wl emphasis added.iberia argument regarding the application of puerto rico contract law is therefore unavailing.
tort claim 
iberia argues that even if puerto rico tort law applies to claim,his claim should still be dismissed.by contrast,argues that the complaint adequately states a claim for negligence.we agree with.puerto rico tort law imposes responsibility for damages caused by negligence or fault.the necessary elements to prevail in such a tort action are a negligent act or omission,damages,and a causal relationship between them.irvine,irg murad skin research,cir.the complaint alleges facts addressing each of these elements,stating that iberia negligent acts or,its fail ure to advise that he needed a visa in order to enter spain caused to be detained by spanish authorities in spain,humiliated in front of his peers from the banking industry,and subjected to extensive mental anguish and sufferings.
iberia argument that an air carrier has no duty to advise passengers under puerto rico law is foreclosed by our decision in compagnie nationale air france castano,cir.in that case,three passengers and a relative sued an air carrier under puerto rico tort law for failing to advise them that they needed visas to enter spain.we opined that 
the puerto rico court would hold that where there was evidence that the defendant,as an inducement to plaintiffs to purchase passage,had held itself out as a tourist or travel agency,and had negligently failed to provide the information that plaintiffs had reasonably been led
