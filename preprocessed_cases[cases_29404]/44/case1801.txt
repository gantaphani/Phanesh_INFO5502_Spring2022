jane and julie doe the does appeal the district court dismissal of their claims for negligence and gross negligence,and its finding that the claims were barred by the communications decency act cda,and texas common law.for the following reasons,we affirm the decision of the district court.
facts and proceedings 
is a social network.online social networking is the practice of using a web site or other interactive computer service to expand one business or social network.social networking on begins with a member creation of an online profile that serves as a medium for personal expression,and can contain such items as photographs,videos,and other information about the member that he or she chooses to share with other users.members have complete discretion regarding the amount and type of information that is included in a personal profile.members over the age of sixteen can choose the degree of privacy they desire regarding their profile that is,they determine who among the membership is allowed to view their profile.once a profile has been created,the member can use it to extend invitations to existing friends who are also users and to communicate with those friends online by linking to their profiles,or using,instant messaging,and blogs all of which are hosted through the platform.
members can also meet new people at through user groups focused on common interests such as film,travel,music,or politics.has a browser feature that allows members to search the web site membership using criteria such as geographic location or specific interests.members can also become online friends with celebrities,musicians,or politicians who have created profiles to publicize their work and to interface with fans and supporters.
membership is free to all who agree to the terms of use.to establish a profile,users must represent that they are at least fourteen years of age.the profiles of members who are aged fourteen and fifteen are automatically set to private by default,in order to limit the amount of personal information that can be seen on the member profile by users who are not in their existing friends network and to prevent younger teens from being contacted by users they do not know.although employs a computer program designed to search for clues that underage members have lied about their age to create a profile on the web site,no current technology is foolproof.all members are cautioned regarding the type of information they release to other users on the web site,including a specific prohibition against posting personal information such as telephone numbers,street addresses,last names,or addresses.members are also encouraged to report inaccurate,inappropriate,or obscene material to the web site administrators.
in the summer of,at age thirteen,julie doe julie lied about her age,represented that she was eighteen years old,and created a profile on.this action allowed her to circumvent all safety features of the web site and resulted in her profile being made public pete solis solis was able to initiate contact with julie in april when she was fourteen.the two communicated offline on several occasions after julie provided her telephone number.they met in person in may,and,at this meeting,solis sexually assaulted julie 
julie mother,jane doe,first sued myspace,its parent company,news corporation collectively myspace,and solis in a texas state court on her own behalf and on behalf of her daughter,alleging that myspace failed to implement basic safety measures to prevent sexual predators from communicating with minors on its web site.the does original petition asserted claims for fraud,negligent misrepresentation,negligence,and gross negligence against myspace,and claims for sexual assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress against solis.myspace answered the petition and filed special exceptions,asserting among other things,that the cda and texas common law barred the does claims.the does amended their petition,to which myspace again specially excepted thereafter,before any ruling on the special exceptions,the does filed a motion for nonsuit which the court granted,dismissing the case without prejudice.the does then refiled in new york state court,asserting the same claims against myspace,but declining to name solis as a defendant.myspace immediately removed that case to the united states district court for the southern district of new york and moved simultaneously to transfer venue to the western district of texas and to dismiss for failure to state a claim.the district court in new york considered both motions and granted myspace motion to transfer venue,but declined to rule on the motion to dismiss,leaving it for the transferee court.
the district court in texas then held oral argument on february,and decided myspace motion to dismiss in a written opinion.the district court construed myspace rule b motion to dismiss as a rule c motion for judgment on the pleadings and considered the does most recent complaint,filed on september,in the bronx county court.in their complaint,the does alleged 
to access the social network,one must create a myspace account.in order to create a myspace account,all one has to do is enter a name,email address,gender,country,and date of birth.
once signed up,each myspace user is given his or her own personal webpage to create.myspace users are then prompted to post photographs and personal information on their webpage.typically,a myspace user webpage is viewable by any other myspace user.further,any myspace user can contact any other myspace user through internal email instant messaging on myspace.
the catalyst behind myspace amazing surge in popularity is their underage users demographic.according to myspace,approximately percent of myspace visitors are minors,under the age of.myspace actively and passively markets itself to minors.
in the summer of,julie created a profile on myspace.at the time,julie was only.despite myspace supposed safety precautions and protections prohibiting anyone under from using myspace,julie was easily able to create a profile.
defendants owed a legal duty to julie to institute and enforce appropriate security measures and policies that would substantially decrease the likelihood of danger and harm that myspace posed to her.
the district court in texas dismissed with prejudice the does claims for negligence and gross negligence,finding that the claims were barred by the cda and texas common law.the does voluntarily withdrew their claims for fraud and negligent misrepresentation therefore,the district court dismissed those claims without prejudice.the does now appeal the district court dismissal of their claims for negligence and gross negligence,arguing that c of the cda is inapplicable here because their claims do not implicate myspace as a publisher protected by the act and because myspace not only published but was also partially responsible for creating the content of the information that was exchanged between julie and solis.doe next argues that c does not immunize myspace failure to take reasonable steps to ensure minors safety.the does lastly apply the law of premises liability germane to owners of real property to publishers and internet service providers operating in the virtual world of cyberspace to argue that the district court erred when it did not find a duty to protect julie.we hold,however,that the does claims of negligence are barred by c of the cda.
ii.standard of review 
this court reviews a district court grant of judgment on the pleadings under rule c de novo.see brittan commc ns int l sw.bell,cir hughes v.the tobacco,cir.a motion for judgment on the pleadings under rule c is subject to the same standard as a motion to dismiss under rule b.johnson johnson,cir citing great plains trust morgan stanley dean witter,cir.t he central issue is whether,in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,the complaint states a valid claim for relief.hughes,at internal quotations omitted.although we must accept the factual allegations in the pleadings as true,a plaintiff must plead enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.bell atl.twombly,d.
