pmi food equipment group,closed its plant in dayton,ohio in and moved the operation to piqua,ohio after signing a agreement with the city of piqua,miami county,and the state of ohio that resulted in favorable tax treatment for years.in the process of closing its dayton plant,pmi terminated all of the hourly employees who worked there.the hourly workers and their spouses collectively referred to as the workers sued pmi,piqua,miami county,the state of ohio,and various other parties,asserting causes of action arising under various state and federal laws in connection with the tax abatement,the closing of the dayton plant,and pmi termination of its hourly workers.all but two of the workers claims were dismissed by the district court,and the remaining two claims were resolved by the parties.the workers timely filed this appeal.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
pmi operated a parts and repair facility in dayton the dayton plant.in,pmi decided to close the dayton plant due to the facility age and inefficient operation.pmi applied to the city of piqua in december of the same year for a agreement the agreement in the miami county enterprise zone.the miami county board of commissioners miami county had created the enterprise zone in piqua to attract new business operations.donald jakeway,who was the director of the ohio department of development odd,was responsible for administering programs,including the one at issue.
the terms of the agreement called for pmi to open a plant in piqua the piqua plant in exchange for various tax breaks,including a tax abatement until on all personal property used for business purposes in the piqua plant and a tax abatement on any new real property added to the plant until.during the negotiations over the agreement,the workers allege that pmi informed piqua and miami county officials that it was considering moving its plant to kentucky,where the company had other operations,in the event that pmi did not receive the tax abatements from piqua.they also claim that pmi in fact had no plans at the time to move to kentucky.the agreement was approved by the piqua city commission,miami county,the state of ohio,and jakeway on january.
at the time that pmi closed the dayton plant,the company employed people at that location,consisting of salaried employees and hourly employees.the hourly employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement cba between pmi and the international union of electronic,electrical,salaried,machine,and furniture workers,the union.according to the workers third amended complaint the amended complaint,the cba was scheduled to expire in june of.the cba contained no provision requiring pmi to keep the dayton plant open.pmi planned to employ a staff of at the piqua plant to fill salaried and hourly positions.
pmi informed the dayton plant hourly employees in december of of the planned closure and their pending termination.the workers allege that pmi initially told them that they would be laid off a few at a time,first by handicap,then by seniority.on july,pmi informed them that they were all to be terminated the following friday,july.three days later,on july,pmi closed the dayton plant and all of the hourly employees were terminated.
all of the salaried employees from the dayton plant were retained to work at the piqua plant,but none of the hourly employees were allowed to keep their jobs.pmi filled the hourly positions with individuals who were employed by a temporary employment agency.the workers allege that,of the hourly employees who were terminated,were age or over and that the average age of the hourly employees was.they also allege that the average age of the temporary workers hired to replace them was.
procedural history 
in may of,the workers filed their initial complaint in the montgomery county court of common pleas in dayton.pmi,piqua,miami county,the state of ohio,jakeway,the city of dayton,dayton city schools,and odd were named as defendants.all of the defendants,except the dayton city schools and odd,are appellees in this appeal.the case was removed to federal court in june of.in october of the same year,the workers filed their amended complaint,which set forth causes of action.shortly thereafter,the defendants filed motions to dismiss.
the district court issued an order in september of that granted in part and denied in part the defendants motions to dismiss,and stated that its supporting opinion would be forthcoming.nine years later,in february of,the district court finally issued its opinion.it granted the motions to dismiss in their entirety as to the state of ohio,jakeway,and miami county,and also granted the motions to dismiss with respect to all but two of the workers claims against the remaining defendants.both of the other claims were later resolved by the parties.the workers timely appealed the district court judgment,limiting the issues on appeal to of the alleged causes of action.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.marks newcourt credit group,cir.in reviewing a rule b motion to dismiss,f actual allegations must be enough to raise a right of relief above the speculative level,on the assumption that all the allegations are true even if doubtful in fact.nicsand,cir quoting bell atl.twombly,d.we need not,however,accept as true legal conclusions or unwarranted factual inferences.gregory shelby county,cir.
constitutional claims 
in their amended complaint,the workers requested that the district court declare the agreement null and void because it allegedly violated their due process and equal protection rights under both the constitution and the ohio constitution.the court declined to consider the workers request,however,concluding that the issue was moot because the agreement had already expired.on appeal,the workers argue that the district court erred in dismissing their constitutional claims for mootness,and they also assert for the first time that the agreement violated the commerce clause of the constitution.but the workers belated commerce clause argument,just like their other constitutional claims that were timely raised,is subject to the mootness doctrine.
we have no authority to render a decision upon moot questions or to declare rules of law that can not affect the matter at issue.cleveland branch,naacp city of parma,cir.a case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.id.quoting county of los angeles davis,d.that is,a case becomes moot only when subsequent events make it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior can not reasonably be expected to recur and interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.id.quotation marks omitted.an otherwise moot claim will not be dismissed,however,where it is capable of repetition,yet evading review,such that the challenged action was in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration,and there was a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subject to the same action again.murphy hunt,d.
in considering the potential mootness of a claim for declaratory relief,this court has explained that the question is whether the facts alleged,under all the circumstances,show that there is a substantial controversy of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.coal.for gov t procurement fed.prison,cir quoting super tire eng g mccorkle,d quotation marks omitted.
the workers argue that the district court decision is fundamentally unjust because the issue would not have been moot if the district court had rendered its decision in a timely manner.although they justifiably lament the district court inordinate and inexplicable delay in deciding the defendants motions to dismiss,they do not dispute that the agreement expired in.this fact is fatal to their claim because the agreement is no longer in effect and no party has any continuing obligations under it.granting declaratory relief would therefore have no effect on the workers current legal interests.furthermore,the workers have not alleged any facts to show that they might be subject to a similar agreement between the same parties in the future.
the issue of whether the agreement is unconstitutional is,accordingly,no longer a live controversy,and there is no reasonable expectation that the agreement will be revived to harm the workers legal interests.see mcpherson.high sch.athletic ass n,cir holding that a request for a preliminary injunction ordering the plaintiff to be allowed to compete in the basketball season was moot in because the plaintiff had already graduated,the season was over,and there were no more games to be played ford wilder,cir holding that,because a resolution was no longer before the state senate and election results had already been voided under the resolution,declaratory relief would have no effect on the parties current legal interests.the workers constitutional claims are therefore moot and the district court properly declined to grant a declaratory judgment.
to be sure,we look unfavorably upon lengthy,unjustified,and inexplicable delays on the part of district courts in deciding cases.see,ball wagers,cir criticizing a delay of five years and nine months.the law does not,however,recognize an exception to the mootness doctrine on the basis of inordinate delay.see big rivers epa,cir discussing the two exceptions to mootness.if the workers were concerned about the inexplicable delay,they had the option to bring a mandamus action against the district court judge.see roche evaporated milk ass n.the traditional use of the writ of mandamus in aid of appellate jurisdiction has been to confine an inferior court to a lawful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction or to compel it to exercise its authority when it is its duty to do so.the workers failure to exercise this right diminishes the force of their mootness argument.
fraud claims 
in their capacity as taxpayers,the workers next assert two claims of fraud against pmi,piqua,miami county,the state of ohio,and jakeway.their first claim was brought on behalf of the workers themselves,in their capacity as state and county taxpayers.this claim alleges that the workers,as taxpayers,suffered damages as a result of pmi alleged fraudulent misrepresentations to the city,county,and state during the negotiations.the second claim was brought in the form of a taxpayers suit pursuant to ohio taxpayer suit statute,ohio.this claim alleges that the agreement involved tax revenues that were intended for specific purposes,but were otherwise directed for private use by pmi.
the district court dismissed both claims on the ground that the workers failed to satisfy the requirements for standing under ohio statute.but whether the workers have standing to sue in federal court in their capacity as taxpayers is a federal question which does not depend on the party prior standing in state court.coyne ex rel.ohio am.tobacco,cir quoting phillips petroleum shutts,d.in other words,standing is a matter of federal law,not state law.coyne,at ellipsis and quotation marks omitted.the district court reliance on ohio law in dismissing the workers taxpayer claims for lack of standing is therefore misplaced.see id.it should have begun its inquiry into the workers standing with an analysis under article iii of the constitution.
this court has set forth the three requirements for establishing article iii standing as follows 
a plaintiff must have suffered some actual or threatened injury due to the alleged illegal conduct of the defendant the injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action and there must be a substantial likelihood that the relief requested will redress or prevent the plaintiff injury.hence,the irreducible minimum constitutional requirements for standing are proof of injury in fact,causation,and redressability.a plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating standing and must plead its components with specificity.
id.at citations omitted.
we need not engage in a lengthy analysis of either injury or causation because the workers fraud claims fail under the third requirement of redressability.they assert that the state and county misdirected and misappropriated tax revenues to fund the agreement,and that they suffered damages as a result.
in coyne,this court held that a group of ohio taxpayers who,like the workers,had challenged the expenditure of state funds,lacked standing because they could not show that a favorable outcome would result in either the receipt of a tax refund by them or a reduction in the tax bill for ohio taxpayers generally.see coyne,at.the court explained that r eimbursement of the public treasury would not necessarily redress plaintiffs claimed tax burden injury because the power to decrease state taxes or issue a tax refund rests within the province of the legislative and executive branches of the state of ohio.id.
like the plaintiffs in coyne,the workers fail to allege that a victory in this suit would result in an increase in the public treasury to replace the amount of money misappropriated under the agreement.nor does their complaint raise a possibility that a favorable outcome would result in either the receipt of a tax refund by the workers or a reduction in the tax burden for ohio or miami county taxpayers generally.indeed,even if the workers were to win and obtain money from pmi to replenish the public coffers,decisions about how to utilize a recovery of such funds would belong to the state of ohio and to miami county.see id.for these reasons,the workers lack standing to bring their fraud claims in federal court.
section claims 
the workers next allege that pmi deprived them of certain constitutional rights,in violation of,when the company terminated them and moved the plant to piqua.their argument is difficult to understand,but appears to be that pmi actions in terminating the hourly employees and moving operations to piqua were under the color of state law because the actions were taken in connection with the agreement,which was authorized and approved by state law and entered into by various government entities.the district court found that the workers failed to state a cause of action because they did not allege that ohio law compelled pmi to terminate them.
to state a claim under,plaintiffs must demonstrate that the defendant deprived them of their rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution under color of state law.lindsey detroit entm t,llc,cir quoting.as a general rule,s ection does not prohibit the conduct of private parties acting in their individual capacities.id.the ultimate issue in determining whether a private party is subject to suit under is whether the alleged infringement of federal rights is fairly attributable to the state.kohn,d quotation marks omitted.this court applies the three tests articulated by the supreme court for determining the existence of state action under the public function test,the state compulsion test,and the symbiotic relationship or nexus test.chapman higbee,cir.only the second and third tests are relevant to this case.
the state compulsion test requires that a state exercise such coercive power or provide such significant encouragement,either overt or covert,that in law the choice of the private actor is deemed to be that of the state.wolotsky huhn,cir citing blum yaretsky,d finding no state action even though the state provided a significant portion of the funding of a private corporation,because the state did not appoint board members,select personnel,or make decisions for the organization.more than mere approval or acquiescence in the initiatives of the private party is necessary to hold the state responsible for those initiatives.id.at.
there is nothing in the record to show that any of the state entities exercised such coercive power or provided such encouragement as to make pmi decision state action.id.pmi,a private company,made a business decision to voluntarily enter into a contract with government entities,to close its dayton plant,and to terminate the workers.no state law or any state entity required pmi to take any of those actions.indeed,the agreement required only that pmi open a facility in piqua.it did not require pmi to close facilities elsewhere or lay off existing employees.
the workers claims also fail under the symbiotic relationship test,which requires a plaintiff to demonstrate that there is a sufficiently close nexus between the government and the private party conduct so that the conduct may be fairly attributed to the state itself.chapman,at cir see also brentwood acad.secondary sch.athletic ass n,d stating that a challenged activity may be state action when it is entwined with governmental policies or when government is entwined in its management or control quotation marks omitted.according to the record,the government entities here did nothing more than authorize and approve a contract that provided tax benefits conditioned on pmi opening a plant in piqua.
the factual allegations do not suggest that the government showed any interest in the internal business matters of pmi or that,aside from offering tax incentives,it influenced pmi business decisions.see,at.finding no state action where various government regulators showed relatively little interest in the school personnel matters.pmi challenged actions,moreover,occurred without any involvement whatsoever by any government entity or regulation.see id.holding that there was no state action where the decisions to discharge the petitioners were not compelled or even influenced by any state regulation.nor does the workers amended complaint allege a nexus between the government and pmi challenged conduct.for the foregoing reasons,the district court properly dismissed the workers claims.
in their amended complaint,the workers asserted a violation of federal and ohio laws on the ground that they were replaced by workers in piqua who were significantly younger.the district court held that the workers failed to state a claim because,although they allege that they were replaced,they do not allege facts necessary to support the factual allegation that they were replaced with younger workers.the district court dismissed their claims on that ground.
the workers base their claims on the allegation that pmi replaced them with employees at the piqua plant who were,on average,years younger than the workers.according to the record,however,pmi did not hire new hourly employees at its piqua plant.the company instead filled the hourly positions with individuals who were employed by a temporary employment agency and assigned by that agency to work at the piqua plant.
under both the age discrimination in employment act adea,and ohio revised code,employers are prohibited from,among other things,discharging any individual or otherwise discriminating against any individual with respect to the person compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment because of that individual age.the mcdonnell evidentiary framework that is applied to adea claims is also used to analyze claims brought under ohio law.mitchell toledo,cir the mcdonnell formula is the evidentiary framework applicable not only to claims brought under title vii,but also to claims under adea and to claims of discrimination under ohio state law citations omitted.a plaintiff who brings an claim must prove that age was a determining factor in the adverse employment action that the employer took against him.phelps yale,cir.
the mcdonnell douglas test requires a plaintiff to first establish a prima facie case of age discrimination by showing that the plaintiff was a member of a protected class of persons,a person age or over,was discharged,was qualified for the position held,and,lastly,was replaced by someone outside of the protected class.minadeo,at.but where the allegations of discrimination arise from a workforce reduction,the fourth requirement is modified so that the plaintiff must also demonstrate some direct,circumstantial,or statistical evidence tending to indicate that the employer singled out the plaintiff for discharge for impermissible reasons.phelps,at quoting barnes gencorp,cir,cert.denied,d.
pmi laid off all of the hourly employees at its dayton plant pursuant to the provision contained in the cba.accordingly,this is a case under phelps and requires the workers to offer evidence indicating that pmi singled out the workers based on their age.pmi terminated of its hourly employees,some of whom were age or over and some of whom were not.the company then used an employment agency to provide temporary workers,some of whom were age or over and some of whom were not,to fill all of the hourly worker positions at the piqua plant.these facts alone,without more,do not raise an inference that pmi terminated the workers because of their age.
even assuming that this is not a case,the workers still failed to allege facts sufficient to create an inference of discrimination.a person is replaced only when another employee is hired or reassigned to perform the plaintiff duties.barnes,at.a plaintiff allegation that he or she was replaced by someone who was not employed by the plaintiff employer,but was instead employed by another company with a contract to perform services for the plaintiff employer,can not justify a reasonable inference of animus on that basis alone.iberia lineas aereas de espana,cir relying on barnes,at.the fact that the employer assigned the former employee work to an independent contractor that decided to employ younger persons to do the plaintiff work is,without more,insufficient to establish a prima facie case.mitchell worldwide underwriters ins,cir.here,the temporary workers were hired,employed,and assigned to fill the hourly wage positions at the piqua plant by a third party,not pmi.the workers fail to allege any facts suggesting that pmi had a role in choosing the temporary workers who would be assigned to the piqua plant or that it requested younger workers from the temporary employment agency.
based on the foregoing,the workers failed to allege facts sufficient to create a reasonable inference of age discrimination based on the piqua plant use of the temporary workers provided by the independent agency.the workers claims of age discrimination were thus properly dismissed by the district court.
breach of the collective bargaining agreement 
the workers amended complaint further alleged that pmi breached the cba by closing the dayton plant,terminating the workers employment,and refusing to bargain with the union over those decisions.based on these allegations,the workers asserted claims for breach of contract,anticipatory breach,waiver,and estoppel.the district court dismissed these claims on the ground that they were preempted by federal law.on appeal,the workers argue that the district court should have continued the analysis under federal law by treating the causes of action as claims under of the labor management relations act lmra,providing federal courts with jurisdiction over any contract between an employer and a labor organization.but as the following analysis indicates,these claims are fundamentally meritless,regardless of whether they are analyzed under state or federal law.
breach of contract 
the workers assert that pmi breached the cba when it terminated the employee plaintiffs as part of the tax abatement scheme.they fail,however,to identify any provision in the cba that prohibits pmi from terminating them.in fact,the cba contains a provision that expressly permits pmi to terminate employees covered under the cba.that provision requires pmi to give employees three working days notice before layoff if circumstances reasonably allow.in addition,the cba contains a provision stating that t he management and direction of the plant and working forces is vested in the company,except insofar as is expressly abridged by specific provisions of this contract.
this court has held that i t is clear that neither federal labor law nor ordinary collective bargaining agreements compel an employer to maintain in operation all or any part of its business.heheman scripps,cir see also wimberly clark controller,cir holding that the plaintiffs failed to sta
