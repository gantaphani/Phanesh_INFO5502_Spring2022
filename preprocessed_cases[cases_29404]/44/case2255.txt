martin nolan martin and his father,nathaniel nolan nolan collectively nolans brought a civil rights action against martin high school basketball coaches,superintendent,principal,and the memphis city schools alleging that defendants violated martin substantive due process rights and tennessee state law by using excessive corporal punishment against him while he played for the hamilton high school basketball team.after trial,the jury found for the defendants on all counts.the nolans filed a timely motion for new trial,which the district court denied.the nolans now appeal that ruling pro se.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
between and,martin nolan played basketball at hamilton high school hamilton.record on appeal roa tr.defendants theodore anderson anderson and eldridge henry henry coached the various basketball teams at the school.roa tr.
hamilton had a corporal punishment policy under which its teachers paddled students.roa tr.anderson and henry both paddled students on the basketball team,including martin.roa tr.the use of corporal punishment in schools is permitted by tennessee law.under the tennessee code,a ny teacher or school principal may use corporal punishment in a reasonable manner against any pupil for good cause in order to maintain discipline and order within the public schools.ann.each board of education is responsible for adopting such rules and regulations as it deems necessary to implement and control any form of corporal punishment in the schools in its district.ann.
martin testified at trial that anderson routinely paddled him for missing practice,being late for practice,missing shots,and getting poor grades and that anderson paddled him once for missing a car wash.roa tr.he claimed that in a single practice during his ninth grade year he was paddled strokes for missing the car wash.roa tr.during one away game,martin contended,anderson punched him in the chest with a closed fist.roa tr.during his time at hamilton,henry also paddled martin.roa tr.martin estimated that he was paddled roughly two to three times a week.roa tr.the paddlings were painful.on one occasion he placed his hands between himself and the paddle to block the blows and had to ice his hands due to the injury.roa tr.nevertheless,he admitted that he never complained to anderson,hicks,the school principal,or anybody else about being paddled.roa tr.he also testified that he never sought medical treatment for physical injuries resulting from the paddlings.roa tr.furthermore,at trial the nolans stipulated that martin was not seriously injured by any of anderson or henry acts.roa tr.
at trial,both anderson and henry contradicted martin account of the frequency and nature of the paddlings.anderson testified that he did not specifically remember ever paddling martin.roa tr.he admitted that he may have paddled martin,but estimated that he did so no more than three times during the entirety of martin three years at hamilton.roa.he testified that he did not recall paddling martin for missing a car wash.roa tr.he denied that he ever hit martin with a closed fist or that he paddled martin times in one practice for missing.roa tr.
anderson explained that players were paddled primarily for misbehavior.roa.he also occasionally paddled basketball players for bad grades to let them know that academics were number one in our program.roa tr.he noted that he paddled martin very rarely because martin was a good kid he did get into trouble and he made good grades.roa tr.
henry estimated that he paddled martin a total of approximately times in the three years martin was part of the hamilton program.roa tr.he testified that he paddled martin on a few occasions for misbehavior during a practice.roa tr.he paddled martin once or twice based on teacher referrals,when another teacher asked him to paddle martin for something that took place in that teacher class.roa tr.he denied paddling martin for missing shots but admitted that he may have paddled martin for not using the correct technique that had been shown to him on several occasions and that he had paddled martin once or twice because of grades or poor conduct on his report cards.roa tr.at.
both henry and anderson testified that they never administered more than three strokes during a paddling.roa tr.according to anderson three licks is a maximum.roa.henry testified that the paddlings,including martin paddling,were not hard.roa.he explained that he did not swing hard and instead merely flick ed his wrist.roa tr.henry and anderson testified that nolan attended practice several times a week and never complained about his son being paddled.roa tr.nolan admitted that he was aware his son was being paddled and even saw his son being paddled.roa tr.
martin also claimed that anderson was verbally abusive.in december during an away game in los angeles,anderson allegedly called martin a bitch after he missed a shot.roa tr.anderson testified that he told martin he was playing like a bitch.roa tr.anderson apologized to martin and his parents for the comment.roa tr.
martin told his parents about the los angeles incident.nolan met with hicks,the school principal,to discuss anderson use of verbal harassment when coaching.roa tr.hicks promised to address the issue with anderson.roa tr.following the meeting,nolan sent a letter to hicks.roa tr.nolan letter does not reference corporal punishment.instead,the letter thanked hicks for listening to his concerns and states i t appears that the verbal harassment that my son,martin nolan,and other members of the team have endured from coach anderson is much more serious than i originally thought.roa tr.nolan admitted that he did not voice any concerns about paddling with hicks.roa tr.hicks agreed that nolan never talked to him about anderson paddling or punching martin.roa tr.nolan testified that after he reported anderson use of bad language to hicks,anderson never again used foul language to martin or administered corporal punishment to martin.roa tr.
when he returned home from the los angeles game,martin decided he no longer wanted to play at hamilton and stopped attending practices.roa tr.around that time,martin began receiving anonymous harassing phone calls referring to him as bitch boy and similar epithets.roa tr.as a result,he sought and received a safety transfer from hamilton to central high school.roa tr.
after martin transferred to central he started seeing a psychologist named janet scott.scott testified that she began seeing martin in february.roa tr.she testified that martin counseling centered on two major issues the treatment he was receiving as a basketball player at hamilton and his desire to have a better relationship with his father.roa tr.scott concluded that martin was suffering from mild depression,low,and low confidence.roa tr.according to scott,those symptoms are common in teenagers.roa tr.she subsequently diagnosed him with an adjustment disorder with depressed mood.roa tr.by definition,that diagnosis refers to a transient condition that lasts no longer than six months from its initial onset.roa tr.
on december,the nolans sued the memphis city schools,coaches anderson and henry,principal hicks,and superintendent johnson.the nolans claimed that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy that subjected martin to excessive paddling,assaults,and verbal abuse in violation of and.they also asserted tort claims of assault and battery,negligence,and outrageous conduct.the conspiracy claim was dismissed at the summary judgment stage and the nolans do not appeal that ruling.similarly,the nolans do not appeal the district court grant of a judgment as a matter of law in favor of johnson and hicks,dismissing the nolans claims against those defendants in their individual capacities.roa tr.finally,the nolans have not appealed the jury verdicts in favor of superintendent johnson and principal hicks in their official capacities.accordingly,no issues regarding principal hicks or superintendent johnson liability are before this court.
on appeal,the nolans contend that the district court erred in denying their new trial motion because no reasonable juror could have found for defendant memphis city schools on the negligence claim,for defendants anderson and henry on the assault,battery and outrageous conduct claims,and for defendants anderson,henry and the memphis city schools on the claims the jury instruction on the constitutional tort claim was in error and the court erred in its evidentiary rulings at trial by refusing to permit the nolans to call superintendent johnson in rebuttal and by excluding testimony regarding why anderson and hicks were no longer working for hamilton.defendants anderson,henry,and the memphis city schools argue that the jury verdicts were reasonable and the district court jury instructions and evidentiary rulings proper.
ii.jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction under because the nolans claims arose under federal law.the district court had supplemental jurisdiction over the related state law claims under.this court has appellate jurisdiction under.
iii.standard of review 
the nolans challenge the district court denial of their new trial motion based on the reasonableness of the jury verdicts and the propriety of the court constitutional tort jury instruction and evidentiary rulings.this court reviews a district court denial of a party motion for a new trial under an abuse of discretion standard.morgan new york life ins,cir.reversal is only warranted if the court has a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.barnes fiberglas,cir.
a court can set aside a jury verdict and grant a new trial if the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence however,a new trial may not be granted on that basis unless the verdict was unreasonable.taylor teco barge line,cir.therefore,if a reasonable juror could reach the challenged verdict,a new trial is improper.barnes,at.a verdict is not unreasonable merely because other inferences or conclusions could have been drawn or because other results are more reasonable.strickland owens corning,cir.
similarly,a district court refusal to give a jury instruction is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.taylor,at.the court considers the jury instructions as a whole to determine whether they fairly and adequately submitted the issues and applicable law to the jury.arban west pub,cir.a new trial is not required based on flaws in the jury instructions unless the instructions,taken as a whole,are misleading or give an inadequate understanding of the law.id.
finally,this court reviews a district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.taylor,at.even if a district court evidentiary ruling is erroneous,a new trial is not warranted if the abuse of discretion constituted harmless error.see morales am.honda motor,cir even if a mistake has been made regarding the admission or exclusion of evidence,a new trial will not be granted unless the evidence would have caused a different outcome at trial.broad discretion is given to district courts in determinations of admissibility and those decisions will not be lightly overturned.tompkin philip morris usa,cir.
iv.law analysis 
reasonableness of the jury.assault and battery 
the nolans contend that they were entitled to a new trial because no reasonable jury could have entered a verdict for anderson and henry on their assault and battery claims.under tennessee law,assault is defined as any act tending to do corporal injury to another,accompanied with such circumstances as denote at the time an intention,coupled with the present ability,of using such actual violence against that person.huffman state,overruled on other grounds by state irvin,see also vafaie owens,wl,at,same.battery is defined as a touching of the person of an individual or something intimately associated with,or attached to,his person for an unlawful purpose.lewis metro.sessions for nashville,quoting huffman,at.
by statute,a public school teacher in tennessee is permitted to use corporal punishment in a reasonable manner against any pupil for good cause in order to maintain discipline and order within the public schools.ann.the tennessee supreme court has held that if corporal punishment is moderate and is inflicted with a proper instrument the teacher is as a rule,not liable civilly for assault and battery.marlar bill,internal quotation marks omitted holding teacher who searched a student and principal who inflicted slight punishment with a ruler were not liable for assault and battery.if the punishment is excessive,however,a teacher is potentially subject to civil liability.see,id.at stating o f course,there must be no malice and there must be reasonable ground and the punishment must not be excessive paul mcghee,noting that tennessee law preserves the right of the child not to be subjected to excessive punishment.the determination of whether corporal punishment was administered in a reasonable manner is a question of fact for the jury.hargrove york,wl,at.
the nolans argue that any reasonable juror was compelled to find that henry committed assault and battery because henry admitted that he paddled martin for reasons,including failure to perform basketball skills properly and poor grades.with respect to anderson,they point out that martin testified that anderson punched him in the chest with a closed fist and repeatedly paddled him painfully.they also note that,even though anderson could not specifically recall paddling martin,superintendent johnson testified that she believed anderson violated the school corporal punishment policy by paddling basketball players for missing shots during games and suspended him from coaching as a result.roa tr.
we first address the assault and battery claim against henry.henry admitted that he paddled martin on a few occasions sic teacher referrals and misbehavior during a practice,and i guess not focusing on the practice itself.not focusing meant not paying attention to what was going on or what he should be doing and some of the kids were his friends and they might be horsing around while in the middle of functions or drills.henry also admitted paddling martin infrequently for not using the proper technique in performing a basketball maneuver after he had been shown the technique several times.henry additionally testified 
by plaintiffs counsel okay.now have see,first off,other reasons that paddlings were administered,are you aware or did you yourself administer paddlings because of poor grades or poor conduct grades 
a.one or two occasions i had to give martin corporal punishment because teachers had sent him to me.
okay.now my question again is,did you ever administer corporal punishment to martin because of his report card,because his grades or poor conduct on his report cards 
a.in the three years maybe once or twice.
q.so the answer is yes 
okay.and have you ever witnessed ted anderson administering paddlings to martin for bad grades or bad conduct grades on his report card 
conduct yes,grades i believe so.
colloquy establishing that henry observed this more than one time over three years,but could not say more than five times,because he just did know.
by defense counsel and this last year that martin nolan was at hamilton,that year,were you in an administrative position at hamilton in addition to your coaching duties 
all right.was martin ever sent to you by a teacher to be paddled for something that he had done in class 
and would you administer the punishment 
you have a philosophy or a method of your own coach or coaching style 
yes,i do.i believe that all kids are born smart,they learn to do things that get them in trouble,that including the coaching aspect.i pretty patient and i let them make mistakes because that how they learn.if you shoot a ball and you miss,that a part of it.but working with the technique,even with that i give you an opportunity to self correct or self adjust after i told you,pointed out things.
there occasions when you would have martin leave a practice 
yes.on several occasions toward the end of,in the middle of his junior year after i would talk to martin and try to get him to do his best all the time and that it was not working,i would say,well,martin,when you get ready,you let me know,but right now go get dressed,you do have to practice today.
do you know how many times during the three years that martin nolan was part of the hamilton basketball program that you actually administered a paddling to him 
maybe ten times in two and a half years.
all right.how many of those would have been related to basketball as opposed to a teacher sending you a note regarding something happening in school 
maybe percent basketball,percent teacher referrals.
taken as a whole,the jury could have understood this testimony to mean that henry paddled martin on several occasions because martin was referred by teachers based on his conduct during class,that henry might have paddled him once or twice for a bad conduct grade on his report card,and that he also paddled him occasionally for improper basketball techniques when he perceived the improper techniques were the product of martin not paying attention or horsing around during practice.the jury could have rejected martin account of the paddlings and concluded that plaintiffs failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that henry paddled martin for bad academic grades,as distinguished from bad conduct grades,or for deficiencies in his basketball performance unrelated to issues of discipline and order during practice.thus,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for new trial as to the assault and battery claim against henry.
as to anderson,the evidence was not sufficient to show that anderson violated the school policy on corporal punishment.plaintiffs were required to show that anderson committed the tort of assault and battery on martin.after admitting that he and henry administered paddlings for bad grades on report cards to emphasize the importance of academics,anderson testified 
by plaintiffs counsel but you did paddle martin on several occasions for bad grades,correct 
several,maybe several,but i paddled martin very rarely because martin was a good kid,and i presume still is,martin did cause a lot of problems.
i sit sic here yesterday in disbelief with the number of paddlings that we were accused of.i rarely had to paddle martin.martin was a good kid,he did get into trouble and he made good grades,so there would have been any reason for me to paddle him.
okay.now so how often,since we got a little bit of reverse testimony here,martin saying two or three times a week and you saying rarely,about how often did you paddle martin according to you 
maybe three times during his whole tenure at hamilton high school.
q.during three years from the ninth to the eleventh grades you paddled him three times 
i saying three,sir.i actually right here do even recall having ever paddled martin,i really do,because martin never got would have had any reason to paddle martin.martin was a good kid,he never got in any trouble,not a teacher every sic sent me anything that i can recall on martin.
q.so now it your testimony that you do recall ever paddling martin 
i do recall it,but i may have.i mean,i ca just remember a is a time that i remember martin,i just ca pick a time out of my head that i remember paddling martin.but would say that i probably did,you know,but i do know,you know,as far as in excess of any exorbitant number,no,sir,i did.
and your program includes paddling the basketball players,correct 
a.it includes paddling the basketball players for misbehaving mostly,yes,sir.if they misbehave,yes,sir.
as with henry,the jury could have rejected martin account of the paddlings,and reasonably concluded that anderson admissions did not establish that he in fact paddled martin for reasons.
as to the paddlings themselves,there was ample evidence presented at trial suggesting that anderson and henry administration of corporal punishment was not excessive and,therefore,did not give rise to civil liability for assault and battery as a threshold consideration,the jurors were free to credit anderson testimony that he never punched martin and that he only paddled martin at most three times in a year period.similarly,henry testified that he only paddled martin a total of ten times during martin tenure at hamilton.the jury could also find credible anderson and henry testimony that they never struck a student,including martin,more than three times in a paddling session and henry assertion that he did not hit hard.furthermore,the nolans stipulated that martin was not seriously injured from the paddlings,which supports the conclusion that the paddlings were not excessive.
the defense also presented evidence from which the jury could reasonably conclude that anderson and henry did not paddle martin out of malice.see hargrove,wl,at noting that a teacher may be liable where he abuses his disciplinary power as a cover for malice.anderson testified that basketball players were primarily paddled for misbehavior,that he paddled students for poor grades because of the great importance of academics to the basketball program,and that he very rarely paddled for poor performance.roa tr.he also testified that he paddled martin very rarely because martin was a good kid he did get into trouble and he made good grades.roa tr.henry testified that he paddled martin based on misbehavior at practice,bad grades or conduct on his report card,and teacher referrals for misbehavior in other classes.roa tr.finally,the record supported that anderson and henry administered corporal punishment with a proper instrument,a wooden paddle known as the wood.roa tr.
from all of the evidence,a reasonable juror could conclude that the paddlings administered by anderson and henry were for disciplinary purposes,and were not excessive in severity,frequency,motivation,or means.therefore,the district court acted within its discretion by denying the nolans motion for a new trial because a reasonable juror could have found that anderson and henry were not liable for assault and battery.
corporal punishment substantive due process claims under 
the nolans argue that they should have been granted a new trial because no reasonable juror could have entered a verdict for defendants anderson,henry,or the memphis city schools on their substantive due process claim under.the threshold question in a claim is whether the plaintiff has been deprived of a right secured by the constitution and laws.lillard shelby cty.bd.of,cir quoting baker mccollan,d,internal quotation marks omitted.like all individuals,public school students have a fourteenth amendment liberty interest in freedom from bodily injury.webb mccullough,cir.
to demonstrate that anderson and henry use of corporal punishment at school violated martin fourteenth amendment substantive due process rights,however,the nolans were required to prove that the force applied caused injury so severe,was so disproportionate to the need presented,and was so inspired by malice or sadism rather than a merely careless or unwise excess of zeal that it amounted to a brutal and inhumane abuse of official power literally shocking to the conscience.ellis ex rel.pendergrass cleveland mun.sch,cir.as discussed supra,the severity and frequency of,as well as the motivation for,martin paddlings were contested at trial.
on appeal,the nolans argue that anderson and henry administration of corporal punishment cause d severe injury to martin,including both physical pain and psychological injury.appellants br.at trial,however,the nolans stipulated that martin was not seriously injured.roa tr.they also failed to produce medical evidence that any physical injury resulted from the paddlings.
furthermore,there was sufficient evidence presented to support the jury conclusion that anderson and henry actions did not cause severe,injury,were not motivated by malice,and,therefore,did not rise to the level of a substantive due process violation.anderson and henry both testified that they rarely paddled martin and that when they did so they never exceeded a three lick maximum number of blows.henry explained that when he paddled students he did not hit hard.anderson testified that he never punched martin,did not swear at him excessively,and that he apologized to martin and his family in the one instance whe
