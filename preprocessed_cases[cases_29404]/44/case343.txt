this suit under asserting excessive force and conspiracy claims raises two interesting issues not directly addressed before by this circuit.the first is whether the supreme court decision in heck humphrey,d,bars the civil rights claim asserting excessive force brought by plaintiff thore,who earlier pled guilty to state criminal charges,arising from the same event,of assault with a dangerous weapon on police officers.the second issue is whether thore is judicially estopped from asserting facts inconsistent with the facts to which thore agreed during the plea colloquy.thore admits that if he is judicially estopped from asserting facts inconsistent with the plea colloquy,then his excessive force claim can not succeed.
on february,charles thore pled guilty in state court to several charges,including three counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon to wit,a car on three police officers,one count of assault and battery,one count of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol,one count of operating after suspension,and one count of operating to endanger.the charges stemmed from his drunken driving encounter with police officers on october,during which thore was shot in the neck by fitchburg police officer jeffrey howe.six other fitchburg police officers and three massachusetts state police detectives also were involved.
during his plea colloquy,thore,who was represented by counsel,said that he agreed with an account of the facts stated by the prosecution.thore knowingly and voluntarily pled guilty.as a result of his plea bargain,thore received the benefit of a joint sentencing recommendation of a sentence of imprisonment,which was accepted by the court.he avoided a potential sentence,and had the benefit of dismissal of other charges.
in august,thore brought an action in state superior court under against the officers the case was removed to federal court.his original complaint alleged that officer howe had used excessive force in shooting him and had engaged in assault and battery.after discovery,he amended his complaint in november,adding claims that six fitchburg police officers,three massachusetts state police detectives who investigated officer howe use of force,and officer howe had all conspired to cover up the circumstances of the shooting and had maliciously abused process.
the district court entered summary judgment for all defendants in a thoughtful opinion.the court held that the doctrine of judicial estoppel barred thore from asserting facts inconsistent with the facts to which he admitted during his plea colloquy in the worcester superior court.as a result,the court reasoned,thore excessive force and state law assault and battery claims failed to overcome officer howe qualified immunity.the district court also held that heck humphrey barred assertion of the malicious abuse of process and conspiracy claims against all defendants and that,in any event,no claim was stated under as to either malicious abuse of process or conspiracy.the court did not reach the heck issue as to the excessive force claim.
thore appeals,arguing that judicial estoppel should not apply to bar him from asserting inconsistent facts because he now has evidence that some of the facts asserted at the plea colloquy are not true.he also argues that heck humphrey does not bar him from asserting any of his claims.he concedes that if judicial estoppel applies,then the district court was correct in entering judgment for officer howe on the excessive force claim.he does not appeal the dismissal of the abuse of process claim.
thore pled guilty to three counts of assault and battery with a deadly weapon a car,see.laws ch.b,as well as other crimes.under massachusetts law,assault and battery may be proven using two alternate theories.under the first,an assault and battery is the intentional and unjustified use of force upon the person of another,however slight.commonwealth burno,quoting commonwealth mccan,internal quotation marks omitted.under the second theory,assault and battery is the intentional commission of a wanton or reckless act something more than gross negligence causing physical or bodily injury to another.id.at.in massachusetts,assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon is a general intent crime,and there is no requirement that the commonwealth must prove the defendant had a specific intent to injure the victim.to find the requisite intent,however,the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the touching did not happen accidentally.commonwealth ford,citations omitted.
we start with the facts the prosecution recited and to which thore agreed at his plea colloquy in state court 
on october,at approximately,sergeant glen n fossa of the fitchburg police department while off duty observed a blue volkswag e n operating erratically on john fitch highway in fitchburg,massachusetts.the john fitch highway is a public way in the city of fitchburg.the blue volkswag e n almost struck the passenger side of the vehicle occupied by sergeant fossa.both vehicles stopped.the operator of the blue volkswag e n,charles thore,the defendant,started to get out of the vehicle he was operating and began yelling at sergeant fossa.sergeant fossa observed that thore appeared to be having a confrontation with a female passenger in his vehicle.the female passenger was later identified as jessilyn chabot.thore got back in the blue volkswag e n and began to drive away wildly,passing cars in the lanes of the john fitch highway.sergeant fossa reported the blue volkswag e n to the fitchburg police department.
sergeant john kell e y and officer matthew dibara responded to the john fitch highway.sergeant fossa pointed out the blue volkswag e n to the responding fitchburg officers.sergeant fossa observed thore holding miss chabot in a headlock,and he appeared to be hitting struggling with miss chabot.miss chabot reported that thore was choking her and that he slapped her in the face twice because she was breaking up with him.miss chabot was pregnant with thore child at the time.
officer dibara approached the blue volkswag e n and instructed thore to please turn off the engine and step from the vehicle.thore did not comply and eventually placed the vehicle in reverse and accelerated.officer dibara reached into an open window and attempted to stop the blue volkswag e n out of concern for the safety of miss chabot.officer dibara held onto thore as he was dragged somewhat and was forced to run at times to keep pace with the vehicle.officer dibara disengaged after about feet,fearing for his life.at times throughout the incident the blue volkswag e n operated by thore came into contact with officer dibara.
thore attempted to flee through the parking lot but was headed off by sergeant kell e y and fitchburg police officer jeffrey howe,who were operating separate police cruisers.thore began to strike both cruisers operated by sergeant kell e y and officer howe with the blue volkswag e 
at one point officer dibara ordered thore to stop at gunpoint.thore looked at officer dibara and stated,fucking shoot me.officer dibara his weapon and attempted to pull thore from the vehicle.thore again accelerated,broke free,and struck officer howe cruiser on the driver door,pushing officer howe and his cruiser into a tractor trailer truck and nearly striking officer dibara.officer dibara heard thore vehicle revving as thore was apparently attempting to move the blue volkswag e n in an unknown direction.fearing for his life,and that of officer dibara,officer howe fired three shots from his firearm at this point.one round struck thore in the neck.
this is a matter of record there is no disagreement that thore agreed to these facts.
thore argues that the facts to which he admitted are not true as to whether the officers were endangered or in fear for their lives.he argues he can prove this through the testimony of a disinterested witness,one jon laro,the truck driver under whose truck officer howe cruiser was pushed.laro,at deposition in this case,gave a markedly different version of the events that contradicted those a recited in the plea colloquy and b contained in the two statements the police recorded on interviewing laro,which laro signed shortly after the event and which fully supported the facts recited at the colloquy.at deposition,laro said that thore car,a blue volkswagen,had not struck the police cars,but that the police cars had repeatedly struck thore car and had him boxed in so his car could not move.the witness stated the officers were never placed in danger by thore and that officer howe had no reason to shoot thore 
they really had him stopped,pinned down when they had him up against that building to be honest with you.to me,i do know,maybe if i was a police officer i think i would have just shot the guy tires.he ai going nowhere,you know,i do know.i did really feel there was a need to shoot the kid let put it that way.i know the kid was right but they were right and two wrongs do make a right and that what happened here.
by contrast,the typed notes of detective kymalainen interview with laro on october,present a different picture of what laro saw 
police after the car hit cruiser five what did it do 
laro the car engine revved and he went flying in reverse away from the police car,he turned hard right in reverse and backed into a parked car about fifteen feet maybe.he was out of control backing up,i thought for sure he was going to hit one of the cops that was near his car.
where were the police officers 
i think there were two officers,there may have been more,but i remember they ran past my tractor towards the blue car after it struck cruiser five.there were a couple of seconds were sic the car was stopped after it hit car five.the cops ran to the car,i saw them with their guns out,when they got near the car they pointed their guns at him and yelled at the guy to get out of the car.those officers yelled at the man to get out,they were very loud.i heard the officer shout several times to get out of the car.the guy did get out,he just jammed it in reverse and went backwards,it was lucky nobody did get hit because he almost ran them over.
prior to the shots what did you think the operator of the blue car was going to do after it struck the parked car 
a.it was going to try and get away again,there was nothing stopping this guy,he was like a lunatic.i really thought the guy was going to run those officers over.
as noted,laro signed the statement on or about october.this typed interview is entirely consistent with handwritten interview notes,which laro also signed and initialed.laro testified he does recall being interviewed,but denied saying a number of things that are recorded in the notes.thore maintains the police forged the notes as part of a cover up.
thore argues that until laro deposition,he had simply relied on the reports the police had given him as to laro account of the events and that this induced him to plead guilty.he says that had he known laro true account,he would not have pled guilty or admitted to certain facts.he points out that he has no memory of events after being shot.he argues there was a conspiracy by the fitchburg and state police to misstate the evidence of the witness,and thus create,after the fact,a justification for the shooting.
thore also argues he should be permitted to prove that the police knew that he was not armed because his girlfriend told them,that his car was boxed in by the cruisers and so his own car could not move or harm the officers,and that the officers were never endangered.based on those facts,he argues that under the standards of brosseau haugen,d,and graham connor,d,it was objectively unreasonable for an officer to shoot him.
the order appealed from grants summary judgment to defendants.our review of entry of summary judgment is de novo.see nelson kline,cir.we note,however,that summary judgment is a bit of a misnomer here.at issue are several matters which are committed to the district court,not a jury,in the first instance.whether the case states a viable claim in the first place and whether the case states a viable claim in light of heck are issues of law for the court.similarly,whether to apply the judicial estoppel doctrine is also an issue for the court,not the jury,to decide.see new hampshire maine,d j udicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine invoked by a court at its discretion.quoting russell rolfs,cir.as to the application of these doctrines,there is no dispute that if plaintiff fails to state a claim,if heck bars the claim,or if judicial estoppel binds thore to the facts stated at the plea colloquy,then the case must be dismissed.
a.the conspiracy claim 
the district court correctly dismissed the conspiracy count for failure to state a claim.thore alleged in his amended complaint that officer howe,six other fitchburg police officers,and three massachusetts state police detectives conspired against him to justify the illegal shooting by officer jeffrey howe,thereby violating his constitutional right to be free from the use of a conspiracy by persons acting under color of law.however,there is no such constitutional right,nor is there any federal law guaranteeing freedom from conspiracy.
it is important to note that w hile conspiracies may be actionable under section,it is necessary that there have been,besides the agreement among conspirators,an actual deprivation of a right secured by the constitution and laws.landrigan city of warwick,cir see also santiago fenton,cir earle benoit,cir.thus,an allegation of conspiracy to deprive someone of,say,his constitutional right to due process states a claim under,slotnick staviskey,cir,but an allegation of conspiracy to justify an illegal shooting does not.
thore failed to identify in his amended complaint a federally protected right of which he was deprived by the alleged conspiracy.he acknowledges as much on appeal by now attempting to cast his claim as a conspiracy to deprive him of his right of action for excessive force.in landrigan,we assume d,without deciding,that a claim alleging deprivation of a right of action,sufficiently advanced,could have amounted to an actionable deprivation of federally protected rights.at.here,however,thore claim is not sufficiently advanced to merit our consideration of this issue.thore has conceded that his claim is not precisely pled we further find that,contrary to plaintiff contention,the gravamen of his claim does not make out an alleged deprivation of his right of action.thore merely asserted that the defendants,under color of law,conspired to justify the shooting,and that this violated his constitutional rights.under these circumstances,we decline to rewrite thore complaint by inserting legal claims not mentioned therein.pujol.express,cir rejecting plaintiffs invitation to construe their complaint as containing elements of certain rico violations when it did not state so directly.
b.the excessive force claim 
defendant howe argues that heck humphrey bars thore claim for excessive force.he also argues that the doctrine of judicial estoppel justifies the district court entry of summary judgment in his favor.
the heck humphrey rule 
in heck humphrey,the supreme court held that where a suit for damages would necessarily imply the invalidity of an inmate conviction,or necessarily imply the invalidity of the length of any inmate sentence,such a claim is not cognizable under unless and until the inmate obtains favorable resolution of a challenge to his conviction.heck,at.as a result,the district court must consider the relationship between the claim and the conviction,including asking whether the plaintiff could prevail only by negat ing an element of the offense of which he was convicted.id.at.only if a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction or sentence does the court go on to ask whether that conviction or sentence has in fact been invalidated.id.at.
thore argues that his claim does not necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction.the supreme court has,in many civil rights actions,including in heck,held that a claim is stated where there is no necessary implication of the invalidity of the conviction.see id.at.see also hill mcdonough,d wilkinson dotson,d nelson campbell,d muhammad close,d.
similarly,in figueroa rivera,cir,this court held that heck did not bar a prisoner claim arising from alleged indifference to an inmate medical needs,but did bar a claim for wrongful conviction and imprisonment.id.at.notably,figueroa also held that there are no equitable exceptions to the heck rule.id.at.
a excessive force claim brought against a police officer that arises out of the officer use of force during an arrest does not necessarily call into question the validity of an underlying state conviction and so is not barred by heck.see,vangilder baker,cir.
even the fact that defendant was convicted of assault on a police officer does not,under heck,as a matter of law necessarily bar a claim of excessive force.see smithart towery,cir see also ballard burton,cir holding that a state conviction for simple assault did not necessarily imply that the defendant did not use excessive force.
in this case thore asserts two theories.the first is that he was not guilty of assault at all,and so officer howe use of force was excessive.that theory is plainly barred by heck.
the more modest second theory is that his excessive force claim need not impugn his convictions for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon in order to establish that officer howe used excessive force.thore says that even if his car had previously hit the cruisers and brushed officer dibara body,by the time of the shooting,thore was stationary in a car,boxed in with nowhere to go,and posed no threat to the officers,who had been told that he had no gun.
just as it is true that a excessive force claim after an assault conviction is not necessarily barred by heck,it is also true that it is not necessarily free from heck.the excessive force claim and the conviction may be so interrelated factually as to bar the claim.see,cunningham gates,cir.
officer howe argues,relying on cunningham,that this is such a case that thore third conviction for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon was based on his refusal to obey commands to get out of his car,and on his gunning his engine to start to get away.in doing so,he endangered the two officers officer dibara on foot and officer howe in his cruiser.we can not tell from the record before us whether this is so.
while we conclude that heck does not automatically bar consideration of an excessive force claim by an individual who has been convicted of assault,the record before us does not permit a determination of the requisite relatedness.accordingly,we move on to consider whether thore is barred by judicial estoppel from denying the facts he admitted in the plea colloquy.
judicial estoppel 
we provide some background on the judicial estoppel doctrine.before the supreme court addressed the use of judicial estoppel doctrine in federal courts,this court had permitted invocation of the doctrine.see,patriot cinemas,cinemas,cir binding party to its prior representation that it would not pursue a claim.
in new hampshire maine,the supreme court held that judicial estoppel could be utilized in the federal courts.at.the court defined judicial estoppel as a doctrine which generally prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase.id.at.quoting pegram herdrich,d internal quotation marks omitted.unlike the doctrine of issue preclusion,judicial estoppel does not require that the issue have been actually litigated in the prior proceeding.id.at.moore federal practice,at ed.
in new hampshire,the court recognized that,although new hampshire was equitably barred from asserting a position concerning a river boundary contrary to a position it had taken in earlier litigation which had culminated in a consent decree,judicial estoppel might be inappropriate when a party prior position was based on inadvertence or mistake.new hampshire,at.but the court rejected new hampshire mistake argument that it had failed to do searching historic research earlier,and that if new hampshire had known then what it knew now,it would not have entered into the consent decree.id.at.the court noted that new hampshire had had every incentive to do that research earlier.id.at.the court also noted that the state inconsistent position would give new hampshire an advantage at maine expense.id.at.furthermore,it is clear that new hampshire inconsistent position presented the risk of inconsistent outcomes in the supreme court.the court had,in the earlier litigation,determined for itself that new hampshire earlier position was consistent with the evidence,id.at,and had relied on that position in approving the earlier consent decree,id.at.
the contours of the judicial estoppel doctrine are not sharply defined,and there is no mechanical test for determining its applicability.see id.at.new hampshire recognized that the purpose of the doctrine is to protect the integrity of the judicial process.id.at.the court identified several factors which inform the decision whether to apply the doctrine,but also stressed these were neither inflexible prerequisites or an exhaustive formula.id.at.the first factor is whether the party later position is clearly inconsistent with its earlier position that inconsistency is conceded in this case.the second is whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept the party earlier position,so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception of inconsistent court determinations,suggesting that either the first or second court was misled.the third consideration is whether an unfair advantage or detriment would be created.see id.at.
this court construed the new hampshire decision in alternative system concepts,synopsys,cir,and held that generally,judicial estoppel would not attach unless 
the estopping position and the estopped position are directly inconsistent and 
the responsible party succeeded in persuading a court to have accepted its prior position.
id.at.this court also rejected as a prerequisite to application of the doctrine that the party asserting the inconsistent position be shown to have benefitted from the court acceptance of the party initial position id.
this case involves the particular branch of the doctrine that prohibits a party from asserting historic facts as opposed to legal theories that are inconsistent with historic facts the party has agreed to in a prior court proceeding of particular significance is that the prior proceeding was a criminal proceeding and the facts were not found by a court or jury,but were agreed to as part of a plea bargain.we note that although judicial estoppel does not usually apply to approved settlements,in re bankvest capital,cir,plea agreements are certainly reviewed by a court.
as to our standard of review,the question before us is partially one of law,which we review de novo.see united states leja,cir the district court resolution of legal questions is reviewed de novo.montrose med.group participating sav.plan bulger,cir de novo review of questions of law about judicial estoppel.the standard of review is also partially one of application of law to facts and exercise of judgment by the district court,which we review for abuse of discretion.alternative.concepts,at holding that the appropriate standard for reviewing a trial court application of the doctrine of judicial estoppel is abuse of discretion emphasis added.
guilty pleas and judicial estoppel 
as for the question of law,the defendants argue for a rule that admissions to facts at an earlier guilty plea colloquy by a criminal defendant should generally bind that person as a plaintiff in subsequent civil rights actions.we reject any such per se rule.there is reason for caution.
the seminal case,relied on by defendants for the proposition that judicial estoppel should,as a rule,apply to facts admitted during guilty pleas,is lowery stovall,cir.see,johnson lindon city,cir relying on lowery.in lowery,a civil plaintiff who had pled guilty to maliciously causing bodily injury to a police officer with intent to kill sued the police for excessive use of force.at.in language,the lowery court said 
particularly galling is the situation
