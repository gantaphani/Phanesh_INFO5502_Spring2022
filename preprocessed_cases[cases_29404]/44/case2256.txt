in february,officer ruth received a dispatch that a man,later identified as christopher mccargo,was running up and down the street,hallucinating and otherwise behaving bizarrely.when officer ruth arrived at the scene,mccargo told officer ruth that he had smoked crack cocaine.shortly thereafter,the emergency medical services ems arrived,and,after examining mccargo,decided not to take him to the hospital.a factual dispute exists regarding whether officer ruth told the emergency medical technicians emts that mccargo had been behaving in a bizarre manner and that mccargo had admitted smoking crack cocaine.it is unclear whether mccargo affirmatively refused medical treatment or remained silent when asked if he needed help.
officer ruth arrested mccargo for public intoxication and transported him to the bradley county justice center.witnesses at the scene and officer ruth testified that mccargo kicked violently once placed into the back seat of the car.when officer ruth arrived at the jail,bradley county jail officers,including a nurse,noticed mccargo rocking back and forth stating do let the dogs get me.the nurse performed another medical exam before checking mccargo into the jail,though officer ruth told them that the emts at the scene had already cleared him.testimony differs as to whether officer ruth told the bradley county jail officers that mccargo admitted smoking crack cocaine and that the emts had noticed something white in mccargo mouth 
as mccargo continued to hallucinate,jail officers placed him in a restraint chair for his own safety,tasing him to relax his muscles.mccargo remained restrained for approximately three and a half hours,during which time he was calm but continued to hallucinate.shortly after the officers released him from the chair,mccargo began to shake and spit up blood and then became unconscious.ems personnel took mccargo to the hospital where he was diagnosed with respiratory and cardiac failure and failure resulting from cocaine use.mccargo lapsed into a coma from which he never recovered.he died eleven months later.
at the time that officer ruth encountered mccargo,two conflicting police department policies regarding the transportation of individuals for medical services existed.one policy instructed police who encountered detainees exhibiting signs of excited delirium to transport them to the hospital for treatment,making no provision for officers to engage the services of an ems vehicle instead however,police chief wes snyder concurrent written memorandum prohibited his officers from transporting any individual to the hospital in a police vehicle for medical services.plaintiffs claim that this policy caused officer ruth not to transport mccargo to the hospital himself,resulting in his death.
plaintiffs filed their original complaint in the circuit court of bradley county,tennessee.the defendants removed the case to the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee.the defendants timely filed motions for summary judgment asserting various defenses including qualified immunity.summary judgment was granted for defendants on all grounds but two ruth request for summary judgment on the basis that he was protected by qualified immunity against the charge of violating mccargo fourteenth amendment right to adequate medical care and the city request for summary judgment on plaintiffs theory as to police chief synder no transport policy.ruth and the city timely sought interlocutory review of these rulings.
