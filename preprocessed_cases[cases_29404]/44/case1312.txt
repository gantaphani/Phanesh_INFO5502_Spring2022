we are asked to review the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of individual and municipal defendants in a suit brought pursuant and pennsylvania wrongful death and survival statutes.ann.the suit arises from the jailhouse suicide of a detainee.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm.
on july,richard lee woloszyn,was arrested by local police after attempting to burglarize a private residence in ellwood city,pennsylvania.the officers took woloszyn to the ellwood city police station where he voluntarily waived his right to counsel and signed a statement admitting the illegal entry.following arraignment on those charges,police took woloszyn to the lawrence county correctional facility lccf where he was to be held.in an incident investigation report,officer list wrote that on the way to the lccf,he and lieutenant gilchrist spoke with woloszyn who appeared to be in good spirits and was joking.officer list also wrote 
he told us how he got caught cheating on his wife with the neighbor lady.i told him he better watch that his wife might kick his butt.he advised us that he was lucky that they did have a gun in his house because she would have shot him years ago.then he said maybe that might have been the best thing for everybody.i told him not to talk like that.
according to list,woloszyn appeared to be in good spirits when they arrived at the lccf.in his deposition,list testified that woloszyn did not show any signs of depression on the way to the lccf.on the contrary,list testified that woloszyn was in fairly good spirits and was talking and joking with us.
after arriving at the lccf,woloszyn was interviewed by correction officer linda.in her affidavit,she stated that while he was being booked,woloszyn 
was very remorseful and distant.he was not answering my questions,but wanted to talk about how he had failed as a father and a person.he talked about how when he was young the children would come to him,but now they would go to his wife instead,he said that really hurts me.he said that he was glad that he got caught because he wanted it to stop,he was on a hour rampage,he had done every drug possible from alcohol to heroin,to crack cocaine and acid.
asked captain adamo to keep woloszyn in the booking area rather than assign him to a cell.she claimed that adamo initially agreed,but changed his mind after annette houck,the lccf nurse on duty,cleared woloszyn for housing unit b hb unit.prisoners are placed there for observation before being placed in the general jail population.according to,adamo told her that he would put woloszyn on five minute checks.however,adamo also said that he would follow the nurse advice.
testified in her deposition that woloszyn told her that he was not suicidal.one of the questions on the lccf booking questionnaire asked if the inmate conversation or actions suggest the risk of suicide and had a place to check either yes or no.completed that form by checking,no.
nurse houck performed a medical assessment of woloszyn at the lccf.woloszyn was polite,cooperative,alert and not agitated.his respiration and blood pressure were normal and he was oriented to person,place and time.although the nurse was aware that woloszyn had claimed to be under the influence of street drugs,he did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol during her assessment.woloszyn told houck that he was not being treated by a psychiatrist and had no psychiatric history.according to houck,woloszyn did not request a counselor or physician at any point during his medical assessment.based upon her medical assessment,houck did not believe that woloszyn should be placed on suicide watch.in her opinion,there was no indication that he intended to harm himself.she therefore informed adamo that woloszyn was medically stable and could be placed in the hb unit.she did,however,recommend that woloszyn be checked hourly for signs of alcohol withdrawal.consistent with houck recommendation,adamo placed woloszyn on one hour checks based upon concerns related to alcohol withdrawal.
correction officer sainato escorted woloszyn from the booking area to hb unit.he did not observe anything unusual about woloszyn mood or behavior.correction officer graziani,the officer on duty in the hb unit when woloszyn arrived there at,also noticed nothing unusual or remarkable about woloszyn behavior.when woloszyn arrived in hb unit woloszyn was able to state and spell his name when graziani asked him to,and graziani then placed woloszyn in his cell.when graziani later asked woloszyn what kind of drink he wanted in the morning,woloszyn yelled back that he wanted juice.
the record also contains an unsworn statement from wayne shaftic,an inmate in the cell next to woloszyn.shaftic claims that woloszyn requested a counselor,and that woloszyn was yelling,screaming,and kicking for more than minutes,but that no one responded.specifically,shaftic statement said,in relevant part 
you could tell the kid was strung out.he was confused he wanted to see a counselor and was told to go to his cell,lay it down and they would contact a counselor in the morning.he said he should be here,that he needed a counselor.he said he needed help,he did belong here i hear the kid in the cell going nuts,yelling and screaming and punching the metal top bunk.the kid was loud,real loud and the kid was screaming loudly.he screamed disjointedly about himself like self blame.i could tell he was kicking his locker also.it was a constant commotion for at least minutes until i talked to him.no one had come up to his cell.the guard at the desk all of this time was matthew graziani and he was looking thru vacation brochures.he never made a walk around until i started to talk to the kid woloszyn said he had been partying for the last days and he could not be in this needed to get out of the cell i believe graziani made his walk around about and i watched him.that day graziani never even looked in our cells.he did say anything and did look our way.he walked past us,went to the end,turned around and walked past us a second time.
prisoners in the hb unit were checked every minutes at,graziani began to check the hb unit.he finished by.at approximately,graziani found woloszyn hanging by the neck in his cell.woloszyn had apparently taken a sheet from his cell bunk,tied it to an unscreened ceiling vent in his cell,and hanged himself.graziani called a code blue and attempted to prop woloszyn up to alleviate the pressure on his neck.correction officers sainato and stiles then entered the cell and assisted graziani in untying the sheet that was knotted around woloszyn neck.they checked woloszyn pulse and respiration,and found none.
stiles and graziani then began performing cpr while another corrections officer was sent for a protective breathing mask although a protective mask should have been kept in the hb unit,none could be found.however,officers graziani and stiles began taking turns performing chest compression and resuscitation without waiting for a protective breathing mask.when the mask finally did arrive,graziani initially inserted it backwards.the error was immediately corrected however,and thereafter the mask was used properly as officers graziani,stiles,piatt and took turns performing resuscitation and chest compressions.they continued until paramedics arrived and took woloszyn to the hospital where he died.
ii.district court proceedings 
woloszyn widow,patricia,filed the instant action and state wrongful death and survival actions against lawrence county,william hall,the warden of lccf,and correction officers graziani and sainato.woloszyn filed the action in her capacity as administratrix of woloszyn estate.to state a claim under,a plaintiff must allege both a deprivation of a federally protected right and that this deprivation was committed by one acting under color of state law.lake arnold,cir.woloszyn alleged violations of woloszyn eighth and fourteenth amendment rights the defendants filed an answer denying liability.after discovery,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment,and this appeal followed.
iii.discussion 
we exercise plenary review of the district court grant of summary judgment.curley klem,cir.w e review the record to determine whether the defendants,the moving parties,have demonstrated that there is no genuine issue of material fact.colburn upper darby township,cir.in order to defeat the defendants motion,the plaintiff must introduce more than a scintilla of evidence showing that there is a genuine issue for trial she must introduce evidence from which a rational finder of fact could find in her favor.id.citation and internal quotations omitted.
woloszyn presents two arguments in her appeal.first,she argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to correction officer graziani because he failed to make five minute checks on woloszyn and failed to have a breathing mask available in a proper location in hb unit.second,she argues that it was error to grant summary judgment to lawrence county and warden hall because the lccf failed to have adequate polices,procedures and training in place.
general legal principles.
woloszyn was a detainee when he committed suicide.we first examined liability under for such suicides in colburn upper darby township,cir colburn i.there,we held that if custodial officials know or should know of the particular vulnerability to suicide of an inmate,then the fourteenth amendment imposes on them an obligation not to act with reckless indifference to that vulnerability.id.at.we later elaborated upon that standard in colburn upper darby township,cir colburn ii,where we wrote that 
a plaintiff in a prison suicide case has the burden of establishing three elements the detainee had a particular vulnerability to suicide,the custodial officer or officers knew or should have known of that vulnerability,and those officers acted with reckless indifference to the detainee particular vulnerability.
colburn ii,at.
in colburn ii,we explained that colburn i rested primarily upon the supreme court decision in estelle gamble,d.estelle involved an eighth amendment claim arising from allegations of inadequate medical care colburn ii,at.we noted in colburn ii that the supreme court held in estelle,that prison officials violate the eighth amendment proscription of cruel and unusual punishment when they exhibit deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners.colburn ii,at.citing estelle,at.the estelle standard requires deliberate indifference on the part of prison officials and that the prisoner medical needs be serious.colburn ii,at quoting monmouth county correctional inst.inmates lanzaro,cir.
the detainee condition must be such that a failure to treat can be expected to lead to substantial and unnecessary suffering,injury,or death.moreover,the condition must be one that has been diagnosed by a physician as requiring treatment or one that is so obvious that a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for a doctor attention.
colburn ii,at citation and internal quotations omitted.
a particular vulnerability to suicide represents a serious medical need.colburn ii,at.the requirement of a particular vulnerability to suicide speaks to the degree of risk inherent in the detainee condition.colburn ii,at.t here must be a strong likelihood,rather than a mere possibility,that harm will occur.id.citations omitted.
however,e ven where a strong likelihood of suicide exists,it must be shown that the custodial officials knew or should have known of that strong likelihood.colburn ii,at.i t is not necessary that the custodian have a subjective appreciation of the detainee particular vulnerability.id.at.nevertheless,there can be no reckless or deliberate indifference to that risk unless there is something more culpable on the part of the officials than a negligent failure to recognize the high risk of suicide.id.at.therefore,the should have known element 
does not refer to a failure to note a risk that would be perceived with the use of ordinary prudence.it connotes something more than a negligent failure to appreciate the risk of suicide presented by a particular detainee,though something less than subjective appreciation of that risk.the strong likelihood of suicide must be so obvious that a lay person would easily recognize the necessity for preventative action the risk of injury must not only be great,but also sufficiently apparent that a lay custodian failure to appreciate it evidences an absence of any concern for the welfare of his or her charges.
id.citation and internal quotations omitted.
n either the due process clause with its focus on arbitrariness and abuse of power,nor the eighth amendment with its focus on the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,imposes liability for a negligent failure to protect a detainee from injury.at.we referred to that level of culpability as reckless indifference in colburn at.in williams borough of west chester,cir,a case decided after colburn i but before colburn ii,we referred to the heightened culpability that is required as deliberate indifference.however,we did not elaborate upon those terms in either case.it was not necessary to elaborate upon either term in colburn ii.instead,we simply said that a level of culpability higher than a negligent failure to protect from harm is required and this requirement is relevant to an evaluation of the first two colburn i elements as well as the third.at.
the phrase,deliberate indifference first appeared in estelle gamble,at.however,the court did not define the term with precision.rather,the court explained that it was a state of mind more blameworthy than negligence.farmer brennan,d.the court did more precisely define the phrase in farmer brennan.however,there,the court was referring to the degree of culpability that would support liability under the eighth amendment.the court explained 
a prison official can not be found liable under the eighth amendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health and safety the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,and he must also draw the inference.
in whetzel,cir,we placed the following gloss on farmer 
to be liable on a deliberate indifference claim,a prison official must both know of and disregard an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.the element of deliberate indifference is subjective,not objective meaning that the official must actually be aware of the existence of the excessive risk it is not sufficient that the official should have been aware.however,subjective knowledge on the part of the official can be proved by circumstantial evidence to the effect that the excessive risk was so obvious that the official must have known of the risk.finally,a defendant can rebut a prima facie demonstration of deliberate indifference either by establishing that he did not have the requisite level of knowledge or awareness of the risk,or that,although he did know of the risk,he took reasonable steps to prevent the harm from occurring.
at citations,internal quotations and brackets omitted.
farmer defined deliberate indifference in the context of the claim of a convicted prisoner under the eighth amendment.it does not,therefore,directly control our analysis here because,as we have explained,woloszyn claim arises under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.nevertheless,because our jurisprudence in custodial suicides borrows the term deliberate indifference from eighth amendment jurisprudence,deliberate indifference may be equivalent to the should have known element required for liability under the fourteenth amendment pursuant to colburn i and ii.however,we need not attempt to reconcile those two phrases here because there is no evidence on this record that woloszyn had a particular vulnerability to suicide.accordingly,his wife can not establish the first element under colburn i and ii.
liability of graziani.
woloszyn wife argues that,considering affidavit and shaftic unsworn statement,
it is clear that woloszyn was assigned to unit hb where graziani was the assigned corrections officer.at the time of woloszyn transfer,he was the subject of an order requ
