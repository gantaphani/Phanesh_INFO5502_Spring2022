opinion of the court 
while receiving a massage treatment at a barbados hotel,appellant patrick slipped,fell,and injured his shoulder.he and the hotel had arranged for that massage by telephone after the hotel mailed a spa brochure to his pennsylvania home.and his wife marie brought negligence claims against the hotel,and the district court dismissed for want of personal jurisdiction.in this appeal,we conclude that the district court had specific jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims.as a result,we will reverse and remand.
appellee sandy lane hotel company is a barbados corporation.its sole business is the operation of the sandy lane hotel in james,barbados.the hotel considers itself the premier address in the caribbean,and its features include holes of championship golf,a spa,and a setting overlooking a gorgeous crescent of beach on barbados western coast.appendix app.
patrick and marie reside in pennsylvania.they first heard about sandy lane while planning a vacation friends and travel agents said good things about the resort,so the couple booked a week stay through the american express travel agency.the left for barbados in late february and returned to pennsylvania in early march.upon their return,sandy lane started mailing seasonal newsletters to the home.these newsletters kept the up to date on new amenities and other changes at sandy lane.see,app.o ur wine waiters have been in france this summer participating in the harvest and improving their wine knowledge to better serve you.
in early,the decided to make a return trip.they booked a stay at sandy lane through a travel agency.sandy lane then mailed the a brochure highlighting the many treatments available at the spa.the brochure advised the couple to schedule spa treatments in advance of their trip.the perused the brochure and liked what they saw.they decided to purchase various treatments,and the scheduling process involved a series of phone calls both to and from sandy lane.in the end,sandy lane agreed to provide spa treatments at specific dates and times,and the agreed to pay a set price.
the arrived in barbados shortly thereafter,and,on february,was due for one of his massages.he went to the spa at the appointed time,and the staff began to rejuvenate his mind,body,and spirit.app.as part of that process,a sandy lane employee instructed to step into the shower and wash up.unfortunately,feet were still slick with massage oils,and there were no mats on the shower wet floor.as he stepped into the shower,slipped,fell,and tore his rotator cuff.
and brought negligence claims against the hotel in the court of common pleas for philadelphia county.sandy lane removed the case to the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,and the district court dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.the appeal.
the district court had jurisdiction because the are citizens of pennsylvania,sandy lane is a barbados corporation,and the amount in controversy exceeds.see,tugman.we have jurisdiction under,and we exercise plenary review over the district court dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction.pinker roche holdings,cir.
once challenged,the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing personal jurisdiction.general deutz ag,cir.nonetheless,since the district court did not hold an evidentiary hearing,the plaintiff s need only establish a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction and the plaintiff s are entitled to have their allegations taken as true and all factual disputes drawn in their favor.miller yacht sales,smith,cir.
under federal rule of civil procedure k,a district court typically exercises personal jurisdiction according to the law of the state where it sits.see.k a.because this case comes to us from the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,we apply the pennsylvania statute.it provides for jurisdiction based on the most minimum contact with th e commonwealth allowed under the constitution of the united states.ann.b see mellon bank east psfs,ass farino,cir.accordingly,in determining whether personal jurisdiction exists,we ask whether,under the due process clause,the defendant has certain minimum contacts with pennsylvania such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.see int l shoe washington.internal quotation omitted.
the two types of personal jurisdiction are general jurisdiction and specific jurisdiction.see helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d.the conceded at oral argument that sandy lane lacks the continuous and systematic pennsylvania contacts needed to support general jurisdiction,so we consider only the specific variety here.
the inquiry as to whether specific jurisdiction exists has three parts.first,the defendant must have purposefully directed its activities at the forum.burger king rudzewicz,d quotation marks omitted.second,the litigation must arise out of or relate to at least one of those activities.helicopteros,at.grimes vitalink commc ns,cir.and third,if the prior two requirements are met,a court may consider whether the exercise of jurisdiction otherwise comport s with fair play and substantial justice.burger king,at.quoting int l shoe,at.
at the threshold,the defendant must have purposefully avail ed itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum.hanson denckla,d.physical entrance is not required.see burger king,at.grand entm t group,star media sales,cir mail and telephone communications sent by the defendant into the forum may count toward the minimum contacts that support jurisdiction.but what is necessary is a deliberate targeting of the forum.thus,the unilateral activity of those who claim some relationship with a nonresident defendant is insufficient.see hanson,at.and contacts with a state citizens that take place outside the state are not purposeful contacts with the state itself.see gehling george sch.of,cir.
some of the contacts alleged by the do not meet this standard first,the claim they heard about the hotel from friends and travel agents in pennsylvania.sandy lane,however,was not a party to these conversations,and they have no bearing on our jurisdictional inquiry.see hanson,at.second,the rely on their trip to sandy lane.this too lacks jurisdictional significance.contact with vacationing pennsylvanians is no substitute for contact with pennsylvania.see gehling,at.a philadelphia vendor may sell a lot of cheesesteaks to german tourists,but that does not mean he has purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities within germany.
nonetheless,sandy lane other contacts do amount to purposeful availment.after the initial stay,sandy lane continued to cultivate the relationship by mailing seasonal newsletters to their pennsylvania home.and after the booked their trip,sandy lane mailed them a brochure and traded phone calls with them for the purpose of forming an agreement to render spa services.through these acts,sandy lane deliberately reached into pennsylvania to target two of its citizens.see hanson,at.grand entm t,at.thus,if the allegations are true,then they establish purposeful contact with pennsylvania.see miller yacht,at.
identifying some purposeful contact with the forum is but the first step in the analysis.the plaintiffs claims must also arise out of or relate to at least one of those contacts.helicopteros,at.grimes,at.unfortunately,the supreme court has not yet explained the scope of this requirement see helicopteros,at.state and lower federal courts have stepped in to fill the void,but their decisions lack any consensus.see generally miller yacht,at scirica,dissenting in part the courts of appeals have adopted divergent interpretations of arise out of or relate to as that phrase relates to specific jurisdiction analysis.
three approaches predominate.the most restrictive standard is the proximate cause or substantive relevance test.courts have articulated this test in a variety of ways.some hold the defendant contacts must be the legal cause of the plaintiff injury,the defendant conduct must g i ve birth to the cause of action.see.sch.of law at andover,am.bar ass n,cir quotation marks omitted.justice brennan,dissenting in helicopteros,similarly described it as a requirement that the cause of action formally arise out of the defendant contacts.see helicopteros,at.brennan,dissenting.but stated most simply,this test examines whether any of the defendant contacts with the forum are relevant to the merits of the plaintiff claim.see lea brilmayer,how contacts count due process limitations on state court jurisdiction,the court of appeals for the first circuit employs this standard in most cases,but it allow s a slight loosening when circumstances dictate.see nowak tak how,cir.other courts apply a purer,more rigid version.see,state ex rel.la manuf.francaise des pneumatiques michelin wells,or,requiring the defendant contacts to have relevance to the substance of th e claim for relief 
a second,more relaxed test requires only causation.as the name indicates,this standard is satisfied when the plaintiff claim would not have arisen in the absence of the defendant contacts.see,shute carnival cruise lines,cir,rev on other grounds,d in shute,for example,two washingtonians booked a carnival cruise through a travel agent,and during the cruise one of them slipped on a deck mat.see id.at.carnival provided brochures to travel agencies in washington,and it also held seminars for washington travel agents.id.these contacts satisfied the test because,i n the absence of carnival activity,the shutes would not have taken the cruise,and shute injury would not have occurred.id.at.
a third standard looks for a substantial connection or discernible relationship.unlike the test,causation is of no special importance.the critical question is whether the tie between the defendant contacts and the plaintiff claim is close enough to make jurisdiction fair and reasonable.see shoppers food warehouse moreno,see also chew dietrich,cir vons seabest foods,cal th,d,thomason chem.bank.because courts that follow this approach consider the totality of the circumstances,there appears to be no rigid distinction between general and specific jurisdiction.see chew,at see also shoppers,at holding that the court discernible relationship requirement relaxes in light of extensive and repeated advertising in the washington post.instead,the two categories sit at opposite ends of a sliding scale.see william richman,review essay part jurisdiction in civil actions,part sliding scale to supplement the distinction between general and specific jurisdiction,cal.the degree of relatedness required in a given case is inversely proportional to the overall intensity of the defendant forum contacts.see vons,d,at.
this court has never adopted a definitive approach to the relatedness requirement over the years,we have applied the requirement many times,but our cases have avoided categorical determinations.see,mellon bank,at.nonetheless,in contract cases we have effectively required substantive relevance.see,at in contract cases,courts should inquire whether the defendant contacts with the forum were instrumental in either the formation of the contract or its breach.as for tort claims,in miller yacht sales,smith,cir,a divided panel stated that a defendant contacts with a forum need not have been the proximate cause of the plaintiff injuries in a tort case.id.at.the majority noted that this conclusion beg ged the question of what level of relationship is necessary under the arise out of or relate to requirement,but it declined to adopt a specific test.id.at.it stated that courts should approach each case individually and take a realistic approach.id.quotation marks omitted.
we agree,of course,that courts must decide each case individually,and miller yacht rejection of the proximate cause test binds this panel.see blair scott specialty gases,cir.moreover,the supreme court personal jurisdiction cases have repeatedly warned against the use of mechanical or quantitative tests.see int l shoe,at.see also kulko superior court,d f ew answers will be written in black and white.the greys are dominant and even among them the shades are innumerable.quotation marks omitted.in light of this instruction,we think it appropriate to continue this court established practice and refrain from adopting a test.see miller yacht,at.
that is not to say,however,that our relatedness inquiry should be completely devoid of standards.the due process clause is supposed to bring a degree of predictability to the legal system.see volkswagen woodson,d.it should allow residents to structure their primary conduct with some minimum assurance as to where that conduct will and will not render them liable to suit.id.the more flexible our approach,the less certain its application and when the only rule is that each case is different,then in no case can the result safely be predicted.antonin scalia,the rule of law as a law of rules,chi.thus,while our precedents foreclose the application of a single,mechanical test,it is altogether appropriate for us to provide further guidance on this court approach to the relatedness requirement.
at the outset,then,we must state that the sliding scale,substantial connection,and discernible relationship tests are not the law in this circuit.by any name,these hybrid approaches allow courts to vary the scope of the relatedness requirement according to the quantity and quality of the defendant contacts.see richman,supra,cal.at see also chew,at vons,d,at shoppers,at.general and specific jurisdiction merge,and the result is a freewheeling test.see chew,at.our cases,however,have always treated general and specific jurisdiction as analytically distinct categories,not two points on a sliding scale.see helicopteros,at.remick manfredy,cir if the defendant maintain s continuous and substantial forum affiliations,then general jurisdiction exists.see dollar sav.bank first sec.bank of utah,cir.if the defendant contacts fall short of that standard,then at least one contact must give rise or relate to the plaintiff claim.see grimes,at.these categories constitute two distinct theories,and our cases recognize the importance of separate analysis.see remick,at grimes,at.
we are not inclined to alter this approach,nor will we supplement it with a sliding scale.when courts confine general and specific jurisdiction to their separate spheres,potential defendants can anticipate and control their jurisdictional exposure.see,at.as long as residents refrain from continuous and substantial forum contacts,they can conduct their affairs confident that transactions in one context will not come back to haunt them unexpectedly in another.see rar,turner diesel,cir.under a hybrid approach,by contrast,all factors come together in a sort of jurisdictional stew.see mary twitchell,burnham and constitutionally permissible levels of harm,rutgers,unbounded judicial intuition replaces structured analysis,and its application from case to case necessarily defies prediction.eeoc lutheran soc,silberman,dissenting every case,after all,has its circumstances,and every chancellor foot a different length.a standard so formless has no place in our relatedness inquiry.
unlike the hybrid approaches,the test at least makes an attempt to preserve the distinction between general and specific jurisdiction.see shute,at.causation does not shift with the strength of the defendant contacts,nor does it slide along a continuum.rather,it draws a bright line separating the related from the unrelated.see william prosser,the law of torts ed.causation is a fact.it is a matter of what has in fact occurred.more importantly,by ensuring the existence of some minimal link between contacts and claims,causation provides a useful starting point for the relatedness inquiry.
but although the analysis may begin with causation,it can not end there.the animating principle behind the relatedness requirement is the notion of a tacit quid pro quo that makes litigation in the forum reasonably foreseeable.see burger king,at.residents who exercise the privilege of conducting activities within a state enjoy the benefits and protection of the state laws in exchange,they must submit to jurisdiction over claims that arise from or relate to those activities.see int l shoe,at.burger king,at.causation can not be the sole measure of relatedness because it is vastly overinclusive in its calculation of a defendant reciprocal obligations.the problem is that it has no limiting principle it literally embraces every event that hindsight can logically identify in the causative chain.see nowak tak how,cir if causation sufficed,then defendants jurisdictional obligations would bear no meaningful relationship to the scope of the benefits and protection received from the forum.see int l shoe,at.as a result,the relatedness inquiry can not stop at causation.
indeed,even courts that embrace the test recognize its overinclusiveness.see,shute,at.these courts fall back on the third step of the jurisdiction is otherwise fair and protect against the test causative excesses.see id.causation,however,may have more holes than the third step can plug.once the plaintiff proves minimum contacts,the court may consider whether the defendant has present ed a compelling case that the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.see burger king,at.emphasis added see also richman,supra.at t he contacts step is by far the more important the fairness inquiry plays a subsidiary role.moreover,even if the third step is up to the task,courts can not elide relatedness simply because the jurisdictional inquiry has a third component.see burger king,at.miller yacht,at.relatedness is an independent constitutional mandate,and some causes do not relate to their effects in a jurisdictionally significant way.
we thus hold that specific jurisdiction requires a closer and more direct causal connection than that provided by the test.as we stated in miller yacht,there is no specific rule susceptible to mechanical application in every case.see at.but in the course of this necessarily inquiry,the analysis should hew closely to the reciprocity principle upon which specific jurisdiction rests.see burger king,at.with each purposeful contact by an resident,the forum state laws will extend certain benefits and impose certain obligations.see int l shoe,at.specific jurisdiction is the cost of enjoying the benefits.see schwarzenegger fred martin motor,cir in return for the benefits and protections of a state laws,a defendant a quid pro to the burdens of litigation in that forum.quotations marks omitted coté wadel,cir personal jurisdiction over nonresidents of a state is a quid for a quo that consists of the state extending protection or other services to the nonresident.the relatedness requirement function is to maintain balance in this reciprocal exchange.in order to do so,it must keep the jurisdictional exposure that results from a contact closely tailored to that contact accompanying substantive obligations.the causal connection can be somewhat looser than the tort concept of proximate causation,see miller yacht,at,but it must nonetheless be intimate enough to keep the quid pro quo proportional and personal jurisdiction reasonably foreseeable.
applying these principles to this case,we first note that sandy lane pennsylvania contacts are a cause of injury.affidavit claims that he decided to purchase spa treatments as a result of sandy lane solicitation.app.we accept that statement as true because the district court held no evidentiary hearing.see miller yacht,at.thus,but for the mailing of the brochure,never would have purchased a massage,and he would not have suffered a injury.
the link is also much closer than mere causation.pennsylvania law allows individuals and businesses to make and enforce binding agreements.sandy lane availed itself of that opportunity,and,through its mailings and phone calls to pennsylvania,it formed a contract for spa services.the hotel acquired certain rights under that contract,and with those rights came accompanying obligations.like all services contracts,the spa agreement contained an implied promise that sandy lane would exercise due care in performing the services required.see richard lord,williston on contracts,at ed.in the case before us,the contend that sandy lane failed to do exactly that.as such,their claims directly and closely relate to a continuing contractual obligation that arose in pennsylvania.
true enough,the claims sound in tort,not contract.they claim that sandy lane breached a social duty that existed independent of and in addition to the hotel contractual obligations.see clair b l paving,those who undertake an activity pursuant to a contract have both a contractual duty and a social duty imposed by the law to act without negligence.our relatedness analysis,however,requires neither proximate causation nor substantive relevance.see miller yacht,at.it is enough that a meaningful link exists between a legal obligation that arose in the forum and the substance of the plaintiffs claims.the claim sandy lane breached a duty that is identical to a contractual duty assumed by the hotel in pennsylvania.so intimate a link justifies the exercise of specific jurisdiction as a quid pro quo for sandy lane enjoyment of the right to form binding contracts in pennsylvania.we therefore hold that the claims arise out of or relate to sandy lane pennsylvania contacts.
having determined that minimum contacts exist,we next consider whether the exercise of jurisdiction would otherwise comport with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.see int l shoe,at.the existence of minimum contacts makes jurisdiction presumptively constitutional,and the defendant must present a compelling case that the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.see burger king,at.see also pennzoil prods.colelli,cir noting that if minimum contacts are present,then jurisdiction will be unreasonable only in rare cases grand entm t group,star media sales,cir the burden on a defendant who wishes to show an absence of fairness or lack of substantial justice is heavy.
the supreme court has identified several factors that courts should consider when balancing jurisdictional reasonableness.among them are the burden on the defendant,the forum state interest in adjudicating the dispute,the plaintiff interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief,the interstate and international judicial system interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies,burger king,at.quotation marks omitted,and t he procedural and substantive interests of other nations.asahi metal indus.superior court,d.
several of these factors weigh in favor of litigating this dispute in barbados.first,the burden on the defendant is a primary concern in any case,see,at.and it is all the more significant here due to t he unique burdens placed upon one who must defend oneself in a foreign legal system.see asahi,at.sandy lane representatives will have to travel miles to litigate in pennsylvania,and the company must also familiarize itself with a foreign legal system.second,the efficiency factor also tips toward sandy lane.see burger king,at.most of the witnesses are in barbados,the evidence is there,and it is not at all clear that pennsylvania law will apply to the merits.see griffith united air lines,holding that under pennsylvania rules courts should apply the law of the jurisdiction most intimately concerned with the outcome of the particular litigation.third,barbados has a considerable substantive interest in determining the rights and liabilities of its own domestic corporations.see asahi,at.all told,these factors tend to show that litigating this dispute in barbados might well be a reasonable and efficient outcome.
sandy lane,though,has a much higher hill to climb.because it has minimum contacts with pennsylvania under the first two steps of our analysis,it must make a compelling case that litigation in pennsylvania would be unreasonable and unfair.see burger king,at.as the supreme court has stated,w hen minimum contacts have been established,often the interests of the plaintiff and the forum in the exercise of jurisdiction will justify even the serious burdens placed on the alien defendant.see asahi,at.indeed,asahi is the only supreme court case ever to present so compelling a situation,and it involved a suit in california between
