kimberly miles,a former account manager at dell,sued dell for sex discrimination,pregnancy discrimination,and retaliation under title vii.the district court granted dell motion for summary judgment as to all three claims,concluding that,under governing circuit precedent,miles failed to make out a prima facie case of sex or pregnancy discrimination because she was replaced by another female,and that miles failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to her retaliation claim because she did not allege retaliation in the charge she filed with the equal employment opportunity commission.because the district court did not consider whether miles case falls within the exception to the fourth prong of the title vii prima facie case that we recognize today,we vacate the grant of summary judgment with respect to miles sex and pregnancy discrimination claims.we affirm the grant of summary judgment with respect to miles retaliation claim.

in mcdonnell douglas green,the supreme court held that t he complainant in a title vii trial must carry the initial burden under the statute of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination,d.the fourth circuit has held that,under the mcdonnell douglas framework,a title vii plaintiff relying on indirect evidence must establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that she is a member of a protected class she suffered adverse employment action she was performing her job duties at a level that met her employer legitimate expectations at the time of the adverse employment action and the position remained open or was filled by similarly qualified applicants outside the protected class.hill lockheed martin logistics,cir en banc.because miles was replaced by another woman,the district court held that miles could not satisfy prong four of the prima facie case and that her sex and pregnancy discrimination claims accordingly failed as a matter of law.
we conclude that,in appropriate cases,a title vii plaintiff can make out a prima facie case without satisfying prong four.specifically,we hold that,in cases where the plaintiff can show that the firing and replacement hiring decisions were made by different decisionmakers,the plaintiff can make out a prima facie case without showing replacement by someone outside the protected class.
this court requirement that title vii plaintiffs show replacement outside the protected class as part of their prima facie case is not dictated by supreme court precedent.the fourth prong of the prima facie case laid out by the court in mcdonnell douglas,a case,did not require the plaintiff to show that the individual ultimately hired be outside the plaintiff protected class.at.requiring,under the fourth prong,that the plaintiff show only that,after his rejection,the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant qualifications.indeed,the supreme court has never addressed the question whether a title vii plaintiff must show that she was replaced by someone outside her protected class in order to make out a prima facie case.consolidated coin caterers,d holding that,under the age discrimination in employment act,an age discrimination plaintiff is not required to show that he was replaced by someone outside the protected class.
nevertheless,in brown mclean,we held,relying on mary honor center hicks,d that i n order to make out a prima facie case of discriminatory termination,a plaintiff must ordinarily show that the position ultimately was filled by someone not a member of the protected class,cir emphasis added see also lockheed martin,at king rumsfeld,cir brinkley harbour recreation club,cir.as dell points out,this rule is so in this circuit that we have previously affirmed dismissals under prong four without even issuing published decisions.see white south carolina dep t of social,wl,at,plaintiffs fail to establish a prima facie case of discrimination based on race because they fail to show the fourth prong of their prima facie case given that the person selected was also a member of the protected class,aff,wl cir.july,hill stores,wl,at,where,as here,a male plaintiff is replaced by another man,a defendant motion for summary judgment should be allowed in a gender discrimination case,aff,wl cir.
it is thus clear that the law in this circuit is that,as a general rule,title vii plaintiffs must show that they were replaced by someone outside their protected class in order to make out a prima facie case.however,we have recognized that there may be exceptions to this rule in limited situations.brown,at citing,as possible exceptions,cases where an age discrimination plaintiff is replaced by a much younger person within the same class,a significant lapse of time occurs between the adverse employment action and the decision to hire another person,and the employer hiring of another person within the protected class is calculated to disguise its act of discrimination.moreover,every other circuit has held that a title vii plaintiff does not always have to show replacement outside the protected class in order to make out a prima facie case this is consistent with the supreme court recognition,beginning with mcdonnell douglas itself,that mcdonnell douglas prima facie case requirements are not necessarily applicable in every respect to differing factual situations.at.furnco constr.waters,d the method suggested in mcdonnell douglas for pursuing this inquiry was never intended to be rigid,mechanized,or ritualistic.
the district court recognized that there may be exceptions to prong four,but concluded that they were limited to the three mentioned in brown.see at.we reject this understanding.nothing in brown or in logic suggests that brown list of possible exceptions is exhaustive.miles urges us to the opposite extreme,asking us to hold that a plaintiff may bypass prong four whenever the totality of her evidence gives rise to an inference of discrimination.we also reject this position.to adopt miles position would be essentially to read prong four out of the prima facie case,which this panel is not at liberty to do given the clear rule in this circuit that title vii plaintiffs must ordinarily show replacement outside the protected class 
although we are without the authority to dispense with the fourth prong altogether whenever the plaintiff evidence could be said to give rise to an inference of discrimination,we do believe,though,that it is permissible for a panel of the court to recognize exceptions to prong four for categories of cases that call for an exception.in order to determine whether an exception to the fourth prong is warranted of course,we must consider the purpose of that prong.although neither brown nor any other decision of this court of which we are aware provides a justification for prong four,it seems evident to us that a plaintiff must ordinarily show that she was replaced by someone outside her protected class because,when someone within her protected class is hired as a replacement,that fact ordinarily gives rise to an inference that the defendant did not fire the plaintiff because of her protected status.for example,when a female plaintiff is fired and the employer replaces her with another woman,that fact at least tends to show that the employer motivation for firing the plaintiff was not her sex,because an employer is unlikely to hire a female replacement if its reason for firing the plaintiff was that she was female.in other words,replacement within the protected class gives rise to an inference of with respect to the protected status.the fourth prong requires plaintiffs,as part of their prima facie case,to eliminate this inference of 
however,replacement within the protected class does not always give rise to an inference of.one clear example of this is when the defendant hires someone from within the plaintiff protected class in order to disguise its act of discrimination toward the plaintiff.see brown,at.the seventh circuit has provided another example 
suppose an employer evaluates its staff yearly and retains black workers who are in the top quarter of its labor force,but keeps any white in the top half.a black employee ranked in the percentile of the staff according to supervisors evaluations is let go,while all white employees similarly situated are retained.this is race discrimination,which the employer can not purge by hiring another person of the same race later.
carson bethlehem steel,cir.in cases like these,whether because of the particular circumstances surrounding the firing decision or because of the particular circumstances surrounding the replacement hiring decision,the employer decision to hire someone of the plaintiff protected class as a replacement does not give rise to an inference of with respect to the decision to fire the plaintiff.in such cases,the fourth prong of the prima facie case ought to give way.consolidated coin,at.concluding that a showing of replacement outside the protected class is not required in age discrimination cases because such replacement lacks probative value as to the defendant discriminatory intent.
we believe that another such category of cases is that wherein the firing and replacement hiring decisions are made by different decisionmakers.in such cases,we are convinced that the replacement hiring decision simply does not give rise to an inference of with respect to the firing decision.that is,when one individual makes the decision to fire the plaintiff and another makes the replacement hiring decision,the second individual hiring decision has no probative value whatsoever as to whether the first individual firing decision was motivated by the plaintiff protected status.we accordingly hold that,when a title vii plaintiff can show that the firing and hiring decisions were made by different decisionmakers,she need not show as part of her prima facie case that she was replaced by someone outside her protected class.
the record before us suggests that such may have been the case here.miles evidence suggests that glaze was principally responsible for firing her,but that his superiors made the decision to hire susan patrick,overruling his preference to hire a male.however,the record has not been sufficiently developed with respect to this issue.we accordingly vacate the district court grant of summary judgment as to miles sex and pregnancy discrimination claims and remand this case to the district court for a determination whether miles has established a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the decision to fire her was made by a decisionmaker different from the one that hired susan patrick.see lockheed martin,at considering at length the question who is a decisionmaker for purposes of discrimination actions brought under title vii.if so,then miles can establish a prima facie case of sex and pregnancy discrimination despite the fact that she was replaced by a woman 
the district court granted dell motion for summary judgment as to miles pregnancy discrimination claim for the same reason that it granted the motion with respect to her sex discrimination,that miles had not shown that she was replaced by someone outside her protected class.see at because miles was not replaced by a person outside her protected class her sex and pregnancy discrimination claims fail.as we have already concluded,miles is not required to show that she was replaced by someone outside her protected class if she can establish on remand a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the decision to fire her was made by a decisionmaker different from the one that hired susan patrick.
even if miles can not make the showing on remand and must therefore satisfy the fourth prong of the prima facie case,she has done so with respect to her pregnancy discrimination claim.as even dell conceded at oral argument,for purposes of establishing a prima facie case of pregnancy discrimination,the protected class is pregnant women,not all women see gleklen democratic congressional campaign,kennedy schoenberg,fisher newman,cir best oil,cir cumpiano,at.because susan patrick was not pregnant when dell hired her,miles has shown,with respect to her pregnancy discrimination claim,that she was replaced by someone outside her protected class.
conceding this point,dell asserts an alternate ground for affirming the district court grant of summary judgment in its favor on miles pregnancy discrimination claim.dell argues that,because miles was not fired until almost a year after she gave birth,any causal connection between her pregnancy and her termination is so attenuated that her claim must fail as a matter of law.dell cites us to two fourth circuit title vii retaliation cases in which we have stated that a lengthy time lapse between the employer becoming aware of the protected activity and the alleged adverse employment action negates any inference that a causal connection exists between the two.see causey balog,cir a thirteen month interval between the charge and termination is too long to establish causation absent other evidence of retaliation.dowe total action against poverty,cir holding that a lapse of three years between the protected activity and the adverse employment action negated the inference of causation these cases do not dictate the outcome dell seeks here.first,these were retaliation cases,in which plaintiffs must show a causal connection between the retaliation and the protected activity as part of their prima facie case,see id.at,and no such showing is required as part of the pregnancy discrimination prima facie case.second,in dowe,the lengthy time lapse that we held negated the causal inference was over three years,significantly longer than the time lapse here.id.at.third,causey determination that a thirteen month interval was sufficient to negate the causal inference depended on the absence of other evidence of retaliation.at.
here,despite the year lapse between miles pregnancy and her termination,we are persuaded,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to miles,that she has introduced sufficient evidence for a rational jury to conclude that there was a causal connection between the two.first,it is uncontested that in may,while miles was still pregnant,glaze unsuccessfully tried to get authorization to fire her.a jury could rationally conclude that glaze wanted to fire miles because of her pregnancy but was rebuffed in his first attempt and simply bided his time until he could convince management to let him fire her,all the while harboring a discriminatory animus.second,a rational jury could conclude that glaze reduced miles sales territory and increased her quotas because she was pregnant and that those actions set her up for the failures that he later used to make the case for her termination to management.if a jury believed either of these scenarios,it could rationally conclude that there was a causal connection between miles pregnancy and her termination.therefore,it would be inappropriate to hold that the causation element of miles pregnancy discrimination thus her entire as a matter of law because of the lapse of time.whether miles pregnancy motivated or otherwise resulted in dell decision to fire her is a question properly left to the jury.
the district court granted dell motion for summary judgment as to miles retaliation claim on the grounds that she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.before a plaintiff has standing to file suit under title vii,he must exhaust his administrative remedies by filing a charge with the eeoc.bryant bell atlantic maryland,cir.the exhaustion requirement ensures that the employer is put on notice of the alleged violations so that the matter can be resolved out of court if possible.see eeoc american bank,cir.while t he eeoc charge defines the scope of the plaintiff right to institute a civil suit,a n administrative charge of discrimination does not strictly limit a title vii suit which may follow rather,the scope of the civil action is confined only by the scope of the administrative investigation that can reasonably be expected to follow the charge of discrimination.bryant,at quoting chisholm united states postal,cir.in other words,i f a plaintiff claims in her judicial complaint are reasonably related to her eeoc charge and can be expected to follow from a reasonable administrative investigation,the plaintiff may advance such claims in her subsequent civil suit.smith first union bank,cir.
the question in this case is thus whether miles claim that she was retaliated against for complaining about discriminatory treatment is reasonably related to her eeoc charge such that it would have reasonably been expected to follow from an administrative investigation of that charge.the district court concluded that it is not.we agree.miles did not check the retaliation box on her charge form,and the narrative explaining her charge made no mention of retaliation.see i believe that i was discriminated against due to my sex female and pregnancy.the eeoc points out that miles stated in her charge that she had complained to glaze supervisor and that glaze told her,so,what do you think of me now when he fired her.these facts,the eeoc argues,establish that miles retaliation claim is reasonably related to her sex and pregnancy discrimination claims and would have followed from an investigation of those claims 
we are unpersuaded.although miles narrative states that she complained to glaze supervisor,it does not state that she complained to him about discrimination.id.at stating only that miles discussed the issue of the hostile attitude of glaze.nor does it state that glaze was aware that miles had complained to his supervisor.and glaze alleged statement to miles does not necessarily imply that glaze was motivated by a retaliatory impulse.in short,miles charge does not remotely allege that glaze retaliated against her because she had complained of his discriminatory conduct to his supervisor,and it does not otherwise allege facts that would have put dell or the eeoc on notice that she was charging dell with retaliation.we thus agree with the district court that miles retaliation claim is not reasonably related to her charge such that it would have been expected to follow from an investigation of miles sex and pregnancy discrimination claims.bryant,at administrative investigation of retaliation could not reasonably be expected to occur in light of bryant sole charge of race discrimination,and the investigation of the complaint did not touch on any matters other than race discrimination.
miles claims that,in determining whether she exhausted her administrative remedies,we should consider not only her charge,but also a letter she later sent to the eeoc that explicitly alleged retaliation.that letter,which was sent five months after miles filed her charge and was not served on dell,does not cure her failure to allege retaliation in the charge and is insufficient to meet the administrative exhaustion requirement.see sloop memorial mission,cir i t would be objectively illogical to view a private letter from a complaining party to the eeoc as constructively amending a formal charge,given that one of the purposes of requiring a party to file charges with the eeoc is to put the charged pa
