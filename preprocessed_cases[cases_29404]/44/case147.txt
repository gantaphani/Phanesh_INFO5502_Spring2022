appellant raymond mcardle mcardle is a former teacher in the public schools of the town of dracut,massachusetts.he claims,among other things,that dracut improperly handled his request for leave under the family and medical leave act,fmla and forced him to resign in retaliation for seeking such leave.the district court granted summary judgment dismissing all of mcardle claims,ruling that he had not worked enough to be eligible for fmla leave,and otherwise finding his claims meritless.for the following reasons,we affirm.
background 
because the district court dismissed mcardle claims on summary judgment before any factfinder could evaluate the competing evidence and inferences,we will describe the facts giving rise to this lawsuit in a light as favorable to mcardle as the record will reasonably allow.colburn parker portland div,cir.
mcardle began working as a middle school english teacher for dracut in.in,he entered divorce proceedings with his wife and began drinking excessively.depression,anxiety,foreclosure on his home,and personal bankruptcy followed.reeling from these personal crises,mcardle began to miss work.he went to work at school only ten of school days in september of and did not appear at all in october,november,or december of.after the winter break,his record improved temporarily.he went to work fifteen out of seventeen days in january,fourteen out of fifteen days in february,twenty out of days in march,twelve days out of sixteen in april,and eleven out of twenty days in may.he did not work at school at all in june,the final month of the school year.in total,he came to school for only days in the school year.
these absences exhausted the fifteen days of sick leave and the two days of personal leave to which he was entitled in the year.he then exercised,after some disagreement with his superintendent,a contractual right to use in the school year his fifteen days of sick leave for the year.he also had deduct days during which school was in session but he did not work and was not paid.throughout the school year,mcardle provided cursory explanations for his absences,supplying his principal with two notes that indicated that he had a medical condition and was unable to work for medical reasons.he was disciplined over his objection for not attending faculty meetings when he was absent from work.he was also disciplined for failing to leave lesson plans for a substitute with the,even though he had done so.
on september,the day the school year began,mcardle again did not appear at school.instead,that day he called his principal,defendant theresa rogers,and informed her that,at the very last minute,he had made the decision that it would not be in anyone interest for him to come back to school.during the same conversation he also stated that he wanted to apply for fmla leave.rogers informed him that he would have to contact the dracut superintendent,defendant spencer mullin.when mcardle called mullin office,he spoke with mullin secretary,rayann,who agreed to send him the appropriate paperwork for the fmla.two weeks later he received a united states department of labor about the fmla and a form to be completed by his doctor.included with these materials was a note,which mcardle concedes he read,informing him that he had to notify the superintendent in writing of any request for fmla leave.this requirement was also stated clearly in dracut fmla leave policy,which was posted on its website.
mcardle did not send any notice to the superintendent of his desire to take fmla leave.nor did he return a completed medical certification.mcardle testified that after he received the materials from he decided that he must need some additional form to fill out.he called the superintendent office and spoke with curtis,another of superintendent mullins secretaries.in his first conversation with her,he asked that someone in the superintendent office send him what he need ed to fill out.mcardle called the superintendent office five to seven more times requesting to speak to mullins himself,but never received a call back.mcardle decided that submitting the medical certification was optional and did not do so.he is correct that the school district fmla policies,which he read,state only that the district may require a medical certification from an employee seeking fmla leave,but he does not explain why he did not believe that such a request had been made when sent him the certification form.and he completely ignores the fact that he had previously agreed in writing as a condition to being allowed to return to work for dracut in that he would provide a physician statement whenever sick leave prevails for five consecutive school days.
on september,rogers sent a letter to mcardle terminating him for abandoning his position since we have not received any written correspondence from you nor have you called the substitute service to alert the district that your classes would be unattended.mcardle promptly replied,pointing out that the town was required to first give him notice of intent to terminate his employment before actually firing him.mcardle reply noted for the first time in writing his desire to take fmla leave,explained that he believed he had not yet been sent the proper form to submit,and denied that there was any need to call the substitute service because the principal knew he was out and had arranged for a substitute.he still failed to provide any physician statement as the town had plainly required.rogers sent a second letter on october,this one notifying mcardle of dracut intent to terminate for the same reasons and giving him ten days to respond.nine days later,mcardle spoke with rogers by telephone and resigned his position after rogers told him that everything relating to his termination would be removed from his record if he did so.
mcardle filed this suit in,alleging in count i that all defendants violated his rights under the fmla.counts ii and iii alleged massachusetts state law tort claims of,respectively,intentional infliction of emotional distress and intentional interference with advantageous business relations.both counts were alleged against individual in the dracut schools defendants theresa rogers,spencer mullin,who was the superintendent prior to and at the time of mcardle dismissal,and stacy scott,who assumed mullins position after mcardle termination.after discovery,defendants successfully moved for summary judgment on all of mcardle claims.he now appeals.

iii.analysis 
mcardle fmla claims 
the fmla guarantees an eligible employee the right to take twelve weeks of unpaid leave because of,among other things,a serious medical condition that renders the employee unable to do his job.see ragsdale wolverine world wide,d.the act further makes it unlawful for any employer to interfere with,restrain,or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise,any right provided by the fmla.a.
mcardle claims that dracut violated the fmla both by interfering with his attempt to seek permission to take fmla leave,and by terminating him because he attempted to avail himself of the protections of the fmla for the leave he took.in this rather unusual case,mcardle has not claimed that dracut violated the fmla by refusing to grant him fmla leave,or by firing him for taking such leave.this departure from the more customary path followed by terminated,employees might be explained by mcardle recognition that,as we explain below,he was not eligible to take fmla leave.but mcardle does in fact argue that he was eligible for fmla leave.
be that as it may,absent exceptional circumstances not present here,we endeavor to assess the claims a party makes,rather than to ponder why he makes those claims and not others.and,in the end,that assessment here will demonstrate that mcardle had no cause for complaint of any type under the fmla.
mcardle was not eligible to take fmla leave 
as a foundation on which he largely but not completely erected his claims,mcardle argued below,and now argues on appeal,that he was eligible for fmla leave,or that the town should be estopped from denying that he was eligible.we therefore begin our analysis of the claims mcardle does make by explaining why the district court correctly ruled,as a matter of law,that mcardle was not eligible to take fmla leave.
to be eligible for fmla leave,an employee must have at least hours of service with the employer during the previous month period.a.the parties presume that the phrase hours of service means hours actually worked,and both the applicable regulations and case law support this presumption.see,c plumley container,cir.under regulations promulgated by the department of labor,an employer of a teacher who challenges the fmla eligibility of that teacher must be able to clearly demonstrate that the teacher did not work hours.c.
dracut demonstrated that mcardle attended school for only days in the twelve months preceding september.mcardle nevertheless suggests that the number of days he worked is a disputed question of material fact because the record contains a letter from dracut superintendent to mcardle counsel that calculates that mcardle worked hours,based on a determination that he was paid for days.but the record demonstrates beyond dispute that the mere fact that a teacher is paid for a day does not mean that he worked that day.mcardle,for example,took personal days,sick days and a paid leave of absence as well as,presumably,vacation days or paid holidays.in any event,the actual books and records of the dracut public schools showed that mcardle came to work on only days,with an entry for each such day.mcardle offered no testimony that he was present at work on any other days.
estoppel aside,that leaves one question how many hours did mcardle work he testified that,when he actually came to school,he was typically in his classroom from am to pm,a total of hours.the collective bargaining agreement to which he is subject also specifies a hour workday.hours times days equals hours worked.
of course,proving that mcardle was in school only hours is not the same as proving that he worked only hours.as mcardle plausibly testified,in addition to time spent at school,he like many teachers sometimes worked at home correct ing writing journals issue ing and sign ing writing papers,term papers.moreover,some of that work may have been done on days other than those when mcardle also went to school.a busy and conscientious teacher,for example,might grade papers or prepare for the next day classes on a weekend.
dracut,however,did not need to prove that mcardle worked only hours.it burden was only to clearly demonstrate that mcardle worked less than hours.the gap between hours and hours is so large that it is entirely implausible on this record that mcardle worked anywhere close to hours.donnelly greenburgh cent.sch.dist,cir hours assumed under cba close enough to hours to create factual issue that other,work pushed total over.mcardle own description of what he might sometimes do at home falls far short of suggesting that a dracut public school teacher work at home is so substantial as to exceed his work at school.mcardle,moreover,was not working at school at all for two separate three month periods,each uninterrupted by any activity that might have generated work.in sum,mcardle has failed to present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of fact as to the number of hours he actually worked during the period preceding his request for leave.staunch cont l airlines,cir.
mcardle has not established that the town handling of his fmla leave application caused him any harm 
unable to establish that dracut in any way interfered with a right to take leave,mcardle is reduced to arguing that,even if he was not eligible for fmla leave,dracut nevertheless interfered with his fmla rights by violating b,which provides that w hen an employee requests fmla leave,or when the employer acquires knowledge that an employee leave may be for an reason,the employer must notify the employee of the employee eligibility to take fmla leave it is not clear on the face of the notice regulations whether they require notice of ineligibility to a person who is ineligible.nor is it clear that mcardle communications to dracut were sufficient to trigger an obligation by dracut to provide a notice of eligibility to mcardle when it had already sent him the medical certification form and a written notice that a written request was required to obtain fmla leave.
we need not decide these issues because,even if we were to assume a violation of the notice requirements,dracut would be liable only for compensation and benefits lost by reason of the violation or any other relief tailored to the harm suffered.e.mcardle points to nothing that he could or would have done differently had dracut told him in early september that he was not eligible for fmla leave.to the contrary,the undisputed record is that,without advanced notice,he failed to show up for work.
mcardle offers no evidence that he would have been able to return to work had he known there was no fmla leave for him.he claims that in the prior year,he always found a way to ensure that his absences were authorized or permitted,asking us to infer that he would have done so in the new school year as well if he knew that he had to do so.speculation,however,does not suffice for reasonable inference.even three years after the fact,mcardle offers no explanation for how he would have secured authorization for the leave he contends he had no choice but to take.such leave would have been especially hard to obtain from a school that,by his own claim,was plainly unenthusiastic about accommodating his needs.
in short,nothing was lost,nor was any harm suffered,by reason of the alleged violations.therefore,even assuming that dracut should have sent mcardle a notice that he was ineligible for fmla leave,no remedy could or need be tailored for such a harmless error.mcardle claim that the town should be estopped from denying his ineligibility fails for this same reason,as he is only entitled to estoppel if he relied on dracut misrepresentations to its detriment.nagle acton boxborough reg l sch,cir.
dracut did not unlawfully retaliate against mcardle 
in addition to granting workers important rights,the fmla also precludes employers from retaliating against employees for exercising those rights.colburn parker portland,cir hodgens dynamics,cir.to make out a prima facie case of retaliation mcardle must show he availed himself of a protected right under the fmla he was adversely affected by an employment decision there is a causal connection between the employee protected activity and the employer adverse employment action.id.at applying the standard from mcdonnell douglas green,d,to fmla cases.
in the more typical case,an employee who is subject to an adverse employment decision after or while taking fmla leave will claim that the taking of the leave was the cause of the adverse decision.see,seeger cincinnati bell,llc,cir.alternatively,when an employee takes no leave,but is subject to an adverse employment decision after asking to take fmla leave,the employee will claim that the request was the cause of the adverse decision.see,mickelson new york life ins,cir.here,by contrast,we have an unusual case in which mcardle was fired while taking leave,but he does not argue that he was fired for taking leave,nor could he successfully so argue because,in his case,taking leave was not a right protected under the fmla.
mcardle is thus left with the rather contrived argument that he was fired not for taking the unsanctioned leave he took,but because he asked for fmla leave.this is another way of saying that he was fired,not because he was absent,but because he asked whether he had the right to be absent.in support of this argument mcardle points to what he calls the temporal proximity between his oral request for leave and his receipt of a notice of intent to terminate,followed by actual constructive termination when he confirmed his request i
