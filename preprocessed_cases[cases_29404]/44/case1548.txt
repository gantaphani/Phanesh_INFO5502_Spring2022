plaintiffs jerry kaplan and go computer sued microsoft in for antitrust injuries that allegedly drove go out of business in.the four year statutory limitations period that congress specified has long since run,and kaplan and go seek to combine no fewer than four separate tolling arguments to sidestep it.a necessary link in the chain is plaintiffs claim that fraudulent concealment delayed the ticking of the clock.affirming the district court,we hold that kaplan and go were on inquiry notice of their claims as of,when enough red flags had flown that a reasonably diligent person would have investigated and acted.
twenty years ago,in,jerry kaplan founded go corporation to bring to market a handheld computer that could be operated by writing directly on its screen with a stylus,and an operating system,penpoint,for use with that or other touch screen computers.the technology was promising and,initially,go was on the rise,winning funding and plans for a public endorsement from intel and catching the attention of other major players in the digital market.as part of its business strategy,go reached out to software among persuade them to write programs for penpoint.it likewise approached original equipment manufacturers like compaq,fujitsu,and toshiba to get them to build their own computers based on penpoint.
according to the complaint,microsoft saw penpoint as a threat to its dominance of the operating system market and took anticompetitive steps against go to extinguish the threat.specifically,microsoft pressured intel to withhold its endorsement and funding forced other hardware and software developers either not to build products for penpoint or to pay exorbitant licensing fees if they did so withheld technical information to ensure that microsoft own software would be incompatible with penpoint and stole go trade secrets to create a faux competitor to penpoint,penwindows,that microsoft would pull from the market as soon as go was gone.the pressure was too much go closed its doors in january,almost fourteen years ago.the complaint adds that even after go closed,manufacturers sold hardware based on penpoint through,and microsoft still markets products based on trade secrets it stole from go.
go assets passed to eo corporation,a former go spinoff that was trying to develop a hybrid between computers and cell technology that would have its day in time.eo ceased development of penpoint and functionally shut down in july,when its chief shareholder,at t,withdrew funding.a few months later,microsoft withdrew penwindows from the market.in,eo was formally dissolved and its assets passed to lucent technologies,which owns penpoint to this day.
this case might have ended there,with no lawsuit at all,but for the department of justice may,filing against microsoft.twice before the federal government had taken action.the federal trade commission had launched a investigation of microsoft in the early,which it ended in by declining to pursue an antitrust action.the department of justice had compelled microsoft to sign a consent decree in,prohibiting certain restrictive licensing practices.the department latest suit concluded in the district court with a new consent decree in november,see united states microsoft,d,and concluded on appeal when the court of appeals for the circuit affirmed the entry of the decree in june,massachusetts microsoft.
in,kaplan,along with a new corporate entity he had recently formed,go computer,went to lucent with a proposal in exchange for of any judgment or settlement go and kaplan might win,lucent would assign its legal interest in any federal and state antitrust claims that lucent acquired from at t and that at t had previously acquired from go.the deal was struck in april.on june,day short of a year after the circuit affirmed the consent decree in massachusetts filed parallel complaints against microsoft in federal and state court,the one under federal antitrust law and the other under state antitrust law.microsoft met go federal complaint with a motion to dismiss or in the alternative for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds.
the merits of go antitrust allegations were never at issue in the district court argument centered wholly on the limitations period.the statute of limitations for federal antitrust claims bars any action unless commenced within four years after the cause of action accrued,plus any tolling.generally,a cause of action accrues and the statute begins to run when a defendant commits an act that injures a plaintiff business.zenith radio hazeltine research,d.all of the injuries alleged in go complaint occurred before go closed in january,with the exception of go reference to penpoint licensing into and trade secret theft even after.thus the issues before the district court were go four arguments for why the statute of limitations did not expire in the eleven and a half years between go closing and filing.
first,go invoked fraudulent concealment doctrine,claiming that microsoft had effectively hidden its wrongdoing until.see supermarket of marlinton,meadow gold dairies,cir starting the clock for concealed injuries from the date they are discovered rather than the date they were committed.second,go argued that the federal government suit against microsoft tolled the clock from the date of filing,may.see i tolling the clock on private antitrust suits during the pendency of related suits by the federal government and for one year thereafter.third,go argued that the federal case did not come to an end with the district court entry of the consent decree in,but only with the circuit affirmance of that decree in.see russ togs,grinnell,cir holding that the pendency of a government antitrust action continues through appeal.fourth,go claimed that microsoft continued to commit antitrust violations involving penpoint technology through at least.zenith radio,at.stating that each new injurious act in a continuing antitrust conspiracy starts a new limitations clock as to that act.
in june,the district court,construing microsoft motion as one for summary judgment,rejected go arguments.go computer,microsoft,d.as to fraudulent concealment,the court concluded that enough red flags were up by to put go,as a matter of law,on inquiry notice of its claims.the limitations period therefore ran out before united states microsoft was ever filed.id.at.in the alternative,the district court reasoned that go was certainly on inquiry notice as of july,when the department of justice and microsoft filed their first consent decree.since july is just a few months short of four years before may,this alternative view did require engaging go united states microsoft tolling argument.but the court held that united states microsoft ended for tolling purposes in,when the district court entered the consent decree,not in,when the appellate court affirmed it.id.at.the tolling period therefore expired in,two years before go filed.
finally,as to the continuing violations argument,the district court pointed out that the language assigning to go antitrust claims that at t had previously acquired from go plainly excludes any antitrust claim arising after go closed in.go continuing violations argument thus rested on injuries to lucent that go had no right to allege.go itself had apparently realized the problem,and,after filing its complaint,had signed two amended assignments with lucent to fix the original assignment language.neither microsoft nor the district court were told of the two assignments,or saw any of the three assignments until a hearing in march,when go counsel produced the third was explaining its provenance.deeply concerned,the district court sanctioned go counsel in its opinion by strik ing all the allegations in the amended complaint underlying the claims asserted by go for any injury allegedly suffered by lucent.d at see also fed civ.b requiring that complaints allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support.
the case did not end there.in a motion for reconsideration,go counsel apologized for the two amended assignments and offered to voluntarily dismiss its federal claims for continuing antitrust injuries to lucent,promising not to seek reinstatement of those claims or to file a new complaint raising them the end result will thus be the dismissal of the federal case.plaintiffs seek simply to eliminate the finding that counsel violated rule b the district court decided to grant the motion,dismissing the lucent claims without prejudice and without rule sanctions in light of plaintiffs representation that they do not intend to continue to proceed with their action in this court in any event.go then filed a notice of voluntary dismissal,but one not confined to the lucent claims.on its face,the notice appeared to contemplate dismissal of the entire action.a day after receiving it,however,and before microsoft voice was heard,the court issued an order approving the notice.
microsoft protested.the district court final judgment on statute of limitations grounds,microsoft explained,would have preclusive effect in california as to go state antitrust claims.go voluntary dismissal of the action was,according to microsoft,an attempt to wipe the slate clean go might then go back to california state court representing its own notice of voluntary dismissal as the last word in the federal case,thereby avoiding the district court conclusions on the merits of its statute of limitations arguments.thus microsoft moved under federal rule of civil procedure or that the court alter,amend,or vacate its order granting voluntary dismissal,and enter final judgment in accordance with federal rule of civil procedure.the district court obliged,issuing an order rescinding the grant of voluntary dismissal and stating at a hearing that it had made a mistake when it dismissed the action in its entirety.on october,the district court signed a final judgment dismissing with prejudice all claims other than the claims based upon antitrust injuries allegedly suffered by lucent,and dismissing without prejudice claims based upon antitrust injuries allegedly suffered by lucent.
go raises three arguments on appeal.first,it challenges our jurisdiction,arguing that the district court final judgment,however styled,was not final for purposes of the courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states second,go claims that the district court was not entitled to rescind its initial approval of the notice of voluntary dismissal.finally,on the statute of limitations issue itself,go urges three of the arguments the district court rejected the fraudulent concealment argument,the tolling argument based on united states microsoft,and the variation on that tolling argument based on massachusetts microsoft.go does not continue to advance its continuing violations argument.thus,the only antitrust injuries legitimately before us go closing in january,and the only limitations arguments concern those injuries.
go finality argument stems from the fact that the district court final judgment dismissed some of go claims with prejudice,and some without.relying mainly on domino sugar sugar workers local union,cir,go contends that whenever a district court dismisses any claim without prejudice,such that a plaintiff could conceivably save his action and carry on in district court by merely amending his complaint,id.at,the dismissal is nonfinal.here,go argues,it could save its action simply by filing an amended complaint based solely on the claims dismissed without prejudice.
section finality rule has never been so rigid.it is a pragmatic rule,and we have interpreted it chiefly to carry out its twin purposes of avoid ing the enfeebling of judicial administration that comes with undue delay of ongoing district court proceedings and preserv ing the primacy of the district court as the arbiter of the proceedings before it.mdk,mike train house,cir internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,domino sugar significance has been its insistence that appellate panels evaluate the particular grounds for dismissal in each case before either permitting or prohibiting appeals from dismissals without prejudice.at see,chao rivendell woods,cir domino sugar requires us to examine the appealability of a dismissal without prejudice based on the specific facts of the case in order to guard against piecemeal litigation and repetitive appeals.
dismissals without prejudice naturally leave open the possibility of further litigation in some form.what makes them final or nonfinal is not the speculative possibility of a new lawsuit,but that they end the litigation on the merits and leave nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.mdk,at internal quotation marks omitted accord hill potter,cir the test for finality is not whether the suit is dismissed with prejudice or without prejudice the test is whether the district court has finished with the case.
when the district court dismissed some of go claims without prejudice,it was utterly finished with go case.the claims in question,of course,are those based on injuries to lucent that go never had a right to allege,and that now make an indirect appearance not to support a statute of limitations argument,but to undermine the finality of the district court judgment.go escaped rule sanctions and won dismissal without prejudice by promising never to raise these claims in federal court again.and even if another district court by some chance did allow go to file a new complaint for the lucent claims,that case would be based on distinct facts from this one in no sense would go have saved this action by amending this complaint.the district court thus rendered a final judgment,and we have jurisdiction to consider it.
go next the district court,having issued the order approving go voluntary dismissal of the action,could not rescind also geared to extinguishing the district court final judgment and restoring go voluntary dismissal.as go conceives it,the district court could only alter or rescind an order of voluntary dismissal under one of three rules federal rule of civil procedure a governing voluntary dismissals,e governing motions to alter or amend a judgment,or b governing motions for relief from a judgment or order.each of those rules requires a type and degree of justification the district court,according to go,did not have.
as to rule a,go argues that under davis usx,cir,courts should generally grant rule a motions unless unduly prejudicial to defendants,and the prospect of a second lawsuit in state court can not qualify as prejudice.id.at.this argument lays the emphasis in the wrong place.the primary force of a is to empower district courts to exercise discretion over voluntary dismissals a n action shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff instance save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper.while davis does indeed direct district courts to focus primarily on the interests of defendants,id.at,it never suggests limiting a to exclude all other them,preventing plaintiffs from litigating,losing,and then wiping the slate clean by voluntarily dismissing their action,see rmd concessions,westfield.nothing in rule suggests the district court was constrained in its discretion to rescind the order granting go voluntary dismissal.
as to rule e,go claims that hill braxton,cir,permits motions to alter or amend judgments only for changes of law,new evidence not available at trial,to correct a clear error of law,or to prevent a manifest injustice.all true.but here,where the district court meant to permit voluntary dismissal for only one claim and,through accident,almost permitted go to escape judgment entirely,there was both a clear error of law and a risk of manifest injustice.
as to rule b,it is impossible to see how a rule designed to grant relief from orders or judgments due to mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect could fail to apply here,where the district court stated,i just think i made a mistake.everyone makes mistakes.and district courts can correct them no less than others,unburdened by the tripwire formalisms go urges.quite apart from any rule or motion,it is inconceivable that district courts would not possess the authority to correct an error and spare litigants the seriou
