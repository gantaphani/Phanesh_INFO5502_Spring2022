plaintiffs,who are approximately united states nationals or their estates,survivors or heirs who were victims of terrorist attacks launched in israel by hamas,appeal from the judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york irizarry,dismissing,on summary judgment,their suit against defendant national westminster bank plc natwest.the claimed basis of liability is that natwest provided material support and resources to a terrorist organization in violation of the antiterrorism act ata,a,a and a,and collected and provided funds for the financing of terrorism in violation of a,a and the complaint accuses natwest of providing material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization by maintaining bank accounts and transferring funds for the palestine relief development fund,interpal interpal.interpal allegedly engaged in terrorist activity by soliciting funds,and otherwise providing support,for hamas.
natwest moved for summary judgment on the grounds that plaintiffs could not show that natwest acted with the requisite scienter to support an award of civil remedies under the ata,that its acts were the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries,that plaintiffs had article iii standing,and that hamas was responsible for the terrorist attacks at issue.the district court granted the motion for summary judgment on the basis of plaintiffs failure to establish a triable issue of fact as to whether natwest had the requisite scienter,and did not address the other asserted grounds.weiss westminster bank plc,d.
plaintiffs contend on this appeal that the district court used an incorrect standard for determining whether natwest acted with the requisite scienter for liability under a predicated on a violation of a by focusing on whether natwest had knowledge that,or exhibited deliberate indifference to whether,interpal funded terrorist activities.we conclude that the statute requirement is less exacting,and requires only a showing that natwest had knowledge that,or exhibited deliberate indifference to whether,interpal provided material support to a terrorist organization,irrespective of whether interpal support aided terrorist activities of the terrorist organization.as hamas is an organization designated as a foreign terrorist organization fto by the united states secretary of state,plaintiffs can fulfill this burden by demonstrating either that natwest had actual knowledge that interpal provided material support to hamas,or that natwest exhibited deliberate indifference to whether interpal provided material support to hamas.there is a triable issue of fact as to whether natwest possessed the requisite scienter.therefore,we vacate the judgment and remand for the district court to consider natwest other arguments in support of summary judgment.
background 
factual background 
interpal is a organization registered with the charity commission for england wales the charity commission.its declaration of trust states that interpal collects funds for humanitarian aid,which it transfers to various charitable organizations in england and wales,jordan,lebanon,and the palestinian territories.natwest maintained accounts for interpal from,the year interpal was founded,until during that time,natwest recorded unusual activity in a permanent database and reported certain suspicious activity to british authorities.natwest is a member of the royal bank of scotland group and is incorporated and headquartered in the united kingdom.
on august,the united states treasury department office of foreign assets control ofac designated interpal as a specially designated global terrorist sdgt.ofac issued a press release stating 
interpal has been a principal charity utilized to hide the flow of money to hamas.reporting indicates it is the conduit through which money flows to hamas from other charities reporting indicates that interpal is the fundraising coordinator of hamas.this role is of the type that includes supervising activities of charities,developing new charities in targeted areas,instructing how funds should be transferred from one charity to another,and even determining public relations policy.
joint app x ja at,weiss westminster bank plc.
on august,the charity commission issued an order freezing interpal accounts and commenced an investigation of interpal activities.on september,the charity commission published a report,announcing that it had completed its investigation and cleared interpal of any allegations of terror financing.the report concluded that the authorities were unable to provide evidence to support allegations made against interpal,and in the absence of any clear evidence showing interpal had links to hamas political or violent militant activities,interpal bank accounts should be unfrozen and the inquiry closed.ja at.according to internal natwest communications,the metropolitan police special branch the special branch also investigated ofac sdgt designation and found that there was insufficient evidence to prove a link of interpal to terrorism,so no uk action was taken against interpal ja at.
following ofac designation of interpal as an sdgt,natwest sought guidance from the financial sanctions unit of the bank of england.on october,the bank of england informed natwest that there are presently no plans to list interpal under the terrorism order in the uk and there is no need to take any further action ja at.the financial sanctions unit also informed natwest that any payments to,or for the benefit of,hamas are prohibited,and any suspicion of such payments should be reported to the charities commission,the bank of england,and the special branch.ja at.natwest began conducting reviews of interpal accounts every six months.
in may,while conducting one of these reviews,natwest uncovered a payment by interpal to an organization that was subsequently designated by the bank of england as an organisation suspected of supporting terrorism.ja at.natwest reviews also revealed that some of the organizations receiving funds from interpal were suspected of having connections with hamas,including at least five committees alleged by united states authorities to be operated on behalf of,or under the control of,hamas in a indictment.superseding indictment,united states holy land found.for relief,cr p.july,ja at.on the other hand,there is no evidence natwest was aware of any interpal payments to any organizations that were designated as terrorist organizations by the bank of england or ofac at the time of the payment.
natwest closed the last of interpal accounts in march.
discussion 
plaintiffs argue that,in its focus on whether natwest was shown to have awareness of interpal financing of terrorist activities,the district court employed an incorrect scienter standard.we agree.as we understand the statute,in order to establish entitlement to a civil remedy under a predicated on a violation of a,plaintiffs were obliged to show that natwest had actual knowledge that,or exhibited deliberate indifference to whether,interpal provided material support to a terrorist organization,irrespective of whether the support aided terrorist activities.
a.the statutory framework 
plaintiffs seek relief under a complex statutory framework involving the ata,a,and,and the immigration and nationality act.through a series of statutory incorporations,in order for natwest to be liable under a,it must have had knowledge that or exhibited deliberate indifference to whether interpal provided material support to hamas an fto,regardless of whether that support was for terrorist activities.
section a provides civil remedies for united states nationals injured by acts of international terrorism 
any national of the united states injured in his or her person,property,or business by reason of an act of international terrorism,or his or her estate,survivors,or heirs,may sue therefor in any appropriate district court of the united states and shall recover threefold the damages he or she sustains and the cost of the suit,including attorney fees.
a emphasis added.the term international terrorism,as used in that section,is defined by to mean 
a ctivities that a involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the united states or of any state,or that would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the united states or of any state appear to be intended i to intimidate or coerce a civilian population ii to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion or iii to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction,assassination,or kidnapping and c occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the united states 
emphasis added this wording is sufficient indication that congress intended application 
the complaint alleges that natwest committed acts that fall within a by providing banking services to interpal in violation of a.that section imposes criminal penalties on 
w hoever knowingly provides material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization to violate this paragraph,a person must have knowledge that the organization has engaged or engages in terrorist activity as defined in section a of the immigration and nationality act 
while a does not include a mental state requirement on its face,it incorporates the knowledge requirement from a,which prohibits the knowing provision of any material support to terrorist organizations without regard to the types of activities supported.its application is not limited to the provision of support to the terrorist activities of a terrorist organization.id.in upholding the constitutionality of against as applied challenges for vagueness and violations of the first amendment rights to freedom of association and speech,the supreme court found that congress plainly spoke to the necessary mental state for a violation of,and it chose knowledge about the organization connection to terrorism,not specific intent to further the organization terrorist activities.holder humanitarian law project,see also antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,a,stat,note following findings and purpose f oreign organizations that engage in terrorist activity are so tainted by their criminal conduct that any contribution to such an organization facilitates that conduct.the court explained 
money is fungible,and when foreign terrorist organizations that have a dual structure raise funds,they highlight the civilian and humanitarian ends to which such moneys could be put.but there is reason to believe that foreign terrorist organizations do not maintain legitimate financial firewalls between those funds raised for civil,nonviolent activities,and those ultimately used to support violent,terrorist operations.thus,funds raised ostensibly for charitable purposes have in the past been redirected by some terrorist groups to fund the purchase of arms and explosives.
humanitarian law project,at internal quotation marks,citations,and alterations omitted boim holy land found.for relief and,cir en banc posner,if hamas budgets million for terrorism and million for social services and receives a donation of for those services,there is nothing to prevent its using that money for them while at the same time taking out of its social services account and depositing it in its terrorism account.
thus,to fulfill a scienter requirement,incorporated into a,plaintiffs must show that natwest both knew that it was providing material support to interpal and knew that interpal engaged in terrorist activity.section a does not require a showing that natwest knew it was providing material support for terrorist activity.
for the purposes of a,a defendant has knowledge that an organization engages in terrorist activity if the defendant has actual knowledge of such activity or if the defendant exhibited deliberate indifference to whether the organization engages in such activity.see strauss credit lyonnais,d,in re terrorist attacks on september,d.a defendant exhibits deliberate indifference if it knows there is a substantial probability that the organization engages in terrorism but does not care.boim,at.
section a explicitly incorporates the meaning of engage in terrorist activity from a of the immigration and nationality act,a iv iv,which defines engage in terrorist activity to include solicit ing funds or other things of value for bb a terrorist organization described in clause vi i clause vi i defines terrorist organization to mean an organization designated under section of this title.a vi i,and authorizes the secretary of state to designate an organization as a foreign terrorist organization fto pursuant to,the secretary of state designated hamas as an fto on october.dep t of state bureau of counterterrorism,foreign terrorist organizations,http last visited august.thus,if interpal solicited funds for hamas,then interpal engaged in terrorist activity within the meaning of section a b of the immigration and nationality act.
in sum,through this complex series of statutory incorporation a to to a to a b a defendant may be liable for civil remedies under a for providing material support to an organization that solicits funds for an fto.under plaintiffs theory of liability,in order for plaintiffs to establish that natwest came within the scienter requirement of,they must present evidence showing that natwest provided material support to interpal while having knowledge that,or exhibiting deliberate indifference to whether,interpal solicit ed funds or other things of value for hamas,regardless of whether those funds were used for terrorist or activities.a b vi iv a.
b.the district court decision 
as we understand the district court reasoning,it imposed on plaintiffs a more onerous burden with respect to natwest scienter than a requires.the court focused on natwest employees knowledge of interpal terror financing as opposed to their knowledge of interpal financing of a terrorist organization.see,weiss westminster bank plc,d,the filing of suspicious activity reports does not equate to knowledge or even legitimate suspicion of terror financing emphasis added id.it is undisputed that none of the suspicious activity reports and resulting investigations led to any credible evidence of terror financing.emphasis added id.natwest employees involved with internal investigations of interpal testified that natwest had a zero tolerance policy for terror financing.emphasis added id.at there is no evidence to suggest that,had natwest known or actually suspected interpal of terror financing,it would have done anything other than close its accounts.emphasis added.this focus on terror financing,as opposed to the financing of a terrorist organization,regardless of the character of the activities being financed,is not consistent with the text of a or the supreme court opinion in humanitarian law project.see at.
moreover,the district court found that natwest did not exhibit deliberate indifference to whether interpal was a terrorist organization following interpal sdgt designation,in part,because british authorities the charity commission,the special branch,and the bank of england condoned natwest relationship with interpal.weiss,d at.in this regard,the court gave inappropriate weight to the british authorities decisions.the charity commission and the bank of england condoned natwest relationship with interpal based on the charity commission investigation,which focused on only a subset of conduct that is criminalized under united states law.the charity commission investigated whether interpal financed hamas political and violent militant activities,not whether interpal provided any material support to hamas,regardless of purpose.while the charity commission report found no clear evidence showing that interpal supported hamas political or violent militant activities,the report made no findings regarding whether interpal provided material support to hamas for and activities thus the conclusions of the british authorities were in response to a different question than is posed by the united states statutes.the british authorities guidance,based on the charity commission report,is not inconsistent with a finding that natwest had knowledge that,or exhibited deliberate indifference to whether,interpal financed hamas and activities.
