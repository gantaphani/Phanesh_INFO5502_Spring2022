this appeal arises out of an collision in long beach,mississippi,involving the decedent,erica bauer valentine valentine,and a train owned by national railroad passenger corporation amtrak,which was operating on tracks owned by csx transportation csx.monica bauer hesling hesling brought this wrongful death action as guardian and next of friend of the decedent two minor children.hesling appeals the magistrate judge denial of her rule b motion for relief from judgment.hesling also appeals the judgment,claiming several errors for exclusion of evidence,and improper or failure to give jury instructions.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
on the morning of october,valentine was driving west along west railroad street in long beach,harrison county,mississippi,parallel to railroad tracks owned by csx.valentine turned south onto white harbor road and attempted to cross the tracks at the white harbor road crossing when a passenger train owned and operated by amtrak,traveling,collided with valentine vehicle killing her and her husband.
amtrak alleges that at the time of the collision,its train was equipped with the minimal safety devices required by state standards amtrak also contends its train had its headlights on bright,had its bell ringing,and sounded warning blasts for the crossing continuously from at least mile prior to the white harbor crossing,and continued to sound the horn at the time of the accident.the parties dispute the timing and length of the warning blast given by the amtrak train.the crossing was marked with advance warning signs,advance pavement markings,a cross buck,and automatic flashers with lights and bells indicating the presence of a train,which were engaged at the time of the accident.at the time of the accident,the crossing was not equipped with gates or crossing arms.on may,two years prior to the accident,csx was informed by the mississippi department of transportation that it was required to develop estimates for the installation of gates because a diagnostic survey team had determined that crossing gates were needed at the white harbor road crossing.following the accident,federal funds were provided for the installation of crossing gates.
immediately preceding the accident,the locomotive engineer of a stationary eastbound csx train,located on a nearby side track adjacent to and just west of the white harbor road crossing to avoid the oncoming amtrak train,stated that the decedent did not look in the direction of the westbound amtrak train prior to the collision.the parties dispute whether valentine was mislead into associating the activation of the crossing warning lights with the stationary csx train on the side track.witnesses testified that the stationary csx train was facing the crossing with its headlights on and smoke was emanating from its engine.also,the parties dispute whether the decedent view of the amtrak train was obscured by a stopped northbound van on white harbor road that had just traversed the crossing and by a railroad located on the northern part of the railroad just east and in close proximity to the white harbor road crossing.
on october,hesling brought a wrongful death action in the united states district court for the southern district of mississippi pursuant to.hesling alleged that csx breached its duty in maintaining an grade crossing at white harbor road failing to install automatic gates at the white harbor road crossing failing to protect the crossing by placing flagmen at the crossing until it was occupied by the amtrak train failing to provide protection at the crossing in violation of mississippi law and csx operating rule and failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances then and there existing so as to avoid the subject accident.hesling also alleged that amtrak breached its duty in operating its passenger train at an excessive rate of speed operating its passenger train at a speed at which the train could not,in the exercise of reasonable care,be stopped at the grade crossing to avoid the subject accident failing to maintain a reasonable and proper lookout for motorists approaching and using the crossing failing to see the decedent motor vehicle in sufficient time to avoid the subject accident failing to sound its whistle and ring its bell as the passenger train approached within yards of said crossing in violation of ann.and in other ways failing to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances then and there existing so as to avoid the subject accident.
discovery proceeded for approximately two and a half years.the jury trial began on january.the jury returned a verdict in favor of csx and amtrak on february.on february,hesling moved for judgment as a matter of law,motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or,in the alternative,motion for a new trial under federal rule of civil procedure a.the magistrate judge declined to disturb the jury verdict.hesling then filed a notice of appeal.subsequently,two previously undisclosed csx documents were discovered a csx newsletter rating the mississippi gulf coast corridor,which included the white harbor road crossing,as the most accident prone on the csx system,and an agreement between the city of long beach and csx providing that csx would not operate its trains faster than through long beach.based on this new discovery,hesling made a motion for relief from judgment under three subsections of federal rule of civil procedure b b based on newly discovered evidence b based upon fraud,misrepresentation,or other misconduct and the subsection b based upon extraordinary circumstances.the magistrate judge denied hesling b motion for relief.hesling filed a timely amended notice of appeal.
discussion 
preemption of the excessive train speed claim 
much of hesling arguments hinge on her challenge to the magistrate judge ruling on federal preemption therefore,we first address whether the federal railroad safety act frsa preempted hesling claim that amtrak violated a csx speed limit of a district court preemption ruling is reviewed de novo.branson greyhound lines,cir.
under,the federal railroad administration fra sets out maximum allowable speed limits for different classes of tracks.the white harbor road crossing was on a section of track rated as class.a class track has a maximum allowable speed of for freight trains and for passenger trains.hesling contends that the magistrate judge prejudicially erred in finding that the issue of speed was preempted because,according to hesling,the magistrate judge ignored statements in the federal register suggesting that track speed is distinguishable from train speed.hesling proffered to the magistrate judge excerpts from the federal register,which hesling argues demonstrate that while the fra set track speed limits,it did not intend to establish train speed limits.instead,according to hesling interpretation,train speed is left to the discretion of the railroads once a track classification is established.we disagree.
in csx,easterwood,the plaintiff brought a wrongful death action claiming,inter alia,csx was negligent for operating its trains at excessive speeds,d.the supreme court found that the frsa expressly preempted the plaintiff claims insofar as she asserted state tort claims based on excessive train speed.id.at.the plaintiff in easterwood conceded that the train was traveling less than the maximum allowable speed based on its track classification.id.at.nonetheless,the plaintiff argued that the train breached a duty to operate its train at a moderate and safe rate of speed.the court held that the track class designation not only set a ceiling for train speed but should be understood as covering the subject matter of train speed in other words,substantially subsumes the relevant state law as to claims based on train speed.id.at.therefore,the court found that under the frsa,any state law claim based on a train allegedly excessive speed is preempted by federal law.id.at.
it is undisputed by the parties that the track at the white harbor road crossing was rated a class track and,therefore,passenger trains are designated as safe for operating on it up to west.it is also undisputed that the amtrak train was traveling approximately at the time of the subject accident.if we were to accept hesling argument that track speed is distinguishable from train speed,the latter being discretionary,it would make the regulation in meaningless.hesling quotes the federal register to bolster her claim that the frsa only intended to set track speed,but left train speed within the discretion of the railroads.the federal register states,notwithstanding some of the language in easterwood that a cursory reading may otherwise indicate,fra has never assumed the task of setting train speed.rather,the agency holds railroads responsible for minimizing the risk of derailment by properly maintaining track for the speed they set themselves.track safety standards,june,codified at pt.although on its face the statement from the federal register supports hesling position,the meaning of the statement changes drastically when put back into context.the next sentence is illustrious,it elucidates f or example,if a railroad wants its freight trains to operate at between two certain locations,it must maintain the tracks between those locations to class standards.id.in other words,train speed is left to the discretion of railroads insofar as they can target what type of track designations they want to maintain.however,that is not to say that railroads can ignore federal regulations in setting their own train speeds,but rather,they have the information and ability to tailor their operations to the particular track designations they desire,and in that way they are the masters of their own universe.
hesling also avers that the railroad could have gone miles an hour across that crossing or miles an hour across that crossing.it was up to the railroad,itself,to determine that,the only limitation being the class of track.that is essentially the same argument the plaintiff in easterwood put forth by arguing that despite the maximum allowable speed,csx had the discretion and duty to operate at a safer,and more moderate speed under the circumstances.easterwood,at.the supreme court rejected the argument,and held that the state tort law claims concerning speed were preempted.id.at.the train here was going under the authorized track speed and any claims or arguments regarding excessive speed are preempted.to hold otherwise would contradict easterwood and its progeny.because amtrak maintained its train speed well within the speed ratings promulgated by the fra,the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion in finding that hesling excessive speed claims are preempted by federal law.
ii.discovery abuses 
next,hesling claims the district court erred in denying her motion for relief from judgment pursuant to rule b based on alleged discovery abuses committed by csx.
rule b provides that a court may relieve a party from final judgment based on newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under rule b.b.rule b provides for relief based on fraud misrepresentation,or other misconduct of an adverse party,and rule b further provides for relief based on any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.id.the purpose of rule b is to balance the principle of finality of a judgment with the interest of the court in seeing that justice is done in light of all the facts.seven elves,eskenazi,cir.t he decision to grant or deny relief under rule b lies within the sound discretion of the district court and will be reversed only for abuse of that discretion.edwards city of houston,cir en banc citations omitted.a district court abuses its discretion if it bases its decision on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.kennedy texas,cir citation omitted.
hesling contends two documents were fraudulently withheld during discovery.the first is a letter detailing a settlement agreement between csx and the cities of biloxi,gulfport,long beach,pass christian,bay louis and waveland.the correspondence,dated february,detailed a plan by which csx agreed for at least a period of one full calendar year from and after january,csx will operate all of its trains at a speed not greater than through the mississippi gulf coast.the other document withheld was the edition of an internal csx newsletter called csxtoday.the newsletter contained two articles hesling asserts are relevant look,listen and live states t he miles along the mississippi gulf coast is the most on the csxt system,and another article makes the twin observations that the mississippi gulf coast had the heaviest concentration of crossings on the whole system,and local ordinances in mississippi and florida forced csx to operate its freight service at a slower speed through populated areas.
neither document was produced during the discovery phase of the trial,despite,what hesling argues,were interrogatories and discovery requests which plainly required the production of the withheld documents.hesling second request for production of documents to csx asked for in relevant part 
request any and all correspondence between csx and long beach,mississippi the state of mississippi concerning the white harbor road crossing.
request all documents or records regarding the white harbor road crossing including but not limited to all interoffice memorandums,letters and documents of any nature concerning this crossing.
request copies of all special instructions for the division and track which would have been in effect for the csx and amtrak trains involved in the subject accident on the day in question.this should include but not be limited to copies of all train orders and track warrants and copies of all slow orders in effect on the day of the accident for this division and track.

appellant excerpt,tab.
relief under rule b 
under rule b,t o succeed on a motion for relief from judgment based on newly discovered evidence,our law provides that a movant must demonstrate that it exercised due diligence in obtaining the information and that the evidence is material and controlling and clearly would have produced a different result if present before the original judgment.goldstein mci worldcom,cir citation omitted.a judgment will not be reopened if the evidence is merely cumulative or impeaching and would not have changed the result.trans mississippi united states,cir.
hesling argues that despite due diligence on its part,csx failed to produce the withheld documents and,but for this error,a different result would have emerged from trial.specifically,hesling contends that although the magistrate judge found the issue of train speed federally preempted,it did not address the argument of a specific individual hazard,which is not preempted by federal law.according to hesling,the agreement would have been evidence that csx recognized such a hazard because it agreed to reduce the danger of operating at high speeds through long beach.because the documents would not be preempted,hesling argues they would have clearly affected the outcome of the trial.
section of the federal railroad safety act details its preemptive force the provision declares that laws,rules,regulations,orders,and standards relating to railroad safety are substantially subsumed by federal law.however,allows states to adopt additional or more stringent state regulation related to railroad safety to prevent a local hazard,but only if the state law is not incompatible with federal regulation and does not burden interstate commerce.easterwood,at.the legislative history of the frsa makes it abundantly clear that this savings clause is to be narrowly construed.easterwood csx,cir citing,reprinted in.
the supreme court in easterwood,although finding that excessive speed claims are preempted,specifically declined to decide if preempted related tort law duties like the duty to slow or stop a train to avoid a specific,individual hazard.easterwood,at.the term specific,individual hazard means a discrete and truly local hazard.seyler burlington santa fe,d,citations omitted.it relates to the avoidance of a specific collision.armstrong atchison,topeka santa fe ry.a condition that can be or is present at many,or most sites can not be a specific,individual hazard.see,earwood norfolk ry,see also bowman norfolk ry.most courts have rejected plaintiffs claims of a specific,individual hazard,finding instead that the circumstances are preempted 
the agreement applied to the rail system running through the entire mississippi gulf coast.hence,it is not an agreement to avoid a single,specific collision at any particular crossing,or in any particular municipality,and therefore the letter agreement is immaterial as evidence of a specific individual hazard.likewise,the csx newsletter makes an observation about the track speed and accident record of the entire mississippi gulf coast region.accordingly,neither the letter agreement nor the csx newsletter would fall under the specific,individual hazard exception,and thus,would not have clearly produced a different outcome at trial.
hesling also claims that the withheld documents were material because a jury instruction included csx argument that the proper speed through long beach was pursuant to federal law.according to hesling,the documents,in that they show csx exercising discretion in setting train speed in response to safety concerns,would have refuted the argument that the issue of train speed was preempted.
for the reasons we have already stated,the magistrate judge was correct in finding that the issue of train speed was preempted.the withheld documents dealt exclusively with train speed.ignoring the fact that there is no evidence the agreement was applicable for more than one full calendar year from and after january,even if csx had agreed to an internal rule capping the speed of a train operating on its track at,internal speed regulations can not overcome preemption.see michael norfolk ry,cir violation of the railroad own speed regulations may be evidence of negligence in a state tort claim for excessive speed however,such a state tort claim is preempted by federal law,and the internal railroad regulations would be irrelevant under federal law.because the withheld documents would not have changed the preemption determination,they clearly would not have affected the ultimate case determination.accordingly,we find that the magistrate judge did not err in denying hesling motion for relief from judgment under b.
relief under rule b 
next,hesling argues that csx failure to disclose the agreement and the csx newsletter amounted to fraud and misconduct.a party making a rule b motion must establish that the adverse party engaged in fraud or other misconduct,and that this misconduct prevented the moving party from fully and fairly presenting his case.gov t fin.servs.one.peyton place,cir quotations and citations omitted.the moving party has the burden of proving the misconduct by clear and convincing evidence.rozier ford motor,cir.unlike rule b,b does not require that the information withheld be such that it can alter the outcome of the case.id.rule b is aimed at judgments which were unfairly obtained,not at those which are factually incorrect.id.the rule is remedial and should be liberally construed.id.at quotations and citation omitted.the magistrate judge held that hesling was not prevented from fully and fairly presenting her case because even if the withheld documents had been available,the issue of speed was preempted.
in rozier,this court found that the plaintiff was prevented from fully and fairly presenting her case because,as a result of what was produced during discovery,the plaintiff decided not to assert certain theories of liability and others.id.at.the court determined that if the fraudulently withheld documents had been produced,it would have changed the way plaintiff counsel would have approached the case and prepared for trial.id.here,hesling argues that if she received the withheld evidence,she could have explored the issue of a specific individual hazard,inquired further into the background of the speed argument,and explore d the reasons for the installation of crossing gates after the subject accident.however,excessive train speed and the subsequent installation of crossing gates were arguments put before the court.the court found these issues to be inadmissible as a matter of law and excluded testimony or evidence on the matters.furthermore,as previously discussed,the documents are irrelevant to the issue of specific,individual hazard.therefore,the failure to produce the documents did not affect how hesling case was presented to the court.we need not reach the issue of whether csx committed fraud or misconduct during discovery because we agree with the magistrate judge finding that hesling has not shown interference in her ability to present her case.thus,the magistrate judge did not err in denying hesling motion for relief from judgment pursuant to rule b.
relief under rule b 
hesling also submits that relief under rule b was appropriate because csx counsel had actual knowledge of and involvement with the discovery that was withheld under rule b,a court may grant relief for any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.b.rule b is a grand reservoir of equitable power to do justice in a particular case when relief is not warranted by the preceding clauses.the broad language of clause gives the courts ample power to vacate judgments whenever such action is appropriate to accomplish justice.harrell dcs equip.leasing,cir citations omitted.however,r elief under this section is granted only if extraordinary circumstances are present.american totalisator,fair grounds,cir citation omitted the magistrate judge held that no extraordinary circumstances were presented in this case to warrant relief under rule b.
this court has consistently held that relief under b is mutually exclusive from relief available under sections.transit cas.sec.trust,cir.the reason for relief set forth under b can not be the reason for relief sought under another subsection of b.hess cockrell,cir.hesling can not obtain relief under b where the allegations of fraud or misconduct are essentially the identical grounds for relief sought under her b motion.but even assuming arguendo that hesling has managed to distinguish the grounds sought for relief under b from those sought under b,she is still not entitled to relief.we deem csx explanation for not disclosing the hesling did not specifically ask for them and because they are allegedly public be wholly unpersuasive and somewhat dubious in light of the clear language of the discovery documents and the nature of the lawsuit however,because the resolution of this issue does not turn on a fraud determination,we will not dwell on this point further.instead,we find that the magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion in holding that the facts here do not rise to the level of extraordinary circumstances justifying relief.
iii.jury instructions 
hesling makes several claims challenging the magistrate judge rulings concerning proposed jury instructions.hesling argues the court committed prejudicial error by charging the jury on the matter of speed,by refusing to charge the jury regarding the nature of the crossing,by refusing to charge the jury on the duty of the amtrak train to either slow its train or sound its emergency horn while maintaining a proper and reasonable lookout,and by refusing to give a spoliation
