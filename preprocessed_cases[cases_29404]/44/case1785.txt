this case involves a dispute between two primary insurers,royal surplus lines insurance company royal and evanston insurance company evanston,and an excess insurer,north american specialty insurance company north american and arises out of a tort suit against a nursing home.north american appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of royal and evanston.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
background 
velma carr sued the heritage sam houston gardens nursing home,its parent company heritage housing,and a number of its employees in state court for continuing negligence in the nursing home care of her husband,raymond carr.carr resided at the nursing home from february to june,when he was transferred to another home.he died in.the suit alleged that the nursing home pattern and practice of ongoing neglect caused carr to suffer from a dislocated shoulder,pressure sores,skin tears and contusions,ulcers,and other pain and indignity resulting from failures of basic care.at trial,a jury awarded over million in actual and punitive damages.royal thereafter settled the case with carr on behalf of the individual nurse defendants and took the position that its coverage was thereby exhausted 
the two corporate defendants appealed,with north american paying the costs of the appeal,and a state appellate court reversed the trial judgment against them.heritage housing,carr,dist,no pet.it rendered judgment in favor of heritage housing and remanded for a new trial against the nursing home id.subsequently,north american paid million to settle with the carrs on behalf of the nursing home before another trial was held.
meanwhile,north american filed a lawsuit,which was removed to federal court,over liability coverage for damages and defense costs incurred by insureds in the underlying tort suit.during the period over which carr alleged negligence,the insureds had three successive,insurance policies providing primary liability coverage a million policy from royal covering april to april a million policy from royal covering april to april and a policy from evanston covering april to april.concurrent with the primary policies,the insureds also had two policies providing excess coverage a million policy from north american covering april to april and a million policy from north american covering april to april.all of these policies were issued to the insureds with knowledge that the business being insured was a health care facility.as evanston noted,north american did not have an excess policy for the period covered by the evanston policy.it is undisputed that,in combination,evanston and royal have paid more than million in defense and indemnity costs for the carr lawsuit.north american concedes that if only one policy amount and only one policy type is implicated by the carr lawsuit,then appellees owe nothing further.
in the coverage case,north american argued,inter alia,that carr had sued for discrete acts of negligence occurring over the course of the three primary policy periods such that the primary coverage limits should be stacked.north american excess coverage then would not be triggered until the limit of the total of all three primary policies million has been reached.north american further argued that the stacking principle should apply to defense costs,in addition to indemnity coverage.finally,north american argued that the defense costs incurred on behalf of the nursing home parent company should be allocated to the commercial general liability cgl part of the primary insurance policies rather than the hospital professional liability hpl part 
on october,the district court granted partial summary judgment to royal and evanston,holding that the policies could not be temporally stacked for purposes of indemnity payments and that defense costs could not be allocated to the cgl portion of the policy.commercial underwriters ins.royal surplus lines ins,d.thereafter,the court granted further partial summary judgment to royal and evanston,holding that the policies could not be temporally stacked for defense cost allocation purposes.ultimately,the court issued final summary judgment as to all parties and issues,and this appeal followed.

iii.discussion 
this case involves,in essence,two forms of stacking temporal,across policies covering different time periods and subject matter,across policies within a time period that cover different potential liabilities.within the first category,north american seeks stacking of two different payments and defense costs.
equitable subrogation 
north american lawsuit is based on its contention that it is entitled to equitable subrogation as an excess carrier against primary carriers.at the outset,then,the question arises whether north american can assert such a claim here.evanston also challenges whether north american sought recovery on an equitable subrogation theory in the district court.texas cases providing a right of equitable subrogation to an excess carrier involve an excess carrier suing a primary carrier,where their respective policies overlap temporally.see,am.centennial ins.canal ins,allowing equitable subrogation by an excess carrier to the insured claim against the primary carrier.that is not the case here as to evanston.as a result,north american can not step into the shoes of its insured as to a primary carrier to which north american is not excess royal ins.caliber one indem,cir north american can not recover against evanston under a theory of equitable subrogation because evanston arguments under the stacking theory are also correct,we discuss the evanston policy along with the royal policies in that analysis below.
this case potentially presents the issue of whether recent texas cases have eroded the underpinnings of canal even in cases of temporally overlapping excess and primary policies,such as those of north american and royal.see excess underwriters at lloyd frank casing crew rental tools,holding that absent an express agreement to the contrary,a carrier who settles a claim later determined not to be covered by its policy can not sue the insured for reimbursement of the excess amount ins.liberty mut.ins,holding that in the absence of an agreement with each other,a primary carrier for the same policy period as another primary carrier has no right of contribution against the other carrier even if it pays more than its pro rata share of the defense or indemnity costs.distinguishes canal as follows in canal,we recognized equitable subrogation as a basis for an excess insurer recovery against a primary insurer to prevent a primary insurer from taking advantage of an excess insurer,acting solely as such,when a potential judgment approaches the primary insurer policy limits.at citing canal,at.canal involved an equitable subrogation claim based upon the insured own stowers claim against the primary carrier.
at oral argument,royal counsel conceded that the principles of equitable subrogation announced in canal have not been abrogated by later decisions.because we resolve this case on the stacking arguments,we need not decide the question of whether equitable subrogation applies to the royal policies.
temporal stacking 
thus,we turn to the stacking issues.stacking refers to the concept of taking policy limits from multiple,but not overlapping,policies potentially covering the same lawsuit and adding those limits together.am.physicians ins.exch.garcia.in garcia,the texas supreme court considered what coverage limit to apply when there are consecutive policies covering distinct policy periods and a claim occurrence extends throughout multiple policy periods.the court held that the coverage limits could not be stacked to multiply coverage for a single claim involving indivisible injury such that the coverage limit would be the sum of the limits provided by the applicable policies.id.at.instead,when a single occurrence triggers more than one policy,covering different policy periods,the insured indemnity limit should be whatever limit applied at the single point in time during the coverage periods of the triggered policies when the insured limit was highest.id.at.
the parties in this case do not dispute the validity of garcia rule.rather,they disagree about whether the liability arising from carr suit involved a single covered event or multiple discrete covered events.under garcia rule,if the negligence at the nursing home constituted a single covered event,it would trigger only one coverage limit.but if the negligence consisted of multiple,discrete covered events,each such event would trigger its own separate coverage limit.
in answering this question,we begin with the policy language.the royal policies cover medical incidents and define a medical incident as any act or omission a.in the providing of or failure to provide professional health care services to your patients,including the providing or dispensing of food,beverages,medications or medical supplies or appliances in connection with such services they further state that a ll related medical incidents arising out of the providing of or failure to provide professional health care services to any one person shall be considered one medical incident.the evanston policy likewise provides that its professional liability coverage insures sums the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of malpractice arising out of the rendering of,or failure to render,the following professional services in the named insured,nursing home medical or nursing treatment to a patient,including the furnishing of food or beverages in connection therewith.it further states that t wo or more claims arising out of a single act,error,omission or occurrence or a series of related acts,errors,omissions,or occurrence s shall be treated as a single claim.
the key word in both of these policies is the same related.under both policies,a series of multiple incidents becomes a single continuing incident or occurrence only if they are related.although the policies do not further clarify the meaning of related,a texas appellate court has construed the term in a similar insurance contract to mean having a logical or causal connection.columbia cas.cp,dist,pet.denied.
in this case,the district court considered summary judgment evidence consisting of the pleadings,trial transcript,and jury findings of the underlying suit,and concluded that the negligent acts at the nursing home were related carr complaint alleged serious bodily injuries which were proximately caused by the continuing negligence of the insureds.d at.elsewhere it referred to the nursing home continuing course of repeated negligence.id.at.the court summarized 
t he plaintiff theory in the underlying suit,a theory upon which she prevailed,was that carr was injured by a series of acts and omissions that were related,having both causal connections,the pattern of negligence was caused by management focus on cutting costs and logical connections,all of the relevant are logically connected to the concept of professional nursing home care,to which carr was entitled.
thus,while one could argue that each day the nursing home committed an act of negligence in failing to properly feed or treat carr,these events are all related.north american points out that carr problems began with poor nutritional care,followed by a shoulder injury,which led to mobility problems,which led to sores,skin ulcers and similar conditions.while north american contends these are discrete events,they all stemmed from a pattern of neglect and incompetence.indeed,as noted above,the district court concluded that the carrs theory of the case in its complaint,continuing into its presentation of evidence at trial,was one of a continuing pattern of neglect,not a series of discrete events in this appeal,north american has not pointed to any specific evidence showing discrete,unrelated injuries leading to discrete damages with individualized,unrelated damages.rule does not impose upon the district court a duty to sift through the record in search of evidence to support a party opposition to summary judgment.nor is it our duty to do so on appeal.stults conoco,cir citations omitted.
we conclude that garcia applies to prevent north american from temporally stacking the policies for indemnity purposes.under garcia,the insured and north american as its equitable subrogee is entitled to whatever limit applied at the single point in time during the coverage periods of the triggered policies when the insured limit was highest.garcia,at.in this case,that is million.
defense costs 
the policies in question are eroding policies.liability insurance policies often have two components defense and indemnity.in many liability policies,the policy limits refer only to the indemnity obligation,the duty to pay covered claims,and the obligation to defend a liability suit is not capped by the policy limits.in an eroding policy,by contrast,the insurer payments to defense counsel to defend the liability suit count against the policy limits.westchester fire ins.admiral ins,worth,pet.denied.for example,if the eroding policy limits are,and the insurer pays in reasonable defense fees,the policy limits for that occurrence are exhausted.
thus,in the garcia case,the focus of the inquiry was the indemnity obligation,because the duty to defend did not have a policy limit.here,the three policies do have a limit on defense costs because those costs,including attorneys fees,are included in the per medical incident limits.
north american argues that even if the garcia rule applies to prevent stacking for indemnity purposes,it should allow stacking for defense purposes.north american cited no cases for this proposition and acknowledges that there are few cases nationwide addressing eroding policies at all,much less in the context of stacking.it suggests,then,that even if garcia requires the insured to select one policy under which obligations would be measured,we should allow the insured to select one policy for indemnity and another for defense,because of the eroding nature of the policies.
north american makes two arguments in support of this contention,unsupported by any precedent.first,north american argues that fairness dictates that the insured should get the benefit of having paid multiple premiums over the years.this argument would make sense if the carr family were the only potential claimant in any of those years.but insurance is purchased to cover unintended,unexpected events,few or many,year after year.an insured who buys car insurance every year for years and never has an accident is not entitled to a refund of premiums.he received what he bargained for each year.
here,we have no information about other claimants,but it matters not whether they were few or many.the nursing home bargained for insurance year after year,and it received that insurance.if what it wanted was more coverage each year,it could obtain that by paying it did by buying the excess policies for two of the three years.if it wanted higher primary policy limits,it could obtain that by paying more for increased coverage.what it did instead was insure itself temporally under policies providing that related incidents involving one injured person constitute one claim,whether year after year or within one year.
even more importantly,if the insured wanted a policy that had an unlimited defense obligation,rather than an eroding one,it should have contracted for such a policy.north american argument would actually give the nursing home the benefit of an additional million in defense costs coverage,despite its failure to contract for that coverage.thus,the fairness argument is unpersuasive 
north american makes a second argument directed only at the royal policies,citing the following policy language 
the limits of this coverage part apply separately to each consecutive annual period and to any remaining period of less than months,starting with the beginning of the policy period shown in the declara
