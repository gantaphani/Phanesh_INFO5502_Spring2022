background 
colleen piccone,a resident of new york,is deputy associate chief counsel to customs and border protection,part of the united states department of homeland security dhs.her boyfriend,peter quaglia,is a new special agent with the same agency.in january,the massachusetts department of social services dss and local police began investigating piccone brother,louis,for alleged child abuse.the state court granted temporary custody of louis three children to dss.meanwhile,louis fled the state with his wife and children.subsequently,the court issued warrants for the parents arrest.
piccone applied for temporary custody of her brother children with the intent of supervising them in the family dalton,massachusetts home.on february,piccone traveled with quaglia from new york to massachusetts to attend a hearing on her application.before the hearing began,a juvenile court probation officer informed piccone and quaglia that someone would need to install a carbon monoxide detector in louis home in order to place the children there in piccone care.on counsel advice,piccone and quaglia purchased a detector at a local hardware store and headed to louis home to install it before the hearing.
when they arrived,piccone and quaglia found two police officers at the house.defendant john bartels,chief of the dalton police department,demanded that piccone and quaglia identify themselves and told them that they could not enter the dwelling.piccone presented her driver license and quaglia showed his federal identification.after a tense exchange,bartels called the juvenile court probation officer,who confirmed that piccone and quaglia had been told to install a carbon monoxide detector in the home.bartels returned to quaglia and told him that he could enter the house and install the detector.quaglia did so,and then he and piccone left for the courthouse.
later that day,bartels spoke with a state trooper and expressed his frustration that quaglia and piccone were telling everybody what to do.that that what really gets my ass out.the state trooper encouraged bartels to m ake calls to the federal agency,get someone fired,do something.shortly after speaking with the state trooper,bartels contacted dhs to complain about plaintiffs behavior and spoke with matthew carbone,an agent with dhs office of inspector general.during their conversation,bartels described his encounter with plaintiffs at length and told carbone that he found their conduct unprofessional after describing how he and his fellow officer asked plaintiffs for identification and told them that they could not go in the house,bartels relayed the following information 
uh and there was a little bit of a uh an argument.you know things were getting a little agitated here.uh and my fellow officer and i were on a high anxiety level as it was because we been dealing with this thing for two weeks but at any rate i told them you not going in to the house,period.uh until we told by the court that you can.and uh they then um you know obeyed what we said.and they went and sat in their car.
bartels then explained that he had confirmed plaintiffs story about the carbon monoxide detector with the juvenile court probation officer.carbone replied 
carbone ok.so their story did pan out.
bartels it did.
carbone it just that they really were too social about it.
bartels no.they were.
carbone pointed out that it was good for piccone and quaglia that they had explicitly told bartels that they came to the house on a private matter and not on official federal agency business and just showed bartels their id,which happened to be government id.carbone also noted that the story they gave bartels was actually corroborated because they did have the co detector.bartels acknowledged those facts,but said 
well there were a lot of there were a lot of questions as for what authority we had.um you know and well i i it seemed like they did feel that we had the authority to tell them no you not going into the house and not knowing who they were.i mean it was just kind of more of a hassle than we needed to go through.
bartels expressed his view that plaintiffs could have ma de things a little bit easier on us so that the officers did have to increase their level of aggression.carbone replied 
carbone uh clearly unprofessional conduct on their on their part uh.
bartels on that level yes.now to uh um quaglia credit,he apologized at the end of all this.
carbone ok.
bartels uh and he said we at a high stress level he drove all night to get here 
carbone mm hm.
bartels uh and uh uh i can understand that.and i uh told him that.i said listen,i know things are things are at a fever pitch right now.but we do need to go through this type of stuff because it just makes matters worse.
carbone right.
bartels uh so um all in all they left in an amicable fashion.i did have any further conversation with piccone because after the initial conversation,she went into the car,i never spoke with her again.
bartels went on to note that the situation was kind of defused when his fellow officer cool ed plaintiffs down and quaglia apologized.
midway through the conversation,carbone inquired,did you guys believe that quaglia or colleen knew where the parents were bartels replied that the officers did ask them specifically but pointed out 
i ca believe they been involved in this thing since the.and i believe it was colleen house which was searched by nypd and that was hell,that was back on the of this month or of last month.so not to know that there are warrants,i do know.
carbone then asked,is it fair to presume that she probably knows where they are,she trying to get the foster or adoption paperwork done so that she can amicably take custody of the kids and then the parents would turn themselves in bartels replied in the affirmative i think that their motive.uh i think they want to uh get the kids situated.and then let uh the parents uh you know deal with their criminal charges here.
carbone then said that he originally had the impression that piccone and quaglia were p urposely hiding stuff and n ot being cooperative with law enforcement,but told bartels,the fact that you guys did pressure plaintiffs to identify the location of the kids and parents in the driveway with them leads me to believe that it not that that type of an emergency.carbone signaled that it would definitely have been a customs and border protection policy violation if quaglia and piccone either had misrepresent ed that they there for immigration reasons and they were or thwart ed law enforcement from finding a fugitive.bartels clarified,no that that did happen.
bartels acknowledged again,i do know that there an emergency but told carbone,t he more i rattle that family tree t he better i going to feel.he reiterated his displeasure with what he viewed as piccone and quaglia lack of professional courtesy during the interaction yeah,you know,i not with the department of homeland security and yeah,i do have the connections you do,but goddamn it,i a cop just like you are.shortly after,carbone asked whether bartels kn ew that quaglia and piccone were aware that the state had issued arrest warrants for louis and his wife.bartels responded,no i do know that,and then continued,b ut i assuming that they know where the family members are,only because they here trying to help get custody of the children.
toward the close of the phone call,carbone noted that he was hesitant to ratchet the investigation up another level if the law enforcement authority that actually looking for the parents did ask plaintiffs those tough questions about the missing family whereabouts.bartels confirmed that he did not need carbone to initiate an emergency investigation and concluded 
and i not looking uh for heads to roll.uh i just looking to you know say hey where are they.uh evidently
