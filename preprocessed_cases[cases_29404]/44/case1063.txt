opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on an appeal from a supplementary order entered following the district court ruling and entry of an order on for summary judgment in a case arising out of a workplace accident at a philadelphia parking garage.appellee,ramara,ramara,the garage owner,engaged sentry builders corporation sentry as a general contractor to perform work at its parking garage,and,in turn,sentry engaged a subcontractor,fortress steel services,fortress,to install concrete and steel components as part of the work.as required by its subcontracting agreement with sentry,fortress obtained a general liability insurance policy the policy from westfield insurance group westfield naming ramara as an additional insured under the policy.while fortress was working on the project in april,one of its employees on the job,anthony axe,was injured in an accident.as a result of his injury,axe filed a tort action against ramara and sentry but he did not include fortress as a defendant as it was immune from actions at law by its employees for injuries suffered on the job if they were entitled to compensation for their injuries under the pennsylvania workers compensation act act ramara tendered its defense in axe action to westfield.but westfield declined to defend ramara as it claimed that axe complaint against ramara did not include allegations imposing that obligation on it under its policy with its applicable endorsements.ramara responded by initiating this action.
both parties moved for summary judgment,and the district court on november,granted partial summary judgment to ramara and denied summary judgment to westfield.ramara,westfield ins,d.the court on december,entered a supplemental order that included a quantified judgment in favor of ramara against westfield for ramara counsel fees and costs incurred to date and ordered that westfield prospectively provide defense to ramara in the underlying action app.westfield timely appealed from the december,order.we address two issues on this appeal whether we have jurisdiction and,if so,whether westfield must defend ramara in the axe action.

iv.background 
factual background 
as we have indicated,ramara engaged sentry to be its general contractor for work at its parking garage and on or about february,sentry contracted with a subcontractor,fortress,to install concrete and steel components at the garage.sentry and fortress memorialized their understanding in a letter the agreement which required fortress to provide all labor and equipment necessary to perform the work in a workmanlike manner and in accordance with the acceptable standard of the trade.app.the agreement further required fortress to supervise the project until its completion.in addition,the agreement stipulated that sentry builders corporation and or ramara,will not be responsible for the procedures or actions of fortress steel in its performance or deliveries to complete the work.app.finally,the agreement stated that fortress steel will before commencement of work provide sentry builders insurance for workmen compensation and general liability with the appropriate limits of coverage,said certificate s of insurance shall also include the landlord ramara,as additional insured.app.
westfield issued a certificate of liability insurance showing that fortress was the named insured under a policy that provided million of primary liability coverage for each occurrence and million of umbrella coverage.app.ramara and sentry were listed as additional insureds under a typewritten section of the certificate entitled description of vehicles.app.the typewritten section reads re project city avenue additional insureds include ramara and sentry builders with regard to above referenced project.app.fortress thereafter began work at the job site.
in april,axe was injured during the course of his employment by fortress while working at ramara parking garage.axe filed a lawsuit axe,the underlying action,seeking damages for his injuries in the philadelphia county court of common pleas against ramara,as the property owner,and sentry,as the general contractor,but he did not include fortress,his employer,as a defendant,for,as we already have set forth,it would have had immunity in the action by reason of the pennsylvania workers compensation act.see.ann.the liability of an employer under this act shall be exclusive and in place of any and all other liability.when ramara sought a defense under the policy,westfield refused to provide that defense as it contended that the policy did not insure ramara for axe claims arising from the accident.
key provisions of the policy 
westfield predicated its denial of coverage on its interpretation of several provisions in the policy now at issue on this appeal.the two provisions that we need consider are the additional insured owners,lessees or contractors automatic status when required in construction agreement with you the additional insured endorsement and an other insurance endorsement.the additional insured endorsement in relevant part reads as follows 
section ii who is an insured 
is amended to include as an additional insured any person or organization for whom you are performing operations when you and such person or organization have agreed in writing in a contract or agreement that such person or organization be added as an additional insured on your policy.such person or organization is an additional insured only with respect to liability for bodily injury,property damage,or personal and advertising injury caused,in whole or in part,by 
your acts or omissions or 
the acts or omissions of those acting on your behalf in the performance of your ongoing operations for the additional insured.
a person or organization status as an additional insured under this endorsement ends when your operations for that additional insured are completed.
app.second emphasis added.westfield argues that for this paragraph to require it to defend ramara in the axe case,the complaint in that case must have alleged explicitly that fortress acts or omissions proximately caused axe injuries.
ramara responds to westfield interpretation of the additional insured endorsement by arguing that it conflicts with the policy other insurance endorsement and therefore westfield interpretation of the additional insured endorsement would not be harmonious with the totality of the insurance contract.the other insurance endorsement provides,in relevant part 
when required by written contract with any additional insured owner,lessee,or contractor to provide insurance on a primary and noncontributory basis,condition.of section iv commercial liability conditions is deleted and replaced by the following 
other insurance 
if other valid and collectible insurance is available for a loss we cover under coverages a or b of this coverage part,our obligations are limited as follows 
primary insurance 
this insurance is primary and except when below applies.
excess insurance 
this insurance is excess over any of the other insurance,
if the loss is caused by the sole negligence of any additional insured owner,lessee,or contractor.
app.first and last emphasis added.westfield claims that there is not a written contract providing additional insured coverage to ramara on a primary and basis.thus,it contends that this provision is inapplicable in this case.ramara,however,maintains that the policy should be construed in its entirety,to give meaning to all of its provisions.specifically,ramara contends,for reasons that we explain below in detail,that when the contract is analyzed as a comprehensive document,westfield interpretation of the additional insured endorsement,in effect,would nullify the other insurance endorsement.according to ramara,if we accept westfield interpretation of the additional insured endorsement,there never could be excess coverage under the other insurance endorsement for such coverage would exist only for losses caused by ramara sole negligence but the additional insured endorsement would provide coverage for ramara only for acts or omissions caused in whole or in part by fortress or someone acting on its behalf.
procedural background 
ramara claims to have expected that as an additional insured under the policy,it would be protected from bodily injury claims arising out of fortress work at the job site.accordingly,after it received the writ of summons from the axe lawsuit,ramara tendered its defense to westfield and requested that it defend ramara in the axe case and indemnify it from any judgment against it in that case.as we explained above,westfield declined to defend ramara,claiming that axe suit against ramara did not trigger its obligation to defend ramara under the policy and its additional insured endorsement.in response,ramara filed a declaratory judgment and breach of contract action against westfield,fortress,sentry,and axe in the philadelphia court of common pleas.but notwithstanding ramara inclusion of additional parties as defendants,this case is essentially an action between ramara and westfield.westfield removed the action to the district court.
in the district court,ramara moved for partial summary judgment on its claim that westfield had a duty to defend it in the underlying axe case.westfield for summary judgment on the claim and sought a ruling that it did not have an obligation to defend ramara.applying pennsylvania law,the court granted partial summary judgment to ramara and denied summary judgment to westfield in an order on november.the order included a provision that if ramara sought reimbursement for its fees and costs to date in the axe case it should submit an itemized list of these expenses and it gave westfield an opportunity to object to ramara claim.ramara submitted the list and the court in a december,order entered judgment against westfield for,the agreed upon amount of counsel fees and costs that ramara had accrued to date in defending the axe case.as part of the december,order,the court also mandated that westfield prospectively provide defense to ramara in the underlying action app.
westfield filed a timely notice of appeal on december,appealing from the december,order after the appeal was docketed in this court,ramara filed several motions in the district court,including a motion to alter or amend the december,order and a motion to strike westfield notice of appeal from the december,order.westfield opposed both motions.on january,the district court issued an order that,among other things,granted ramara motion to strike westfield notice of appeal from the december,order and partially granted ramara motion to alter or amend the december,judgment.on march,westfield filed an amended notice of appeal that included an appeal from the january,order.
our clerk by an order on january,directed the parties to submit briefing on the question of whether we have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.the order noted that the december,order of the district court from which westfield had appealed did not appear to dismiss all claims as to all parties and that it has not been certified under.b.app.the clerk subsequently issued a second order on march,affording the parties the opportunity to submit briefing on the district court authority to issue an order striking the notice of appeal app.with all briefing now completed,we turn to the questions presented by this appeal.
discussion 
we first must decide whether we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal.see steel,at.at.after all,w ithout jurisdiction the court can not proceed at all in any cause.id.citation omitted.then,if we conclude that we have jurisdiction,we will interpret the language of the policy to determine whether the factual allegations in the underlying complaint potentially trigger coverage for ramara in the axe case.see am.contract bridge league nationwide mut.fire ins,cir applying pennsylvania law.in making these determinations,we view the factual allegations in the underlying axe complaint as true and liberally construe them in ramara favor as the insured.see frog,switch,at.
a.we have jurisdiction because the district court december,order is a mandatory injunction under a.
in its december,order the district court directed that p rospectively,westfield shall provide defense to ramara in the underlying action app.westfield appeals from this order and the january,order amending it.therefore,the question of whether we have jurisdiction over this appeal hinges on whether the december order qualifies as an injunction under a,as that section provides the only possible basis for us to have jurisdiction,or instead is we conclude that the order is an injunction and thus we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal.
a district court injunctive order,even if it is not a final judgment,is immediately appealable under a.see aleynikov goldman sachs,cir.in a determination of whether an order is injunctive,a district court characterization of its order is not dispositive.thus,as the cases we discuss will explain,what counts is what the court actually did,not what it said it did.see sampson murray,d.therefore,if a district court grants an interlocutory injunction,the order granting the injunction is appealable.tokarcik forest hills sch,cir.
we emphasize that rather than using a labeling test,we use a functional test under which the nature of the relief in the order on appeal determines if an order is injunctive.cohen bd.of trs.of the of med.and dentistry,cir en banc.in a functional test analysis,an order is injunctive if it adjudicates some of the relief sought in the complaint and is of such a nature that if it grants relief it could be enforced pendente lite by contempt if necessary.id.at see also wright,miller,cooper gressman,federal practice procedure,ed.
in circumstances similar to those here,we concluded that a grant of partial summary judgment was injunctive and,accordingly,was immediately appealable under a.see aleynikov,at.in aleynikov,the appellee brought suit seeking indemnification and advancement of his attorney fees from the appellant,his former employer,arising from a criminal prosecution against him relating to his employment.aleynikov goldman sachs,no.civ.km,wl,at.following expedited discovery,the district court granted the appellee motion for summary judgment with respect to his claims for advancement of certain fees,but denied his motion with respect to indemnification and fees.id.at.
on appeal,we stated that although the district court did not use the term injunction in its order granting partial summary judgment,the nature of the relief granted is determinative in deciding whether a remedy is equitable or legal.aleynikov,at.we concluded that an order that prospectively grants an indeterminate amount of monetary relief is equitable in nature.as we explained in aleynikov,where an order for the payment of money is and involves an amount that can not be calculated with specificity,it is equitable.because the order for partial summary judgment in aleynikov adjudicated some of the relief sought in the complaint and granted relief that could be enforced pendente lite by contempt if necessary,we concluded that it was immediately appealable under a.id.
here,the district court december,order granted relief similar to that in aleynikov and thus the december,order is immediately appealable.the order directing westfield to defend ramara prospectively is an order for the payment of money that is and currently indeterminate because it requires westfield to pay defense costs for the duration of the axe action.see aleynikov,at.the order granted ramara some of the relief that it sought in the complaint and was enforceable pendente lite.nevertheless,ramara contends that we do not have jurisdiction to review that order because,unlike the appellee in aleynikov,ramara does not request indemnification and fees.ramara observation is true but inapposite.
we reiterate that aleynikov makes clear that the relief granted by a district court not the relief sought by a party determines whether an order is injunctive.therefore,even though the appellee summary judgment motion in aleynikov sought both indemnification and fees,our analysis focused on the nature of the relief that the district court actually granted by its order to determine whether that order was immediately appealable.moreover,ramara proposed rule would allow a strategically drafted summary judgment motion to block an interlocutory appeal under a from an order entered on the motion any time the movant sought indemnification and fees,regardless of the relief that the district court actually granted.neither our holding nor our reasoning in aleynikov supports such a result.
ramara motion for partial summary judgment in this case only sought relief with respect to westfield duty to defend it in the axe action the district court specifically noted in its january,order that the issue of westfield duty to indemnify is still outstanding and not yet ripe for resolution.app.nevertheless,the court december,order directing westfield to defend ramara prospectively in the axe lawsuit granted monetary relief of an indeterminate amount.see aleynikov,at.in these circumstances,aleynikov controls,and ramara claim that our case law does not support westfield position that it can appeal under a is simply wrong.see appellee br.at.
in reaching our result,we also note that other courts of appeals have addressed the precise question before us now.for example,in w holding aig ins.rico,the court found that it had jurisdiction over an appeal from a district court order directing the appellant insurer to advance the appellees defense costs,cir.reasoning that an order nature depends on its operative terms and effects,the court concluded that the district judge order certainly seem ed to fit the bill of an appealable injunction under a.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.similarly,in westar energy,lake the court determined that it had jurisdiction over an appeal from a district court order that directed the appellant corporation to advance criminal defense costs to the appellee on a prospective basis,cir.although the district court granted relief in that case that was not labelled an injunction,the court of appeals nonetheless concluded that the relief was equitable in nature and therefore the order was immediately appealable under a.id.at.
there are other courts of appeals decisions supporting our result.for example,in pacific insurance general development the court found that it could exercise jurisdiction over a district court order granting partial summary judgment to appellees and directing the appellant insurer to pay their defense costs pending resolution of its rescission claim,cir.because the interlocutory order mandated that the insurer pay defense costs,the court held that it was an immediately appealable injunction for purposes of a id.at citation omitted see also abercrombie fitch fed.ins,app x,cir holding that a district court order enjoining the insurer from failing and refusing to pay the appellee defense costs fit s the requirements of an injunctive order,over which we have jurisdiction under a gon first state ins,cir finding that an order directing an insurer to pay the insured defense expenses as they were incurred met the general definition of an injunction and was immediately appealable.
in light of our reasoning buttressed by decisions of other courts of appeals,we are satisfied that we have jurisdiction over the district court december,order directing westfield to defend ramara prospectively.although the order did enter judgment in ramara favor against westfield for in legal fees and costs relief that is legal in nature the order also directed westfield to defend ramara going forward and thus it granted equitable relief and was immediately appealable.though ramara moved to amend the december,order by striking its language as it contends that it did not seek that relief in the district court,the court january,order clarified that the december order had not terminated the entire action and did not remove the relief app.
it is clear that the relief the district court granted by its december,order is prospective,grants some of the relief that ramara requested,and could be enforced pendente lite by contempt,if necessary.see cohen,at.despite the district court characterization of the december,order in its january,order as one granting specific performance of a contract term,app,the relief granted in the december,order was in part equitable.consequently,the district court december,order includes a mandatory injunction and is immediately appealable at least to the extent that it granted equitable relief under a 
ramara as an additional insured under the policy is entitled to a defense in the axe case.
with the jurisdictional issue behind us,we turn now to the question of whether the underlying complaint supported the district court conclusion that westfield owed ramara a duty to defend it in the axe lawsuit.an insurer duty to defend is a distinct obligation that is different from and broader than the duty to indemnify.sikirica nationwide ins,cir citations omitted.because an insurer duty to defend its insured in a lawsuit is broader than its duty to indemnify,it necessarily follows that it will not have a duty to indemnify an insured for a judgment in an action for which it was not required to provide defense.id.citations omitted under pennsylvania law,which is applicable on the insurance coverage issue,a court ascertaining whether an insurer has a duty to defend its insured makes its determination by defining the scope of coverage under the insurance policy on which the insured relies and comparing the scope of coverage to the allegations of the underlying complaint.id.at see also accident ins.of am.allen.if the allegations of the underlying complaint potentially could support recovery under the policy,there will be coverage at least to the extent that the insurer has a duty to defend its insured in the case.sikirica,at citing gen accident ins.of,at.

to determine whether based on its factual allegations an underlying complaint triggers an insurer duty to defend,a court views the allegations as true and liberally construe s them in favor of the insured.frog,switch,at citation omitted.an insurer must defend its insured until it becomes absolutely clear that there is no longer a possibility that the insurer owes its insured a defense.see am.foreign ins.jerry sport,as long as the complaint might or might not fall within the policy coverage,the insurance company is obliged to defend i t is the potential,rather than the certainty,of a claim falling within the insurance policy that triggers the insurer duty to defend.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,an insurer has a duty to defend if there is any possibility that its coverage has been triggered by allegations in the underlying complaint.id.with these principles in mind,and after reviewing the policy with its endorsements,we conclude that westfield has a duty to defend ramara in the axe action because based on the factual allegations in the complaint the axe complaint potentially triggers coverage.
the allegations of the axe complaint potentially implicate fortress under both a proximate cause or but for causation standard.
at bottom,this case concerns whether the axe complaint sufficiently alleges,as required by the additional insured endorsement,that axe injuries potentially were caused,in whole or in part by fortress acts or omissions or the acts or omissions of someone acting on fortress behalf.if it does,then ramara is an additional insured under the policy with respect to the axe action and is entitled to a defense in that case.if it does not,then ramara is not an additional insured with respect to the axe action and westfield does not have a duty to defend ramara.we decide this question by comparing the allegations of the axe complaint to the language of the policy.see kvaerner,at.we reiterate that our interpretation of the policy is a question of law over which we exercise plenary review.see fourth street investors ins.in addition,we must construe any ambiguities in the policy in favor of the insured to further the contract prime purpose of indemnification and against the insurer,as the insurer drafts the policy,and controls coverage.kvaerner,at citation omitted.
in support of its contention that the allegations of the axe complaint fall outside of the policy,westfield first relies on language in the additional insured endorsement.specifically,westfield claims that under dale cumberland mutual fire insurance,wl,the endorsement language that requires axe bodily injury to be caused,in whole or in part by fortress acts or omissions,or someone acting on its behalf,limits coverage to situations in which axe explicitly alleges that fortress proximately caused his injuries.westfield contends that the axe complaint does not contain such allegations and therefore it does not have a duty to defend ramara in the axe action.
in response,ramara largely repeats the arguments that it made in the district court.ramara starts from the premise that pennsylvania courts have not interpreted the caused,in whole or in part language of the additional insured endorsement.ramara then asserts that the interpretation advanced by the district court in dale and on which westfield relies is more restrictive than that which the pennsylvania supreme court likely would adopt.ramara contends that fortress conduct need only have been a cause of axe injuries to entitle it to a defense in the axe case.moreover,ramara maintains that even if we adopt westfield proximate cause argument with respect to fortress conduct,the allegations of the axe complaint still would entitle it to that defense.
like the district court,we find that westfield must defend ramara under either the or proximate cause interpretation of the additional insured endorsement.because a proximate cause requirement is more demanding than a cause requirement meaning that allegations satisfying the former necessarily will satisfy the latter,though the opposite is not true but is possible we first will consider whether the allegations of the axe complaint suffice under the proximate cause test.proximate causation is defined as a cause which was a substantial factor in bringing about the plaintiff harm.bouriez carnegie mellon,cir see also hamil bashline,restatement second of torts.the concept is essentially a limiting principle that functions as shorthand for the judgment that not all factual causes contributing to an injury should be legally cognizable causes.csx,mcbride,d we therefore must determine whether the axe complaint potentially alleges that fortress acts or omissions were a substantial factor in axe being injured.
the axe complaint is rife with allegations satisfying the proximate cause test.in his complaint,axe alleges that fortress employed him at the time of his accident,and that sentry engaged fortress as an independent contractor he claims that he was injured severely when he fell through an opening in the garage deck while attempting to set beam clips in the course of his normal duties at the job site.axe also alleges that ramara act ed by and through its agents,servants employees and fail ed to adequately inspect and monitor the work performed.app.app.as the district court observed,if axe was injured during the course of his normal duties at the job site,and the injury was caused by the acts or omission of ramara agents,contractors,or subcontractors of which fortress was one these allegations raise at least the potential that fortress conduct was a proximate cause of his injuries.ramara,d at.
in addition,axe pleads that ramara failed to provide and require that equipment be used in accordance with industry standards.app.he further avers that ramara employed retained,or was obligated to employ field personnel,project supervisors and safety inspectors to inspect the work being performed at the job site.app.yet,fortress employees used equipment that fortress owned and performed work that axe asserted necessarily fell within the scope of ramara supervision.app.finally,axe claims that ramara was negligent by failing to hire competent contractors and subcontractors perform construction services in manner consistent with the prevailing standard of care in the construction industry supervise the construction work coordinate with the other entities and subcontractors on the premises and enforce a site specific fall protection plan.app.
taken together and construed liberally in favor of ramara for purposes of this insurance coverage case,these allegations partially base ramara liability on its failure to supervise the work of its contractors or subcontractors who used equipment improperly and disregarded a site specific fall protection plan,all while performing their work in violation of the industry standard of care.fortress,though engaged by sentry,was one of ramara subcontractors,and axe employment by fortress was the sole reason that axe was at the job site and was injured.clearly,axe made factual allegations that potentially would support a conclusion that axe injuries were caused,in whole or in part by fortress acts or omissions.of course,we need not and,indeed,can not decide whether axe will succeed on these claims at trial.ramara only must show that the axe complaint,when liberally construed in favor of ramara,includes allegations to support a conclusion that fortress was potentially negligent and that its negligence was a proximate cause of axe injuries.we conclude that it does.accordingly,ramara comes within the additional insured endorsement of the policy with respect to the axe case.therefore,ramara is entitled to a defense in the axe case even under westfield narrow interpretation of the additional insured endorsement limiting coverage to situations in which an insured contractor actions proximately caused a plaintiff injuries.
the other insurance endorsement supports ramara interpretation of the additional insured endorsement.
although ramara qualifies as an additional insured under either the or proximate cause interpretation of the additional insured endorsement,we point out that ramara causation interpretation is correct.in the district court,ramara argued that the language of the additional insured endorsement was not easy to reconcile with the other insurance endorsement under westfield proximate cause interpretation.the district court agreed,concluding that the language of the other insurance endorsement supported ramara interpretation.we also conclude that the other insurance endorsement supports ramara reading.
a court function when interpreting an insurance policy under pennsylvania law,is to ascertain the intent of the parties as manifested by the language of the written instrument.am.auto.ins.murray,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.a court must read the policy as a whole and construe it according to the plain meaning of its terms.heist caribe am.home assurance,cir.a court construes commonly used words and phrases in their natural,plain,and ordinary sense,with the court free to consult a dictionary to inform its understanding of terms.am.auto.ins,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.but if those terms are open to more than one interpretation,they are regarded as ambiguous.med.protective watkins,cir.it is well established that a mbiguous provisions in an insurance policy must be construed against the insurer and in favor of the insured any reasonable interpretation offered by the insured,therefore,must control.id.at citation omitted.pennsylvania courts apply this rule liberally.id.
under the policy,the other insurance endorsement provides that an additional insured such as ramara is entitled to excess coverage for a loss caused by its sole negligence.the district court concluded that under westfield proximate cause interpretation of the additional insured endorsement it would be impossible for an additional insured to have excess coverage under the other insurance endorsement.the district court reasoned that a loss caused by ramara sole negligence which is necessary to trigger excess coverage under the other insurance endorsement could not be proximately caused simultaneously by fortress acts or omissions which westfield contended was necessary for ramara to have coverage.ramara,d at.on appeal,westfield argues that the apparent discrepancy between the other insurance and additional insured endorsements under its interpretation is immaterial because the former endorsement is inapplicable to this case and as a result,the district court discussion of the other insured endorsement constituted an advisory opinion.we can not agree on either of these points.
courts must interpret an insurance policy as one,harmonious document and resolve ambiguities in favor of coverage.see med.protective,at heist caribe,at.in interpreting a policy as a whole,and resolving potential ambiguities,a court often must compare the language used in one provision of the policy with the language in another provision.indeed,it would be difficult for a court to read a policy as a comprehensive document and unearth potential ambiguities if the court was required to interpret the provisions of a policy in isolation.moreover,if a relevant provision is shown to be ambiguous,other policy provisions can assist a court in assessing whether the insured party interpretation of that provision is reasonable.inasmuch as the district court understanding of the other insured endorsement supported its result,its discussion of the point can not be dismissed as an advisory opinion.
the pennsylvania workers compensation act.
finally,westfield argues that coverage was not triggered because one party is conspicuously absent from the allegations in the axe complaint fortress.indeed,axe explicitly names fortress only once in his underlying complaint,stating that fortress was his employer at the time that he was injured.as a result,westfield maintains that the axe complaint is silent as to any acts or omissions by fortress,and thus westfield does not have a duty under the policy with the additional insured endorsement to defend ramara when pennsylvania four corners rule is applied.
the district court disagreed,finding that the sparse reference to fortress in the axe complaint was understandable in light of the workers compensation act grant of tort immunity to employers for workplace injuries to their employees.ramara,d at see also.ann.the liability of an employer under this act shall be exclusive and in place of any and all other liability to such employes.due to the immunity from tort liability afforded to employers for injury to their employees in circumstances in which compensation is provided by the act,the district court reasoned that westfield narrow interpretation of the underlying complaint ignore d the realities of the worksite and the effect of the pennsylvania workers compensation act.ramara,d at.on appeal,we must decide whether the district court consideration of the act and its effect on pleading violated pennsylvania four corners rule.
at the outset,we find it instructive to retrace the boundaries of the four corners rule.in pennsylvania,a determination of whether an insurer has a duty to defend is made solely by consideration of the allegations of the complaint in the underlying action.kvaerner,at emphasis in original citation omitted.however,i f coverage indemnification depends upon the existence or nonexistence of undetermined facts outside the complaint,until the plaintiff claim is narrowed to one patently outside the policy coverage,the insurer has a duty to defend claims against its insured.stidham,at.if the complaint might or might not fall within the policy coverage,the insurance company is obliged to defend.am.foreign ins,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.it is therefore the potential,rather than the certainty,of a claim falling within the insurance policy that triggers the insurer duty to defend.id.
this understanding of the four corners rule is important,because neither our own research nor the parties briefing has revealed a case in which we previously have spoken on how a court should deal with the practical effects of the workers compensation act on pleadings where pennsylvania four corners rule is relevant.in a factually analogous case,however,a district court persuasively emphasized substance over form while making a determination faithful to the four corners rule.the court explained 
the purpose behind the four corners rule is that an insurer should not be required to defend a claim when it is apparent on the face of the complaint that none of the injuries fall within the purview of the insurance policy.given the circumstances of this case,that purpose would not be well served by blindly following plaintiff insistence that the court apply the most restrictive interpretation of the four corners rule.due to the immunity conferred by the workmen compensation act,the plaintiff in the underlying action could not have sued his employer,and,thus,would not have included any allegations about it in his underlying complaint.nonetheless,the insurer has expressly stipulated that it knew the plaintiff was injured while performing duties on a job site in the scope of his employment with the insured given the insurer obvious knowledge of the existence of facts that could trigger coverage and its awareness of the plaintiff reason for not including them,it would be both illogical and unjust for this court to find that the insurer duty to defend was not triggered.
