appellant arthur drager,as personal representative of the estate of shirley gross,seeks reversal of the district court denial of gross request to amend her complaint and its dismissal of her state common law tort claims against appellee pliva usa,for injuries sustained as a result of her use of a drug it manufactured.drager contends on appeal that the proposed amendments were not futile and that gross state tort claims are not preempted by the requirements of the federal food,drug,and cosmetics act,et,fdca.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
in,gross was prescribed reglan,a brand of metoclopramide,a drug used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease and other ailments.gross followed a course of generic metoclopramide,produced by appellee pliva,from march to january.as a result of gross use of metoclopramide,she developed permanent injuries including the movement disorders tardive dyskinesia and akathisia.
on january,gross filed suit against pliva and reglan producers,including pfizer,alleging state law claims of negligence,breach of warranty,fraud and misrepresentation,strict liability,and failure to warn.pursuant to gross stipulation that she ingested only pliva generic metoclopramide,the district court dismissed her claims against the brand name manufacturers on november.the district court stayed further proceedings against pliva,the only remaining defendant,on april,pending the supreme court decision in pliva,mensing.
after mensing was decided,holding that fdca labeling requirements preempted state laws,see id.at,the stay was lifted and pliva filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings.it contended that pursuant to mensing,gross claims were preempted by the fdca because of the impossibility of pliva compliance with both that statute and the alleged state law duties.in her response to pliva motion,gross requested that the district court allow her to amend her complaint to include allegations that pliva violated a state law duty by failing to update its warnings to include changes made by brand name manufacturers in.on november,the district court granted pliva motion,holding under the reasoning of mensing that all of gross state law claims were preempted by fdca requirements applicable to generic drug manufacturers.the district court also denied leave to amend on the ground that the proposed amendments would be futile under maryland law.gross filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment,which the district court denied on january.during the pendency of this action,gross passed away and drager continued the case on behalf of her estate.the district court november and january orders form the basis of drager appeal.
we review de novo a district court ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings under federal rule of civil procedure c.butler united states,cir.the standard of review for rule c motions is the same as that under rule b.id.at.therefore,a motion for judgment on the pleadings should only be granted if,after accepting all allegations in the plaintiff complaint as true and drawing all reasonable factual inferences from those facts in the plaintiff favor,it appears certain that the plaintiff can not prove any set of facts in support of his claim entitling him to relief.edwards city of goldsboro,cir.a rule c motion tests only the sufficiency of the complaint and does not resolve the merits of the plaintiff claims or any disputes of fact.butler,at.
under federal rule of civil procedure a,the grant or denial of an opportunity to amend is within the discretion of the district court.scott family dollar stores,cir quoting foman davis.consequently,we review the district court denial of a motion to amend for abuse of discretion.nourison rug parvizian,cir.a district court denial of leave to amend is appropriate when the amendment would be prejudicial to the opposing party there has been bad faith on the part of the moving party or the amendment would have been futile.scott,at quoting laber harvey,cir.
we may affirm on any ground supported by the record regardless of the ground on which the district court relied.united states moore,cir.
drager contends on appeal that the district court denial of leave to amend was an abuse of discretion because gross proposed allegations would have stated a cause of action under maryland law.however,drager concedes that gross never filed a motion to amend her complaint or a proposed amended complaint with the district court.regardless of the merits of the desired amendment,a district court does not abuse its discretion by declining to grant a motion that was never properly made.cozzarelli inspire,cir finding no abuse of discretion where plaintiffs requested leave to amend in a response but did not file a motion to amend or a proposed amended complaint.
consequently,we affirm the district court denial of leave to amend and hold that none of drager claims regarding pliva alleged failure to update its warnings are before us on appeal.similarly,we find that the complaint did not allege any violation of the federal misbranding laws or parallel state duties.to the extent drager makes those claims on appeal they are waived.united states evans,cir.
drager also argues that the district court erred by finding gross state tort claims to be preempted by the fdca because of the impossibility of pliva simultaneous compliance with fdca requirements and relevant maryland law.although one of drager objections to the district court reasoning gives us pause,all of gross causes of action are indeed preempted by the fdca.we therefore affirm the district court on all counts.
in mensing,the supreme court reaffirmed the principle that p analysis requires courts to compare federal and state law.at.to make this comparison,courts first identify the state tort duties and federal requirements applicable to the parties.id.if the applicable federal statute does not include a statement that either expressly preempts or expressly preserves otherwise applicable state law duties,the court must determine if there is preemption by conflict.id.at.
s tate law is naturally preempted to the extent of any conflict with a federal statute,crosby foreign trade council,because the federal constitution provides that every federal enactment is superior to any state law or constitutional article,const.art.vi,cl.as a result,under the supremacy clause,w here state and federal law directly conflict,state law must give way.mensing.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the supreme court has held that state and federal law conflict when it is impossible for a private party to simultaneously comply with both state and federal requirements.id.in such circumstances,the state law is preempted and without effect.by definition a party can not state a claim for which relief may be granted pursuant to a law that has been effectively repeal ed as it applies to a particular set of circumstances.id.at.
mensing and another recent supreme court case,mutual pharmaceutical,bartlett,address the preemptive effect of the fdca on state tort laws as they apply to generic drug manufacturers.for a variety of policy reasons,under the hatch waxman amendments,codified at j,the fdca imposes substantially different requirements on producers of name brand drugs and producers of,or generic,counterparts.in greatly simplified terms,manufacturers of generic medications gain authorization to market their products by demonstrating that those products are equivalent to the previously authorized name brand versions in a number of ways,including formulation and labeling.generics must maintain this equivalence to maintain authorization.see generally j.
in mensing,the supreme court made clear that under j generic drug manufacturers are not entitled to unilaterally change their labeling and therefore any state law tort premised on the failure of a generic to alter its labeling is preempted.id.at.in bartlett,the supreme court emphasized that generics are also not permitted to change the formulation of their products.at.further,the court rejected the argument that a generic drug manufacturer is required to leave the marketplace in order to avoid state law liability resulting from its
