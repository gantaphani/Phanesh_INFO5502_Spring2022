plaintiffs katherine umsted,alexandra stodghill and truxton umsted,collectively,the grandchildren,brought an action claiming that their late uncle scott umsted,had tortiously interfered with their expectancy in an inheritance.the district granted summary judgment to the defendants,the of the uncle estate.we affirm.
scott umsted,and his wife margaret umsted had two children,scott and truxton umsted.truxton,who predeceased his parents,had three children,katherine,alexandra and truxton.after scott died in,scott served as the executor of his father estate and as trustee of his trusts.prior to,margaret owned certain property in rhode island.the grandchildren allege that margaret had intended to leave half of her interest in that property to them,and the other half to scott.indeed,under margaret will,the residuary of her estate is divided into two equal shares to the three grandchildren,and to scott.it is undisputed that the property would have passed through the residuary clause had margaret still owned the property at the time of her death.
but,in,margaret conveyed all of her interest in the property to herself and scott as joint tenants.according to the grandchildren,following scott death,margaret depended heavily on scott for advice and direction and,given his role as the trustee and executor of his father will,his relationship with margaret was not only that of a son,but also of a fiduciary.the grandchildren allege that scott used his position of trust to unduly influence his mother,tortiously inducing her to make the inter vivos conveyance of the property and depleting the size of her estate.
scott obtained sole ownership of the property upon margaret death in march and served as the executor of her estate until his death in october.although the grandchildren first learned of the conveyance in june or july,they did not suggest that the property be brought back into margaret estate until after scott died and attorney richard boren was appointed administrator of margaret estate in april.even then,the grandchildren did not make a formal written request.boren took no action to reacquire the property.
defendants quentin anthony and linda umsted,scott widow,were appointed of scott estate in october.although they were aware that the grandchildren had concerns about the manner in which scott had performed his duties as the executor of scott and margaret estates,it is undisputed that they did not notify the grandchildren of the commencement of the administration of scott estate,as required by rhode island law.see laws.in april,pursuant to the terms of scott will,the defendants conveyed scott interest in the property to themselves as trustees of the scott umsted.family trust and the scott umsted.marital trust.
on june,the grandchildren filed a complaint in federal court seeking to have title to the property placed into a constructive trust for their benefit,and to receive money damages and attorney fees.the first count of the complaint alleged that scott had tortiously interfered with their expectancy of inheritance,and the second count alleged that scott had exercised undue influence over margaret,which resulted in the conveyance that caused them injury by depleting their inheritance.
the defendants subsequent motion for summary judgment was referred to a magistrate judge.in his report and recommendation,the magistrate judge noted the lack of case law in rhode island explicitly considering the validity of a cause of action for tortious interference with an expectancy of inheritance,and concluded that rhode island would not recognize the tort in the circumstances of this case as to the second count,the magistrate judge determined that the claim of undue influence belonged to margaret,the victim of the alleged undue influence,and the grandchildren could not bring a claim on behalf of her estate because the applicable statute of limitations had expired.the district court accepted and adopted the magistrate judge findings and recommendation that the action be dismissed.the grandchildren filed a timely appeal from the judgment.

the grandchildren primary argument on appeal is that the conclusion that rhode island would not recognize a cause of action for tortious interference with an expectancy of inheritance was erroneous.they point out that rhode island already recognizes an analogous cause of action for tortious interference with a prospective business relationship,see mesolella providence,and that the rhode island supreme court has previously extended common law theories into new contexts,see mallette children friend and,recognizing the tort of negligent misrepresentation in the adoption context.given that at least states have recognized some form of the tort,see diane klein,a disappointed yankee in connecticut or nearby probate court tortious interference with expectation of survey with analysis of state approaches in the first,second,and third circuits,pitt,including maine,see cyr cote,me,and massachusetts,see lewis corbin,the grandchildren argue that the supreme court of rhode island would likely follow suit.they further assert that the tort would be governed by rhode island limitations statute.see laws.
whatever force this argument may have in the abstract,it does not help the plaintiffs in this case.the magistrate judge report and recommendation does not hold that rhode island would reject recognition of the tort in all instances.rather,the magistrate judge concluded that rhode island would decline to recognize the tort in the circumstances presented here because the rhode island probate code provided the grandchildren with an adequate remedy that they failed to pursue before bringing their tort action.this reasoning accords with that of the majority of states that have considered tortious interference causes of action.see,moore graybeal,cir applying delaware law and holding that where adequate relief is available in a statutory proceeding,a tortious interference claim may not be pursued jackson kelly,same wilson fritschy,same dewitt duce,so d,holding that a plaintiff must exhaust probate remedies before pursuing a claim for tortious interference james fassold,tortious interference with expectancy of inheritance new tort,new traps.att y,collecting cases root providence water supply,holding that a plaintiff alleging a taking in violation of the state constitution must first pursue the statutorily specified remedy.
in many of these cases,the adequate remedy available to the plaintiff was a will contest in probate court.a will contest would not have provided an adequate remedy here because the grandchildren do not dispute margaret will,but rather the inter vivos conveyance that depleted her estate.see hegarty hegarty.nevertheless,the rhode island probate code provides another avenue to remedy the wrong alleged by the grandchildren.under rhode island law,legally interested parties may commence an action on behalf of an estate to recover property that belongs to the estate if the executor fails to so act.see laws.the rationales supporting probate exhaustion are therefore just as applicable here as in the cases.
rhode island,like most states,is not inclined to extend common law remedies into areas covered by statutory law.root,at w hen the general assembly creates a new statutory right or liability and provides for a specific remedy for any violations of that right,a party aggrieved by the exercise of that newly created right is bound to follow the statutorily specified remedy.citing smith tripp,rhode island has enacted a comprehensive statutory scheme designed to secure the expeditious and conclusive settlement of estates and quieting of titles.see lind mcsoley,thompson hoxsie.allowing a freestanding common law tort to be brought by expectant legatees on their own be
