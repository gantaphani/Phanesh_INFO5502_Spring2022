the,present and former inmates of the federal correctional complex,united states penitentiary,in beaumont,texas,appeal the district court dismissal of their claims under the federal tort claims act ftca against the united states in connection with the decision made by gerardo maldonado,the regional director of the south central region of the federal bureau of prisons,not to evacuate the penitentiary in the aftermath of hurricane rita the plaintiffs also challenge the district court denial of leave to amend their complaint to add bivens claims against individual penitentiary officials.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm.
background 
hurricane rita,a category storm,came ashore on september,shifting eastward in the final hours before landfall away from houston,texas,and toward beaumont,texas,which sustained a direct hit.the federal correctional complex in beaumont,texas,has three units a federal correctional institution a federal correctional institution and a united states penitentiary.inmates from the low and facilities were evacuated before or shortly after the hurricane arrival.the plaintiffs in this suit,inmates from the penitentiary,were not decision that maldonado made the day after the storm.
hurricane rita left beaumont without electricity,water,or gasoline,and the city was declared to be part of a disaster area.the storm left the federal correction complex with significant damage,rendering its emergency generator inoperable,sweeping away large portions of its roof,and leaving it without a supply of potable water.the plaintiffs evidence shows that penitentiary officials attempted early on to establish a temporary power grid but that their efforts were frustrated by unexpected setbacks.emergency generators were delivered to the penitentiary shortly after the storm,but without sufficient heavy wire to establish a grid.this wire was not readily available,requiring penitentiary officials to place a special order that took additional time to fill.according to the plaintiffs allegations,the penitentiary was without electrical power for days.
the significant discomfort caused by the lack of electricity was aggravated by a heat wave that swept the region in the days after the storm.the temperature exceeded degrees fahrenheit on sixteen of the days that the facility was without electricity and exceeded degrees fahrenheit on an additional seven.inside the penitentiary,the temperature was sometimes much higher.floor wax melted the cement and brick walls sweated within a few days after the storm,the moisture developed into a slimy black mold.without a working air conditioner,the air inside the prisoners cells was stagnant.the inmates spent their nights in pitch black darkness,without the ability to access electric emergency alarms.
the inmates allege that during the first three days after the storm,they remained locked in their cells.inmates with chronic ailments did not have access to medical could not access inhaler refills,diabetics could not get their insulin.during these first days,the inmates allege that they received no food at all from the guards.the guards did distribute water,but it was colored brown with some type of matter flowing in it,and smelled foul.the plaintiffs contend that they drank this water in any case because they were so dehydrated from the heat.on september,the prisoners received written confirmation in a memorandum from timothy outlaw,the warden of the beaumont complex,that the penitentiary water source had been declared and should not be ingested under any circumstance.
the plaintiffs allege that when they first received a meal,four days after the storm,the food provided was sandwiches made with moldy bread and spoiled meat and cheese or peanut butter,and that from that point they received no more than two sandwiches daily until power was restored.around the same time that the plaintiffs first received food,they began receiving one liter of sanitary water per day,though they contend that this was not sufficient to replenish fluids lost from the heat.
the inmates allege that they were not given the opportunity to shower until october,fourteen days after the storm.they allege that the shower water had a brownish color and offensive smell,and that the water immediately caused skin problems,such as open wound sores peeling skin with pus itching,burning rashes and boils.the inmates did not receive medicine for these issues.no clean clothes were available,so the inmates were required to put their dirty clothes back on after showering.
the plaintiffs allege that they could not flush their toilets during the entire period,and that the odor of urine and feces in their cells was overpowering.there was little toilet paper and no way to wash their hands.when the toilets became too full,the guards passed out plastic bags in which the prisoners could relieve themselves.filled bags were collected only at irregular intervals 
the plaintiffs allege that they suffered physical injuries as the result of these events,including episodes of high stress high blood pressure and heart disease respiratory and lung disorders from alleged exposure to ammonia from urine and feces and to mold heat exhaustion and heat stroke dehydration and malnutrition heliobactor pylori infection due to alleged exposure to human waste diarrhea due to alleged and salmonella exposure blood stream infections sleep deprivation muscle atrophy due to inactivity during lockdown worsening of existing medical conditions constipation and pain from hunger.they also allege mental injuries,including stress disorder suicidal tendencies depression insomnia and delusions.the plaintiffs also allege,without elaboration,that two inmates died as a result of these conditions.
the plaintiffs sued under the ftca alleging that the decision not to evacuate the inmates after the storm gave rise to the torts of negligence,recklessness,deliberate indifference,intentional infliction of emotional distress,malice,and wrongful death when the district court dismissed those claims under federal rule of civil procedure b for lack of jurisdiction,the plaintiffs sought leave to file a fourth amended complaint that raised substantially the same claims in an action against individual penitentiary officers under bivens six unknown agents of the federal bureau of narcotics,d.the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation that leave to file the amended complaint under federal rule of civil procedure be denied.the magistrate judge reasoned that leave would be futile because the bivens claims were.the plaintiffs appeal both the dismissal of their ftca claims and the denial of leave to amend.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court order granting the government motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.tammany parish,ex rel.davis fed.emergency mgmt.agency,cir.in our de novo review,we apply the same standard as does the district court.wagstaff dep t of,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in applying rule b,the district court has the power to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on any one of three separate bases the complaint alone the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts evidenced in the record or the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus the court resolution of disputed facts.tammany parish,at internal quotation marks omitted.here,the district court did not resolve any disputed facts,so we,as did the district court,consider the allegations in the plaintiffs complaint as true.id.internal quotation marks omitted.o ur review is limited to determining whether the district court application of the law is correct and,to the extent its decision was based on undisputed facts,whether those facts are indeed undisputed.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we then ask if dismissal was appropriate.id.
although we generally review a district court denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion,where,as here,the district court sole reason for denying such an amendment is futility,we must scrutinize that decision somewhat more closely,applying a de novo standard of review similar to that under which we review a dismissal under rule b.wilson,cir see also stripling jordan prod,llc,cir.
iii.the ftca claims 
the ftca waives sovereign immunity and permits suit against the united states for claims sounding in state tort law for money damages.waiving sovereign immunity to make the government liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.it provides district courts with jurisdiction over monetary claims against the government for the negligent or wrongful acts of its employees where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.b.
the liability of the united states under the ftca,however,is subject to various exceptions contained in,including the discretionary function exception.see united states gaubert,d.the discretionary function exception withdraws the ftca waiver of sovereign immunity in situations in which,although a government employee actions may have been actionable under state tort law,those actions were required by,or were within the discretion committed to,that employee under federal statute,regulation,or policy 
the provisions of this chapter and section b of this title shall not apply to a ny claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the government,exercising due care,in the execution of a statute or regulation,whether or not such statute or regulation be valid,or based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the government,whether or not the discretion involved be abused.
a.the government contends that the discretionary function exception applies to the challenged decision in this case because in deciding not to evacuate after the storm,maldonado was operating within the bounds of the discretion committed to him under a,which requires the federal bureau of prisons to provide for the safekeeping,care,and subsistence of all federal prisoners,but does not indicate the manner in which the duty must be fulfilled the district court concluded that the discretionary function exception deprived it of subject matter jurisdiction and granted the government motion to dismiss under rule b on that basis.the plaintiffs appealed,arguing that the discretionary function exception should not apply because maldonado violated nondiscretionary duties imposed by other statutes,regulations,and policies in deciding not to evacuate after the storm.
to properly evaluate the plaintiffs contentions,some exegesis of the operation of the discretionary function exception is necessary.the supreme court has developed a test for determining whether agency conduct qualifies as a discretionary function or duty.see gaubert,at.under the first prong,the conduct must be a matter of choice for the acting employee.berkovitz ex rel.berkovitz united states,d.the exception covers only acts that are discretionary in nature,acts that involv e an element of judgment or choice.gaubert,at quoting berkovitz,at.thus,it is the nature of the conduct,rather than the status of the actor that governs whether the exception applies.id.quoting united states empresa de viacao aerea rio grandense varig airlines,d.if a statute,regulation,or policy leaves it to a federal agency to determine when and how to take action,the agency is not bound to act in a particular manner and the exercise of its authority is discretionary.see id.at.
the requirement of judgment or choice is not satisfied and the discretionary function exception does not apply,however,if a federal statute,regulation,or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow,because the employee has no rightful option but to adhere to the directive.id.at quoting berkovitz,at.in other words,the discretionary function exception does not apply if the challenged actions in fact violated a federal statute,regulation,or policy.see id.at if the employee violates a mandatory regulation,there will be no shelter from liability because there is no room for choice and the action will be contrary to policy.berkovitz,at i f the agency policy did not allow the official who took the challenged action to act on the basis of policy considerations,the discretionary function exception does not bar the claim.as the circuits have concluded,the reason for this rule is federal employee can not be operating within his discretion if he is in fact violating a nondiscretionary policy.our court has explained 
just because the discretionary function exception would generally shield the government from ftca liability otherwise arising from a policy decision,it does not follow that the government is automatically shielded from such liability when the acts of the particular agents seeking to implement that policy violate another federal law,regulation,or express policy.actions taken to carry out a discretionary policy must be taken with sufficient caution to ensure that,at a minimum,some other federal law is not violated in the process.
johnson sawyer,cir,vacated on other grounds,cir.
under the second prong of the test,even assuming the challenged conduct involves an element of judgment,and does not violate a nondiscretionary duty,we must still decide whether the judgment is of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.gaubert,at quoting berkovitz,at see also varig airlines,at.because the purpose of the exception is to prevent judicial of legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social,economic,and political policy through the medium of an action in tort,when properly construed,the exception protects only governmental actions and decisions based on considerations of public policy.gaubert,at quoting berkovitz,at varig airlines,at internal citation omitted.in this regard,if a regulation allows the employee discretion,the very existence of the regulation creates a strong presumption that a discretionary act authorized by the regulation involves consideration of the same policies which led to the promulgation of the regulations.id.at.
the plaintiffs contend that neither prong of the berkovitz test is satisfied in this case.they contend that prong one is not satisfied because maldonado decision not to evacuate violated certain nondiscretionary statutory and policy duties.they contend that prong two is not satisfied because the decision not to evacuate was not a policy judgment or susceptible to policy analysis.each of these contentions is discussed in turn.we note that the plaintiffs bear the burden of showing congress unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity.see kokkonen guardian life ins.of,d.at the motion to dismiss stage,this includes pleading facts that facially allege matters outside of the discretionary function exception.tammany parish,at.
prong one whether the decision not to evacuate violated nondiscretionary duties 
the plaintiffs do not dispute that maldonado decision not to evacuate fell within the bounds of discretion committed to him for the administration of prisons under a.they contend,however,that the eighth amendment,the safe drinking water act,and various policies of the federal bureau of prisons imposed nondiscretionary duties that were violated by the decision not to evacuate in evaluating these arguments,we accept arguendo the plaintiffs contention that to constrain maldonado discretion in this case,the statute,regulation,or policy at issue need not specifically require evacuation,but instead might simply impose other nondiscretionary as duties to provide certain living standards to maldonado would have violated in deciding not to evacuate.
the eighth amendment 
the plaintiffs argue on appeal that maldonado decision not to evacuate violated the eighth amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment,and that this constitutional violation precludes the application of the discretionary function exception.this court has not yet determined whether a constitutional violation,as opposed to a statutory,regulatory,or policy violation,precludes the application of the discretionary function exception.see castro united states,wl cir.june.we need not decide the issue here,however,because we conclude that the plaintiffs waived this argument by failing to raise it in the district court.
we observe,as the government emphasized at oral argument,that although the plaintiffs pleadings asserted that the officials conduct of the penitentiary in the aftermath of the storm was cruel and unusual and therefore a constitutional tort actionable under the ftca the plaintiffs did not plead,and never argued to the district court,that the eighth amendment precluded the application of the discretionary function exception.even in their objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendations,in which the plaintiffs cited numerous federal statutory and regulatory requirements that they contended precluded the application of the discretionary function exception,they nowhere cited the eighth amendment for the same.the plaintiffs argument that the eighth amendment precluded the operation of the discretionary function exception appeared for the first time in their appellate briefing,where it became virtually the centerpiece of the appeal.the plaintiffs have not explained why they did not raise this argument earlier.
to state a claim under the ftca,a plaintiff has the burden of stating a claim for a tort and establishing that the discretionary function exception does not apply.tammany parish,at.the plaintiffs never raised their present eighth amendment argument when the district court was evaluating the merits of their ftca claim.by failing to plead or otherwise argue to the district court that the alleged eighth amendment violation precluded the application of the discretionary function exception,the plaintiffs have waived this contention on appeal.see,lemaire.dep t of transp,cir a rguments not raised before the district court are waived and can not be raised for the first time on appeal.comm.energy txu energy,cir.
the safe drinking water act 
the plaintiffs also contend that the decision not to evacuate after the storm violated nondiscretionary duties imposed by the safe drinking water act,et,which sets out national drinking water regulations for public water systems in each state.among other requirements,the act imposes maximum permissible levels for certain drinking water contaminants.as a matter of bureau of prisons policy,under program statement,federal prison officials are required to follow the provisions of the safe drinking water act.
we first note that the plaintiffs have not,in the district court or in this court,specified which requirements of the safe drinking water act the conditions at the penitentiary failed to meet.the plaintiffs pleadings and briefing only allege,conclusorily,that maldonado decision as to whether or not to evacuate was constrained by nondiscretionary duties imposed by the safe drinking water act.they do not state which provisions of the act,or regulations promulgated under the act,were violated by that decision.these vague allegations,without more,arguably do not satisfy the plaintiffs burden of pleading facts that allege conduct outside the discretionary function exception.see tammany parish,at 
in any event,the plaintiffs contention that the safe drinking water act imposed nondiscretionary duties that were contravened by the decision not to evacuate lacks merit.the safe drinking water act delegates primary enforcement responsibility to the individual states,provided that the environmental protection agency administrator has certified the state as meeting the conditions prescribed by and the regulations promulgated under that statute.texas has obtained such certification texas law provides a defense against water quality enforcement actions in circumstances of natural disasters.water code ann.west if a person can establish that an event that would otherwise be a violation of a statute within the commission jurisdiction was caused solely by an act of god,war,strike,riot,or other catastrophe,the event is not a violation of that statute,rule,order,or permit.in the aftermath of hurricane rita,on september,the texas commission on environmental quality invoked and issued a regulatory guidance document,which provided that all rules and regulations that may inhibit or prevent prompt response to this threat are suspended for the duration of the incident.because the nondiscretionary duties otherwise imposed by the safe water drinking act were suspended in the aftermath of the hurricane,the plaintiffs can not rely on these duties as bases for constraining maldonado discretion.
program statement 
finally,the plaintiffs contend that the decision not to evacuate after hurricane rita violated nondiscretionary policy duties imposed by bureau of prisons program statement,titled correctional statements and accreditation.program statement requires federal correctional institutions to obtain accreditation from the american correctional association aca,a private,nonprofit organization.the aca will grant accreditation if the correctional institution meets a certain number of mandatory and nonmandatory standards promulgated by the aca.full compliance with nonmandatory standards is not necessary to obtaining accreditation.see am.correctional ass n,standards for adult correctional institutions xviii ed.throughout their briefing,the plaintiffs cite to a superseded version of this publication.the current,version sets out the standards that were applicable when hurricane rita made landfall in september.in the current edition,the standards have been renamed expected practices and have been renumbered.in discussing the standards the plaintiffs have cited,we refer to both the superseded and renumbered versions.
program statement sets out the requirement of aca accreditation the time frame for obtaining accreditation the circumstances under which the time for accreditation may be extended or waived procedures for annual recertification and the methods through which compliance will be monitored and audited.it does not set out the particular mandatory and nonmandatory standards that the aca considers in granting accreditation,nor does it incorporate them by reference.the plaintiffs do not allege that maldonado decision not to evacuate after hurricane rita resulted in a failure to obtain accreditation or recertification for the penitentiary.they therefore have not alleged that maldonado decision violated nondiscretionary duties imposed by program statement.
in any event,the majority of the aca standards that the plaintiffs allege to have been violated are nonmandatory and as to the mandatory statements that the plaintiffs allege were violated,none imposes duties that were violated by the decision not to evacuate.the plaintiffs cite expected practice formerly standard,which requires institutions to provide for the control of vermin and pests,as evidence that the penitentiary officials were required to remediate the mold that grew on the penitentiary walls in the damp aftermath of the storm.but the plaintiffs do not cite a dictionary definition or otherwise explain how mold qualifies as a vermin or pest.the plaintiffs next cite expected practice formerly standard,which requires an institution potable water to be in compliance with jurisdictional laws and regulations,and contend that under this expected practice,the penitentiary officials were required to comply with the provisions of the safe drinking water act.but,as discussed above,the requirements of the safe drinking water act were suspended by law in the aftermath of the storm.finally,the plaintiffs cite expected practice formerly standard,which requires that u pon arrival at the facility,all offenders be informed about how to access health services and the grievance system.there is no allegation that the penitentiary officials failed to inform inmates about health system access.in sum,maldonado decision not to evacuate did not violate any nondiscretionary duties imposed by the standards that the plaintiffs cite.
the parties agree that in deciding not to evacuate after the storm,maldonado was acting within the discretion accorded by a.the plaintiffs have not pointed to any nondiscretionary duties that were viol
