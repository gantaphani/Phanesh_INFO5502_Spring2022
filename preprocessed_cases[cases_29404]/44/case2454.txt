in these two appeals,ronald wolfe,junior challenges the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of,detective allan perry perry as well as the district court award of attorney fees to perry,sheriff deputy ivan deering deering,and assistant prosecutor daniel rose rose.the district court found that junior constitutional claims brought pursuant to,as well as his claims,were barred by michigan statute of limitations.on appeal,junior argues that the district court erred in holding that the statute of limitations began to run from the date of his arrest.upon review,we conclude that the district court did err in finding junior claims time barred,but that his arrest was supported by probable cause.therefore,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of perry on other grounds.furthermore,we affirm the district court grant of attorney fees to deering and rose as well.in light of our conclusion that the claims against perry were not time barred,we vacate the attorney fee award to perry and remand to the district court for reconsideration.finally,because the award amount was not apportioned among the three defendants,we vacate the entire award amount and remand to the district court to allow the court to reconsider the award to perry.
background 
these appeals arise out of a criminal investigation into the activities of junior,his father,ron wolfe,senior,and his stepmother,marie wolfe collectively,the wolfes.the wolfes were under investigation for a series of larcenies committed in livingston county,michigan,over a period.specifically,the wolfes were suspected of involvement in the theft of two hundred bales of hay on august,the theft of building materials,including a large amount of osb panels,from a construction site on september,the theft of roofing materials from another construction site on september,the theft of two golf carts from a country club on january,the theft of two horses from a residence on may,and finally,a fraudulent insurance claim involving residential windows the police investigation into the various larcenies was headed by detective perry,a deputy with the livingston county sheriff department.perry investigation of the wolfes consisted primarily of interviews with william harp harp,a former friend of senior,and harold van patten van patten,who worked as a handyman for the wolfes from november until at senior residence at fisher road the fisher road residence.van patten responsibilities included maintaining the property,caring for the animals,and constructing a pole barn.from january through september,van patten also resided at the fisher road residence,living above the barn.
with regard to the stolen hay,van patten informed perry that one night in august he was awakened by senior at half past midnight and told to get dressed and get in senior truck.van patten noticed that junior and another man,rich munson munson,were driving a separate truck.the two pickup trucks drove to a field owned by robert salmon salmon,where two wagons filled with hay were located.van patten stated that senior stood guard with a,while van patten drove the truck onto the field and along with junior and munson attached the two wagons to the trucks.van patten stated that he was so upset about stealing the hay that he was unable to drive and therefore,senior drove the truck back to the fisher road residence.upon arrival at the residence,van patten stated that they drove through pine trees to get to an old airplane hanger located on the north side of the property.van patten told perry that he helped senior,junior,and munson unload the hay into the hangar,and then return the empty wagons by the side of the road near the salmon residence,where they were discovered the next day.van patten stated that he believed both senior and junior were carrying weapons that night and therefore,he was too afraid to object to participating.the next day,van patten claimed that he told senior do you guys ever get me involved in anything like this again,because i not this way.joint appendix at van patten dep.at.van patten story was corroborated by a police incident report taken on august,documenting a complaint by salmon of the theft of bales of hay from his property.
with regard to the stolen construction materials,harp told perry that in november,while on a neighboring property,he observed the construction of a pole barn with osb panels and new shingles at the fisher road residence.harp stated that he told perry that building materials had been stolen from residential construction sites in the area and suspected the wolfes involvement.perry discussed the matter with van patten,whose responsibilities included constructing the pole barn on the fisher road residence.van patten informed perry that he went to bed around on september,and the next morning when he went down to feed the livestock he discovered a stack of building materials by the barn.van patten claims he asked senior about the materials,to which senior responded that junior and rich culbert culbert had stolen sheets of osb from a nearby construction site.van patten used the materials to construct the remainder of the pole barn.a few weeks later,van patten mentioned to senior that he needed shingles to finish the roof of the pole barn.the next day,van patten discovered squares of shingles lying on the ground next to the barn along with other roofing materials.van patten claims that when he asked senior about the shingles,senior responded that junior and culbert got them from a house being built down the road.van patten used the shingles for the roof of the pole barn.once again,the story told to perry was corroborated by a police incident report taken on september,documenting the theft of building materials from a nearby construction site.
with regard to the stolen golf carts,harp told perry that in early january,senior asked harp if he could borrow harp chevy suburban as well as if harp wanted to go for a ride with him.harp stated that he rode with senior in a gray sedan to a restaurant located at the oakpointe country club.junior and another man arrived driving harp suburban and towing senior horse trailer.harp explained that both junior and senior had firearms and communicated through.harp told perry that he assisted senior,junior,and the other man in loading two golf carts into the horse trailer.one of the carts was in harp barn,while the other was taken to the fisher road residence.the following day,oakpointe country club reported that two carts were stolen the previous night.harp also told perry that there was an additional golf cart,which looked very similar,already at the fisher road residence prior to the january theft of the other two.van patten corroborated harp claim by providing perry with a photograph of the decks he had built at the fisher road residence,in which a golf cart is visible in the background of the picture.
during a conversation with perry on december,van patten also mentioned that during the month of may,his work at the fisher road residence included taking care of two horses.van patten stated that one morning when he went out to feed the livestock,he found two horses inside a stall.van patten explained that senior told him that a woman called at and said her barn burned down and asked senior to care for her horses.on may,jean wainscott reported to the police that two of her horses were stolen from her residence.van patten had seen photos of the two horses from a friend who worked with wainscott and identified them as the horses he took care of for a month on the fisher road residence.
finally,during his conversation with perry on december,harp mentioned that in he had allowed senior to store about two dozen residential windows in his barn.harp stated that a month later junior began transferring the windows from harp barn back to the fisher road residence.van patten informed perry that during that time he was constructing a log home on the property and was installing the windows.van patten stated he would tell senior the measurements of the windows he needed and senior and junior would drive off and return with the windows twenty minutes later.senior told van patten that he and junior were purchasing the windows at a store in town.scott van patten,harold brother,informed perry that senior told him that the windows were stolen and there was an insurance claim made on them.at scott van patten dep.at.
after completing his investigation into the various criminal activities of the wolfes,perry obtained arrest warrants for senior and junior as well as a search warrant for the fisher road residence on december,the police executed the search warrant and seized various items from the property including sixty bales of hay,osb panels,wrappers,and two golf carts as well as scores of firearms and marijuana plants from a locked basement vault.senior and junior arrived on the property during the search and were immediately taken into custody.criminal charges were subsequently brought against all of the wolfes in livingston county circuit court.
senior was originally charged in state court with manufacturing marijuana with the intent to deliver.the state court suppressed the evidence of the marijuana seized from the basement vault,however,because it held that the search of the residence was outside the scope of the warrant.though the state marijuana charge was subsequently dismissed,senior was indicted in federal court for violation of federal firearm laws.in response,senior filed a motion to suppress similar to the one granted in his state criminal proceedings.the district court denied senior motion,finding that the search warrant was supported by probable cause and the firearms and marijuana were discovered in plain view in connection with the valid search.united states wolfe,d.we subsequently affirmed the district court ruling in that case.united states wolfe,wl,at cir,cert.denied,d.
the state criminal case against junior proceeded to trial because the charges against him were unrelated to the firearms and marijuana found in the vault.junior was convicted of larceny over,but the conviction was later set aside due to trial publicity,and ultimately dismissed.following the dismissal of the criminal charges,junior brought suit in livingston county circuit court against perry,sheriff deputy deering,sergeant robert swackhamer swackhamer,assistant prosecutor rose,harp,and van patten pursuant to.the complaint alleges that the defendants violated junior fourth amendment right to be free from an unreasonable search and seizure as well as various claims.pursuant to b,the defendants removed the case to the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan following discovery,the defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that junior claims were barred either by the statute of limitations or collateral estoppel due to senior federal criminal case.in the alternative,the defendants argued they were entitled to summary judgment because there was probable cause for the search and arrest.
in response to the summary judgment motions,junior dismissed the claims against swackhamer and deering and conceded that he lacked standing to challenge the search of his father residence,leaving only the claims against rose and perry.on december,the district court granted summary judgment to rose because junior failed to state a claim under and rose was entitled to absolute immunity for actions performed within the scope of his prosecutorial duties.furthermore,the district court granted summary judgment to perry on the ground that junior constitutional and claims against him were barred by michigan statute of limitations.the district court found that all the claims against perry related to junior arrest on december,or actions undertaken before that date.as a result,the district court determined that the statute of limitations for the federal and state claims had run by the time junior filed his suit on january.junior appeals only the district court ruling with regard to his claims against perry.
on december,deering,perry,and rose filed a motion pursuant to for costs and attorney fees,claiming that junior claims were frivolous.the district court agreed and awarded the three defendants in costs and in attorney fees.junior appeals the award of attorney fees.
ii.analysis 
statute of limitations 
in his appeal,junior argues that the district court erred in holding that the statute of limitations on his claims against perry began to run at the time of his arrest.we have held that a district court determination that a complaint was filed outside of the statute of limitations is a conclusion of law,which we review de novo.banks city of whitehall,cir.upon review,we conclude that the statute of limitations did not begin to run on his constitutional claim and his claim until after the criminal charges against junior were dismissed,and therefore,his claims against perry were timely filed.we need not decide the timeliness issue with regard to junior claim however,because it can be resolved on other grounds.
because congress did not specifically adopt a statute of limitations governing actions,federal courts must borrow the statute of limitations governing personal injury actions in the state in which the section action was brought.id.citing wilson garcia,d.we have held that the appropriate statute of limitations to be borrowed for actions arising in michigan is the state limitations period for personal injury claims.comp.laws ann.chippewa trading cox,cir,cert.denied,d carroll wilkerson,cir,cert.denied,d.although state law provides the statute of limitations to be applied in a damages action,federal law governs the question of when that limitations period begins to run.sevier turner,cir see also sharpe cureton,cir,cert.denied,d.
typically the statute of limitations for filing an action alleging an unconstitutional search and seizure begins to run at the time of the injury,when the plaintiff becomes aware of the unconstitutional action.shamaeizadeh cunigan,cir,cert.denied,d.we have held,however,that in light of the supreme court ruling in heck humphrey,d,a cause of action under that would imply the invalidity of a conviction does not accrue until the conviction is reversed or expunged,and therefore the statute of limitations does not begin to run until such an event occurs,if ever.shamaeizadeh,at.we have noted that the concerns of heck apply as well as.id.at.thus,we have applied the heck principle to claims that if successful would necessarily imply the invalidity of a future conviction on a pending criminal charge.id.at emphasis added quoting smith holtz,cir,cert.denied,d.if civil claims were allowed while criminal cases were pending,there would be a potential for inconsistent determinations in the civil and criminal cases and the criminal defendant would be able to collaterally attack the prosecution in a civil suit.id.at quoting smith,at.instead,a criminal defendant should focus on his primary mode of a viable defense to the charges against turning to a civil claim under.id.at.
applying these principles to the instant case,we conclude that the district court erred in finding that the statute of limitations began to run on december,the date of junior arrest.in his complaint,junior alleges that perry conspired with harp and van patten in order to arrest and charge junior for crimes that he did not commit.at compl.at.specifically,junior alleges that perry determination relied on information supplied by harp and van patten,which perry knew was false.at compl.at.thus,success on his constitutional claim necessarily implies that harp and van patten lied about junior involvement in the various thefts.given that the information that harp and van patten provided was central to the state criminal prosecution,resolution of the civil claim in junior favor while the criminal case was pending would certainly imply the invalidity of any future conviction.therefore,we conclude that the statute of limitations applicable to the claim against perry did not begin to run until dismissal of the criminal charges against junior on july.at state.order.junior filed his civil complaint against perry on january,well within michigan statute of limitations period.thus,we conclude that the district court erred in holding that junior fourth amendment claim against perry was time barred.
similarly,the district court erred in finding junior claim of malicious prosecution to be time barred as well.under michigan law,a person must bring a claim within two years after the claim first accrued.comp.laws ann.as a general rule,tort actions accrue when all the elements of a cause of action have occurred and can be alleged in a proper complaint.parisi.townships ass n.with regard to a claim,t ermination of the underlying criminal proceedings in the plaintiff favor is a necessary element of the civil cause of action for malicious prosecution.gebhardt.michigan courts have defined termination of the criminal proceedings in favor of the accused to include the formal abandonment of the proceedings by the public prosecutor.cox williams.specifically,the dismissal of criminal charges at the instance of the prosecutor implies a lack of reasonable ground for prosecution and is a favorable termination of the proceeding for purposes of a malicious prosecution cause of action.id.at.thus,junior claim first accrued when the prosecutor decided to dismiss the criminal charges against him on july.at dismissal order.pursuant to michigan law,junior had two years from that date within which to bring his claim.because junior filed suit against perry within that applicable period,the district court erred in ruling that his claim was time barred.
junior claim for false arrest is a bit more problematic.under michigan law,false arrest is an illegal or unjustified arrest,and the guilt or innocence of the person arrested is irrelevant.peterson novelties,city of berkley.to prevail on a claim of false arrest or false imprisonment,a plaintiff must show that the arrest was not legal,the arrest was not based on probable cause.id.under michigan law,a person must bring a claim within two years after the claim first accrued.comp.laws ann.all the elements of the cause of action of false arrest accrued on december,the date upon which perry arrested junior.therefore,the district court found that the michigan statute of limitations period began to run on that date and had expired in,two years prior to junior filing of his complaint.michigan courts have specifically reserved the question of whether the heck rationale applies to claims.see peterson novelties,at resolving the claim on the issue of probable cause,and thereby,finding it unnecessary to determine the applicability of heck.we need not resolve this issue either because we can resolve the claim against perry on other grounds.
in sum,we conclude that the district court erred in finding junior constitutional claim and his claim to be time barred.we do not resolve the issue of timeliness with regard to junior claim,however.
collateral estoppel 
perry argues in his brief that even if junior claims were filed timely,because of the prior decisions in senior federal criminal case,the doctrine of collateral estoppel bars his claims.we have held that t he availability of collateral estoppel is a mixed question of law and fact which this court reviews de novo.hammer ins,cir,cert.denied,d.applying this standard,we conclude that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is inapplicable in this case.
the united states supreme court has defined the doctrine of collateral estoppel,also known as issue preclusion,as once an issue is actually and necessarily determined by a court of competent jurisdiction,that determination is conclusive in subsequent suits based on a different cause of action involving a party to the prior litigation.montana united states,d.though the exact requirements necessary to invoke collateral estoppel are listed slightly differently in our various opinions,we have stated recently that collateral estoppel applies when 
the issue in the subsequent litigation is identical to that resolved in the earlier litigation,
the issue was actually litigated and decided in the prior action,
the resolution of the issue was necessary and essential to a judgment on the merits in the prior litigation,
the party to be estopped was a party to the prior litigation or in privity with such a party,and 
the party to be estopped had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue.
ashcroft,cir.perry argues that because the federal district court and this court previously held that there was probable cause to believe senior committed a criminal offense,junior is precluded from relitigating the issue based on the same evidence in this case.we find this argument to be unpersuasive.
probable cause necessary to justify an arrest is defined as whether at that moment of the arrest the facts and circumstances within the officers knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the arrestee had committed or was committing an offense.beck ohio,d.in senior criminal case,the district court found that based on the facts and circumstances known on december,probable cause existed to believe that senior was involved in numerous crimes and the evidence of those crimes would be found at the fisher road residence.wolfe,d at.central to the district court finding was its conclusion that harp and van patten were credible.id.the district court determination does not necessarily mean,however,that the same evidence supports such a conclusion regarding junior.probable cause to arrest someone is an individualized determination made for each person based on the known facts and circumstances at the time.see,maryland pringle,d holding that the belief of guilt must be particularized with respect to the person to be searched or seized ybarra illinois,d where the standard is probable cause,a search or seizure of a person must be supported by probable cause particularized with respect to that person.evidence sufficient to support probable cause of criminal wrongdoing of one does not necessarily imply that the same evidence is sufficient to justify probable cause to arrest another.the issue before the district court in senior criminal proceeding was probable cause of senior criminal wrongdoing the issue of probable cause to believe junior criminal wrongdoing was never addressed.therefore,because the issue decided in senior criminal case is not identical to the one in this litigation,we conclude that the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply.
probable cause 
finally,perry argues in his brief that even if junior claims were not collaterally estopped,perry should be entitled to summary judgment in his favor because probable cause existed to arrest junior.we agree.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.fisher harden,cir.under rule c,summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.celotex catrett,d quoting.c.in deciding upon a motion for summary judgment,we must view the factual evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party,smith,cir.
as we stated above,probable cause necessary to justify an arrest is defined as whether at that moment of the arrest the facts and circumstances within the officers knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the arrestee had committed or was committing an offense.beck,at.a reviewing court must assess the existence of probable cause from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene,rather than with the vision of hindsight.klein long,cir internal quotations omitted,cert.denied,d.in this case,probable cause to arrest junior was based on the information provided by harp and van patten.when an informant tip is used to establish probable cause,the supreme court has stated that a court should review the probable cause determination based on the totality of the circumstances rather than any rigid test.illinois gates,d.the supreme court noted however that an informant veracity,reliability and basis of knowledge are all highly relevant in determining the value of his report.id.at.furthermore,the court underscored the value of corroboration of details of an informant tip by independent police work.id.at.
in this case,the information upon which perry relied was not an uncorroborated tip of an unknown informant.united states perkins,cir,cert.denied,d.instead,the information about junior involvement in criminal activity was provided by two known sources,harp and van patten.see united states couch,cir holding that a known informant is inherently more credible because the informant could potentially be held accountable for providing false information.furthermore,they provided highly detailed descriptions of criminal wrongdoing,including criminal activity in which they themselves participated,further bolstering the credibility of their information.harp even admitted to perry that he still possessed one of the stolen golf carts.the informants had a close relationship with senior,which provided them with a solid basis of knowledge from which to speak about his and junior various criminal activities.specifically,harp stated that he and senior were friends and that he had been at the fisher road residence numerous times.van patten had worked for senior for two years and lived at the fisher road residence for nine months,thereby witnessing firsthand the activities which occurred there.
in addition,the information which harp and van patten told perry was corroborated by the police incident reports from the times of the thefts.for example,the police incident report regarding the stolen hay notes that the abandoned wagons were found with f resh pine bough pieces and pine cone,which supports van patten statement to perry that they had to drive through pine trees to reach the old plane hangar.at police incident.van patten description of the sudden appearance of the construction materials while he was building the pole barn matches the dates in the police incident reports concerning when the materials were stolen.perry also independently verified the informants claims through discussions with sergeant swackhamer,who corroborated the existence of pine trees at the fisher road residence,as well as the presence of a golf cart.
finally,van patten and harp corroborated each other stories.van patten corroborated harp story of the golf carts by providing perry with a picture of the deck he built,in which a golf cart is visible in the background.harp and van patten also corroborated each other with regard to the stolen residential windows which were stored at harp barn and then brought by junior to the fisher road residence for use in construction of the log cabin by van patten.the stories told by harp and van patten are also remarkably similar with regard to the manner in which the thefts occurred,late at night,use of walkie talkies,carrying firearms,which further bolsters their credibility.thus,based on the totality of the circumstances,we conclude that the information provided by harp and van patten was more than sufficient to support a finding of probable cause to arrest junior.
junior relies heavily on minor inaccuracies and omissions in the affidavit accompanying the search warrant for the fisher road residence to argue that perry knowingly provided false information to obtain the arrest warrant specifically,junior argues that perry ignored the original police incident report regarding the stolen hay which states that the wagons tire tracks were visible on the dirt roads and went beyond the main entrance of the fisher road residence.at police incident.junior argues that these tire tracks prove that van patten story is inaccurate and therefore,perry should not have relied on it to obtain the arrest warrant.while the presence of the tire tracks does conflict with van patten story of the hay theft,it is insufficient by itself to dispel the existence of probable cause of junior criminal wrongdoing in light of all the evidence available to perry.van patten was a participant in the theft and provided perry with an eyewitness,firsthand account,which is not invalidated merely because of a single inconsistency.van patten stated that he was shaken up by his participation in the robbery and could not drive back.thus,a reasonable police officer could believe that because of his agitated state he did not notice the precise route the trucks took to get back to airport hangar on the fisher road residence.van patten detailed description of the robbery,coupled with its similarities in the manner in which the golf carts were stolen,and corroborated by the presence of the pine cones and branches in the wagons is sufficient to establish probable cause to arrest junior even in light of the inconsistent tire tracks.officers are not required to rule out every possible explanation other than a suspect illegal conduct before making an arrest.united states reed,cir,cert.denied,d.
moreover,assuming arguendo that the tire tracks were sufficient to dispel the belief that junior participated in the hay theft,probable cause still existed to believe that junior was involved in the theft of the golf carts and construction materials.harp provided a detailed account of the theft of the golf carts,which matches the incident reports taken at the time.he also admitted that one of the stolen golf carts was still on his property.van patten provided a picture of the fisher road residence in which the golf cart appeared.while perry did erroneously state in the search warrant affidavit that swackhamer had verified through serial numbers that the golf cart at harp property was one of the two stolen from the country club,that error by itself is insufficient to dispel the probable cause of junior criminal wrongdoing in light of all the other evidence.similarly,van patten story about the stolen construction materials,which matched the materials mentioned in the incident reports,is sufficient to establish probable cause of criminal wrongdoing as well.
because junior arrest on december,was supported by probable cause,there was no constitutional violation and therefore,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to perry on the fourth amendment claim.furthermore,because the absence of probable cause is a necessary element for the claims of false arrest and malicious prosecution,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to perry on those claims as well.
attorney fees 
in the second of the two appeals before this court,junior challenges the district court award of attorney fees to defendants perry,rose,and deering.we review a district court award of attorneys fees under based on an abuse of discretion standard.lake county sheriff dep t,cir.in light of a district court superior understanding of the litigation and the desirability of avoiding frequent appellate review of what essentially are factual matters,an award of attorneys fees under is entitled to substantial deference.reed rhodes,cir quoting hensley eckerhart,d.applying this deferential standard,we conclude that awarding attorney fees to deering and rose was not an abuse of discretion.in light of our earlier holding that junior constitutional claim against perry was not time barred,we vacate the award of attorney fees to perry and remand the issue to the district court for reconsideration.finally,because the district court did not apportion the total amount of the award among the three defendants,we vacate the amount of the award and remand to the district court for redetermination.
pursuant to,a district court in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.b.the supreme court has held that while prevailing plaintiffs are entitled to attorneys fees under that statute in all but special circumstances,prevailing defendants are entitled to attorneys fees much less frequently.smith,cir.citing christiansburg garment eeoc,d,cert.denied,d.a prevailing defendant should only recover upon a finding by the district court that the plaintiff action was frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation,even though not brought in subjective bad faith.wayne village of sebring,cir internal quotation omitted,cert.denied,d.application of these standards requires inquiry into the plaint
