robert snyder operated a business in a building he owned,and shared with two tenants,in a mostly residential area of waltham,massachusetts.after snyder fired an employee who was a member of the waltham city council,the former employee complained to the city building department that snyder was using his property unlawfully.code enforcement officers then scrutinized snyder use of his property and fined him under a local land use ordinance.snyder eventually brought this suit under against the city of waltham and five individuals,claiming a violation of his right to equal protection of the laws under the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.after unsuccessfully seeking summary judgment based on immunity defenses,two of the individual defendants filed this appeal.finding that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law,we reverse.
background 
in reviewing an interlocutory appeal from a denial of qualified immunity,we accept as given the facts that the district court ruled could be found by a reasonable jury viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.see johnson jones.we do not entertain challenges to the inferences drawn by the district court in doing so or to its determinations regarding the evidentiary support for the plaintiff claims.see cady walsh,wl,at cir.june.we can consider an interlocutory appeal of this kind,then,to the extent the appellants ground their arguments in the record as viewed most favorably to the plaintiff,leaving undisturbed all factual inferences implied by the district court decision.see johnson,at.here,while gaudet and powell sometimes stray from that path in their brief,the facts that ultimately prove dispositive are those that both sides agree we can assume to be true for purposes of this appeal.we describe those facts below,adding some additional context.
snyder difficulties with the city began when he fired an employee,serafina collura,who served as a member of the waltham city council.collura soon complained to the city building department that snyder use of his building violated a land use ordinance because,according to collura,snyder rented a portion of the second floor as a residence.collura continued to pressure city officials to investigate snyder over the following months.
appellants ralph gaudet and patrick powell were waltham superintendent of public buildings and senior building inspector,respectively.gaudet and powell eventually did investigate snyder.the district court found it reasonable to infer,and we accept for purposes of this appeal,that gaudet and powell knew of collura motivations and acted in aid of her efforts.powell inspected snyder property twice in february,approximately seven months after collura first complained.although powell initially indicated in a conversation with a city attorney that he had found no violations during his inspections,he later issued a citation to snyder in june.we assume that powell can be attributed to pressure from collura.
in the citation,powell found that snyder had violated a zoning variance issued to the original owner of the building in by using it for purposes other than professional offices.the original owner,an optometrist,had sought to use the property for three medical offices and received a variance allowing its use as professional offices.the original owner sold the property to another optometrist,who sold to snyder in.the parties dispute whether the variance allowed use of the second floor as a residence,but we need not consider the issue,because we accept solely for purposes of our consideration of this interlocutory appeal that snyder never engaged in such residential use.
snyder maintains that he complied with the variance because the building was used entirely for professional offices.but he has admitted the truth of several facts described in powell citation.first,powell found,and snyder has conceded,that one room in the building was used to perform massages second,he has conceded that a second room was used as the office of a roofing contractor,who he says also used it for work as a paralegal.finally,powell found that snyder used his own office as a warehouse for receiving and shipping.although snyder disputes the characterization of his own office as a warehouse,he admits that he used it to store the small metal components his company manufactures for eventual shipment to customers.
powell citation instructed snyder to either cease and desist from violations of the variance,or show evidence that he was applying to the city zoning board of appeals to modify the variance.if he did neither,he would face fines escalating to per day.snyder eventually pursued a modification,but the zoning board of appeals did not grant one.meanwhile,the city issued several fines to snyder,starting with a fine in november about four months after the citation issued,followed by further fines in may,at which time snyder was told that he would continue to be fined for each additional day that passed until he corrected the violation.
snyder contested the fines in the waltham district court,which denied their enforcement in december.approximately two and a half years later,the court entered a docket entry,at the behest of an attorney for waltham,to clarify that it had found sufficient evidence of a violation but had dismissed the fine because snyder had later come into substantial compliance.
ii.standard of review 
as noted above,we have jurisdiction only to consider gaudet and powell legal argument that,on the facts described above,they were entitled to immunity.on that legal issue,our review is de novo.suboh district attorney,cir.
iii.analysis 
to assess qualified immunity,we ask whether a government official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.plumhoff rickard,internal quotation marks omitted.for a right to be clearly established,existing precedent must have placed beyond debate that the particular conduct at issue violated the plaintiff rights.ashcroft.
in the district court,snyder alleged that gaudet,powell,and the other defendants violated his rights to equal protection and substantive due process under the fourteenth amendment,and his right to be free from unreasonable seizure under the fourth amendment,and that they conspired to do so.the defendants moved for summary judgment,claiming among other points that gaudet and powell were entitled to qualified immunity.the district court denied that motion as to all claims and all defendants.on this appeal,snyder relies only on his equal protection claim to defeat gaudet and powell assertion of qualified immunity,thereby waiving any argument that the other claims survive the immunity defense.see tower leslie brown,cir.snyder also asserts before us a violation of the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment,but he never presented that claim to the district court,so we will not consider it.see rodríguez garcía miranda marín,cir.we therefore train our review on his only preserved federal claim against these defendants his equal protection claim 
because snyder contends that the government singled him out for differential treatment for reasons unique to him,rather than because of his membership in any group,his equal protection claim is of the class of one variety.see id.in such an equal protection claim,snyder must show that he has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.vill.of willowbrook olech.in claims such as snyder,the plaintiff ordinarily must also show that the defendant differential treatment of the plaintiff was motivated by bad faith or malicious intent to injure,rubinovitz rogato,cir,but we need not reach that requirement because we find that snyder can not prevail in showing differential treatment.
in a class of one equal protection claim,proof of a similarly situated,but differently treated,comparator is essential.see cordi allen conlon,cir.in particular,plaintiffs must show an extremely high degree of similarity between themselves and the persons to whom they compare themselves.id.a
