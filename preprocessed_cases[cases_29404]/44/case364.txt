catherine deegan patterson and yvonne deegan gioka appeal from the district court judgment which dismissed their federal tort claims act ftca complaint due to their failure to file within the applicable statute of limitations.see b.we affirm.
background 
in march,two fbi flemmi and joseph edward teddy deegan in chelsea,massachusetts.the boston office of the federal bureau of investigation fbi knew beforehand of the informants plans,but did nothing either to stop the murder,or to prevent the subsequent wrongful conviction of two other limone and joseph the deegan murder.
in december,the boston globe,in a series of sensational expos√©s of corruption within the boston fbi office,revealed the fbi complicity in the deegan slaying.for example,on december,the boston globe published an article titled fbi reportedly hid key evidence,documents show it knew of deegan slaying plot in,in which it reported secret documents recently discovered in a justice department probe of fbi corruption appear to show that the bureau knew not only that the wrong men were convicted of a gangland murder,but also that agents were told about the plot two days before it happened and apparently did nothing to stop it.during the following month,the story received national press coverage.on january and,respectively,a massachusetts superior court judge vacated the limone and salvati convictions,which actions likewise received local and national media attention.
on january,teddy deegan brother richard submitted an administrative claim for wrongful death under the ftca against the united states,purporting to act as the voluntary administrator of teddy estate.as massachusetts law does not recognize the authority of voluntary administrators to submit wrongful death claims,see marco green,the government denied richard deegan administrative claim.
on december,catherine deegan patterson acting as the administrator of her father estate and her sister yvonne deegan gioka submitted their own administrative claim to the government,seeking recompense both for their father wrongful death and for infliction of emotional distress.patterson was residing in new hampshire,gioka in georgia.the government denied the patterson and gioka administrative claim as untimely,and on august,patterson and gioka timely filed the instant complaint in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts,asserting both wrongful death and emotional distress claims.the united states moved to dismiss the complaint due to the failure of plaintiffs december,administrative claim to satisfy the ftca limitations provision.see b.in response,patterson and gioka argued,inter alia,that i gioka administrative claim was timely because she lived in georgia,and did not learn of the fbi involvement in her father death until catherine told her the news in the summer of and ii their december administrative claim,even if untimely,should nonetheless relate back to the date of their uncle richard original and timely administrative claim on january.
the district court rejected both contentions and granted the government motion to dismiss.the court pointed to the extensive national press coverage the deegan story had received,then found that the gioka claim had accrued more than two years prior to the filing of their december claim.the court also spurned the relation back argument on the ground that richard,qua voluntary administrator,was not authorized under massachusetts law to submit a claim in behalf of the deegan estate,thus the government had no reason or responsibility to investigate his wrongful death allegations.patterson and gioka now appeal from the dismissal order.
discussion 
because the parties do not dispute the predicate jurisdictional facts,we review the grant of the motion to dismiss the complaint de novo.see skwira united states,cir,cert.denied,d.b.the ftca permits individuals to sue the united states for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,b,but limits this waiver of sovereign immunity by prescribing that a tort claim against the united states shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate federal agency within two years after such claim accrues,id.b.thus,this limitations provision,ensuring that the government is promptly presented with a claim while the evidence is still fresh,is to be strictly construed in the government favor.see united states kubrick,d skwira,at.the limitations provision commences upon the accrual of the claim,which occurs when the plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known i she was injured and ii the cause of the injury.see id.
a.the december administrative claim 
the plaintiffs first contend that,since gioka neither knew nor had reason to know of the fbi involvement in her father murder until the summer of,the district court erred in finding that the gioka administrative claim,presented to the government in december,was untimely under b.the plaintiffs assert that the publicity about the case was centered primarily in the boston area rather than national in scope,and that gioka,who was in chronic poor health,lived in georgia where she was not presumptively exposed to boston media reports.
for purposes of calculating the b accrual date,the government need not demonstrate that plaintiffs had actual knowledge of the news of december w here events receive widespread publicity,plaintiffs may be charged with constructive knowledge of their occurrence.callahan united states,cir quoting mcintyre united states,cir.thus,the test is an objective one.see mcintyre,at.the record demonstrates beyond serious dispute that the breaking news of the fbi involvement in the deegan murder did receive such widespread publicity.the boston globe and the boston herald published prominent accounts detailing the new facts relating to the fbi role in the deegan slaying,which were subsequently picked up by national wire services api,nationally circulated news publications inter alia,the new york times,the chicago tribune,the washington post,the los angeles times,and usa today,and national network news,the cbs early show.thus,the fact that gioka resided in georgia in december is insufficient to vitiate a finding that she should have learned of the news at that time.
gioka also contends that her medical condition,which included cognitive problems arising from an automobile accident,a stroke,and lyme disease,prevented her from making a reasonable inquiry and discovering the fbi complicity in her father murder.assuming,without deciding,that b might permit such a mental incapacity exception gioka has not alleged facts which would enable her to assert it.she does not contend that her illnesses rendered her mentally incompetent.thus,at a minimum,she would have to point to evidence demonstrating that the degree of her mental incapacity rendered her incapable of discovering with the exercise of reasonable then of news of the fbi involvement in her father death.see,barnhart united states,cir.
gioka has failed to make the requisite showing.she presents no medical reports detailing precisely how,or to what extent,her illnesses in fact impaired her ability to discover or comprehend the facts which were widely publicized in the national media.the gioka affidavit merely states at times,my concern about my health has been overwhelming and has left little room for other matters,including considerations of my father death.she does not specify at which times she was incapacitated,which leaves open the possibility that she was not significantly impaired,for example,in december and early when the deegan story first broke in the press.further,even if we were to infer that her medical condition kept her bedridden or housebound,it apparently did not prevent her from accessing the media,since she admits to a memory of seeing the very end of a cnn report about salvati.finally,gioka sister,catherine patterson,admits that she had knowledge of the pertinent facts by the summer of and it strains credulity to suggest that patterson,knowing o
