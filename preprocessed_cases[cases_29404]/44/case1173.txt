opinion of the court 
grace grace and the state of montana appeal an order from the united states district court for the district of delaware affirming an order from the district bankruptcy court denying grace motion to expand a preliminary injunction.the proposed expansion would have enjoined claims against the state of montana arising from grace mining operations near libby,montana.both the district court and the bankruptcy court determined that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction under b and a to expand the injunction to enjoin those claims and,therefore,denied the motion.for the following reasons,we will affirm.
background 
this appeal is the fourth to reach us from grace ongoing efforts to reorganize under chapter of the bankruptcy code,efforts which began in when grace sought shelter from liabilities associated with asbestos litigation disputes in the case have been aggressively litigated,as our previous three opinions indicate.see in re grace.cir in re grace.cir in re kensington int l,cir.
grace produces specialty chemicals and materials.as part of its business,from until,grace operated a vermiculite mine ten miles north of libby,montana.the mine yielded ore which was used to create zonolite.the zonolite contained tremolite,which is alleged to be an especially carcinogenic variety of asbestos.while the mine was operating,it generated dust that allegedly caused injury to mine workers,their families,and others in the community.persons claiming to be injured by that asbestos exposure the libby claimants filed suit against grace in maryland state court the lawsuit.as a result of costs associated with such asbestos litigation,grace decided to file a petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.
preliminary injunctive relief 
on april,the same day that grace filed its chapter petition,it commenced an adversary proceeding to halt prosecution of the lawsuit.the bankruptcy court promptly granted a temporary restraining order that included a provision enjoining litigation against grace and its affiliates whose purported asbestos liability derived from grace alleged liability.
on may,the bankruptcy court entered a preliminary injunction pursuant to a,encompassing the conditions of the temporary restraining order.more specifically,it precluded all and fraudulent transfer claims against affiliated entities,including claims against insurance carriers alleging coverage from liabilities.app.at.at grace request,the may order named grace worker compensation insurer,maryland casualty company mcc,as an insurance carrier covered by the injunction.the request was based in part on a settlement agreement between grace and mcc in which grace agreed to release and indemnify mcc against any future claims against mcc that arose out of grace alleged liability.on january,the bankruptcy court modified the scope of the preliminary injunction to include several additional claims and parties and to reinstate the bar against the commencement of new actions against affiliates directly or indirectly related to grace alleged asbestos liability.app.at.
on february,a group of the libby claimants,led by named plaintiff carol gerard,sought to modify the preliminary injunction to allow them to pursue claims against mcc.the bankruptcy court denied the motion,which,despite a reversal by the district court,was ultimately affirmed by our court on appeal.see in re grace gerard grace.cir gerard.
present litigation 
prior to grace april,filing for bankruptcy,the libby claimants brought lawsuits in the montana courts against the state of montana the montana actions,alleging that montana is liable to them because it was negligent in failing to warn them of the risks of asbestos from the libby mine.on december,the montana supreme court held that montana had a duty to gather public information and provide it to the people.orr state,see also id.at the state argument that it owed no duty to the miners ignores the state duty to make investigations,disseminate information,and make recommendations for control of diseases and improvement of public health to persons,groups,or the public.citations omitted.having established that,under montana law,the state of montana owed a duty to the libby claimants,the montana supreme court remanded for a determination by the of whether the state breached its duty to the miners,and if so,whether such breach caused the damages claimed by them.id.at.
on june,understandably reluctant to face potential asbestos liability alone,montana asked the bankruptcy court for relief from the automatic stay of litigation against grace so that it could implead grace as a defendant in the montana actions grace opposed that motion,but filed its own motion asking the bankruptcy court to expand the preliminary injunction to include actions brought against the state of montana.grace argued that its motion should be granted because grace and montana share an identity of interests such that the montana actions were essentially suits against grace,which would be harmful to grace efforts to reorganize.the libby claimants,of course,opposed grace motion,claiming that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to enjoin the montana actions.they also argued that,even if the court did have jurisdiction,grace motion failed to establish the unusual circumstances or equitable factors required for the issuance of an injunction against a litigant.the state of montana also filed a response to grace motion,in which it stated that it did not object to the motion unless the relief granted would affect certain of its rights.after a hearing on the motions,the bankruptcy court stayed the montana actions and took the matter under advisement.
on april,the bankruptcy court denied grace motion to expand the preliminary injunction to encompass the montana actions,holding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to grant the requested relief.see in re grace.after examining b and a,and controlling precedent,the bankruptcy court concluded that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the montana actions because grace bankruptcy estate would not be directly affected by the outcome of those lawsuits.id.the court noted that,before there could be any effect on grace,montana must first be found liable in state court and then pursue its claim for indemnification in bankruptcy court.id.
while the montana supreme court found that a duty existed on behalf of the state,the case was remanded for determination of whether the state of montana breached that duty.if breach is not found,is not possible.if breach is found,the montana plaintiffs would still be obligated to bring an entirely separate proceeding to receive indemnification.montana law prohibits the state of montana from litigating against debtors for either contribution or indemnity during the course of the state court actions.a judgment against the state of montana will not bind debtors.an intervening adjudication is necessary to affect the estate.
id.citations omitted.the court effectively denied montana motion to lift the automatic stay,saying that the automatic stay remains in effect as to the debtors and their property and nothing in this opinion and order authorizes relief from the stay as to any allegation id.at.
the state of montana and grace sought leave to appeal,and the district court allowed them to do so,though it went on to affirm the decision of the bankruptcy court see in re grace,wl.like the bankruptcy court,the district court noted that grace will not be bound by a judgment against the state of montana in the state court actions because a separate adjudication is necessary to affect debtors estate.id.at.the court thus held that subject matter jurisdiction does not exist.id.at.
grace and montana filed timely notices of appeal to our court.
on appeal,grace and montana argue that the bankruptcy and district courts erred because a federal court need not exercise jurisdiction over a action in order to enjoin it.grace op.br.at according to appellants,as long as the federal court is acting in a case over which it has jurisdiction,the propriety of an injunction is a matter of the federal court remedial authority,not its jurisdiction.id.while the appellants recognize that a bankruptcy court must establish subject matter jurisdiction before considering the merits of a a injunction id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted,they rely on our opinion in gerard to argue that this requirement does not mean that the court must establish jurisdiction over the proceeding sought to be enjoined.id.the libby claimants respond that the bankruptcy court must have subject matter jurisdiction over the montana actions to enjoin them,and that the lower courts correctly found that the bankruptcy court was without such jurisdiction.they further argue that,should we conclude that jurisdiction exists,a a injunction is nevertheless not warranted because grace and montana have failed to establish the unusual circumstances or equitable factors required for the issuance of an injunction.
bankruptcy subject matter jurisdiction generally 
while a of the bankruptcy code allows a bankruptcy court to issue any order necessary to carry out the provisions of the code,it does not provide an independent source of federal subject matter jurisdiction.in re combustion eng g,cir see also a.thus,before considering the merits of any a injunction,a bankruptcy court must establish that it has subject matter jurisdiction to enter the injunction.see combustion eng g,at describing the bankruptcy court threshold jurisdictional inquiry.
federal district courts have original jurisdiction but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title of the bankruptcy code,or arising in or related to cases under title.b.section a of title then permits a district court to refer any and all proceedings arising under title or arising in or related to a case under title to the bankruptcy judges within the district.id.a.there are thus three types of bankruptcy jurisdiction,commonly called arising under,arising in,and related to jurisdiction.only the last of these is at issue here.proceedings over which a bankruptcy court can legitimately exercise jurisdiction include suits between third parties that conceivably may have an effect on the bankruptcy estate.combustion eng g,at citing celotex edwards,d.broadly worded as that is,however,jurisdiction is not without limitation.id.at see also bd.of governors of fed.reserve mcorp,d noting the limited authority congress has vested in the bankruptcy courts through jurisdiction.
jurisdiction 
to understand the limits of jurisdiction,it is helpful to look at the case in which we adopted the any conceivable effect test for finding such jurisdiction.in pacor,higgins,cir,we said,
the usual articulation of the test for determining whether a civil proceeding is related to bankruptcy is whether the outcome of that proceeding could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy an action is related to bankruptcy if the outcome could alter the debtor rights,liabilities,options,or freedom of action either positively or negatively and which in any way impacts upon the handling and administration of the bankrupt estate.
id.at emphasis in original citations omitted overruled on other grounds see also combustion eng g,at describing the pacor test as seminal.despite that sweeping language,the facts of the case demonstrated a crucial limit on the legitimate exercise of subject matter jurisdiction.
in pacor,john and louise higgins brought suit in pennsylvania state court against pacor,a distributor of chemical supplies,seeking damages from injuries allegedly resulting from higgins exposure to asbestos supplied by pacor.at.thereafter,pacor filed a complaint impleading the corporation manville,which pacor claimed was the original manufacturer of the asbestos.id.soon after,manville filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.id.when pacor attempted to remove the higgins lawsuit to the bankruptcy court where the manville bankruptcy was pending,we denied removal,holding that the primary action between higgins and pacor would have no effect on the manville bankruptcy estate,and therefore can not establish related to jurisdiction over that suit id.at.we noted that,a t best,the lawsuit is a mere precursor to the potential third party claim for indemnification by pacor against manville.yet the outcome of the action would in no way bind manville,in that it could not determine any rights,liabilities,or course of action of the debtor.id.thus,in pacor,we were clear that an inchoate claim of common law indemnity is not,in and of itself,enough to establish the bankruptcy court subject matter jurisdiction.see id.a ny judgment received by the plaintiff higgins could not itself result in even a contingent claim against manville,since pacor would still be obligated to bring an entirely separate proceeding to receive indemnification.
eighteen years later,in in re global,cir,we reaffirmed the pacor test and simultaneously reiterated that a potential indemnification claim under common law is not enough to establish a bankruptcy court subject matter jurisdiction.we stated that t he test articulated in pacor for whether a lawsuit could conceivably have an effect on the bankruptcy proceeding inquires whether the allegedly related lawsuit would affect the bankruptcy proceeding without the intervention of yet another lawsuit.id.at emphasis added.applying that rule,we held that the bankruptcy court did not have subject matter jurisdiction because the indemnification claim against the debtors had not yet accrued and would require another lawsuit before having an impact on the debtor bankruptcy proceeding.id.thus,made it clear that there is no jurisdiction over a claim if there would need to be another lawsuit before the claim could have any impact on the bankruptcy proceedings.
finally,and more recently,in combustion engineering,we again emphasized the bounds of the pacor test for jurisdiction.see at.there,we considered a prepackaged chapter reorganization plan providing that all asbestos claims against combustion engineering and two of its affiliates,abb lummus global,and basic,lummus and basic,were to be channeled through a trust created under g of the bankruptcy code,to which all three entities were to contribute.id.at.the plan also provided for a a injunction barring any claims against the three entities.id.one of the issues on appeal was whether the bankruptcy court had the power to enter the injunction as to lummus and basic.in analyzing that question,we repeated that the pacor test,as clarified by,requires an inquiry into whether the allegedly related lawsuit would affect the bankruptcy without the intervention of yet another lawsuit.id.at.we also examined other factors advanced by the debtor as grounds for jurisdiction,namely,the alleged unity of interest between the debtor and its affiliates based on the debtor potential indemnity obligation to those affiliates,as well as the existence of both a shared production site and shared insurance between the debtor and the affiliates.id.at.even when considering those additional elements of unity between combustion engineering and its affiliates,we nevertheless held that jurisdiction could not be extended to asbestos claims against those.
a review of the claims asserted against combustion engineering,basic and lummus reveals little evidence of derivative liability w e have rejected related to jurisdiction over claims involving asbestos or products supplied by the debtor when the claim did not directly result in liability for the debtor a ny indemnification claims against combustion engineering would require the intervention of another lawsuit to affect the bankruptcy estate,and thus can not provide a basis for related to jurisdiction.
turning to the facts at hand,the relationship between grace and the state of montana is in one crucial respect analogous to the relationships in pacor,and combustion engineering.like the debtors in those cases,grace will not be bound by any judgment against the third party in question.rather,an entirely separate action would be necessary for any liability incurred by montana to have an impact on grace estate.specifically,montana would first have to be found liable by its state courts and would t
