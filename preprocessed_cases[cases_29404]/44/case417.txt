appellant rosaura brought this action,pursuant to the federal tort claims act ftca and the bivens doctrine,see bivens six unknown named agents of federal bureau of narcotics,d,against the united states,the immigration and naturalization service ins and a number of immigration officers.the complaint asserts claims for malicious prosecution,abuse of process,negligence,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and violations of various constitutional rights.the upshot of the complaint is that because gonzalez turned down the romantic overtures of defendant immigration officer andres nuñez,nuñez and his colleagues used their official positions to destroy her law practice,to obtain warrants to search her home and office,to procure her arrest,and to secure a criminal indictment against her.the alleged harassment began in peaked with gonzalez indictment for various criminal offenses on september,and continued for some months after her acquittal on february.
on july,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss and entered judgment,concluding that all of gonzalez claims were cognizable either under the ftca or as bivens claims,but that both the ftca and bivens claims were untimely.on august,gonzalez moved for relief from judgment under fed.civ.pro.b as to her ftca claims,arguing that the district court miscalculated the filing date.the government responded that even if the ftca claims were timely,gonzalez motion should be denied because she failed to state claims under the ftca upon which relief could be granted.
in its order addressing gonzalez rule b motion,the district court reaffirmed its holding that the bivens claims were,but agreed that the ftca claims were timely.nonetheless,the court denied the motion because,in its view,the malicious prosecution and abuse of process claims were inadequately pleaded under fed.civ.pro.b.the court held that the indictment conclusively established the existence of probable cause,foreclosing the malicious prosecution claim.the court also held that the abuse of process claim was not cognizable because only defendant nuñez was alleged to have had a bad motive bringing a lawsuit was not an abuse of process it was too speculative to conclude that a grand jury handed down an indictment to coerce gonzalez into a relationship with nuñez and that the probable cause determination preempted any alleged improper collateral objectives by the defendants.gonzalez notice of appeal,filed on january,refers only to the order denying the rule b motion.
on appeal,gonzalez argues that her claims for malicious prosecution and abuse of process were adequately pleaded,her bivens claims were not,and the district court failed to address several of her other ftca claims.appellees respond that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the rule b motion because the abuse of process and malicious prosecution claims were foreclosed by the indictment were inadequately pleaded,and that no timely appeal was taken as to the bivens claims.
we begin by considering which issues are properly before us.gonzalez did not timely appeal from the july,judgment.see fed.a frito lay snacks caribbean,cir.thus,we only have jurisdiction to consider the order denying rule b relief.see frito lay,at.while the bivens timeliness issue was not clearly raised in gonzalez rule b motion,the district court nonetheless considered it in its order.therefore,we conclude that we have jurisdiction to consider all of gonzalez claims.
a district court denial of a rule b motion is typically reviewed for abuse of discretion.see caisse dubois,cir.rule b relief is extraordinary in nature,and to warrant such relief a movant must demonstrate that the motion is timely,exceptional circumstances justify granting extraordinary relief,and vacating the judgment will not cause unfair prejudice to the opposing party.id.at.moreover,a district court should only grant rule b relief if the moving party demonstrates that the underlying claims have a reasonable chance of success on the merits.see id.
we can dispense with gonzalez bivens contentions in short order.gonzalez claims accrued no later than february,with her acquittal,yet she filed no claims administrative or judicial for nearly two years.as bivens actions are subject to a limitations period,see roman townsend,cir,the district court did not err in concluding that these claims were.the district court conclusion that gonzalez ftca claims were inadequately pleaded is more problematic.
under the ftca,we look to law of the place where the alleged wrongful actions occurred,see rodriguez united states,cir,so puerto rico law provides the relevant standards for the substantive claims.to state a malicious prosecution claim,a plaintiff must allege four elements that a criminal action was initiated or instigated by the defendants that the criminal action terminated in favor of plaintiff s that defendants acted with malice and without probable cause and that plaintiff s suffered damages.united states,d.the only issue here is whether the existence of the grand jury indictment was sufficient to defeat the lack of probable cause requirement.
generally,a grand jury indictment definitively establishes probable cause.see ford,d,an indictment fair upon its face and returned by a properly constituted grand jury conclusively determines the existence of probable cause citation and internal quotation omitted.however,courts have recognized an exception if law enforcement defendants wrongfully obtained the indictment by knowingly presenting false testimony to the grand jury.see,rothstein carriere,cir applying new york law camiolo state farm fire casualty,cir applying pennsylvania law moran clarke,cir applying missouri law see also,d at.such allegations are sufficient,at the pleading stage,to rebut the presumption of probable cause established by the grand jury indictment,d at normeat royal dane quality,cir actor would not be immunized from a malicious prosecution claim by the independent prosecutor decision to commence a criminal action if he effectively instigates the prosecution by knowingly providing false information to the authorities,cir similar aponte matos toledo davila,cir an officer is not entitled to qualified immunity in a action if there is an issue of fact as to whether he obtained the warrant relied upon by knowingly presenting false evidence.because gonzalez alleges that the defendants obtained the indictment,as well as the various search and arrest warrants,through the use of false testimony,she has pleaded a viable claim for malicious prosecution.
we reach a similar conclusion as to the abuse of process claim.under puerto rico law,t he two basic elements of abuse of process are a bad motive,and the use of a legal process for an improper,collateral objective.microsoft computer warehouse,d,citation and internal quotation omitted.further,while malicious prosecution claims are generally directed to a legal action as a whole,abuse of process typically covers challenges to the legal action procedural components,discovery mechanisms or subpoenas.see,d at.
the district court is correct in observing that only nuñez is specifically alleged to have had a bad motive.however,this is not fatal to gonzalez claim,as a wrongful motive in an abuse of process claim can be inferred from a wrongful act,see simon navon,cir,and gonzalez alleges a host of wrongful acts committed by the other defendants.further,while simply bringing a lawsuit may not be an abuse of process,obtaining search and arrest warrants by means of false testimony is a proper basis for a claim of abuse of process at least for pleading purposes.see generally,d at.
concerning the collateral objective element,gonzalez alleged that nuñez sought to punish her for rejecting him and that the other defendants were retaliating against her for exercising her civil rights.these are adequate improper collateral objectives for pleading purposes.thus,gonzalez has stated a viable abuse of process claim.
in sum,the district court acknowledged that it was mistaken in initially holding gonzalez ftca claims,but ruled that she was nevertheless not entitled to relief from judgme
