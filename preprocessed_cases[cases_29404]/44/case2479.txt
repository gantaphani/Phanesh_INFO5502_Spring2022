the defendants in this action appeal the district court denial of their motion for summary judgment based on a defense of qualified immunity.this case stems from a strip search of over twenty students that occurred after a student in a high school gym class reported that her prom money had been stolen the plaintiffs in this case include both male and female high school students who were subjected to the search the defendants are the teachers who were involved in the search and the police officer who instructed the teachers to search the female plaintiffs.
the actions of the defendants in this case were unconstitutional.however,at the time the searches occurred,the law regarding the reasonableness of a strip search under these circumstances was not clearly established.the denial of summary judgment is therefore reversed.
background 
on may,a student in the gym class at whitmore lake high school reported to her gym teacher,brian carpenter,that her prom money had been stolen at some point during the class.the school principal was absent on the date of the incident,so the acting principal,school teacher charmaine balsillie,was advised of the theft.balsillie called the police to report the incident and asked two female teachers,sue langen and wendy lemons,and one male teacher,jay munz,to assist her.
when balsillie arrived at the gymnasium,the male students were in the boys locker room,and the female students were in the gymnasium.lemons,langen,and the female students searched the gymnasium and the female students backpacks.balsillie then went to the boys locker room and told carpenter that the police were on their way.at this time,balsillie noticed munz heading towards the shower area.carpenter told balsillie that they had searched the male students backpacks,but had failed to locate the money.by the time balsillie exited the locker room,police officer mayrand had arrived.
munz and carpenter were the only defendants that participated in the search of the male students in the boys locker room.carpenter searched book bags and lockers,while munz searched the boys individually in the shower room.the search consisted of the boys individually lowering their pants and underwear and removing their shirts the boys were not physically touched.the teachers claim that the police arrived and came into the boys locker room after about of the boys had been searched.according to the teachers,mayrand told carpenter to continue searching the students and that teachers had a lot more leeway than police officers when it came to searching students.about twenty boys were searched.
officer mayrand also spoke to balsillie and asked if the girls had been searched.according to balsillie,mayrand told her that the boys had been checked in their underwear and that the teachers needed to check the girls in the same way so as to prevent any claims of gender discrimination.balsillie and langen then took the female students into the girls locker room where the girls pulled up their shirts and pulled down their pants while standing in a circle the girls were never touched and did not remove their underwear.about five girls were searched.the stolen money was never discovered.
ii.analysis 
the defendants appeal the district court denial of their motion for qualified immunity in this action.the district court found that,at the time the searches occurred,the law clearly established that a strip search of students for missing money in the absence of individualized suspicion is not reasonable,and accordingly denied the teachers request for qualified immunity.with respect to officer mayrand,the district court found that the facts,taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,supported a finding that mayrand had subjected the female plaintiffs to a constitutional violation by setting the strip search in motion.the district court therefore denied summary judgment as to both the teachers and officer mayrand 
the searches performed on the students in this case were unconstitutional.however,at the time the searches were performed,the law did not clearly establish that the searches were unconstitutional under these circumstances.the denial of summary judgment is accordingly reversed.
although the denial of a motion for summary judgment is generally considered interlocutory and not appealable,a denial based on a determination that the defendant is not entitled to qualified immunity may be reviewed on appeal.solomon auburn hills police,cir citing phelps coy,cir.when reviewing a district court denial of qualified immunity,all facts are to be taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs and the only issues appropriate for review are those that are strictly legal.id.citing phelps,at.because the availability of qualified immunity is a legal question,we review the decision of the district court de novo.id.citing thomas cohen,cir.
the doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials who perform discretionary functions from civil liability insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.this court employs a test when determining whether a grant of qualified immunity is proper 
first,we determine whether,based upon the applicable law,the facts viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs show that a constitutional violation has occurred.second,we consider whether the violation involved a clearly established constitutional right of which a reasonable person would have known.third,we determine whether the plaintiff has offered sufficient evidence to indicate that what the official allegedly did was objectively unreasonable in light of the clearly established constitutional rights.

a.the searches violated the fourth amendment 
the initial inquiry in determining whether a grant of qualified immunity is proper is whether the facts asserted,taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,establish a constitutional violation.saucier katz,d.in this case,approximately twenty male students were searched,in the absence of individualized suspicion and without consent,in the hopes of locating missing money.approximately five female students were searched under similar circumstances,but were also required to remove their clothes in the presence of one another.under these circumstances,the searches were a violation of the fourth amendment.assuming arguendo that officer mayrand was aware of these circumstances when ordering the female students to be searched,his conduct was also unlawful.
as explained by the supreme court in new jersey,d,a school search violates the fourth amendment when the school undertakes a search of a student that is unreasonable.in,a school official searched a student purse for cigarettes after the student had been caught smoking in the restroom.id.at.upon searching the purse,the school official found a pack of cigarettes and rolling papers,which were often used by students to smoke marijuana.id.a further search of the purse revealed marijuana,a pipe,plastic bags,a substantial quantity of single dollar bills,an index card that listed the names of students owing her money,and two letters implicating her in marijuana dealing.id.the court held that the fourth amendment applies to searches conducted by school authorities,id.at,but rejected strict adherence to a probable cause requirement.id.at.rather,the legality of a school search depends on its reasonableness under all the circumstances.id.determining the reasonableness of a school search involves a twofold inquiry first,was the action justified at its inception and second,was the search reasonably related in scope to the circumstances justifying the search.id.in general,a search of a student by a teacher or other school official will be justified at its inception when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of the school.id.at.a search is generally permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student and nature of the infraction.id.at.the search in was held to be reasonable.id.at.the court reasoned that school officials had reason to suspect that the student purse contained cigarettes based on the accusation that she had been smoking in the restroom the court also concluded that,after the initial search of the student purse revealed evidence of marijuana,a further search of the purse was justified.id.at.
we assume,without holding,that the searches of both the male and female students were justified at their inception.that is,some search of the persons and effects of students may be warranted when substantial property has been reported recently stolen.the courts have held that lack of individual suspicion does not ipso facto render a search unreasonable.in the school context,the court expressly refrained from so holding.id.at.see also skinner ry.labor executives ass n,d upholding policy of drug testing railway employees who violate safety rules or who are involved in accidents in the absence of individualized suspicion treasury employees union von raab,d upholding drug testing of customs officials who carry a firearm or work in drug interdiction in the absence of individualized suspicion.dep t of state police sitz,d upholding sobriety checkpoints performed in the absence of individualized suspicion.
the scope of the searches in the instant case,however,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,does not pass constitutional muster.in making this determination,we are guided by the supreme court analysis in vernonia sch.dist.acton,d,which sets forth the relevant criteria for evaluating searches performed in the absence of individual suspicion.in vernonia,the court held to be reasonable a school system policy of randomly drug testing student athletes even in the absence of individualized suspicion.id.at.in so deciding,the court looked to three factors the student legitimate expectation of privacy,the intrusiveness of the search,and the severity of the school system needs that were met by the search.id.in vernonia,the court found the drug testing policy to be constitutional because student athletes had a decreased expectation of privacy by virtue of the voluntary nature of their participation,the invasion of the students privacy was minimal,and the threat to the school system from unfettered drug use was great.id.at.
the scope of the searches of the male students 
in light of the factors set forth in vernonia,the searches performed on the male students in this case were in violation of the fourth amendment.first,the privacy interest here was great.students of course have a significant privacy interest in their unclothed bodies.see,at.noting that a search of a child person is undoubtedly a severe violation of subjective expectations of privacy.the supreme court did note in vernonia,however,that public school locker rooms are not notable for the privacy they afford.at.the boys were thus not deprived of a privacy interest as much as if they had been searched,for instance,in an office.however,the scope of the search did exceed what would normally be expected by a high school student in a locker room.as alleged by the plaintiffs,the boys were individually and directly examined as they unclothed.moreover,unlike in vernonia,the students did not voluntarily subject themselves to a degree of regulation higher than that imposed on students generally.at.the students here were attending gym class as part of a general school curriculum.they accordingly did not voluntarily consent to be regulated more closely than the general student population,as do student athletes who choose to go out for school sports teams.see id.
second,the character of the intrusion was far more invasive than the character of the urinalyses in vernonia,where students remained fully clothed.also unlike in vernonia,the searches were likely to disclose much more than the limited information presence of drugs at issue in vernonia.the boys were required to lift their shirts and to remove both their pants and underwear.
third,the governmental interest,though of some weight,was not as great as in cases like vernonia.school administrators have a real interest in maintaining an atmosphere free of theft.but,a search undertaken to find money serves a less weighty governmental interest than a search undertaken for items that pose a threat to the health or safety of students,such as drugs or weapons.see oliver mcclung,finding that a strip search for money was not reasonable,but noting that the same search may have been reasonable if undertaken to find drugs or weapons.in addition,the lack of individualized suspicion also makes the government interest less weighty.the government may have a comparatively strong interest in searching a particular student reasonably suspected of theft,because of the likelihood that the search will be successful.such interest is diluted considerably when,instead of one,two,or three students,the school officials search over twenty students,without reason to suspect that any particular student was responsible for the alleged theft.in that case the intrusive search of each individual is that much less likely to be successful.
the highly intrusive nature of the searches,the fact that the searches were undertaken to find missing money,the fact that the searches were performed on a substantial number of students,the fact that the searches were performed in the absence of individualized suspicion,and the lack of consent,taken together,demonstrate that the searches were not reasonable.accordingly,under and vernonia,the searches violated the fourth amendment.
the scope of the searches of the female students 
the searches of the female students also violated the fourth amendment.because the searches of the female students were similar in many respects to those performed on the male students,we only briefly describe the factors that render the searches unconstitutional.as with the male students,the female students did not consent to the search,nor was there reason to suspect that any particular student was responsible for the alleged theft.the approximately five female students were required to lift their shirts and remove their pants.the girls,however,unlike the males,did not have to remove their underwear.on the other hand,unlike any allegation in regard to the search of the males,the female students were required to undress in front of one another.the fact that the searches of the females did not occur in the presence of only school officials,but rather in the presence of other students,further supports the conclusion that the searches were unreasonable.see reynolds city of anchorage,cir in analyzing the reasonableness of a strip search occurring in a juvenile group home,the court found it important that the search was conducted in a way designed to minimize its intrusive effect and that the search took place in the presence of only a single staff member.
the fact that the searches of the females were highly intrusive,the fact that the searches occurred in the presence of other students,the lack of consent,the absence of individualized suspicion,and the fact that the searches were undertaken to find money,taken together,demonstrate that the searches performed on the females in this case were not reasonable.the searches accordingly violated the fourth amendment.
officer mayrand 
assuming arguendo that officer mayrand was aware of the numerous factors that rendered the searches in this case unconstitutional,then mayrand action in ordering the searches of the female plaintiffs was also unlawful.
