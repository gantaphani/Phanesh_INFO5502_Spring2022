employee benefits plans regulated by the employee retirement income security act of erisa or act often contain subrogation clauses requiring a plan participant to reimburse the plan for medical expenses if the participant later recovers money from a third party for his injuries.here,petitioner montanile was seriously injured by a drunk driver,and his erisa plan paid more than for his medical expenses.montanile later sued the drunk driver,obtaining a settlement.pursuant to the plan subrogation clause,respondent plan administrator the board of trustees of the national elevator industry health benefit plan,or board,sought reimbursement from the settlement.montanile attorney refused that request and subsequently informed the board that the fund would be transferred from a client trust account to montanile unless the board objected.the board did not respond,and montanile received the settlement.
six months later,the board sued montanile in federal district court under a of erisa,which authorizes plan fiduciaries to file suit to obtain appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of the plan.a.the board sought an equitable lien on any settlement funds or property in montanile possession and an order enjoining montanile from dissipating any such funds.montanile argued that because he had already spent almost all of the settlement,no identifiable fund existed against which to enforce the lien.the district court rejected montanile argument,and the eleventh circuit affirmed,holding that even if montanile had completely dissipated the fund,the plan was entitled to reimbursement from montanile general assets.
held when an participant wholly dissipates a settlement on nontraceable items,the plan fiduciary may not bring suit under a to attach the participant separate assets.
a plan fiduciaries are limited by a to filing suits to obtain equitable relief.whether the relief requested is legal or equitable depends on the basis for the plaintiff claim and the nature of the underlying remedies sought.sereboff mid atlantic medical services.
this court precedents establish that the basis for the board claim the enforcement of a lien created by an agreement to convey a particular fund to another party is equitable.see sereboff,at.the court precedents also establish that the nature of the board underlying remedy enforcement of a lien against specifically identifiable funds that were within montanile possession and control,at would also have been equitable had the board immediately sued to enforce the lien against the fund.but those propositions do not resolve the question here whether a plan is still seeking an equitable remedy when the defendant has dissipated all of a separate settlement fund,and the plan then seeks to recover out of the defendant general assets.
this court holds today that a plan is not seeking equitable relief under those circumstances.in premerger equity courts,a plaintiff could ordinarily enforce an equitable lien,including,as here,an equitable lien by agreement,only against specifically identified funds that remained in the defendant possession or against traceable items that the defendant purchased with the funds.see symons,pomeroy equity jurisprudence.if a defendant dissipated the entire fund on nontraceable items,the lien was eliminated and the plaintiff could not attach the defendant general assets instead.see restatement of restitution.
b the board arguments in favor of the enforcement of an equitable lien against montanile general assets are unsuccessful.sereboff does not contain an exception to the general requirement for equitable liens by agreement.see,at.nor does historical equity practice support the enforcement of an equitable lien against general assets.and the board claim that erisa objectives are best served by allowing plans to enforce such liens is a vague notio n of the statute basic purpose inadequate to overcome the words of its text regarding the specific issue under consideration.mertens hewitt associates.
c the case is remanded for the district court to determine,in the first instance,whether montanile kept his settlement fund separate from his general assets and whether he dissipated the entire fund on nontraceable assets.

robert montanile,petitioner board of trustees of the national elevator industry health benefit plan 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
when a third party injures a participant in an employee benefits plan under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,stat,as amended,et,the plan frequently pays covered medical expenses.the terms of these plans often include a subrogation clause requiring a participant to reimburse the plan if the participant later recovers money from the third party for his injuries.and under erisa a,a,plan fiduciaries can file civil suits to obtain appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of the plan.
in this case,we consider what happens when a participant obtains a settlement fund from a third party,but spends the whole settlement on nontraceable items for instance,on services or consumable items like food.we evaluate in particular whether a plan fiduciary can sue under a to recover from the participant remaining assets the medical expenses it paid on the participant behalf.we hold that,when a participant dissipates the whole settlement on nontraceable items,the fiduciary can not bring a suit to attach the participant general assets under a because the suit is not one for appropriate equitable relief.in this case,it is unclear whether the participant dissipated all of his settlement in this manner,so we remand for further proceedings.
petitioner robert montanile was a participant in a health benefits plan governed by erisa and administered by respondent,the board of trustees of the national elevator industry health benefit plan board of trustees or board.the plan must pay for certain medical expenses that beneficiaries or participants incur.the plan may demand reimbursement,however,when a participant recovers money from a third party for medical expenses.the plan states amounts that have been recovered by a participant from another party are assets of the plan and are not distributable to any person or entity without the plan written release of its subrogation interest.app.the plan also provides that any amounts that a participant recover s from another party by award,judgment,settlement or otherwise will promptly be applied first to reimburse the plan in full for benefits advanced by the plan and without reduction for attorneys fees,costs,expenses or damages claimed by the covered person.at.participants must notify the plan and obtain its consent before settling claims.
in december,a drunk driver ran through a stop sign and crashed into montanile vehicle.the accident severely injured montanile,and the plan paid at least for his initial medical care.montanile signed a reimbursement agreement reaffirming his obligation to reimburse the plan from any recovery he obtained as a result of any legal action or settlement or otherwise.at emphasis deleted.
thereafter,montanile filed a negligence claim against the drunk driver and made a claim for uninsured motorist benefits under montanile car insurance.he obtained a settlement.montanile then paid his attorneys and repaid about that they had advanced him.thus,about remained of the settlement.montanile attorneys held most of that sum in a client trust account.this included enough money to satisfy montanile obligations to the plan.
the board of trustees sought reimbursement from montanile on behalf of the plan,and montanile attorney argued that the plan was not entitled to any recovery.the parties attempted but failed to reach an agreement about reimbursement.after discussions broke down,montanile attorney informed the board that he would distribute the remaining settlement funds to montanile unless the board objected within days.the board did not respond within that time,so montanile attorney gave montanile the remainder of the funds.
six months after negotiations ended,the board sued montanile in district court under erisa a,a,seeking repayment of the the plan had expended on his medical care.the board asked the court to enforce an equitable lien upon any settlement funds or any property which are in montanile actual or constructive possession.fed.appx,quoting complaint.because montanile had already taken possession of the settlement funds,the board also sought an order enjoining montanile from dissipating any such funds.montanile then stipulated that he still possessed some of the settlement proceeds.
the district court granted summary judgment to the board.sd,wl.the court rejected montanile argument that,because he had by that time spent almost all of the settlement funds,there was no specific,identifiable fund separate from his general assets against which the board equitable lien could be enforced,at.the court held that,even if montanile had dissipated some or all of the settlement funds,the board was entitled to reimbursement from montanile general assets,at.the court entered judgment for the board in the amount of.
the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit affirmed.it reasoned that a plan can always enforce an equitable lien once the lien attaches,and that dissipation of the specific fund to which the lien attached can not destroy the underlying reimbursement obligation.the court therefore held that the plan can recover out of a participant general assets when the participant dissipates the specifically identified fund.fed,at.
we granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the courts of appeals over whether an erisa fiduciary can enforce an equitable lien against a defendant general assets under these circumstances.we hold that it can not,and accordingly reverse the judgment of the eleventh circuit and remand for further proceedings.
as previously stated,a of erisa authorizes plan fiduciaries like the board of trustees to bring civil suits to obtain other appropriate equitable relief to enforce the terms of the plan.a.our cases explain that the term equitable relief in a is limited to those categories of relief that were typically available in equity during the days of the divided bench meaning,the period before when courts of law and equity were separate.mertens hewitt associates.under this court precedents,whether the remedy a plaintiff seeks is legal or equitable depends on the basis for the plaintiff claim and the nature of the underlying remedies sought.sereboff mid atlantic medical services,internal quotation marks omitted.our precedents also prescribe a framework for resolving this inquiry.to determine how to characterize the basis of a plaintiff claim and the nature of the remedies sought,we turn to standard treatises on equity,which establish the basic contours of what equitable relief was typically available in premerger equity courts.life annuity ins.knudson.
we have employed this approach in three earlier cases where,as here,the plan fiduciary sought reimbursement for medical expenses after the plan beneficiary or participant recovered money from a third party.under these precedents,the basis for the board claim is equitable.but our cases do not resolve whether the remedy the board now seeks enforcement of an equitable lien by agreement against the defendant general assets is equitable in nature.
first,in,we held that a plan with a claim for an equitable lien was in the circumstances presented seeking a legal rather than an equitable remedy.in that case,a plan sought to enforce an equitable lien by obtaining a money judgment from the defendants.the plan could not enforce the lien against the settlement that the defendants had obtained because the defendants never actually possessed that fund the fund went directly to the defendants attorneys and to a restricted trust.we held that the plan sought a legal remedy,not an equitable one,even though the plan claimed that the money judgment was a form of restitution,at.we explained that restitution in equity typically involved enforcement of a constructive trust or an equitable lien,where money or property identified as belonging in good conscience to the plaintiff could clearly be traced to particular funds or property in the defendant possession.at.but the restitution sought in was legal not equitable because the specific funds to which the fiduciaries claim ed an entitlement we re not in the defendants possession.at.since both the basis for the claim and the particular remedy sought were not equitable,the plan could not sue under a.
next,in sereboff,we held that both the basis for the claim and the remedy sought were equitable.the plan there sought reimbursement from beneficiaries who had retained their settlement fund in a separate account,at.we held that the basis for the plan claim was equitable because the plan sought to enforce an equitable lien by agreement,a type of equitable lien created by an agreement to convey a particular fund to another party.see,at.the lien existed in sereboff because of the beneficiaries agreement with the plan to convey the proceeds of any settlement.we explained that a claim to enforce such a lien is equitable because the plan could rely on a familiar rul e of equity to collect specifically,the rule that a contract to convey a specific object even before it is acquired will make the contractor a trustee as soon as he gets a title to the thing.ibid.internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.the underlying remedies that the plan sought also were equitable,because the plan sought specifically identifiable funds that were within the possession and control of the beneficiaries not recovery from the beneficiaries assets generally.at internal quotation marks omitted.
finally,in us airways,mccutchen,we reaffirmed our analysis in sereboff and again concluded that a plan sought to enforce an equitable claim by seeking equitable remedies.as in sereboff,the basis for the plan claim was equitable because the plan terms created an equitable lien by agreement on a settlement.see,at slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.and,as in sereboff,t he nature of the recovery requested by the plan was equitable because it claimed specifically identifiable funds within the beneficiaries control that is,a portion of the settlement they had gotten.at slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.
under these principles,the basis for the board claim here is equitable the board had an equitable lien by agreement that attached to montanile settlement fund when he obtained title to that fund.and the nature of the board underlying remedy would have been equitable had it immediately sued to enforce the lien against the settlement fund then in montanile possession.that does not resolve this case,however.our prior cases do not address whether a plan is still seeking an equitable remedy when the defendant,who once possessed the settlement fund,has dissipated it all,and the plan then seeks to recover out of the defendant general assets.
to resolve this issue,we turn to standard equity treatises.as we explain below,those treatises make clear that a plaintiff could ordinarily enforce an equitable lien only against specifically identified funds that remain in the defendant possession or against traceable items that the defendant purchased with the funds,identifiable property like a car.a defendant expenditure of the entire identifiable fund on nontraceable items like food or travel destroys an equitable lien.the plaintiff then may have a personal claim against the defendant general assets but recovering out of those assets is a legal remedy,not an equitable one.
