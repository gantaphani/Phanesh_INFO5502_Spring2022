the in this case are united states citizens who were injured in a terrorist attack that hamas orchestrated in jerusalem.they sued the islamic republic of iran in the united states district court for the district of columbia,alleging that iran had provided material support to hamas and was therefore liable for the attack.in,the plaintiffs obtained a default judgment against iran.campuzano islamic of iran,d.seeking to collect on that judgment,they moved to attach,by trustee process action in the district of massachusetts,certain antiquities that they claim are the property of iran but that are currently in the possession of the,the museum of fine arts,boston mfa and harvard university collectively,the museums.
after several years of litigation,the district court granted the museums motions to dissolve the attachments,concluding that the museums could invoke the objects immunity from attachment under the foreign sovereign immunities act,and that although the terrorism risk insurance act provided a potential way around that immunity,the plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden of proving that the antiquities in question were attachable under that statute.we agree with the district court that the trustee attachments should be dissolved,though we take a narrower path to reach that conclusion.
facts background 
this action began in,when the plaintiffs registered their default judgment against in the district of massachusetts and moved for orders of attachment by trustee process against all antiquities that are the property of the islamic republic of iran in the possession of the museums.see.at issue are approximately objects in harvard possession and approximately objects held by the mfa that originated in or near the area covered by the current borders of iran,including stone reliefs,sculptures,and archaeological specimens.
the museums moved to quash the trustee process summonses and dissolve the attachments,arguing that iran did not own the antiquities and that,even if it did,the antiquities would be immune under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,which provides that the property in the united states of a foreign state shall be immune from attachment arrest and execution except as provided in sections and of this chapter,id.
the plaintiffs responded with three arguments,raised in a motion for partial summary judgment and an opposition to the motion to quash the museums did not have standing to assert sovereign immunity on behalf of iran even if they did,the commercial use exception to immunity under the fsia would apply,see id.a and in any event,the plaintiffs could reach the antiquities under section a of the terrorism risk insurance act of tria,a,stat,codified at note,which permits the attachment of certain blocked assets of a terrorist party.the district court found it appropriate to consider whether the antiquities were immune under the fsia and determined that the commercial use exception did not apply,but concluded that the plaintiffs might still be able to attach the antiquities under section a of tria if they could prove that the antiquities belonged to iran.rubin islamic of iran rubin i,d.
the museums moved for reconsideration of the district court ruling that the antiquities qualified as blocked assets under tria,and the court issued a second order declining to alter its previous ruling but explaining it in further detail.rubin islamic of iran rubin ii,d.the court also certified for interlocutory appeal,see b,its rulings regarding the applicability of section a of tria,the issue of whether a foreign sovereign immunity under the fsia may only be raised by that sovereign,and the question of whether the commercial use exception applied,rubin ii,d at.the parties filed petitions for leave to appeal,which we denied,finding that aspects of the legal question of immunity might be bound up with the factual question of ownership and preferring to resolve the immunity question after ownership had been ascertained.rubin islamic of iran,cir.
discovery proceeded,and the museums once again moved to dissolve the attachments.this time,the district court granted their motions.the court found that,as judgment creditors,the plaintiffs bore the burden of proving that any object on which they sought to execute belonged to iran,that tria did not alter that burden,and that,despite extensive discovery,the plaintiffs were unable to sustain their burden of showing that any particular item held by the museums is the property of iran subject to execution by means of trustee process.rubin islamic of iran rubin iii,d.the court examined two iranian laws that the plaintiffs had invoked,one from and another from,and concluded that neither vested ownership of the antiquities in iran.id.at.the court thus dissolved the trustee attachments,and this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
for context,we briefly summarize the complex issues that the parties have put before us,though our resolution of this case does not require us to delve into many of them.the plaintiffs main argument on appeal is that tria preempts state property law,and,when read in conjunction with certain treasury department regulations,gives the plaintiffs in their words the right to levy against any interest of iran,even if that interest is less than a full ownership interest.they further claim that iran has an interest in the antiquities under iranian law that is sufficient to make them attachable under tria.
the museums,for their part,counter that tria does not displace the traditional rule that a judgment creditor may execute only against assets that a judgment debtor owns,and that the district court was correct in concluding that iranian law does not vest title to the antiquities in iran.however,the museums also challenge the district court finding that the antiquities qualify as blocked assets within the meaning of prerequisite for that statute to apply.see tria a.finally,the museums urge us to find that,even if iran owns the antiquities and they are theoretically attachable under tria,the plaintiffs claim is barred under massachusetts law by the statute of limitations and the museums adverse possession of the objects.
also before us is the position of the united states department of the treasury office of foreign assets control ofac,which is responsible for administering and enforcing economic and trade sanctions,including promulgating the regulations at issue here.the united states has filed an amicus brief articulating ofac views regarding two aspects of this case.first,ofac urges us to find that tria authorizes the attachment only of those assets that are owned by the relevant terrorist party.second,providing its own interpretation of the treasury department regulations,ofac argues that the antiquities are not contested within the meaning of those regulations,which,if correct,would make tria inapplicable here.
because we agree with ofac that the antiquities are not contested,and thus conclude that they can not qualify as blocked assets under tria,we need not reach the broader questions of whether tria preempts state law,what kind of ownership interest suffices for an asset to be attachable under tria,whether iranian law vests title to these antiquities in iran,or whether the plaintiffs claims are foreclosed by the massachusetts statute of limitations or the adverse possession doctrine.before we turn our attention to the blocked assets issue,however,we must address a attempt by the plaintiffs to overcome the immunity hurdle posed by the fsia.
a.the fsia 
the fsia makes the property in the united states of a foreign state immune from attachment and execution,subject to certain exceptions,one of which permits the attachment of property used for a commercial activity in the united states,assuming the underlying judgment relates to a claim for which the foreign state is not immune under section or section a as such section was in effect on january,id.a.the plaintiffs argued before the district court that the antiquities fell within the scope of that exception.see rubin i,d at they claimed that the statute did not require iran specifically to use the antiquities for commercial purposes in the united states,but that any party including the museums could do so in order for section a to be implicated.the district court rejected that argument,holding that the plain language of the statute,its legislative history,and generally accepted principles of international law establish that the commercial use exception of applies only where it is the foreign sovereign who engages in the commercial activity.id.at.
in their opening brief on appeal,the plaintiffs did not challenge that holding.however,after the museums addressed section a in their briefs,the plaintiffs filed a reply brief,arguing for the first time that we should permit execution under section g of the fsia,see g,which congress enacted in january as part of the national defense authorization act ndaa,b d,stat.the plaintiffs read section g as allowing a judgment creditor to execute against any property interest whatsoever of a foreign state.
the ndaa provides that qualifying judgments entered under the old version of the fsia should,on motion made by plaintiffs to the united states district court where the action was initially brought be given effect as if the action had originally been filed under the new version of the statute.ndaa c a.in march,the plaintiffs filed such a motion in the district court where they had obtained the default judgment,and the motion was granted in june rubin islamic of iran.the massachusetts district court issued its initial immunity ruling in this case in,see rubin i,d,but it certified that ruling for interlocutory appeal in march two months after the enactment of the ndaa and three days after the plaintiffs filed their motion for retroactive application of the ndaa with the district court,see rubin ii,d at,and the case continued before the massachusetts district court well into,see rubin iii,d.
at no point,however,did the plaintiffs bring the fsia amendment or the district court decision to the attention of the massachusetts district court in the instant trustee process action.nor did the plaintiffs make any argument pertaining to section g in their opening brief on appeal they made the argument for the first time in their reply brief,claiming that they had no opportunity to raise the applicability of section g before the district court.we reject that excuse,given that more than three years passed between the amendment of the fsia and the district court final ruling in this case.in any event,the plaintiffs have provided no compelling explanation for their additional failure to invoke section g in their opening brief on appeal.
we therefore refuse to consider the applicability of section g.see anderson hannaford,cir reiterating the basic rule that an argument not raised before the district court is deemed waived am.specialty ins.lapalme,cir there are few principles more securely settled in this court than the principle which holds that,absent exceptional circumstances,an appellant can not raise an argument for the first time in a reply brief.
nonetheless,under certain circumstances,tria permits the attachment of property that might otherwise be immune under the fsia.see bennett islamic of iran.the relevant section of tria provides that n otwithstanding any other provision of law,a person who has obtained a judgment against a terrorist party on a claim based upon an act of terrorism may attach and execute on the blocked assets of that terrorist party including the blocked assets of any agency or instrumentality of that terrorist party in order to satisfy the judgment.tria a.tria thereby allows a person to circumvent the normal process for attaching assets that are blocked under a sanctions program,which entails obtaining a license from ofac.see.
there exists some debate as to whether tria preempts state property law and whether the phrase assets of that terrorist party in section a means that the terrorist party must actually own the assets.compare hausler jpmorgan chase bank,d,and hausler jp morgan chase bank,d,with calderon cardona jpmorgan chase bank,d.but even if we assume,simply for the sake of argument,that the antiquities at issue here qualify as assets of iran under section a,they would also need to be blocked in order to fall within tria scope.see ministry of def.support for the armed forces of the islamic of iran elahi,d w e initially decide whether iran cubic judgment is a blocked asset within the terms of tria.that question of law,whether viewed as one of statutory interpretation or one of foreign sovereign immunity,is subject to de novo review.see hernández miranda empresas díaz massó,cir ungar palestine liberation,cir.
the plaintiffs claim that the museums did not appeal the district court decision that the antiquities are blocked assets under tria and thus argue that that order is the law of this case.not so.at the museums request,the district court certified its blocked assets ruling for interlocutory appeal.see rubin ii,d at.the museums then filed a petition for permission to appeal under b,which we denied.rubin islamic of iran,cir.at the time,we believed that the blocked assets question might be bound up with the factual question of ownership and was best resolved,if necessary,after the district court had determined who owned the antiquities.id.now,with the benefit of further factual development and,more importantly,of briefing by ofac,we find the issue dispositive.in any event,this is the first opportunity the museums have had to raise their blocked assets argument on appeal.
tria defines the phrase blocked asset as any asset seized or frozen by the united states under sections and of the international emergency economic powers act ieepa,stat,codified at u.tria d a.we have described the ieepa as codifying congress intent to confer broad and flexible power upon the president to impose and enforce economic sanctions against nations that the president deems a threat to national security interests.united states mckeeve,cir.ofac is responsible for administering sanctions imposed under the ieepa.
in,in response to the iranian hostage crisis,president carter issued an executive order the order,which ofac later implemented though regulations,blocking all transactions involving property subject to the jurisdiction of the united states or which is in the possession of or control of persons subject to the jurisdiction of the united states in which iran had any interest of any nature whatsoever,unless ofac authorized the transaction.see also exec.order.
ofac blocking order remains in place,but its effect was significantly circumscribed by the algiers accords,pursuant to which the united states and iran resolved the hostage crisis and the united states promised to revoke all trade sanctions that had been directed against iran since november and to arrange for the transfer to iran of all iranian properties located in the united states that were not addressed by other parts of the agreement.declaration of the government of the democratic and popular republic of algeria,see also elahi,at.as part of the accords,president carter issued executive order the order,which directed a ll persons subject to the jurisdiction of the united states in possession or control of properties,not including funds and securities,owned by iran or its agencies,instrumentalities,or controlled entities to transfer such properties,as directed after the effective date of this order by the government of iran.the algiers accords automatically unblocked most iranian assets that existed in this country at the time.weinstein islamic of iran,cir.
ofac implementing regulation closely mirrors the language of the order.it requires all persons subject to the jurisdiction of the united states in possession or control of properties,as defined in to transfer such properties held on january,as directed after that day by the government of iran.a.section,in turn,defines the universe of properties unblocked by the order all uncontested and liabilities and property interests of the government of iran,its agencies,instrumentalities,or controlled entities,including debts.id.a a property interest can not be contested under section unless the holder thereof reasonably believes that iran does not have title or has only partial title to the asset.id.c.after october,such a belief may be considered reasonable only if it is based upon a bona fide opinion,in writing,of an attorney licensed to practice within the united states stating that iran does not have title or has only partial title to the asset.id.
thus,to further narrow the issue,we must determine whether the antiquities in the museums possession are contested within the meaning of the ofac regulations and therefore blocked under the order in which case they would be attachable under tria,or whether they are uncontested and therefore unblocked under the order in which case they would not be attachable under tria 
in resolving that question,the district court unfortunately did not have the benefit of briefing by ofac,which only became involved in this matter on appeal.the court recognized that the order and regulations envision a binary contest of ownership between iran and an asset holder in the united states.rubin ii,d at.the court,however,read tria as inserting the interests of a judgment creditor into that equation.an asset can become contested,the court concluded,where the judgment creditor asserts iran ownership of the property,id.at,notwithstanding the absence of any contest between the actual holder and iran,id.at.the court construction was based,in part,on the fact that,under massachusetts law,a creditor assertion that property held by a putative trustee belongs to the debtor and may be taken by the creditor for application against the debt is fundamental to trustee process.id.at.
on appeal,ofac directs our attention to the plain language of the order and regulation,which require a transfer only as directed by the government of iran.at a.that,ofac argues,is a condition precedent for the rest of what the regulations envision.only if iran directs the transfer of an asset being held in the united states must the property holder transfer the asset,or challenge iran ownership by obtaining an opinion of counsel,see c,which would make the asset contested,at least until ownership is ascertained.in the absence of any claim by iran,however,the asset remains uncontested.id.a.
ofac also notes that tria was drafted against the backdrop of the relevant regulations,not the other way around.the regulations were last amended in,a year before tria was enacted.see.july.we agree with ofac that it was therefore inappropriate for the district court to interpret the regulations in light of the tria.see miles apex marine,d we assume that congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation.that is particularly true given congress explicit reference to the ieepa,and by extension the ofac regulations that implement executive orders,through its use of the phrase blocked assets in tria.tria d a.
because iran has never made a claim to,or directed transfer of,any of the antiquities at issue here,rubin iii,d at rubin ii,d at,ofac argues that the antiquities can not be contested for purposes of.we must defer to ofac interpretation unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation s.chase bank usa,mccoy,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the fact that blocked assets play an important role in the conduct of united states foreign policy may provide a further reason for deference to the views of the executive branch in this case,see of austria altmann,d estate of heiser islamic of iran,d,wl,at,but we need not rely on that alternate ground,because we find ofac interpretation to be a reasonable one.
two additional points bolster ofac view.first,the regulations clearly state that property interests shall not be deemed to be contested solely because they are subject to an attachment,d,and we have some doubt as to whether the district court holding can be squared with that language.
second,we are not convinced that ofac interpretation entirely negate s tria remedy as to judgment creditors of iran.rubin ii,d at.if iran directed a transfer of the antiquities,and the museums contested ownership,the antiquities might qualify as blocked assets within the meaning of tria.furthermore,iran is the subject of numerous sanctions and blocking programs,levin bank of,cv,wl,at,and there may well be other blocked iranian assets that the plaintiffs can reach,including bank assets,see,weinstein,at allowing relatives of victim of terrorism to attach assets of bank melli,an instrumentality of iran weinstein islamic of iran,d,allowing survivors of victim to attach assets held in two bank accounts formerly used by iranian consulates in the united states.the pool of assets available to the plaintiffs does appear to be quite limited,see estate of heiser,wl,at,which is certainly lamentable,but we can not rewrite the statutory or regulatory text.
we therefore defer to ofac reasonable position that an asset can be contested for purposes of only if iran itself has claimed an interest in the asset.see chase bank.at.iran has never made such a claim with regard to the antiquities in the museums possession.thus,even if we assume that those antiquities qualify as assets of iran under section a of tria,they would be uncontested assets that were unblocked in,pursuant to executive order.the order and are thus inapplicable here.because the plaintiffs have relied on no other authority to support their claim that the antiquities are blocked within the meaning of tria,we conclude that the antiquities are not attachable under that statute.tria a,d a.
having reached that conclusion,we need not decide whether the museums belief that iran does not own the antiquities could be reasonable in the absence of a bona fide opinion,in writing,of an attorney licensed to practice within the united states stating that iran does not have title or has only partial title to the asset.c see rubin ii,d at.the museums would have had the duty to obtain such an opinion only if iran had made a demand for the antiquities and the museums wished to contest ownership.see a,a.
iii.conclusion 
while we are mindful of the incident that gave rise to the judgment here and the difficulty the plaintiffs are having collecting on that judgment,the general rule is that foreign sovereign property in the united states is immune from attachment and execution.see.tria carves out a narrow exception to that rule,applicable only to blocked assets,and the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that any of the antiquities in the museums possession fall within that exception.tria therefore does not nullify the antiquities immunity from execution under the fsia,and the plaintiffs have waived any challenge to that immunity on appeal.
thus,while we disagree with the district court judgment that the antiquities qualify as blocked assets under tria,rubin ii,d,we affirm its conclusion that the plaintiffs motion for order of attachment by trustee process should be denied and that the museums motions to dissolve the attachments should be granted.

the plaintiffs also contended that the museums did not have standing to assert the immunity of the antiquities under,because immunity is an affirmative defense,personal to the sovereign.on appeal,they have not challenged the district court rejection of that argument,which was in accord with other courts rulings on the issue.see rubin i,d at see also walters indus.commercial bank of china,cir rubin islamic of iran,cir peterson islamic of iran,cir walker int l holdings of congo,cir.
