the plaintiff,paula konikoff,a real estate appraiser,brought a lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against the prudential insurance company of america prudential.prudential is the manager of two funds,prisa and prisa ii the funds,for which konikoff had provided appraisal services.konikoff asserts in a single cause of action that prudential injured her by disseminating to shareholders and the public at large a report about the funds valuation practices prepared by independent counsel,and a transcript of answers by counsel to questions about the report,both of which defamed her.the district court michael dolinger,magistrate granted summary judgment in favor of prudential.see konikoff prudential ins.of,civ.mbm mhd,wl.
the magistrate judge held that the communications at issue were protected by new york and privileges,neither of which was lost through the actual malice or malice of prudential.in the absence of new york law establishing that the privileges attach to such broad public dissemination of defamatory statements,we decline to rest our holding on those grounds.we affirm,instead,because prudential did not act with fault sufficient to permit liability under the standard promulgated by the new york court of appeals in chapadeau utica.as a matter of law,prudential dissemination of the defamatory material under the circumstances presented was not grossly irresponsible.
background 
because summary judgment was granted against konikoff,we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to her.see van zant klm royal dutch airlines,cir.from through,konikoff worked as a real estate appraiser for the firm of kpmg peat marwick.prudential retained her as the outside appraiser of the office building located at john street in new york city.the building was part of the portfolio of prisa ii,a real estate investment vehicle for pension funds administered by prudential.
in,mark jorgensen,the portfolio manager for prisa and prisa ii,told prudential executives that he believed prudential portfolio managers had deliberately been causing appraisers to overvalue properties held by the funds in order to inflate the funds performance statistics.prudential retained the law firm of howrey simon to investigate jorgensen claims.the firm found them to be unsubstantiated.
jorgensen was then reassigned.in response,he filed suit against prudential alleging that he had been retaliated against as a whistle blower.the lawsuit was widely publicized,as were jorgensen allegations that funds buildings,including john street,had been fraudulently.
prudential,alarmed by an unrelated investigation of its securities units,hired a law firm and an accounting firm to perform independent investigations of the funds valuation practices.the law firm,sonnenschein nath rosenthal sonnenschein,was retained to defend the jorgensen suit and to ascertain all of the facts concerning prudential management and operation of the valuation process of prisa and prisa ii from through.the accounting firm,kenneth leventhal and company,performed a valuation of prisa and prisa ii properties.sonnenschein found no evidence of a scheme to overvalue the prisa and prisa ii portfolios.leventhal determined,however,that of the appraisals it reviewed were unreasonable.it concluded that konikoff appraisal of john street for the fourth quarter of was reasonable,but that two later appraisals of the building performed by konikoff,in and,were unreasonable.
concerned about the allegations in the jorgensen suit,institutional investors threatened to withdraw from prisa and prisa ii and various government agencies considered investigations.in an attempt to respond,prudential made the sonnenschein report available to them.the report was also sent to,inter alia,prospective investors,independent appraisers,and members of the media including the new york times,the wall street journal,the newark,and pensions and investments.
the sonnenschein report concluded 
the evidence as a whole does not support a claim that the overvaluations which leventhal ascribes to various property appraisals during this period were the result of undue influence upon appraisers or of improper appraiser bias.we found no evidence that any appraiser was threatened with removal if he or she failed to report a particular value or failed to move a value in a particular direction.we found no evidence that any appraiser was given special inducement to report a value favored by management.
the substantial body of evidence amassed here,possibly excepting the disputed john street incident a prisa ii property,does not support a conclusion that independent appraisers were compromised or coerced by prudential into reporting biased or false property values.the evidence we found does not support a finding that prudential engaged in any scheme to report knowingly false and overstated property values.
the five independent appraisers those accounting for a substantial majority of the overvaluations claimed by denied any undue pressure or influence upon them.
emphasis added.
konikoff claims that this language the report statement defamed her by possibly excepting the disputed john street incident from its conclusion as to the absence of wrongdoing.doing so,she argues,suggested to the reader that as the appraiser of john street,she may in fact have been compromised or coerced by prudential into reporting a biased or false property value.
the sonnenschein report was first distributed at an april,meeting of prisa and prisa ii investors held by prudential.a few weeks later,prudential held a second meeting at which investors were given the opportunity to ask questions of reid ashinoff,the sonnenschein partner in charge of preparing the report.prudential prepared a transcript of the questions and answers and distributed it to investors.according to the transcript,the following exchange occurred at the meeting 
q.in its report,sonnenschein appeared critical of certain appraisers.does sonnenschein recommend that prudential take any further action with respect to certain appraisers 
no.no hard evidence suggests that the appraisers did not formulate their own conclusions or that the appraisers would not stick to their value conclusions.there is more than one way to view the evidence regarding the different appraisers.consider john street by way of example.peter korpacz was replaced as the appraiser for john street because of differences between his and prudential approaches to that property valuation.korpacz,however,still appraises other prisa properties and,thus,suffered no retribution on the part of prudential with respect to his appraisal of john street.when paula konikoff of kpmg peat marwick replaced korpacz as the outside appraiser for john street,she came up with an appraised value under disputed factual circumstances from which one could argue circumstantially that the value conclusion was not reached independently.all direct evidence,however,indicated that konikoff value conclusion was reached independently.we understand that reasonable minds will differ as to what conclusions should be drawn.note also that two of the appraisers discussed in sonnenschein konikoff and donald longer perform prisa or prisa ii appraisals as a result of decisions made before the reports relating to the jorgensen allegations were issued.
emphasis added.
konikoff argues that this statement with the report statement,collectively the statements is defamatory because it falsely asserts that circumstantial evidence indicated that her appraisal was not reached independently and it implies that konikoff was fired by prudential in connection with questions as to her appraisals when in reality she no longer performed appraisals for the funds because she had left kpmg peat marwick to form her own firm.
procedural history 
konikoff filed her complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york in september.prudential quickly moved to dismiss pursuant to.b for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.the district court michael mukasey,judge denied the motion from the bench.the court found that for an appraiser of real estate,whose reputation and livelihood depend on independent judgment and expertise,a suggestion that a specific valuation was the product of external pressure rather than reasoned deliberation disparages her professional capacities.if that is what the report statement suggested,then it was defamatory,according to the district court.the court also concluded that the statement in the question and answer one could argue circumstantially that konikoff was coerced into overvaluing john attacked konikoff professional abilities because an average listener or reader could conclude from the juxtaposition of ashinoff remarks that konikoff no longer works for prudential because she had failed to render an independent appraisal.the district court held that because both statements were reasonably susceptible of more than one meaning,the trier of fact would be required to determine in what sense the words were used and understood quoting davis ross,cir.finding it impossible to determine whether the potentially defamatory statements were privileged as a matter of law,the district court denied the motion to dismiss.
after agreeing to have the remainder of the proceedings heard by a magistrate judge,the parties engaged in extensive discovery.when it was completed,prudential moved for summary judgment,arguing that the statements were privileged.the magistrate judge agreed,holding in a lengthy opinion and order that under new york law the statements were entitled to protection under both the and qualified privileges.concluding that there was no genuine issue as to a material fact bearing on whether those privileges had been abused and therefore lost by reason of the breadth of the publication of the statements or by prudential malice,the magistrate judge granted summary judgment in prudential favor.
on appeal,konikoff proffers a single argument that although the communications were privileged,there are triable questions of fact as to whether prudential acted with actual malice,whether it published the statements with knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard for their truth,and therefore lost the benefit of the privilege.
konikoff argument is based largely on the technical definition of the word bias as it is employed in the appraisal industry.bias appears in the conclusion of the sonnenschein report addressing whether the various property appraisals during the relevant period were the result of undue influence upon appraisers or of improper appraiser bias emphasis added.konikoff argues that bias is a term of art that means corruption of the appraisal process by submission of a value which is outside a reasonable range and which can not be supported by independent method emphasis added.a valuation is not biased under this definition,even if it is coerced or biased in the ordinary sense of the word,unless it can not be supported by an independent valuation method.konikoff argues that prudential knew her valuations of john street could be independently supported,and that it therefore knowingly or recklessly published a falsehood when it indicated the possible presence of improper appraiser bias.
discussion 
standard of review and choice of law 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.see tenenbaum williams,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c,w here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.an issue of fact is material for these purposes if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.anderson liberty lobby,d.an issue of fact is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.id.
while we may,of course,affirm on the same grounds relied on by the district court if the record permits,i t is beyond cavil that an appellate court may affirm the judgment of the district court on any ground appearing in the record.shumway ups,cir.
the parties have clearly,if tacitly,agreed that new york law governs this litigation.see konikoff,wl,at.particularly in light of the plaintiff residence in new york,the fact that the john street appraisal of which is at the heart of this located in new york,and the circulation of the statements within new york we see no reason not to apply new york law.see celle filipino reporter,cir noting that n o reason of policy warrants a departure from the parties implied during jury trial merrill lynch interfunding,argenti,cir jurisdiction in this case is premised on diversity,and the parties both present arguments based on new york law,the law of the forum state.it is therefore appropriate for this court to apply new york law.
ii.common law privilege 
the magistrate judge granted summary judgment to prudential by applying new york law of qualified or conditional privilege.new york common law affords qualified protection to defamatory communication s made by one person to another upon a subject in which both have an interest.stillman ford.there also appears to be a similar,albeit less developed,privilege covering a speaker communications designed to protect the speaker own legitimate interests.see british am.wirth,cir restatement second of torts the magistrate judge concluded that the statements were covered by both of these privileges.see konikoff,wl,at.
if a defamatory communication is conditionally privileged,the plaintiff may nonetheless prevail by establishing that it was published excessively,it was made to persons with an insufficient interest in it for it to warrant protection,see stukuls state,citing restatement second of torts,or that it was made with malice,see liberman gelstein,
malice sufficient to defeat qualified privilege may be either of the common law or of the constitutional variety.see id.malice mean s spite or ill will,id.at,at,at,and will defeat the privilege only if it is the one and only cause for the publication,id.at,at,at quoting stukuls,at,at,at.constitutional or actual malice means publication with a high degree of awareness of the publication probable falsity or while the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of the publication.id.at,at,at quoting,respectively,garrison louisiana,d and amant thompson,d first and third brackets in original.the critical difference between malice and constitutional malice,then,is that the former focuses on the defendant attitude toward the plaintiff,the latter on the defendant attitude toward the truth.see,price viking penguin,cir,cert.denied,d carson allied news,cir.
the district court concluded that the audience for prudential publication of the statements was appropriate and that the privilege was therefore not abused by excessive publication.see konikoff,wl,at.as for malice,the court first noted that the plaintiff did not seriously contend that the statements were made solely out of spite or ill will,with malice sufficient to defeat the privilege.see id.at.the statements therefore did not lose their privilege on that account.after extensive analysis,the court concluded that as a matter of law,the statements also had not been published with actual malice because prudential neither knew the statements were false nor entertained serious doubts as to their truth at the time it disseminated them.see id.at.
we do not quarrel with the magistrate judge conclusion as to absence of malice.whether the privileges apply in these circumstances,however,presents a close question,one that new york courts have not yet resolved.whereas prudential communicated the statements to the world at large through the media,the and privileges have traditionally been tightly confined to cases in which the alleged defamatory statements were published to an extremely limited,clearly defined group of private persons with an immediate relationship to the speaker,such as a family member or an employer own employees.theodore boutrous,why an expanded privilege should also protect the media,communications lawyer,spring,at citing brown kelly broadcasting,cal d.there is authority in other jurisdictions for expanding the privilege to include communications to the general public through the press.see,richmond southwire,cir employer release to media of report on employee dishonesty protected by privilege under arkansas law citing straitwell national steel,cir privilege applicable in similar circumstances under west virginia law courts applying new york law,however,have not extended the privilege to cover publication of defamatory statements through the media to the world at large 
application of the or privilege in this case could have significant ramifications.it might,for example,be read as extending the privileges to all defensive statements to and through the media made by people and entities that deal with the general public,on the theory that all such communications are either in the legitimate of the speaker or in the common interest of the speaker and the general investing or consuming public.there is no apparent reason for the privilege,expanded in this manner,to be limited to the somewhat unusual circumstances before us the republication by a defendant of statements contained in independent reports generated by outsider lawyers,accountants or other consultants.similar protection would likely follow for defamatory statements generated by defendants themselves in response to assertions of their wrongdoing.
it is also difficult to see why the privilege thus broadly applied would not protect media defendants from liability for statements they publish and broadcast about private persons,since members of the media share with their audience a common interest in the events of the day.see boutrous,supra,at.under that rationale,private plaintiffs seeking to hold members of the press liable for defamatory articles or broadcasts would be required to establish or constitutional malice on the part of the defendant.that result is difficult to square with the prevailing rule established by the new york court of appeals that private plaintiffs must show that the defendant was grossly irresponsible to establish liability.see chapadeau utica.
we do not hold that the privileges are unavailable with respect to communications by and through the media under new york law,nor even that they do not protect prudential in the case at bar.were we forced to reach the issue,we might be inclined to certify to the new york court of appeals the question whether new york privilege covers statements to the general public under the circumstances of this case.we decline to do so,however,because we can affirm the judgment of the district court on different and firmer footing the chapadeau standard.
iii.analysis under chapadeau 
development of the chapadeau standard 
in new york times sullivan,d,the supreme court held that for a public official to succeed in a defamation suit,the first amendment requires that he or she first establish with convincing clarity that the defendant published a defamatory falsehood with actual malice.id.at.the court later extended the same test to defamation suits brought by public figures.see gertz robert welch,d.as we noted above,the supreme court interpreted the term actual malice to require proof that the defendant published a statement with knowledge of its falsity or with a high degree of awareness of the publication probable falsity,garrison,at,or while the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of the publication,amant,at.see also gertz,at.requiring proof of subjective awareness of probable falsity citing amant,at.
in gertz,decided some ten years after sullivan,the supreme court turned to the question of what standard the first amendment required private defamation plaintiffs to meet in defamation cases.the court held,inter alia,that,so long as they do not impose liability without fault,the states may define for themselves the appropriate standard of liability for a publisher or broadcaster of defamatory falsehood injurious to a private individual.at.the vast majority of states subsequently decided that the appropriate standard of liability left for them to decide by gertz is negligence.see turf lawnmower repair,bergen record,collecting state authority.
the new york state court of appeals,however,chose a different path.it held in chapadeau that where the content of the article is arguably within the sphere of legitimate public concern,which is reasonably related to matters warranting public exposition,the party defamed may recover if he or she can establish by a preponderance of the evidence,that the publisher acted in a grossly irresponsible manner without due consideration for the standards of information gathering and dissemination ordinarily followed by responsible parties.chapadeau,at,at,at 
chapadeau itself was about the liability of a newspaper publisher for a statement contained in a published article,and the court invocation of the terms publisher and standards of information gathering and dissemination suggest that the gross irresponsibility standard may apply only to cases against media defendants.courts applying new york law have,however,uniformly applied chapadeau to cases involving defendants,at least where the communication at issue admits of measurement by the chapadeau standard.see,mcgill parker,dep t noting that while a standard which requires a showing that the publisher of defamatory material acted in a grossly irresponsible manner is particularly suited to a media defendant,there is no reason why the constitution should be construed to provide greater protection to the media in defamation suits than to others exercising their freedom of speech citation omitted.other cases to the same effect are collected in the margin the chapadeau standard therefore applies to this suit by private plaintiff konikoff against defendant prudential about the statements by prudential concerning appraisals of property,a subject arguably within the sphere of legitimate public concern.chapadeau,at,at,at.
application of the chapadeau standard 
the situation presented by this appeal is hardly unique.it is not at all uncommon for a business entity to respond to charges of wrongdoing by preparing or commissioning from counsel or other experts a report on the allegations which is then disseminated to its shareholders,employees and the general public 
prudential commissioned the sonnenschein report to investigate the jorgensen allegations.while there is some minor skirmishing between the parties about the extent of prudential involvement in the report preparation,there is no evidence to suggest that in commissioning the report prudential acted other than responsibly.it hired a law firm and a accounting firm to conduct parallel investigations.the magistrate judge found that sonnenschein interviewed approximately current and former prudential employees and outside appraisers,including konikoff,and reviewed documents.konikoff,wl,at.the sonnenschein report contains the uncontradicted statement that sonnenschein received complete and unfettered access to all prudential records and personnel.lewis newsday,dep t holding that newspaper publication of statements from sources who were mere conduits for unverified rumor raised a triable issue of fact as to whether newspaper was grossly irresponsible where it made no effort to substantiate statements and sources made no representation that they had done so.
there also is no indication that prudential was grossly irresponsible in disseminating the statements.on the contrary,it was plainly reasonable for prudential to publish the full text of the independent report it had commissioned and the transcript of the related question and answer session in response to demands by investors and governmental agencies that prudential address the charges.the purpose of releasing these documents was to inform the public about the assessment by independent investigators of the allegations against the company.prudential could hardly have edited the reports to omit information prudential thought to be inaccurate while honoring its goal of publicly disclosing,in haec verba,what sonnenschein thought to be the facts.pr
