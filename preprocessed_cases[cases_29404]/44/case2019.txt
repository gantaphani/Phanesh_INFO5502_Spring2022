discussion 
jurisdiction over this appeal 
denial of summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity is immediately appealable to the extent that the question on appeal is whether the undisputed facts amount to a violation of clearly established law.kelly foti,cir.
ii.qualified immunity and claims under 
we review de novo the denial of summary judgment predicated on qualified immunity.beltran city of el paso,cir.in an interlocutory appeal in which the defendant asserts qualified immunity,to the extent that the district court found that genuine factual disputes exist,we accept the plaintiff version of the facts to the extent reflected by proper summary judgment evidence as true.id.
we use a approach to analyze qualified immunity claims.price roark,cir.first,we consider whether the facts alleged,taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,show that the officer conduct violated a constitutional right.id.citing saucier katz,d.if the plaintiff allegations could make out a constitutional violation,we then ask whether the right was clearly is,whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.id.quoting saucier.at.if,upon viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,reasonable public officials could differ on the lawfulness of the defendant actions,the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity.southard.bd.of criminal justice,cir.this inquiry is an objective one,not dependant on the particular officer subjective beliefs.anderson creighton,d.
false imprisonment under section 
to ultimately prevail on his section false imprisonment claim,haggerty must show that williams did not have probable cause to arrest him.see brown lyford,cir the constitutional torts of false arrest and false imprisonment require a showing of no probable cause.probable cause exists when the totality of the facts and circumstances within a police officer knowledge at the moment of arrest are sufficient for a reasonable person to conclude that the suspect had committed or was committing an offense.glenn city of tyler,cir internal quotation and citation omitted.therefore,williams is entitled to qualified immunity if a reasonable officer in his position could have believed that,in light of the totality of the facts and circumstances of which williams was aware,there was a fair probability that haggerty had committed or was committing an offense.see see also united states watson,cir explaining that probable cause fair probability requires more than a bare suspicion but less than a preponderance of evidence.even law enforcement officials who reasonably but mistakenly conclude that probable cause is present are entitled to immunity.mendenhall riser,cir emphasis added internal quotation and citation omitted see also anderson creighton,d it is inevitable that law enforcement officials will in some cases reasonably but mistakenly conclude that probable cause is present,and we have indicated that in such cases those other officials who act in ways they reasonably believe to be not be held personally liable.in sum,haggerty must clear a significant hurdle to defeat william qualified immunity.brown,at.t here must not even arguably be probable cause for the arrest for immunity to be lost.id.internal quotation and citation omitted.
haggerty was arrested for interference with the duties of a public servant.see.penal code ann.a.a person commits an offense if the person with criminal negligence interrupts,disrupts,impedes,or otherwise interferes with a peace officer while the peace officer is performing a duty id.however,it is a defense that the alleged interruption,disruption,impediment or interference consisted of speech only.d.
viewing the facts in the light most favorable to haggerty and based on the totality of the circumstances within williams knowledge,a reasonable officer in williams position could have believed with fair probability that haggerty had interfered with his duties.haggerty claimed in his affidavit that on july,kendrick randolph,a student from haggerty group who allegedly had just been attacked by eight males,according to haggerty response to the motion for summary judgment in the cafeteria of texas southern university tsu,was out of control and was trying to fight all those that had jumped on him.when haggerty went outside,he saw williams handcuffing randolph he told williams not to handcuff randolph and that he was randolph teacher haggerty acknowledges that williams told him to step back or get away and if he did he would be put under arrest.haggerty claims to have stepped back without touching williams.
williams then took randolph back into the tsu student center.randolph saw some of the individuals who had attacked him and began pulling away from williams to again combat those individuals.when haggerty went back into the student center,he saw williams slam randolph into a wall.haggerty claims that he then took a few steps forward,but never got closer than feet to williams and said do do that,do slam that boy into the wall and do manhandle that juvenile.haggerty states that he was not cursing,but was speaking up loudly.he also observed many young children and others seeing what was going on.williams then said something that haggerty can not recall,and the next thing i haggerty recall is several other officers not williams tackled haggerty.
thus,viewing the totality of circumstances in the light most favorable to haggerty,but from the perspective of a reasonable officer in williams position,we have police called because haggerty concluded he and tsu staff could not handle the matter see note,infra,an randolph who was occupying williams efforts and attention,a nearby group of some eight alleged attackers,an approaching person in relative proximity to williams haggerty who had previously been told to step back and that he would be arrested if he did loudly and telling williams to stop,and a gathering crowd.a reasonable officer in williams position could have believed that the situation was tense and dangerous,haggerty actions were serving to stir up the potentially explosive situation and there was a fair probability that haggerty actions constituted interference with his duties.
further,while haggerty relevant actions included speech,a reasonable officer could have believed that they were not limited to speech haggerty stepped forward toward williams after having previously been warned to not interfere and was within relative proximity to feet away.under the circumstances,it is not unreasonable that an officer could have believed that this constituted more than speech only and that the statutory defense of section d was not established.as law enforcement officials who reasonably but mistakenly conclude that probable cause is present are entitled to immunity,mendenhall,at internal quotations and citations omitted,it is not determinative that haggerty interruption,disruption,impediment or interference could ultimately be determined to have been by speech only and that williams probable cause judgment may have been wrong.saucier katz,d.we conclude that williams is entitled to qualified immunity from haggerty false imprisonment claim under section.
malicious prosecution under section 
subsequent to the district court denial of williams summary judgment,and to when the briefs in this appeal were filed,we held that malicious prosecution standing alone is no violation of the unit
