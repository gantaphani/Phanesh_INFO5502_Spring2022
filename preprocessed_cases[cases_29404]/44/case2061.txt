kcs,robinson,everett,duett,and mdot filed a notice of removal on june.city of forest filed a joinder of removal,dated june.in both the notice of removal and joinder of removal,defendants claimed that the federal district court for the southern district of mississippi,jackson division,had subject matter jurisdiction over mckee lawsuit,because mckee could not state a viable claim against any of the defendants robinson,everett,duett,mdot,and the city of forest.
mckee responded to defendants notice and joinder of removal with a motion to remand based upon two contentions.the first contention,that defendants removal of the case was untimely,is irrelevant for purposes of this appeal and has already been addressed and rejected by a prior panel of this circuit in an unpublished per curiam opinion.mckee.city,cir table.mckee second contention was that she could state a viable claim against the defendants,this contention is relevant for this appeal as it relates to mckee claims against the train crew.
in count i of her complaint,mckee alleged that defendants robinson,everett,and duett were careless,reckless,and negligent in the following respects defendants operated the train at an excessive rate of speed defendants failed to keep a reasonable and proper lookout for approaching motorists at the crossing defendants failed to have the train under reasonable and proper control and defendants failed to blow the train whistle or horn,or ring the bell within yards of the crossing,and failed to blow the train horn continuously in order to warn shepard and mckee of the train crossing.
in response to mckee motion to remand,kcs submitted evidence purporting to negate the viability of each of the allegations in mckee complaint.kcs submitted evidence that the train was operated within the federally determined speed limit,that according to the train crew they maintained a proper lookout,did everything required by law to avoid the collision,and properly sounded the horn.mckee did not respond to kcs evidence with any evidence to support her allegations but only argued that defendants did not carry their burden of proving fraudulent joinder because her claims against the train crew were properly alleged and dependent on factual determinations to be made by a jury.
the district court disagreed with mckee and found that all of mckee causes of action against the defendants were either not viable or preempted.therefore,the district court found that the defendants were fraudulently joined and denied the motion to remand and subsequently dismissed the defendants.
on april,mckee filed a motion to correct filings,amend,for reconsideration,and for relief from,and supplemental motion to remand hereinafter called motion to reconsider.in support of her motion to reconsider,mckee submitted her own affidavit claiming that she did not hear the train horn immediately prior to the train collision with shepard van.after considering mckee motion to reconsider,the district court denied the motion.

on mckee first appeal,a panel of this court upheld the district court rulings and dismissal of the city of forest and mdot.because mckee had failed to obtain a rule b certification or a b certification from the district court with respect to defendants robinson,everett,and duett,the panel held that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal of the dismissal of these defendants.
