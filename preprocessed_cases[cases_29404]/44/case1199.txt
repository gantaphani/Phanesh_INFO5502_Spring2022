this is the third appeal in this contribution claim under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of cercla,stat.after the second appeal was decided,defendant mead moved for judgment for failure to state a claim or for lack of jurisdiction.the district court denied the motions,but certified a controlling question of law under b raising the issue of whether the effect of cooper indus.aviall,d,is to deny jurisdiction over plaintiff beazer contribution claims under f of cercla,f also implicated is the denial of mead motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under f.
we conclude that the district court has jurisdiction.we will also affirm the denial of the motion for judgment on the pleadings and will remand for further proceedings.
we will summarize the progress of this litigation to the extent that it is pertinent to the pending appeal.beazer predecessor in title purchased property previously owned by mead.after federal and state investigations revealed the existence of hazardous wastes at the site,beazer entered into a administrative order on consent with the united states environmental protection agency under the resource conservation and recovery act of rcra,et.after mead declined to participate in the investigation and cleanup of the site,beazer began a lengthy and continuing remediation process.
in early,beazer filed a complaint against mead seeking contribution for investigation and cleanup costs under a and f of cercla,a,f,as well as asserting various state and common law claims.mead counterclaimed based on an indemnity provision in the original purchase agreement.
the district court granted summary judgment to mead,but on appeal we reversed,holding that the purchase agreement did not require indemnification.beazer east,mead,cir beazer i.the case was remanded so that the district court could consider both parties contribution claims,and determine the proper apportionment of cercla liability.id.at.
on remand,mead argued,inter alia,that beazer could not recover most of its costs under f because they were incurred under the rcra rather than cercla.moreover,the costs could not be obtained under a because they were not voluntarily incurred.
in,the district court determined that beazer and f claims were duplicative.it dismissed the claim,stating,beazer has failed to identify any additional bases for recovery or damages under a claim which would not be included in a final allocation of the parties contribution claims under f f.
the district court also concluded,t o the extent that the motion seeks to preclude beazer from advancing its f action on the bases that beazer response costs were incurred on a voluntary nature or were incurred under the resource conservation recovery act,et,the motion is likewise denied.
the court then referred the case to a magistrate judge to allocate costs between mead and beazer.at that time,neither of the parties sought reconsideration of the district court rulings on the viability of the and f claims.
after conclusion of the magistrate allocation proceedings,the district judge modified the magistrate recommendations and,following a bench trial,assessed mead with and beazer with liability.in august,the court entered judgment against mead in the amount of plus interest.the court also entered a declaratory judgment in october requiring mead to pay of beazer continuing costs.
mead appealed,contending that in the absence of its consent the magistrate judge lacked authority to conduct a trial.mead did not challenge its liability for contribution under f,nor did beazer discuss whether it had a claim for contribution under.
in june,this court decided that the magistrate judge lacked authority to conduct the allocation proceeding.beazer east,mead,cir beazer ii.we remanded for a new equitable allocation proceeding before the district judge,and commented on factors to be considered in the apportionment,but made no ruling on the liability of the parties.id.at.
in december,after beazer ii was argued,the supreme court decided cooper.essentially,that case held that a party who has not been sued under or a can not obtain contribution under f from other liable parties.at.
in june,we filed the opinion in beazer ii and returned the case to the district court.six months later,in january,mead filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings,asserting that beazer could not maintain its claim for contribution pursuant to f because of the cooper decision.in a later filing,mead argued that cooper deprived the district court of jurisdiction because beazer had not been sued under or.
the district court denied the motion,ruling that the requirement for a suit under or was an element of a claim for relief under f and not a jurisdictional threshold.the court also noted that mead had waived its defense to the f claim by failing to raise the issue on its appeal in beazer ii.
mead then filed this interlocutory appeal.after it was docketed and the briefs were filed,but before oral argument,the supreme court decided united states atlantic research,d,holding that a potentially responsible party prp may recover against another prp for cleanup costs under a id.at.
cercla is a strict liability statute granting the president broad authority to compel private parties and governmental bodies to clean up contaminated sites and to require everyone who is potentially responsible for contamination to contribute to the costs of cleanup.united states bestfoods,d emphasis and quotation omitted.as originally enacted,the statute provided for recovery under,which listed four categories of parties,including current and past owners of a facility,who were potentially responsible for cleanup costs.see a.
section provided that prps were liable for costs incurred by the federal and state governments,a a,as well as for any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan.a b.section,however,proved to be an inadequate means for allocating cleanup costs among the various prps.disputes arose over whether a private party that voluntarily incurred cleanup expenses or had been sued by other prps could recover from other prps.
litigation about the scope of ultimately led congress to amend cercla by adding f to provide a right to contribution.see superfund amendments and reauthorization act of sara,stat.under f,a ny person may seek contribution from any other person who is liable or potentially liable under section a,during or following any civil actions under section of this title or under section a.f.further,i n resolving contribution claims,the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate.id 
section,however,raised questions over the interplay between f and a.see,atlantic research.at.courts struggled to determine whether f allowed a prp to seek contribution from other prps for voluntary cleanup costs and whether it could maintain a action under for joint and several liability against other prps.see dupont de nemours united states,cir.
in,the supreme court held that a private party who has not been sued under or a may not obtain contribution under f from other liable parties.cooper,at.the court,however,did not decide whether a prp may pursue a a action against other prps for joint and several liability,id.at,and whether a prp has an implied right to contribution under.id.at.
atlantic research answered the question left open by cooper,holding that the plain language of a subparagraph b authorizes actions by any private party,including prps.at.the court described the interplay between a and f as follows section f authorizes a contribution action to prps with common liability stemming from an action instituted under or a.and a permits cost recovery as distinct from contribution by a private party that has itself incurred cleanup costs.id.at.
mead contends that because the claim was dismissed in by the district court,beazer only remaining means of recovery is under f,a claim that is fatally flawed in light of cooper.mead argues that because beazer has not been sued under or a it may not obtain contribution
