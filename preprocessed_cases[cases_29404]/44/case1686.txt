decedent robert brown took his own life while detained by county officials on a probation violation.appellant james brown,the decedent father and the administrator of his estate,brought state tort claims and federal constitutional claims pursuant to against several officials who allegedly had custody of decedent either prior to or at the time of brown suicide.the magistrate judge granted judgment as a matter of law to the officials.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
decedent robert brown was taken into custody pursuant to an arrest warrant issued by nancy svec,an employee of the virginia beach probation and parole department and brown probation officer.the warrant was issued because brown had failed a random urinalysis drug test,and had admitted during a telephone conversation with svec that he was taking pills a day and had attempted suicide the week prior by overdosing on unspecified pills.this information led svec to conclude that brown posed a danger to his parents and others.
svec accompanied virginia beach police officer switzer to brown parents home to effectuate the arrest.pursuant to a search,svec and switzer found pills on brown person,in his bedroom,and in his car.they then transported brown to the virginia beach general jail for processing on a probation violation.
when they arrived at the jail,svec had a short conversation with james ogden,the supervisor of central processing for the jail.svec testified at trial that she informed ogden that brown was suicidal,psychotic,and subject to volatile withdrawal and had attempted suicide the week before.svec also conveyed to ogden that her primary concern was that brown could become volatile and possibly attack people as he withdrew from drugs.specifically,svec testified during her of which were read verbatim at trial including this passage that she believed she had also told ogden that brown had previously attacked a staff member while in detox.ogden testified,by contrast,that svec never informed him that brown was suicidal,only that he has violent episodes while coming off of prescription drugs.ogden subsequently placed brown on medical watch,which consisted of continuous video surveillance of his cell,
three days following his arrival at virginia beach general jail,brown hung himself in his cell by his shoe laces.although brown cell was under video surveillance,gwen officer responsible that day for monitoring brown cell as well as others by way of small video not notice that brown had hung himself until after the code was called by someone else.the undisputed medical testimony at trial established that brown had been deprived of oxygen for at least four minutes.as a result,brown was hospitalized and placed on a ventilator.he died seven days later.
appellant james brown,decedent father and the administrator of his estate,filed a lawsuit against svec,ogden,and harris collectively the appellees in the eastern district of virginia the first count of the amended complaint asserted a section action against each of the appellees,alleging that they were deliberately indifferent to brown serious medical needs in contravention of the eighth amendment.in count ii,appellant alleged that the appellees were grossly negligent under state law in failing to supervise the decedent condition and in generally completely abdicating their responsibilities to the decedent.
the parties consented to have the case tried before a magistrate judge.see c.following a full trial on the merits,the appellees filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law.the magistrate judge granted the motion,and entered judgment for the appellees on all claims.the magistrate judge subsequently denied appellant motion for reconsideration and for a new trial.
the first issue on appeal is whether brown suicide barred the representative of his estate from recovering on any derivative state claims.appellant brought wrongful death actions against svec and ogden,and a separate gross negligence claim against harris.reviewing the grant of judgment as a matter of law de novo,see brice nkaru,cir,we agree with the magistrate judge that,as a matter of law,appellant evidence failed to establish that brown was of unsound mind when he took his own life.
in granting judgment as a matter of law on those claims,the magistrate judge held that brown actions constituted common law suicide,and that any cause of action resulting from the suicide,an immoral and illegal act under virginia law,was barred.under virginia law,i t is well settled that,as a general rule,a party who consents to and participates in an immoral or illegal act can not recover damages from other participants for the consequence of that act.wackwitz roy.as a result,the virginia supreme court held in wackwitz that,because suicide is a common law crime,it precludes recovery for injuries sustained as a result of that act.id.at.
appellant state claims seek damages for injuries resulting from brown taking of his own life and consequentially are barred under wackwitz if brown committed common law suicide.to commit suicide at common law,a person must take his own life be of years of discretion and be of sound mind.see id.at.a person is of sound mind if competent and sane.see hill nicodemus,cir applying virginia law.it is undisputed that brown was not a minor when he took his own life therefore,unless brown was incompetent or insane at the time,appellant state claims are barred.
appellant does not dispute that suicide constitutes a per se bar to recovery,but rather argues that there was sufficient evidence in the record for the jury to conclude that brown was of unsound mind.appellant relied exclusively on the testimony of benjamin carey to establish that fact at trial.while carey testified that brown suffered from bipolar disorder,we agree with the magistrate judge that his testimony was insufficient to create a jury question regarding brown competency or sanity for two reasons.
first,carey assessed brown mental condition at a discrete point in time,more than three months prior to brown death.carey expressed no view about whether brown was insane or incompetent at the time he took his own life.indeed,appellant failed to proffer any contemporaneous assessment of brown mental condition.at best,therefore,carey testimony,and by extension appellant evidence,establishes only that brown may have been insane or incompetent at a given point in time more than three months prior to his death.wackwitz and hill suggest,however,that a decedent mental soundness must be measured at the time of the act.see hill,at noting that insanity is measured at a given time wackwitz,at holding that a wrongful death claim arising out of a suicide survived a motion to dismiss because the plaintiff alleged that her decedent was of unsound mind when he killed himself.as a result,carey testimony,standing alone,is simply insufficient to overcome the legal presumption that brown was sane when he took his own life.see hill,at stating that there is a presumption that a person is sane under virginia law.
second,carey testimony does not even prove that brown was incompetent or insane at the time carey evaluated him.under virginia law,t he term insane refers to one who is,at a given time,an idiot,lunatic,non compos mentis or deranged.hill,at citing nelms nelms.even reading carey testimony in a light most favorable to appellant,brown bipolar disorder simply did not render him legally insane.specifically,carey testified that 
t here was no evidence that brown was psychotic or had a thought disorder.that he did not appear to have suicidal thinking,any suicidal intent or suicide plan.i thought his memory was grossly intact.he had limited insight,and his judgment was considered fair.so that was the mental status examination.
emphases added.in addition,carey opined that people with bipolar disorder can work in the job force and carry on ordinary life activities.
of particular significance is carey opinion that brown did not suffer from a thought disorder and that his judgment was fair.carey clearly believed that people suffering from bipolar disorder can be sane and competent and,in particular,that brown could function in society.
