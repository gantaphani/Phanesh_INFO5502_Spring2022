in this case,an insurer sought a declaratory judgment that it was required to indemnify its insured for no more than percent of a state court judgment because it had covered its insured for no more than percent of the time in which the state court plaintiff was exposed to lead poisoning.the district court agreed that the insurer was responsible for only a portion of the judgment,notwithstanding the fact that its insured was held jointly and severally liable for the entire judgment in the underlying state proceeding.the state plaintiff and defendant in the federal declaratory action appeals,and we affirm in part and reverse in part.the principle underlying our decision is a straightforward one an insurance company can not be held liable for periods of risk it never contracted to cover.
from her birth on january,until,lakia roberts resided at a house on east preston street in baltimore,maryland.in september,when she was months old,roberts was diagnosed with lead poisoning.a test indicated that she had an elevated blood lead level of micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood.she continued to exhibit elevated blood lead levels until august.
on february,roberts filed a complaint in maryland state court against attsgood realty company alleging that the injuries she sustained from the lead poisoning were the result of its negligent management of the east preston street property.attsgood had owned,leased,and managed the property from roberts birth until november,when it had sold the property to gordon gondrezick.
attsgood then requested defense and indemnification from pennsylvania national mutual casualty insurance company penn national under the terms of its insurance contract.in,penn national had issued a liability insurance policy to attsgood covering the period from january,to january.the policy was later renewed to extend coverage to january.according to the terms of the contract,penn national promised attsgood that it would provide liability insurance for premises you own,rent or occupy,including east preston street.from roberts birth in january until this coverage began in january,attsgood lacked liability insurance for the east preston street property.
under the contract,penn national promised to pay those sums that attsgood becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies as well as defend any suit seeking those damages.this guarantee was in turn qualified by a provision stating that this insurance applies to bodily injury and property damage only if the bodily injury or property damage occurs during the policy period.the contract also made clear that attsgood rights and duties under this policy may not be transferred without penn national written consent except in the case of death of an individual n amed i nsured.
in accordance with the policy,penn national agreed to defend attsgood subject to a reservation of its rights.attsgood then filed a third party complaint against gondrezick seeking contribution and indemnification in the event that roberts prevailed.after gondrezick failed to appear or otherwise defend himself,the maryland court entered an order of default against him in favor of attsgood.
following discovery,the state case went to trial on may,on counts of negligence and unfair trade practices.to prove the property owners liability,roberts mother and her expert witness provided testimony indicating that roberts had been exposed to lead poisoning at the east preston street property since her infancy and that this exposure had resulted in permanent brain damage.attsgood in turn challenged the contention that the presence of lead at its property was the actual source of roberts injuries.
the trial ended on may.the jury returned a verdict in favor of roberts for,which was reduced to following an application of maryland noneconomic damages cap.it is undisputed that attsgood and gondrezick are jointly and severally liable for this amount.
on october,penn national filed a declaratory judgment action against attsgood and roberts in federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.the insurer sought a determination that it was obligated to indemnify attsgood for no more than percent of the total judgment,or.penn national filed a motion for default judgment against attsgood after it failed to respond.penn national also filed a motion for summary judgment against roberts arguing that it should be liable for only months of the entire period of roberts exposure to the risk of lead poisoning.it calculated that while it had insured attsgood for the months from january to january,attsgood had sold the property to gondrezick in november,thereby resulting in a total of months of coverage.
roberts saw the matter differently.she argued that penn national was responsible for paying the entire judgment in light of the joint and several liability of its insured.she also contended that even if the district court decided to allocate liability,virtually all of her lead exposure occurred during penn national two policy periods,beginning with the discovery of her elevated blood lead level in september.
the district court largely agreed with penn national.relying on mayor city council of baltimore utica mutual insurance,the court observed that in lead paint or continuous trigger cases such as this,maryland courts determine an insurer liability through a allocation by time on the risk.applying this method of allocation to the judgment,the district court determined that the evidence in the underlying litigation established that roberts was first exposed to lead paint when she was born on january.it then used august,the month of roberts final elevated blood lead level,as the point for her period of exposure.based on these dates,the district court concluded that roberts had been exposed to lead poisoning from january,to august,for a total of full months.
the district court then calculated penn national period of coverage.it concluded that penn national provided insurance to attsgood from january,to january,for a total of months.the court rejected penn national argument that its period of coverage should be reduced to months because attsgood had sold the property to gondrezick on november,concluding that while under the terms of the insurance contract penn national may be correct,the record is entirely barren of facts showing that penn national coverage in fact was terminated.
in its allocation of liability,the district court used the months of coverage as the numerator and the months of exposure to lead poisoning as the denominator to conclude that penn national was responsible for,or approximately percent,of the judgment.it then found that penn national is liable to roberts for x,but no more.
both roberts and penn national appeal from the district court judgment.on appeal,roberts advances two main arguments.she first contends that the district court erred in allocating penn national liability on a pro rata basis.she next argues that even if pro rata allocation was appropriate,the district court should have used the date of her first elevated blood lead level rather than her date of birth to calculate her period of exposure.for its part,penn national challenges the district court refusal to reduce its period of coverage to months.
we review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.because jurisdiction here was founded on diversity of citizenship,we apply the same substantive law that a court in maryland,the forum state,would apply if it were deciding this case.see klaxon stentor.the parties do not dispute that a maryland court would apply its own substantive law to the matter before us.
applying maryland law,we affirm the district court judgment with respect to roberts two arguments.with respect to the matter raised on penn national,however,we reverse.we address these three issues in turn.
roberts first challenges the district court decision to allocate penn national liability on a pro rata basis.although penn national insured attsgood for only part of the time in which she was exposed to lead poisoning,roberts believes it should be on the hook for the entire judgment.the thrust of her argument is that penn national contracted to cover the risk of any judgment against attsgood for bodily injury,regardless of when it occurred,by promising to pay those sums that attsgood becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury.emphasis added.in other words,the contingency insured against was not injury to attsgood own person or property,but attsgood risk of liability to another for personal or property injury.see sentinel ins.first ins.of haw,haw emphasis in original.thus,roberts contends,when attsgood was held jointly and severally liable for in damages,penn national became contractually bound to pay the entire judgment.despite its seeming simplicity,this claim suffers from three major problems.
the first problem with roberts position is that it ignores the plain language of the insurance contract.but o ur primary task in interpreting an insurance policy,as with any contract,is to apply the terms of the contract itself.cole state farm mut.ins.thus we must look first to the contract language employed by the parties to determine the scope and limitations of the insurance coverage.id.the terms of penn national insurance contract plainly indicate that it never agreed to cover the risk of the entire state judgment.
penn national did not contract to pay those sums that attsgood becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury without qualification.rather,it contracted to pay those sums that attsgood becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury to which this insurance applies.emphasis added.the contract in turn makes clear that t his insurance applies to bodily injury and property damage only if t he bodily injury or property damage occurs during the policy period.emphasis added.by its own terms,the contract does not cover damages attsgood became legally obligated to pay for injuries that occurred outside of the policy period.that fact is fatal to roberts claim that penn national should be held liable for injuries that began before and continued after its period of coverage.c ollecting all the indemnity from a particular policy for an injury spanning multiple policy periods is not consistent with the language of the policies providing indemnification for liability that resulted from an accident or occurrence during the policy period.mayor city council of baltimore utica mut.ins,emphasis in original citation omitted.
not only was penn national coverage limited to the policy period,it was also restricted to premises that attsgood own ed,rent ed or occup ied.this language precludes us from holding penn national liable for injuries that occurred when gondrezick,and not attsgood,owned the house at east preston street.in seeking to impose the entire judgment on penn national,roberts would have us turn a blind eye to these terms and hold an insurance company liable for risks for which it never contracted and for which it never received premiums.we decline to do so.
in addition to ignoring contractual language,roberts position conflicts with maryland law.in lead paint or continuous trigger cases such as this one,maryland courts engage in a pro rata by allocation of liability.see.cas.hanson,quoting riley united servs.auto.ass n,see also in re wallace gale,f d,cir holding that after utica mutual,the allocation method is correct under maryland law.under this method of allocation,e ach insurer is liable for that period of time it was on the risk compared to the entire period during which damages occurred and losses will be prorated to the insured for periods during which it was uninsured.utica mutual,at emphasis in original citation omitted see also in re wallace gale,at the allocation of risk to the insured is for periods for which there is no insurance in force or for which there is no coverage by an insurance policy which is in force.these cases prohibit us from holding penn national liable for periods during which it did not provide coverage to attsgood.
while roberts concedes that maryland courts engage in pro rata allocation,she contends that this method is inappropriate here.according to roberts,maryland courts use the pro rata approach only when allocating liability across multiple policy periods of a single insured.in support of this position,she points out that none of the previously cited maryland cases involved more than one insured and argues that extending the pro rata approach to situations involving multiple tortfeasors here attsgood and gondrezick would allow an insurance company to do an end run around the joint and several liability of its policyholder.
like the district court,we find roberts proposed limitation entirely unpersuasive.there is nothing in maryland law to indicate it would abandon the pro rata approach and commitment to contractual language when multiple tortfeasors are involved.and those courts that have considered roberts argument have rejected it.other jurisdictions that employ the pro rata approach do not suddenly change their method of allocation depending on how many tortfeasors are involved.see ins.of am.forty eight insulations,cir holding that when allocating the cost of indemnification e ach insurer is liable for its pro rata share even if an insured is found to be jointly and severally liable outboard marine liberty mut.ins,rejecting the novel proposition that,because an insured liability is joint and several,the liability of the excess insurers can not be apportioned on a pro rata basis emphasis in original.and even those jurisdictions that take a different approach recognize that the allocation of contractual liability can not hinge on tort concepts.see,armstrong world,aetna cas.sur,d,the contractual obligations of insurers to a single are separate and distinct from the tort liability of multiple asbestos manufacturers to an asbestos claimant.no matter what the tort liability of an asbestos manufacturer whether joint and several,proportionate to fault or proportionate to market share the indemnity obligations of its insurers do not change.
the reason why roberts proposed distinction has failed to gain traction should be evident.the rationale behind the pro rata approach bears no relation to the amount of tortfeasors in a particular case.at the level of greatest generality,the pro rata method is based on the fact that a n insured purchases an insurance policy to indemnify it against injuries occurring within the policy period,not injuries occurring outside that period.olin ins.of,cir.this explains why the pro rata approach not only allocates liability across multiple insurers of a single tortfeasor,but also accommodates the need to hold liable those businesses that chose not to purchase insurance or coverage by allocating liability to them for periods during which they were uninsured.see utica mutual,at.pro rata allocation of liability is thus concerned with the length of a policy period,not the number of tortfeasors.
ultimately,roberts proposed distinction stems not from a plausible approach to pro rata allocation,but from a conflation of tort and contract law.according to roberts,the district court decision to apply the pro rata approach here effectively destroys the concept of joint and several liability.appellant br.at.but as the district court noted,this argument misses the point because t he law that applies to joint and several liability is entirely different,and separate and apart,from maryland allocation law.
no one disputes that attsgood and gondrezick are jointly and severally liable and that each is responsible for the entire judgment under longstanding principles of tort law.see cooper bikle.the question before us,however,is not whether attsgood is liable for the entire judgment,but whether penn national is.and that question can be answered only by reference to the insurance contract,which necessarily involves the application of contract law.consequently,fears of end runs around the tort doctrine of joint and several liability are not germane to our analysis.see outboard marine,at holding that because insurance coverage disputes are governed by contract law w e c
