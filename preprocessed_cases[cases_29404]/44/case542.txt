paul fire marine insurance company appeals from the entry of judgment as a matter of law on its claims that defendants james ellis and ellis ellis engaged in common law fraud,unfair trade practices as proscribed by.laws ch,and statutory fraud in violation of of the massachusetts workers compensation statute during ellis representation of david formoso in pursuing a claim for workers compensation benefits from paul.although the issue of paul burden of proving the element of damages in its fraud claim presents some complexity because of the workers compensation context,we nonetheless agree with paul that the trial court erred in granting defendants motions for judgment as a matter of law.consequently,we vacate the judgment of the district court.
we recite the evidence presented at the trial in some detail because the outcome of this appeal turns,in part,upon the proper construction of that evidence.since,james ellis has been an attorney specializing in workers compensation law.at the time of the events underlying this case,he was a partner with his brother in the firm of ellis ellis,where he managed the workers compensation department.the present case arises from ellis representation of one person who was employed at two different jobs under two different names denis milan and david formoso.during,this individual,while maintaining his separate identities,had two injuries,one at each place of employment.to reduce some of the inevitable confusion regarding these dual identities,we will refer to denis milan only when discussing his claim for the first accident at the victory button company.because it appears uncontradicted that david formoso is the correct name of this individual,we will use that name in all other instances.
the first accident occurred on march,at the victory button company.denis milan,a worker at the factory,claimed an injury to his lower back after he reached up to pull some hangers.doctors placed that injury at the location.milan sought workers compensation benefits for this injury and filed a claim with victory button insurer,cigna insurance company.the second accident occurred approximately eight months after the first,on november,at the westford regency hotel.david formoso,who worked as a dishwasher at the hotel,claimed to have injured his back during a fall.doctors examining formoso determined that this injury was also at the location in his lower back.formoso also sought benefits for this alleged injury,submitting a workers compensation claim to the massachusetts department of industrial accidents on december.this claim was referred to paul,westford regency insurer.ellis represented formoso in both claims.
although formoso was claiming a causal relationship between his back injury and the fall at the westford regency hotel,the prior accident at the victory button its injury to the same part of the never disclosed to paul.not surprisingly,the parties dispute the significance of this nondisclosure.ellis,who testified as a hostile witness during paul,claimed ignorance of the concealed identity until five months after the westford regency hotel accident.he did not disclose this dual identity because of his belief that formoso was still entitled to benefits and his concern that disclosure would jeopardize formoso ability to remain in this country paul took a darker view of ellis conduct,describing a fraudulent scheme to obtain workers compensation benefits.we,of course,must view the evidence in the light most favorable to paul because of the standard of review applicable to this appeal.so viewed,the evidence discloses a fraudulent scheme to obtain workers compensation benefits.
formoso deceit 
three months after the victory button company accident,milan began a course of treatment for his injury.his prognosis at that time was poor,with at least one of his doctors indicating that milan would suffer a total disability unless and until surgery was performed.that surgery never occurred.indeed,milan doctors were unanimous in concluding that he had suffered a disabling injury that prevented him,at least temporarily,from returning to work.these doctors,however,were apparently never told that during the same period that they concluded he could not work,milan was working,as formoso,at the westford regency hotel as a dishwasher moreover,formoso took another job at malu construction in the fall of,again while still under a diagnosis of disability from his doctors.thus,during the time when milan was diagnosed as totally disabled,formoso was in fact performing two other jobs.in other words,the injury to milan,though serious enough to keep milan from working,had no corresponding effect on formoso ability to work.
indeed,formoso apparently only lost his ability to work when he suffered an accident as formoso at the westford regency hotel.nonetheless,there was a basis in the evidence for questioning whether that accident actually resulted in any injury.robert bates,a chiropractor,treated milan from august,to april,three times a week.though this time period included the westford regency hotel accident on november,therefore should have included some loss of function corresponding to that.bates testified that milan showed a fairly consistent improvement in condition.there were waxes and waning of symptoms,in other words,be a little better,a little worse but overall he got a little bit better through the treatment.
moreover,bates put milan through a series of circuit training exercises designed to improve muscle strength in his back.bates kept logs of these exercises.these logs showed that between november and december,and again between december,and february,milan increased the weights he used on these machines as well as the number of repetitions he performed.in contrast,during the same period,formoso was seen by param singh on november,roland caron on december,and bernard stone on february.singh reported that formoso was experiencing low back pain that was moderate to severe in intensity,constant in nature,aggravated by movements of the spine,by prolonged ambulation,prolonged standing,or any physical exertion.caron saw surgery as an option and opined that formoso is totally disabled at the present time with a guarded prognosis.stone confirmed the reports of low back pain and recommended surgery as a realistic option because formoso symptoms were not improving.bates,however,considered milan progress on the circuit training exercises from november,to february,as indicative of a positive result.
this evidence reveals a striking disjunction during the same time frame between milan improving conditions and formoso supposedly severe back problem.indeed,the medical histories of milan and formoso are like those of two different people.when milan suffered a debilitating injury,milan needed to stop work while formoso kept working.likewise,when formoso fell at the hotel,he exhibited severe symptoms while milan showed steady progress in his rehabilitation.it is undisputed,however,that milan and formoso are the same person.what reconciles the contradictions is a scheme to defraud paul.before the accident at the hotel,formoso his treatment as the objective indicators of injury,such as,would be consistent with a lower back injury like the one he had already suffered at the victory button company he knew the symptoms the doctors would expect from that injury.to fabricate a claim for workers compensation benefits he only needed an accident at the hotel that he could claim resulted in symptoms identical to those he was already experiencing because of his prior injury.he could then convince doctors that there was a causal connection between his symptoms and that accident by claiming to have no prior back injuries.whether the accident at the hotel was a mere fortuity or was manufactured makes no difference.the jury could have concluded that formoso recognized his opportunity and,using the symptoms from his victory button company injury,proceeded to claim benefits from paul despite the absence of any actual injury during the fall at the hotel.
ellis complicity in formoso deceit 
ellis representation of milan began at some point after the victory button accident and continued until july of when that claim was finally settled.ellis representation of formoso began at least in november of and continued until july of ellis claimed that he did not learn that his office was representing one person with different claims under two different names until march,when formoso came into his office and confessed to his dual identity.there was contrary evidence,however.there was testimony that ellis himself admitted in a june hearing on formoso claim that he knew of the dual identity as early as december of.furthermore,one of ellis former associates testified that ellis met personally with every new client during the initial intake process.accordingly,the jury could have concluded that ellis knew from the moment he began representing formoso that he was also representing him in a different claim under the name of denis milan.
although at trial ellis would only admit to an awareness that formoso was reluctant to tell doctors of his prior medical history,the evidence supports an inference that ellis knew that formoso would falsify his medical history by failing to disclose to doctors examining him after the hotel accident the prior accident at the victory button company.furthermore,although ellis claimed that confidentiality prevented him from revealing formoso dual identity to paul,nothing in the record reveals that he ever sought to ensure that his analysis of that ethical issue was correct.ellis never shared formoso confidences with attorneys at his own firm.indeed,ellis testified that during the entire period of his representation of both milan and formoso,he was the only person in his office who knew of the dual identity.
also,ellis management of the workers compensation department at his firm is entirely consistent with the actions of a man engaged in a fraudulent endeavor seeking to avoid exposure.ellis controlled the flow of information in the workers compensation department of his law firm.his method of assigning attorneys to files ensured that those attorneys were never able to gain a complete picture of any given case.files were assigned randomly each week,with ellis giving each attorney only enough information to allow that attorney to deal with the specific matter at issue.ellis handled all of the mail and controlled its dissemination.in short,ellis method of managing the practice of his department reveals a man afraid of his subordinates getting enough information to form a complete picture of the department activities.
likewise,ellis went to great lengths to ensure that formoso never had to appear before the department of industrial accidents as milan.though claimants would normally attend hearings on the settlement of a claim,milan did not attend a hearing on the settlement of his claim against cigna.instead,ellis submitted an affidavit dated may,indicating that milan was a resident of mamaroneck,new york with no intent to return to massachusetts.on may,however,formoso was in massachusetts receiving a medical evaluation connected with the hotel accident.
in addition to actively concealing the dual identity,ellis consistently used others as a buffer between himself and the creation and dissemination of false information in furtherance of formoso claim.formoso doctors incorporated the false medical history in their reports,thus unknowingly creating false reports that ellis then used to convince paul to pay benefits.having assisted formoso in the creation of these false reports,ellis then used his associates,all of whom were in the dark about the true state of affairs,to unknowingly pass along that false information to paul.in short,there was abundant evidence suggesting that ellis was a willing participant in a scheme to obtain benefits fraudulently from paul.
c.the paul claim and the history of this case 
paul began making payments on the formoso claim shortly after receiving it in december of and continued to honor the claim until june of.during that period,formoso was seen by numerous doctors,including several performing independent medical examinations imes on behalf of paul.with one exception,none of these doctors also saw milan without exception,none were told of the prior injury.these doctors,including formoso own,created reports that were forwarded to paul.in fact,ellis office routinely forwarded the medical reports it received on formoso condition despite ellis knowledge that those reports contained false information regarding formoso medical history.indeed,ellis testified that he never tried to dissuade formoso from lying to doctors.all of these reports attributed formoso symptoms to the only accident the doctors knew of the accident at the hotel.
paul relied on these reports and their causation determinations until,when it filed a motion for discontinuance to stop its payments to formoso.at a conference on that motion on june,ellis admitted that he had known that milan and formoso were the same person from either december,or january.the discontinuance was eventually granted during the period of coverage,paul paid on the formoso claim.
approximately six months after the june conference,paul filed the present action in the district court,alleging numerous counts against ellis and ellis ellis specifically,paul alleged that both ellis and his firm in their representation of formoso committed common law fraud engaged in unfair trade practices in violation of.laws ch,committed statutory fraud in violation of.laws ch.and acted negligently.hotly contested from the outset,the case went to trial before a jury in april of and lasted ten days.at the conclusion of paul,the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law on all counts.the court granted these motions from the bench.paul filed a motion for reconsideration,which the court denied in a written memorandum expanding upon its earlier reasoning.paul now appeals.
we review the grant of motions for judgment as a matter of law de novo.toyota motor,cir.under the familiar standard of review,such motions may be granted only if the evidence,when taken in a light most favorable to the,is so that the movant is plainly entitled to judgment,for reasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome.gibson city of cranston,cir see also logue dore,cir.in carrying out this analysis the court may not take into account the credibility of witnesses,resolve evidentiary conflicts,nor ponder the weight of the evidence introduced at trial,cir quoting irvine murad skin research,cir.
on appeal,paul contends that the district court misapplied the burden of proof on its fraud claim and misapprehended the evidence on the ch.and ch.claims.we address each of these three arguments in turn.
we begin our analysis with an examination of the massachusetts common law of fraud.the specific fraud alleged was the misrepresentation of formoso medical history and alternate identity.to sustain a claim of misrepresentation,a plaintiff must show a false statement of a material fact made to induce the plaintiff to act,together with reliance on the false statement by the plaintiff to the plaintiff detriment.zimmerman kent,see also restatement second of torts rood newberg.on the first of these elements that ellis made a false statement of material fact designed to induce paul to act there was ample evidence that ellis gave paul medical reports which he knew falsely indicated that there was only one injury the focus of the trial court decision and of the parties arguments on appeal is upon the issues of reliance and damages.
in concluding that paul had failed to meet its burden on this issue,the district court ruled that paul had failed to adduce any evidence showing that it had relied upon the lack of evidence of a prior back injury in approving formoso claim for workers compensation benefits.paul counters with the claim that the record contains ample evidence to prove its reliance on the misrepresentations.we agree.under massachusetts law,in order to prove reliance upon a misrepresentation,it is not necessary to prove that the false representations were the sole or predominating motive that induced the victim to part with his money or property.shawmut bank johnson,see also restatement second of torts cmt.b noting that causation in fact exists if the representation has played a substantial part,and so has been a substantial factor,in influencing his decision.paul only had to show that the false representation alone or with other causes materially influenced it to take the particular action that the wrongdoer intended it should take as a result of such representations and that otherwise it would not have taken such action.shawmut bank,at golding longwood,butler martin.
when measured against this standard and with due appreciation for the circumstantial evidence adduced in this case,paul provided more than enough evidence to allow a jury to conclude that formoso misrepresentations about his medical history were a substantial factor in its acceptance of formoso claim for benefits.elaine young was a decision maker with primary authority for the handling of the formoso claim so long as total expenditures did not exceed.she testified explicitly to her responsibilities in handling claims.as part of those responsibilities,she would obtain medical documentation of the person disability,verify that the accident did happen,and schedule imes and make payment if seemed deemed sic suitable.her decision to make payments necessarily involved an evaluation of medical reports,particularly their determinations about disability,injury,and causation.young testified that when deciding whether payments were appropriate,she explicitly relied upon medical reports produced by imes.only if those reports contained discrepancies or problems that were readily apparent from the report itself would she question their medical determinations.indeed,the evidence of young reliance upon these reports was bolstered by her testimony that she never had any doubts during her handling of the formoso claim that an injury had occurred at the westford regency hotel.this lack of doubt is unremarkable given that none of the reports contained any evidence that would have supported a contrary conclusion.
young evidence was bolstered by the testimony of betty clark,who was young subordinate,and by ellis himself.clark testified that she would make recommendations about how to proceed after conducting her own review of the records.she continued to recommend payment of formoso claim because she never saw any medical documentation to file for a discontinuance.ellis acknowledged that insurers take into account medical records and the representations about causation when making decisions in the course of a claim 
q.in circumstances where there is an ongoing claim for a back injury,is it true that those are the circumstances where an insurer,like paul,would base some of their decisions on these reports 
a.some of their decisions.
this evidence is sufficient to have allowed the jury to conclude that,although not the only factor in paul decision to pay benefits,the falsified medical history contained in the medical reports was a factor in that decision.
in ruling that paul failed to carry its burden of proving that it was damaged by the misrepresentations,the district court said that paul had to show that had the information about a prior injury been revealed,it would have relieved paul of an obligation to pay for the injuries resulting from the hotel accident.to carry this burden,the court reasoned,paul needed to adduce,in this context,would need to be expert medical that the hotel accident either did not result in an injury or resulted in an injury that was fleeting and temporary.we disagree with this analysis.
the court did not appreciate the manner in which the workers compensation context of this case affects the relative burdens of the parties on the damages element of paul fraud claim.to be sure,under massachusetts law,t he burden of proving fraud by a preponderance of the evidence rests on the party alleging it.connolly rochester shoe tree,wl at,citing cereghino giannone.this burden extends to all elements of paul claim,including damages.ellis notes correctly that paul did not have the authority to deny benefits unilaterally.thus,even if it had chosen to contest formoso claim because of its discovery of the misrepresented facts,the department of industrial accidents could still have required paul to cover formoso claim.if that had occurred,paul would not have been damaged by the misrepresentation.
nonetheless,it does not follow that because paul decision to deny the payment of benefits could be overruled by a state agency,it also bore a burden to prove in this fraud action,as ellis claims,that as a result of the failure to disclose formoso prior injuries,it was required to pay workers compensation benefits that it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay under the worker compensation laws.in order to understand why paul burden does not extend so far,it is first necessary to examine its burden on damages absent this workers compensation anomaly.
detrimental reliance 
once paul provided evidence that it relied upon the misrepresentation,it needed to show that this reliance was detrimental in order to prove that it was damaged.zimmerman,at a plaintiff must show a false statement of a material fact made to induce the plaintiff to act,together with reliance on the false statement by the plaintiff to the plaintiff detriment.emphasis added.here,paul could meet that requirement by demonstrating that it would have contested formoso right to compensation if his complete history had been disclosed.shawmut bank,at matthews bliss,wl if the false suggestion had no influence,if the plaintiff would have done the same thing if such representation had not been made,then it was not a motive to the act.
although the district court fairly noted that paul did not provide expert medical testimony directly on this point,the record contained sufficient circumstantial evidence to enable paul to prove that it would have contested formoso right to payment if it had known his full medical history.as noted,clark testified that the incomplete medical reports did not give grounds for seeking a discontinuance.the jury would have been entitled to conclude that at least some of those reports would have been different if the doctors examining formoso had been told that he had a prior injury at the victory button company.for instance,one of the doctors that paul hired to perform an ime,metzmaker,testified that determining causation was a significant part of his responsibilities in examining formoso.according to metzmaker,medical history was important to that determination because the onset of pain provided a significant clue as to the cause of the injury.because formoso concealed a prior injury to the same part of the back,all of the evidence of the onset of pain given to metzmaker and the other doctors indicated that this pain began after the westford regency hotel accident.the jury would have been entitled to conclude that,based upon the importance of pain in determining causation,at least some of the medical reports would have reached a different conclusion about the cause of formoso symptoms,thus giving paul the evidence it needed to discontinue payment.
ellis disclosure of the victory button company accident also would have allowed paul to discover the prior treatment,formoso dual identity,and the scheme to defraud paul.it is inconceivable that paul would have continued to pay benefits to formoso under those circumstances.thus,the evidence before the jury was more than sufficient to demonstrate that paul reliance upon the false representations was detrimental.put another way,paul proved that it was damaged by the payment of money it would not have chosen to pay if ellis had disclosed formoso full medical history.
paul workers compensation obligations 
we next turn to the question of whether the workers compensation context increases paul burden beyond this showing of detrimental reliance.we first look to paul obligations under the workers compensation laws.the existence of a second injury with a causal relationship to the accident at the westford regency hotel is central to the issue of whether paul was required to pay benefits to formoso.under massachusetts workers compensation law,when an employee suffers an accident that exacerbates a injury or that causes a new injury at the same location as a prior injury,full responsibility for that injury rests with the insurer providing coverage for the second accident and not with the insurer who was responsible for the prior injury.thus,w here an employee has suffered a series of compensable injuries,he has a right to be paid compensation by the insurer on the risk at the time of the most recent injury shown to have a causal connection with his present incapacity.falcione case,see also tassone case,evans case.applying this principle to the present case,if formoso was actually injured or if a prior injury was aggravated during the westford regency hotel accident,then paul would have been required to pay benefits despite its attempts to disclaim coverage.
it does not follow,however,that because paul would have been required to pay benefits if there were a second injury,it also had the burden of proving the absence of such an injury.indeed,massachusetts law is squarely to the contrary.it has uniformly been held by this court that the burden of proof remains throughout the trial on the employee to establish his case on all the evidence where liability is denied,or the amount to be recovered is in issue.in re ginley,see also in re quigley.workers comp,wl at.march,it is established law that the employee has the burden of proving medical causation and every other element of her claim.this allocation of burdens remains the same whether an insurer has denied benefits outright or has filed a motion for discontinuance.in re quigley,wl at the burden of proving benefit entitlement does not shift in a discontinuance proceeding,it continues to rest on the employee.thus,whenever there is an issue of the assignment of causation for an injury to a specific accident,the employee bears the burden of establishing that causation.id.
if paul had discovered the fraud and contested formoso right to receive benefits,therefore,formoso would have borne the burden of proving his entitlement to those benefits.we conclude that the massachusetts courts would not shift this burden to the insurer in a later action alleging fraud.indeed,ellis has provided no argument explaining why the burden should shift and so increase the insurer proof beyond a showing of detrimental reliance.nor could he.ellis argument for burden shifting on the damages issue only arises once the insurer has demonstrated all of the other essential elements of a fraud that spared formoso and ellis the burden of proving the claim for benefits in a workers compensation proceeding.allowing the burden to shift to the insurer in this fraud action despite that avoidance would only serve to reward fraudulent wrongdoing.given the striking similarities between the injuries alleged to have resulted from both the victory button and the westford regency hotel accidents,along with the other facts of this case,that burden may have been a difficult one for formoso and ellis to surmount in a workers compensation proceeding.we decline to reward such fraud by shifting this burden to paul.of course,it remains open to ellis,if he chooses to do so,to shoulder the burden of proving,as a defense to the damages claim in this fraud case,that despite his wrongdoing,paul would still have been required to pay the benefits it paid to formoso lorber beebe.
our conclusion on this point is bolstered by the massachusetts cases analyzing burdens of proof in case within a case attorney malpractice actions.in these actions,once some form of negligence has been shown on the part of the defendant attorney in the malpractice action,the issue of the defendant ultimate liability for damages turns upon whether his or her negligence affected the result in the prior action.the burden of proof,however,does not shift between the prior action and the action for malpractice.the factual issues once involved in the underlying action are presented to the trier of fact in the malpractice case with the burden of proof placed precisely as it was in the underlying action itself.glenn aiken.thus,if a plaintiff in the malpractice action the status comparable to paul in this case would not have borne the burden of proof in the underlying action,that burden does not shift to it.instead,the negligent defendant the status comparable to ellis in this case bears the burden of showing that its negligence produced no loss to the plaintiff because,even if there had been no negligence,the underlying action would have achieved the same result.glidden terranova,s ince the client had no obligation to prove his case in the underlying action he could have simply required the plaintiff to prove his case,he should not shoulder the burden of proving a defense in the malpractice action.quoting nolan,tort law at see also deerfield plastics hartford ins,reaching the same conclusion regarding burdens in a dispute over an insurer unreasonable settlement of a workers compensation claim.this principle is entirely consonant with our conclusion that the burden of proof regarding formoso legal entitlement to benefits did not shift to paul when it filed this fraud action against ellis.
b.the chapter claims 
paul also appeals from the entry of judgment as a matter of law on its count alleging violations of.laws ch,ch.chapter created new substantive rights by making conduct unlawful which was not unlawful under the common law or any prior statutes.schubach household finance,quoting commonwealth decotis.chapter proscribes those engaged in trade or commerce from employing u nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in business transactions.commercial union ins.seven provinces ins,cir quoting.laws ch.the standard for behavior that falls within the ch.proscription is notably imprecise,encompassing any actions that attain a level of rascality that would raise an eyebrow of someone inured to the rough and tumble of the world of commerce,have an extortionate quality that gives it the rancid flavor of unfairness,or fall within at least the penumbra of some,statutory,or other established concept of unfairness.id.internal quotations and citations omitted see also indus.ceramics,wellons,cir noting that ch.does not contemplate an overly precise standard of ethical or moral behavior quoting arthur little,dooyang,cir spencer doyle,noting that ch.claims are neither wholly contractual or tortious,but may encompass conduct which amounts to misrepresentation.
though ch.provides a broad remedy,it is only directed at conduct that occurs in the course of trade or commerce.u nfair or deceptive acts or practices therefore can only form the basis of a ch.claim if those acts are perpetrated in a business context.lantner carson,see also first,cooper,holding that because actions relating to an internal business dispute were not intended to influence an external marketplace,the plaintiffs had failed to show the trade or commerce required to maintain a ch.claim greater boston legal serv.haddad,wl at.may.this trade or commerce requirement was the basis for the district court entry of judgment as a matter of law.rather than focusing upon the alleged unfairness of ellis acts,the court instead found that any allegedly unfair acts were not performed in a business context in this case,any representations made by the defendants to paul were pursuant to a legal action,namely the adversarial workers compensation litigation in which formoso benefits were determined.therefore,the court concluded that chapter is inapplicable.
we disagree with the court characterization of the events at issue here.to be sure,the adversarial workers compensation litigation formed a backdrop to ellis actions.the jury could have easily concluded,however,that those actions were not vigorous advocacy in pursuit of formoso workers compensation claim.instead,the jury could have found that ellis used the workers compensation litigation to add a veneer of legitimacy to a fraudulent scheme to dupe paul into paying benefits to which formoso was not entitled.such a scheme affects trade or commerce and can be a basis for ch.liability.see coggins mooney,wl at.april,affirmed su
