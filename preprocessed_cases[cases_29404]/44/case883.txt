cleidson silva,doing business as c l construction c l,affordable housing foundation,affordable,and mountain developers associates,llc mountain,appeal from a final judgment entered on may,after a jury trial,at which plaintiff jose raimundo madeira,an undocumented alien worker,was awarded compensatory damages for lost earnings,as well as expenses and pain and suffering,as the result of physical injuries attributable to defendants violation of new york labor law.defendants affordable and mountain had unsuccessfully moved in the district court for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the award of lost earnings.see madeira affordable hous,d.they argued below that federal immigration law,as articulated in the immigration reform and control act of irca,stat,codified as amended in scattered sections of,and as interpreted by the supreme court in hoffman plastic compounds,nlrb,d,necessarily precluded any damages award under new york law that compensated an undocumented worker for lost earnings,at least to the extent such earnings were based on pay rates in the united states rather than in the worker native country.in pursuing this same argument on appeal,affordable and mountain are now joined by defendant silva.
in addition,affordable and mountain appeal district court rulings allowing the jury to apportion liability among c l,affordable,and mountain precluding evidence regarding c l lack of insurance and dismissing their action against preferred national insurance company preferred.silva further appeals the district court rejection of his rule b challenge to the jury verdict obligating him to indemnify affordable and mountain,arguing that the document relied on by these plaintiffs to support their indemnification claim is not an enforceable contract.
for the reasons discussed herein,we conclude that federal immigration law does not clearly preempt new york state law allowing undocumented workers to recover lost united states earnings where,as in this case,the wrong being compensated,personal injury,is not authorized by irca under any circumstance it was the employer rather than the worker who knowingly violated irca in arranging for the employment and the jury was instructed to consider the worker removability in deciding what,if any,lost earnings to compensate.because we conclude that appellants and other arguments are also without merit,we affirm the district court judgment in all respects.
factual background 
in recounting the facts relevant to this appeal,we necessarily review the record in the light most favorable to the parties in whose favor the jury returned each part of its verdict.see gronowski spencer,cir.
madeira employment and injury 
plaintiff jose raimundo madeira is a citizen of brazil who illegally entered the united states in.in brazil,madeira had worked in a factory earning approximately per month he had also labored briefly on his parents farm without formal remuneration.in the united states,madeira fared better,working consistently as a construction laborer,largely through the efforts of his brother,paulo miranda.as a supervisor for c l,miranda had authority to hire workers to perform that party subcontracts.in the years prior to the accident here at issue,madeira was earning approximately per hour in the united states and working as many as hours per week.
nothing in the trial record indicates that madeira himself used any false identification to obtain work in the united states such action was apparently unnecessary given his brother willingness to hire him despite knowing madeira undocumented status.moreover,because miranda acted as c l agent in hiring workers,his knowledge of madeira undocumented status can be imputed to his principal,c although madeira was generally paid in cash for his work,he testified that he paid income taxes on his earnings by using a taxpayer identification number.no evidence was adduced to the contrary.madeira further stated that,sometime in,he attempted to legitimize his work status by applying for a social security card and work permit but,at the time of trial in,those applications had not yet been acted on.
on june,while working as a roofer for c l,madeira fell from the top of a building at a development site in monroe,new york,sustaining serious injuries that required four surgeries and more than three months hospitalization.at the time of trial,madeira was still substantially disabled,particularly in walking.
b.the southern district lawsuit 
following his accident,madeira invoked federal diversity jurisdiction to file suit in the southern district of new york against affordable,the owner of the construction site,and mountain,the development general contractor,for their alleged failure to provide adequate safety equipment at the work site in violation of new york scaffold law,labor law in turn,affordable and mountain filed a action for indemnification against madeira employer,c l,as well as against c l insurer,preferred.the suit proceeded to a bifurcated trial,with the jury first deciding madeira claim and then considering affordable and mountain demand for indemnification.
the jury determination of liability and damages 
in the first phase of trial,the jury heard testimony from madeira his brother miranda who,in addition to hiring madeira for the job,had witnessed the accident and jacob sofer,the president of both affordable and mountain.a vocational rehabilitation counselor also testified on plaintiff behalf,offering his opinion as to madeira dim prospects for future employment in either the united states or brazil in light of his disability.the counselor expressed no opinion as to how madeira immigration status might have affected his employability in this country if he had not been injured.nor did the defense offer any evidence indicating if or when madeira might be required to leave the united states.the parties did,however,present conflicting medical opinion testimony about the extent of madeira injuries.
following the close of the evidence,the district court instructed the jury that it was not to consider madeira immigration status in assessing affordable and mountain liability under labor law.nevertheless,the jury was allowed to consider plaintiff undocumented work status in awarding any compensatory damages for lost earnings.specifically,the court charged 
plaintiff status as an undocumented alien should not be considered by you when you deliberate on the issue of defendant s liability under labor law section.however,you may conclude that plaintiff status is relevant to the issue of damages,specifically to the issue of lost wages which the plaintiff is claiming.you might consider,for example,whether the plaintiff would have been able to obtain other employment since as a matter of law,it is illegal for an employer in the united states to employ an undocumented alien,although of course it does happen that certain employers violate that law.if the plaintiff did not lose any income because you conclude that he would not have been able to work,and i mean not been able to work due to his alien status,you could not award him any damages for lost wages.you might also want to consider his status in determining the length of time he would continue to earn wages in the united states and in considering the type of employment opportunities that would be available to him.the fact that an alien is deportable does not mean that deportation will actually occur,but you are allowed to take the prospect of deportation into account in your deliberations.
finally,even if you conclude that the plaintiff would be deported at some point,you could conclude that he would lose income from employment overseas if you have a basis for making that calculation.in short,it up to you,the jury,to decide what weight,if any,to give plaintiff alien status just as you would any other evidence.alien status is not relevant to items of damage other than lost earnings.
the jury proceeded to find both affordable and mountain liable under labor law.it awarded madeira in total compensatory damages,consisting of in incurred expenses for past pain and suffering in past lost earnings for future pain and suffering over the course of years and for future lost earnings over the course of years.only the past and future lost earnings awards are at issue on this appeal.from the fact that the future lost earnings award represents far more than madeira would likely have earned in brazil in the specified years but considerably less than he could have earned in the united states over the same time one can reasonably infer that the jury concluded that,but for his injury,madeira would have remained and worked in the united states,but only for a limited period 
the jury findings on indemnification 
in the second phase of the trial,the jury found that an enforceable contract existed between c l on the one hand and affordable and mountain on the other,requiring c l to indemnify affordable and mountain for so much of the compensation award as stemmed from c l own negligence.as required by that contract,the jury apportioned liability for madeira injuries,holding c l liable and mountain and affordable each liable.
rule b motions 
following the indemnification verdict,affordable,mountain,and silva all moved for relief pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.affordable and mountain moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on four grounds madeira was precluded from recovering lost earnings by the fact that,at the time of his accident,he was not legally eligible to work in the united states liability could not be apportioned among c l,affordable,and mountain because the jury did not find,in the first phase of the trial,that affordable and mountain were negligent the district court erred in precluding affordable and mountain from presenting proof regarding c l lack of insurance and the district court erred in dismissing affordable and mountain action against preferred.meanwhile,silva moved for a new trial,arguing that no enforceable contract existed requiring c l to indemnify affordable and mountain for losses resulting from madeira personal injuries.
the district court denied all motions in a detailed memorandum and order dated april.see madeira affordable hous,d.silva,affordable,and mountain now appeal the district court rule b rulings as well as its final judgment in doing so,silva joins affordable and mountain in arguing that madeira,as an undocumented alien,was not entitled to recover lost earnings,at least not at united states pay rates.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.see armstrong brookdale.hosp.med,cir.in so doing,we apply the same standard as the district court itself was required to apply.diesel town of lewisboro,cir.specifically,we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,giving that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences that the jury might have drawn in its favor.see id.noting that reviewing court can not itself assess the weight of conflicting evidence,pass on the credibility of witnesses,or substitute its judgment for that of the jury.on such a deferential review of the record,we will reverse the denial of a disappointed litigant motion for judgment as a matter of law only if there is such a complete absence of evidence supporting the verdict that the jury findings could only have been the result of sheer surmise and conjecture,or such an overwhelming amount of evidence in favor of the movant that reasonable and fair minded men could not arrive at a verdict against the moving party.id.quoting fletcher,cir alteration in original.that is not this case 
federal immigration law does not clearly preempt new york state law allowing undocumented workers injured in construction accidents to recover compensatory damages for lost united states earnings 
in reviewing the joint challenge raised by affordable,mountain,and silva to the damages awarded madeira in the district court final judgment,we note at the outset that no party here disputes the fact of madeira injury,the jury findings as to the relative degree of each party negligence,or madeira right to be compensated for incurred expenses and past and future pain and suffering.instead,affordable,mountain,and silva referred to collectively as appellants for purposes of their damages challenge dispute only madeira recovery of lost earnings.they submit that the supreme court decision in hoffman plastic compounds,nlrb,d,required the district court to conclude that federal immigration law prohibiting the employment of undocumented aliens precludes state tort or labor law from awarding an injured undocumented worker such as madeira compensatory damages for lost earnings at united states pay rates.appellants submit that,if an injured undocumented worker can recover any lost earnings,it is only at the rates he could have earned in his native country.
in fact,the new york court of appeals this year rejected a similar hoffman challenge to an undocumented alien recovery of lost united states earnings pursuant to labor law.see balbuena idr realty llc,the court observed that the state legislature intended the scaffold law to protect all workers in qualifying employment of immigration status.id.at,at.the court specifically noted that,in balbuena,as opposed to hoffman plastic,the undocumented aliens had not themselves violated federal immigration law in procuring employment.see id.further,the court of appeals noted that new york law for compensating personal injury specifically sought to avoid any conflict with federal immigration law by instructing juries to consider the fact of a plaintiff removability in determining what,if any,lost united states earnings should be compensated.see id.at,at.
new york highest court construction of the scope of recovery allowed by its own state law plainly controls this court reading of that law.see commissioner estate of bosch,d tyler bethlehem steel,cir nevertheless,because federal preemption of state law is itself a federal question,balbuena reasoning and conclusion on that issue can only inform,not bind,our resolution of this appeal.accordingly,although we reference balbuena reasoning in this opinion,we do so in the context of independently deciding whether irca,as enacted by congress and as interpreted by the supreme court in hoffman plastic,necessarily preempts new york law to the extent the state allows injured undocumented workers to recover compensatory damages for lost earnings at united states pay rates.we conclude that where,as in this case,the wrong being compensated is personal injury,conduct not authorized by irca it was the employer and not the worker who violated irca by arranging for employment and the jury was instructed to consider the worker removability in assessing damages,new york law does not conflict with federal immigration law or policy in allowing an injured worker to be compensated for some measure of lost earnings at united states pay rates.
the relevant state and federal laws 
we begin by considering the state and federal laws relevant to appellants lost earnings challenge.
compensating personal injury under new york labor law 
it is well established that the states enjoy broad authority under their police powers to regulate employment relationship s to protect workers within the state.de canas bica,d accord balbuena idr realty llc,at,at.this includes the power to enact laws affecting occupational health and safety.balbuena idr realty llc,at,quoting de canas bica,at.pursuant to this power,new york,like many states,has enacted various laws to compensate workers who sustain workplace injuries.
most obviously,new york workers compensation law requires employers to pay or provide compensation to employees for their disability or death from injury arising out of and in the course of the employment without regard to fault as a cause of the injury.workers comp.law.this statute was designed to provide a swift and sure source of benefits to the injured employee.long.the price for these secure benefits is the employee loss of the tort action against his employer in which greater benefits might be obtained.id 
new york does not,however,rely only on workers compensation awards to promote workplace safety and compensate injury.mindful of the particular dangers of construction work,the state has long imposed absolute liability for personal injury on those site owners and general contractors who fail to provide adequate safety equipment to all persons working at construction sites.see labor law abbatiello lancaster studio,noting that law imposes absolute liability on owners and contractors for any breach of statutory duty that proximately causes injury.this liability applies regardless of the fact that the injured worker may be in the direct employ of a party other than the defendant contractor or owner.see abbatiello lancaster studio,at,at.as the new york court of appeals recently explained,labor law seeks to place ultimate responsibility for safety practices at building construction sites where such responsibility actually belongs,on the owner and general contractor,instead of on workers,who are scarcely in a position to protect themselves from accident.balbuena idr realty llc,at,at,internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also abbatiello lancaster studio,at,at.
new york law not only holds site owners and general contractors absolutely liable for personal injuries resulting from a violation of labor law it specifically extends the protections of that law to injured undocumented workers.see mazur,dep t collecting cases see also balbuena idr realty llc,at,at,coque wildflower estates developers,dep t july,hernandez sullivan tenant,dep t june.div.lexis,at ordonez brooklyn tabernacle.kings county,misc.lexis,at echeverria estate of lindner.nassau county,misc.lexis,at.
the compensatory damages available under new york law to a worker injured in violation of are those generally recoverable for personal injury,expenses,pain and suffering,and lost earnings.see generally united states burke,d hernandez sullivan tenant.div.lexis,at new york courts have rejected tortfeasors efforts to limit their liability for lost earnings when the victim sustaining personal injury is an illegal alien.notably,in collins new york city health hospitals,dep t,the appellate division,second department,specifically declined to limit an injured illegal alien compensatory damages to the earnings he might otherwise have realized in his native country.instead,recognizing the jury responsibility to determine compensatory damages from the totality of the circumstances,the court concluded that the jury should factor into any lost earnings award its findings regarding the length of time during which the alien plaintiff might have continued earning wages in the united states,the probability that such earnings would have been the product of illegal activity,and the likelihood of the plaintiff potential deportation.see public adm r equitable life assurance soc y,dep t see also balbuena idr realty llc,at,at,reaching same conclusion with respect to award of lost earnings to undocumented worker pursuant to labor law.the district court charge to the jury in this case fully comported with these principles of new york law the only issue for us to decide is whether that law actually conflicts with federal immigration law and policy.
discouraging illegal immigration through irca 
the federal government exercises supreme power in the field of foreign affairs,including immigration,naturalization and deportation.hines davidowitz.t he supremacy of the national power in the general field of foreign affairs,including power over immigration,naturalization and deportation,is made clear by the constitution,was pointed out by the authors of the federalist in,and has since been given continuous recognition by this court.footnotes omitted.illegal immigration,a topic of much recent debate,has long been a subject of federal legislative concern.in,congress enacted the immigration and nationality act ina,stat,codified as amended at,intended as a comprehensive federal statutory scheme for the regulation of immigration and naturalization.de canas bica,at.notably,the ina gave little attention to one factor relevant to illegal immigration employment.see,nlrb,d noting that ina did not make it unlawful for an employer to hire an alien who is present or working in the united states without appropriate authorization or for an alien to accept employment after entering this country illegally.congress remedied the omission in when it amended the ina by enacting irca.
irca focus on employer sanctions 
confronting a influx of undocumented aliens,congress concluded that the most humane,credible and effective way to respond to the problem was to penalize those employers who hired illegal aliens.i,at,as reprinted in,see id.employment is the magnet that attracts aliens here illegally employers will be deterred by the penalties in this legislation from hiring unauthorized aliens and this,in turn,will deter aliens from entering illegally or violating their status in search of employment.thus,irca makes it unlawful for employers knowingly to hire unauthorized aliens.see a.to ensure against such hiring,irca mandates employer verification of the legal status of persons hired.see id.b.employers who fail to check their workers immigration status or who fail to keep eligibility records face civil fines.see id.e a.employers who engage in a pattern or practice of knowingly employing undocumented aliens are subject to criminal penalties.id.f.
as initially enacted,irca,like the ina,did not make it unlawful for undocumented aliens to accept employment in the united states.indeed,at the same time that irca established employer sanctions as the centerpiece of its effort at immigration reform,congress afforded millions of undocumented workers already in the united states the opportunity to legalize their status.see.not until irca was itself amended in did congress provide for penalties and sanctions to be imposed directly on undocumented workers who sought employment in the united states.see immigration act of a,stat,codified at.even then,however,congress made irca new sanctions applicable only to aliens who knowingly or recklessly used false documents to obtain employment.see a,f.it did not otherwise prohibit undocumented aliens from seeking or maintaining employment.
irca express preemption clause 
from its initial enactment,irca has contained an express preemption clause,stating that t he provisions of this section preempt any state or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions other than through licensing and similar laws upon those who employ,or recruit or refer for a fee for employment,unauthorized aliens.h.the statute is silent,however,as to its preemptive effect on any other state or local laws.
reconciling irca and federal labor law in hoffman plastic 
significantly,it was not the preemptive effect of irca on state law that first required judicial attention.rather,it was the potential for conflict between irca and other federal laws,specifically,federal labor law.the supreme court addressed this issue in hoffman plastic compounds,nlrb,reversing a national labor relations board nlrb award of backpay to an undocumented worker on the ground that such recovery was foreclosed by federal immigration policy as expressed in irca.at.because appellants insist that hoffman plastic precludes madeira,as a matter of law,from recovering lost united states earnings as compensatory damages for personal injury under new york labor law,we discuss that case,and its background,in some detail.
a.the circuit conflict leading to hoffman plastic 
prior to hoffman plastic,a number of federal courts read the following language in the house committee report on irca to suggest that the statute employer sanctions were not intended to preempt federal or state labor law protections 
it is not the intention of the committee that the employer sanctions provisions of the bill be used to undermine or diminish in any way labor protections in existing law,or to limit the powers of federal or state labor relations boards,labor standards agencies,or labor arbitrators to remedy unfair practices committed against undocumented employees for exercising their rights before such agencies or for engaging in activities protected by existing law.
i,at,as reprinted in at.nevertheless,attempts to reconcile this construction with federal immigration policy failed to reach consistent conclusions.
for example,in montero ins,this court interpreted the committee statement narrowly to mean that an undocumented worker is fully eligible for federal labor law remedies if the alien is permitted by the ins to remain in the united states,cir rejecting argument that irca precluded deportation of undocumented alien based on evidence obtained in course of labor dispute,and holding that w hether or not an undocumented alien has been the victim of unfair labor practices,such an alien has no entitlement to be in the united states.
later that same year,this court concluded that such ins permission was not a condition precedent to the nlrb ordering an employer who had unlawfully terminated an undocumented worker to pay backpay,at least for a discrete period of time.see nlrb fuel oil buyers group,cir upholding backpay award to undocumented aliens from the date of their unlawful discharge until either their qualification for future employment or the expiration of the reasonable time allowed for them to comply with irca the court explained that a failure to enforce any backpay remedies in the case would encourage employers to compare the expense of irca fines to the expenses of backpay and the advantage gained in resisting unions,and potentially to decide that the risks of irca penalties are worth incurring.id.it concluded that an nlrb backpay award to an undocumented worker did not violate the principles underlying irca because the award was simply compensation for economic injury caused by the employer unlawful conduct it did not reestablish an illegal working relationship between the employer and any undocumented alien.see id.at n othing in the nlrb order requires the company or the employers to violate irca.see also id.at quoting nlrb reinstatement order conditioned on alien workers presenting employer with an ins form and the appropriate supporting documents necessary to allow employer to meet its obligations under irca.
in dissent,judge jacobs questioned the nlrb authority to order an employer to award backpay for any period during which undocumented workers were,in fact,ineligible for employment under irca.he suggested that plaintiffs were entitled to backpay only from the date on which they established their eligibility to work under federal immigration law.see id.at jacobs,dissenting in part and concurring in part see also id.at observing that,because nlrb proceedings can span a whole decade,a backpay award is no small inducement to prolong illegal presence in the country.
nevertheless,the majority ruling in fuel oil found support in an earlier ruling by the ninth circuit in local,warehouse and office workers union nlrb,cir.in that case,the ninth circuit held that undocumented workers terminated in violation of the national labor relations act nlra,could be awarded backpay because the nlrb routinely awards backpay to restore discriminatees to the economic position they would have enjoyed absent the unfair labor practice,backpay awards deter future similar unlawful practices,and eliminating backpay awards to undocumented aliens would encourage employers to continue violating the nlra,subverting its broad remedial goals.id.at see also nlrb kolkka,cir sustaining nlrb order against employer of undocumented workers.by contrast,in del rey tortilleria,nlrb,cir,the seventh circuit ruled that,under,undocumented workers could not be awarded backpay for any period during which they were not lawfully entitled to be present and employed in the united states.
the supreme court resolved this circuit split in hoffman plastic.
hoffman plastic compounds,nlrb 
in hoffman plastic compounds,nlrb,d,the supreme court considered the nlrb authority to award backpay to an undocumented worker terminated in violation of the nlra for supporting efforts to unionize his place of employment.the worker,jose castro,was an undocumented alien from mexico,who,in may,was employed as a blending machine operator at hoffman plastic compounds.castro obtained his job by fraud,presenting his employer with what he knew were false united states identification documents.see id.at.in december,castro began supporting a campaign at hoffman.in january,hoffman fired castro and three other employees who engaged in similar union activity.id.at.three years later,in january,the nlrb found that hoffman actions violated section a of the nlra,a.see hoffman plastic compounds,and arauz,hoffman,in order to rid itself of known union supporters,discriminatorily selected union adherents for layoffs.the nlrb ordered hoffman to cease and desist from any such further violations,to post a detailed notice to its employees explaining the nlrb remedial order,and to offer reinstatement and backpay to the four terminated employees,including castro.see hoffman plastic compounds,nlrb,at.
a compliance hearing ensued to determine the amount of backpay to be awarded the wrongfully fired workers.an nlrb administrative law judge alj ruled that castro was not entitled to any backpay award because he had used false documentation to obtain employment and had failed to present proof that he was currently lawfully in the united states.in such circumstances,and in light of the supreme court ruling in,nlrb,d,the alj concluded that a backpay or reinstatement award to castro would conflict with irca.see hoffman plastic compounds,and arauz,wl,nlrb lexis,at.
the nlrb reversed the alj decision with respect to backpay,awarding castro in lost earnings from the date of his termination to the date when hoffman first learned of castro status as an undocumented alien hoffman plastic compounds,and arauz.in so ruling,the nlrb emphasized that the most effective way to accommodate and further the immigration policies embodied in irca is to provide the protections and remedies of the nlra to undocumented workers in the same manner as to other employees,to the extent that such enforcement does not require or encourage unlawful conduct by either employers or individuals.id.at.the circuit twice denied hoffman petition for review of the nlrb order,see hoffman plastic compounds,nlrb,en banc,prompting the supreme court grant of a writ of certiorari,hoffman plastic compounds,nlrb,d.
the supreme court ultimately reversed both the circuit and the nlrb holdings,ruling that the nlrb broad discretion to fashion remedies for violations of the nlra,see hoffman plastic compounds,nlrb,at.collecting cases,did not reach so far as to permit that agency to award backpay to an illegal alien for years of work not performed,for wages that could not lawfully have been earned,and for a job obtained in the first instance by a criminal fraud,id.at.noting the circuit split over whether such a result was compelled by,see supra,the supreme court declined to rule on that precise question,observing that the subsequent enactment of irca made it appropriate to consider nlrb backpay awards through a wider lens,focused as it must be on a legal landscape now significantly changed.id.at.
describing the legal change effected by irca,the court observed that it was now impossible for an undocumented alien to obtain employment in the united states without some party directly contravening federal immigration policy either the undocumented alien tenders fraudulent identification,which subverts the cornerstone of irca enforcement mechanism,or the employer knowingly hires the undocumented alien in direct contradiction of its irca obligations.id.at.confronting the former circumstance in hoffman plastic,the court concluded that any attempt by the nlrb to remedy the employer unfair labor practice by awarding backpay to the undocumented alien would necessarily run counter to policies underlying irca,which policies the nlrb has no authority to enforce or administer.id.at.indeed,the court cited that alien criminal procurement of employment with false documents as the fact that sinks nlrb arguments in defense of the backpay remedy,observing that,f ar from accommodating irca,the nlrb position,recognizing employer misconduct under the nlra but discounting the misconduct of illegal alien employees under irca,subverts it.id.at.noting that it never deferred to the nlrb remedial preferences where such preferences potentially trench upon federal statutes and policies unrelated to the nlra,id.at.see id.at.collecting cases involving federal statute,bankruptcy code,federal antitrust policy,and the interstate commerce act,the court ruled that nlrb backpay awards to illegal aliens lie beyond the bounds of that agency discretion.id.at.
the court observed that its ruling did not deprive the nlrb of all power to sanction hoffman for relying on activity as the reason for terminating castro.federal immigration policy did not preclude the nlrb from ordering hoffman,under penalty of contempt,to cease and desist from unfairly hindering that activity and to post a notice detailing its prior transgressions and informing employees of their rights.the court concluded that these remedies were sufficient to effectuate national labor policy regardless of whether the spur and catalyst of backpay accompanies them.id.at.quoting,nlrb,at.
hoffman plastic does not conclusively resolve the question of irca preemption of state laws 
appellants submit that hoffman plastic construes irca to preclude any award of lost united states earnings to an injured undocumented worker,regardless of the statutory authority invoked.thus,they insist that irca bars new york state from allowing an undocumented worker injured in a construction accident to recover lost earnings at united states pay rates.because hoffman plastic is distinguishable from this case in important factual and legal respects,we are not convinced by appellants argument.
factual distinctions 
focusing first on factual differences,we note that the injury being remedied in hoffman plastic was termination while the wrong being compensated in this case is disabling personal injury.the distinction is significant.the termination at issue in hoffman plastic,while unlawful under the nlra because motivated by the worker protected union activities,was,in fact,effectively required by irca given the two statutes competing views of the termination at issue,there was particular reason to think that an nlrb backpay award to the worker for a period of time after termination directly conflicted with irca.this case presents no similar conflict because neither irca nor any other law authorized,much less required,any appellant to inflict disabling physical injury on madeira 
further,in hoffman plastic,the employment relationship originated in the worker own criminal violation of irca,prompting the supreme court to observe that it would subvert irca to penalize the employer unfair labor practice but to discount the worker immigration violation.id.at.citing employee criminal conduct in procuring employment as factor that sinks board argument that backpay award reasonably accommodates irca.no comparable worker misconduct is evident in this case.madeira did not himself violate irca in procuring the employment that led to his injury.rather,both the illegal employment relationship and the personal injury were the product of wrongdoing by others.specifically,it was madeira employer c l that hired him in knowing violation of irca.and it was c l,affordable,and mountain that failed to provide safe work conditions in violation of new york law.thus,because the application of new york law for calculating compensatory damages against the various appellants liable for personal injury in this case does not require any discounting of irca criminality by madeira himself,the facts simply do not present the same concern for subversion of federal immigration law that was identified in hoffman plastic.in this case,the challenged remedy would be assessed against parties at least one of whom violated irca,and not awarded to the irca violator himself,as in hoffman plastic.
legal distinction 
there is also an important legal distinction between this case and hoffman plastic.in hoffman plastic,the supreme court sought to reconcile two federal statutes to ensure that one did not trench on the other,a task routinely performed by federal courts in this case,however,appellants urge us to hold that immigration law stands as an absolute bar to state law relating to compensable damages for personal injury.we necessarily review such an argument carefully.as justice black famously observed,our federalism prescribes that the national government,anxious though it may be to vindicate and protect federal rights and federal interests,always endeavors to do so in ways that will not unduly interfere with the legitimate activities of the states.younger harris,d discussing federalism in context of abstention principle.federalism concerns were not at issue and,therefore,were not addressed in hoffman plastic.to resolve them here,we look to well established principles of federal preemption.
there is no basis for concluding that congress clearly intended irca to preempt established state law principles for compensating lost earnings in personal injury cases involving undocumented workers 
a.the legal foundation for federal preemption of state law 
constitutional authority for the federal preemption of state law is grounded in the supremacy clause,which states that the laws of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.const.art.vi,cl.despite this sweeping language,courts do not readily assume preemption.to the contrary,in the absence of compelling congressional direction,courts will not infer that congress ha s deprived the states of the power to act.new york.new york state dep t of labor,d internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,when,as in this case,the state law at issue involves the historic police power over public safety,courts start with the assumption that these powers are not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.jones rath packing,d quoting rice santa fe elevator.emphasis added accord cipollone liggett group,d.thus,as the supreme court has instructed,preemption fundamentally is a question of congressional intent.english,d see retail clerks int l schermerhorn,d holding that t he purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone of preemption analysis.
congress can convey its clear and manifest intent to preempt the exercise of state police power in three ways.first,congress may explicitly state that it intends to preempt a state law.see english,at.observing that when congress has made its preemptive intent known through explicit statutory language,the courts task is an easy one.second,even absent any such explicit statement,congress preemptive intent may be implied where the scheme of federal regulation is sufficiently comprehensive to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for supplementary state regulation,in short,where congress has manifested an intent for federal law to occupy the field.hillsborough county,automated med,d quoting rice santa fe elevator,at.finally,congress preemptive intent may be implied from the fact that state law so conflicts with federal law that either compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,florida lime avocado growers,paul,d,or state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress,hines davidowitz,at.see also silkwood,d.the conflict standard for preemption is strict.as chief justice rehnquist,the author of the court opinion in hoffman plastic,cautioned,federal preemption can not be premised on unwarranted speculations as to congress intent.jones rath packing,at.rehnquist,concurring in part and dissenting in part.a clear demonstration of conflict must exist before the mere existence of a federal law may be said to state law operating in the same field.id 
appellants fail convincingly to establish that congress,either explicitly or implicitly,demonstrated a clear and manifest intent totally to preempt new york law allowing juries to award some measure of lost united states earnings to undocumented workers who sustain personal injuries in violation of labor law 
express preemption 
no provision in irca expressly preempts state law providing for injured undocumented workers to recover compensatory damages,including lost earnings.as noted supra,irca express preemption clause applies only to any state or local law imposing civil or criminal sanctions on persons who employ or assist in the employment of illegal aliens.h emphasis added.compensatory damages for personal injury do not reasonably equate to sanctions.as the new york court of appeals observed in balbuena idr realty llc,a sanction is generally considered a penalty or coercive measure,such as a punishment for a criminal act or a civil fine for a statutory or regulatory violation.at,at,quoting black law dictionary ed citation omitted.by contrast,the primary purpose of civil recovery in a personal injury action premised on state labor law provisions is not to punish the tortfeasor but to compensate the worker for injuries proximately caused by negligence or the violation of statutory safety standards,at,see also mendoza zirkle fruit,wl,dist.lexis,at noting distinction between sanctions and compensatory damages in rejecting irca preemption challenge to civil conspiracy action,rev on other grounds,cir dowling slotnik,observing that workers compensation benefits could not be construed as sanctions in rejecting irca preemption challenge to their award.thus,although the national power over immigration is undoubtedly supreme,see hines davidowitz,at,we conclude that congress has not explicitly exercised it to preempt state laws allowing undocumented aliens who sustain workplace injuries to recover compensatory damages for lost earnings,however calculated.
congress failure expressly to preempt a particular state law does not preclude a court from implying that intent.see sprietsma mercury marine,d congress inclusion of an express clause does not bar the ordinary working of conflict principles internal quotation marks omitted emphasis removed crosby foreign trade council,d.thus,we consider the two circumstances that can give rise to implicit preemption.
implicit field preemption 
congress intent to preempt state law may be implied where it has designed a pervasive scheme of regulation that leaves no room for the state to supplement,or where it legislates in a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state law on the same subject.english,at.quoting rice santa fe elevator,at.as we have already noted,immigration is plainly a field in which the federal interest is dominant.see hines davidowitz,at.state tort and labor laws,however,occupy an entirely different field.appellants point us to nothing in the record supporting an inference that congress,by enacting irca,demonstrated a clear and manifest intent to least where illegal aliens are state tort or labor laws determining the compensatory damages recoverable for personal injuries.see english,at.where the field which congress is said to have includes areas that have been traditionally occupied by the states,congressional intent to supersede state laws must be clear and manifest.quoting jones rath packing,at.omission in original see also silkwood,at.imposing burden of establishing congress preemptive intent on party challenging application of traditional state tort law.
to the extent congress expressed any intent on the subject,the house committee report issued in conjunction with irca enactment suggests that the legislation was not intended to undermine or diminish in any way labor protections in existing law.i,at,as reprinted in at see supra we are mindful that,in hoffman plastic,the supreme court concluded that this language merited little weight as evidence of congress affirmative intent to allow the nlrb to fashion unfair labor practice remedies at odds with federal immigration policy.see hoffman plastic compounds,nlrb,at.but as we have already observed,in this case we do not simply reconcile two federal statutes we consider federal preemption of established state law.even if,in the preemption context,we heed hoffman plastic admonition to afford the house report little weight in identifying congress affirmative endorsement of other statutory remedies,the quoted language usefully highlights appellants inability to carry their burden.they can point to nothing in the record indicating congress clear and manifest intent to preempt the field of compensatory damages for workplace injuries sustained by undocumented aliens.see silkwood,at.accordingly,we conclude that no field preemption bars the challenged award of lost earnings in this case.
implicit conflict preemption 
the most difficult question presented on this appeal is whether a compensatory award of lost earnings to an injured undocumented worker so conflicts with irca policy prohibiting the hiring of such an alien as to warrant an inference of federal preemption.at the outset,we reiterate that implicit conflict preemption is warranted only if appellants can clearly demonstrate that a compliance with both new york labor law and irca is physically impossible,or b new york labor law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full congressional purposes and objectives stated in irca.see,silkwood,at.what constitutes a sufficient obstacle is a matter of judgment,to be informed by reference to the overall federal statutory scheme.crosby foreign trade council,at.see also geier am.honda motor,d noting that preemptive obstacles go by various names conflicting contrary to repugnance difference irreconcilability inconsistency violation curtailment interference,or the like quoting hines davidowitz,at.omissions in original.the mere fact of tension between federal and state law is generally not enough to establish an obstacle supporting preemption,particularly when the state law involves the exercise of traditional police power.see silkwood,at.holding that state award of punitive damages to person injured in nuclear incident did not conflict with federal remedial scheme regulating safety aspects of nuclear energy.rather,t he principle is thoroughly established that the exercise by the state of its police power,which would be valid if not superseded by federal action,is superseded only where the repugnance or conflict is so direct and positive that the two acts can not be reconciled or consistently stand together.jones rath packing,at.rehnquist,dissenting in part and concurring in part quoting kelly washington.emphasis added.
compliance with both new york labor law and irca is not physically impossible 
there is no irreconcilable conflict between irca and new york state labor law such that compliance with both the former prohibition on the employment of undocumented workers and the latter safe construction site obligation is physically impossible.as the new york appellate division,second department,has aptly observed,as between an employer and the federal government,the act of hiring an undocumented worker knowingly or without verifying his or her employment eligibility is unlawful,but as between the worker and an alleged tortfeasor,there are duties under the common law and the new york statutes governing workplace safety.majlinger cassino contracting,at,at.those duties are unrelated to,and do not depend on,the worker compliance with federal immigration laws.id.at.
compensatory awards of lost united states wages under new york labor law do not stand as a direct and positive obstacle to irca objectives 
preliminarily,we do not understand appellants to suggest that the general safety obligations imposed by new york labor law pose any obstacle to the attainment of irca policy objectives.in fact,such an argument would be unconvincing in light of hoffman plastic.there,the supreme court acknowledged that an employer was obliged to desist,under penalty of contempt,from engaging in generally proscribed nlra unfair labor practices against all employees,including undocumented workers.see hoffman plastic compounds,nlrb,at.see also singh jutla,d,noting that hoffman plastic did not foreclose all nlra remedies to undocumented workers.in short,federal immigration law did not excuse the hoffman plastic employer from its general nlra duties to engage in fair workplace practices toward all workers it only precluded the nlrb from employing a particular the victim of the unfair labor practice was an undocumented alien who had secured his employment through fraud and whose termination was,in fact,effectively required by irca.see hoffman plastic compounds,nlrb,at.so in this case,nothing in irca or federal immigration policy generally demands that employers,site owners,or general contractors be absolved from new duties of workplace care whenever undocumented aliens provide labor on construction sites.instead,as in hoffman plastic,the policy conflict issue in this case reduces to a concern about remedies,specifically,new york state ability to award workers,including undocumented aliens,some measure of lost united states earnings in compensation for disabling injuries caused by workplace negligence.in addressing this issue,it is helpful to consider where the challenged compensatory award falls along a spectrum of remedies potentially available to undocumented workers.
a reinstatement 
on the far end of remedies in plain conflict with federal immigration policy are orders directing employers who have violated some other law to reinstate undocumented workers.in such circumstances,the conflict with federal immigration law is both direct and positive because compliance with the remedial order requires the employer to violate irca,nlrb,at.noting that nlrb order conditioning reinstatement on employee legal reentry into united states thereby avoided conflict with ina montero ins,at collecting cases and noting that prospective remedies such as reinstatement consistently have been dependent upon whether the alien is permitted by the ins to remain in the united states del rey tortilleria,nlrb,at a n illegal alien is plainly not entitled to prospective and continued probably would be granted to other victims of similar unfair labor practices.quoting ins,d.
b flsa orders 
at the other end of the spectrum are orders that do not require,or even presume,a continuing violation of irca,for example,an order requiring an employer to pay his undocumented workers the minimum wages prescribed by the fair labor standards act flsa,for labor actually and already performed.in such circumstances,the immigration law violation has already occurred.the order does not itself condone that violation or continue it.it merely ensures that the employer does not take advantage of the violation by availing himself of the benefit of undocumented workers past labor without paying for it in accordance with minimum flsa standards.thus,a number of district courts have concluded,even after hoffman plastic,that irca does not preclude such flsa awards 
c remedies that presume continued irca violations 
falling between these examples are various remedies that,while not mandating actual irca violations,nevertheless appear to presume that,but for the wrong being remedied,the unlawful employment relationship would have continued.whether such remedies stand as direct and positive obstacles to irca policy objectives supporting an inference of congress manifest intent to preempt admits no uniform answer.the particular circumstances in which the state and federal laws interact must be carefully considered in deciding whether conflict preemption can appropriately be implied.before turning to the instant case,it is useful to consider the circumstances in two paradigmatic situations in this intermediate range,the first in which a backpay or lost earnings award to an undocumented worker is clearly disallowed,and the second in which it is allowed,at least by a number of courts.
i the disallowance of backpay in hoffman plastic 
the nlrb backpay award disallowed in hoffman plastic presumed that,but for the employer engagement in an unfair labor practice,the undocumented worker would have continued in its employ,at least until the employer discovered his undocumented status.although federal preemption was not at issue in hoffman plastic,two facts in that case are useful in identifying the sort of conflicts between irca and lost earnings awards that might support an inference of preemption.first,as previously noted,supra,the injury being compensated by the challenged backpay the nlra only because of the employer motivation otherwise,it was effectively required by irca.to compensate an employee under one statute for conduct effectively required by another plainly raises conflict concerns not present when,as in this case,the conduct at not authorized by any statute.second,the terminated employment relationship at issue in hoffman plastic originated in a criminal irca violation by the employee.awarding such an employee backpay for his employer nlra violation while ignoring the employee own criminal irca conduct subverts irca in a way not present when,as here,it is the employer who violates both federal and state law.new york court of appeals has by no means indicated that it would approve a lost earnings award to an undocumented alien who procured employment by criminally violating irca.indeed,in balbuena idr realty llc,at,at,that court specifically noted that the plaintiffs in that case unlike the alien in hoffman plastic did not commit a criminal act under irca.
thus,two facts critical to hoffman plastic identification of a conflict between two federal statutory schemes are not present to support appellants preemption argument in this case.
ii the allowance of workers compensation awards to undocumented aliens 
like the backpay at issue in hoffman plastic and the lost earnings in this case,a workers compensation award implicitly presumes that,but for the workers injury,the unlawful employment relationship would have continued both before and after hoffman plastic,however,state courts have almost uniformly held that workers compensation awards are not an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the policy and purposes of irca rather,courts have generally concluded that uniform application of workers compensation laws best serves the interests of both federal and state law.
as the connecticut supreme court has observed with respect to federal immigration law,excluding undocumented workers from the pool of eligible employees would relieve employers from the obligation of obtaining workers compensation coverage for such employees and thereby contravene the purpose of the immigration reform act by creating a financial incentive for unscrupulous employers to hire undocumented workers.dowling slotnik,at,at.other state courts have echoed this point.see,farmer brothers coffee workers comp.appeals,d.lexis,at noting that if employers were permitted to deny workers compensation benefits to undocumented workers,unscrupulous employers would be encouraged to hire aliens unauthorized to work in the united states,by taking the chance that the federal authorities would accept their claims of good faith reliance upon immigration and work authorization documents that appear to be genuine reinforced earth workers comp.appeal.commw.lexis,at noting that the denial of workers compensation benefits to injured undocumented employees would provide employers with an incentive to violate federal immigration law by actively seek ing out illegal aliens rather than citizens or legal residents because they will not be forced to insure against or absorb the costs of injuries.at the same time,state courts express understandable concern that the denial of workers compensation benefits would seriously undermine the state significant interest in promoting workplace safety and protecting the public fisc by leading employers of undocumented aliens to think that they can engage in unsafe practices with no fear of retribution,secure in the knowledge that society would have to bear the cost of caring for these injured workers.design kitchen baths lagos.these twin concerns hardly suggest that a workers compensation award stands as a direct and positive obstacle to federal immigration policy.
we are,of course,mindful that,in hoffman plastic,the nlrb proffered an analogous argument,that its backpay order served to reduce employer incentives both to hire illegal aliens in violation of irca and to engage in unfair labor practices proscribed by the nlra.a majority of the supreme court reversed the order.that decision,however,must be viewed in context.
the hoffman plastic majority did not explicitly reject the general premise of the nlrb denial incentive argument.rather,it identified other factors in the case that tipped the conflict balance decidedly against the agency.as we have now repeatedly observed,the termination that the nlrb attempted to remedy with a backpay order in hoffman plastic was conduct effectively required by irca.moreover,the terminated employment in hoffman plastic originated in a criminal irca violation by the employee,not the employer,a fact cited by the supreme court as sink ing the nlrb efforts to characterize its backpay award as consistent with irca as well as the nlra.id.at.holding that recognizing employer misconduct under the nlra while discounting employee irca violation subverts rather than accommodates federal immigration law.
where,however,these hoffman plastic circumstances are not the undocumented worker has committed no irca crime,where the employment relationship originates in the employer knowing violation of irca duties,and where the wrong being compensated is personal injury not authorized by irca under any alleged conflict,particularly between federal and state law,may not be so apparent.thus,with respect to workers compensation,a viable policy argument might still be made that a benefits award to an injured undocumented alien better serves to encourage employer compliance with both federal immigration and state safety laws than would a benefits denial.in any event,in such circumstances,courts have certainly not identified a direct and positive conflict warranting federal preemption of workers compensation awards 
to the extent workers compensation benefits sometimes represent more than the undocumented worker could have earned in his native country,employers might argue that such windfalls could encourage illegal immigration in violation of federal law.whether such an argument is more than speculative is something we need not decide on this appeal.see id.at.breyer,dissenting and cases cited therein dismissing as speculative suggestion that aliens decision to enter united states is influenced by benefits of labor laws.while such overpayments may evidence a degree of tension between state law calculations of workers compensation benefits and federal immigration policy,courts have not identified that circumstance as a definite and positive obstacle to the effective operation of that policy.
iii the award of lost united states earnings in this case 
as we have already observed,new york labor law supplements the state workers compensation laws by extending absolute liability for construction injuries to site owners and supervising general contractors.applying some of the conflict principles identified in our foregoing discussion of workers compensation benefits and other remedies to this case,we identify five reasons why the award of lost united states earnings to madeira does not stand as an obstacle to the full purposes and objectives of congress as stated in irca.
first,unlike the termination in hoffman plastic,the personal injury at issue in this case is not conduct authorized by irca under any circumstances.see supra.thus,new york law does not subvert irca by requiring a defendant to compensate an alien worker for action required by irca.
second,unlike reinstatement,a lost earnings award to an injured worker does not require the worker or his employer actually to commit or continue to commit an irca violation.see supra.at most,the award hypothesizes the continued employment relationship simply as a means of calculating damages to the injured worker.
third,insofar as an undocumented worker employment necessarily originates in a past irca violation that would presumably have continued but for the injury,the supreme court has thus far recognized a backpay or lost earnings award to conflict with federal immigration law only when the irca violation prompting employment was committed by the employee,not,as in this case,by the employer.see hoffman plastic compounds,nlrb,at.see supra.
fourth,when,as in this case,both the illegal employment relationship and the personal injury are attributable to the wrongful conduct of persons other than the undocumented worker,a denial of lost earnings compensation,like a denial of workers compensation,see supra,is more apt to subvert both federal and state law than a grant of such compensation is apt to place the two in direct and positive conflict with one another.as the new hampshire court of appeals observed in recently rejecting a hoffman challenge to its state law allowing an undocumented worker to recover lost united states earnings for workplace injuries to refuse to allow recovery against a person responsible for an illegal alien employment who knew or should have known of the illegal alien status would provide an incentive for such persons to target illegal aliens for employment in the most dangerous jobs or to provide illegal aliens with substandard working conditions.rosa partners in progress.allowing such recoveries would not trench on federal immigration policy because,although the compensatory awards would stem from illegal relationships,employers could avoid the result by complying with irca and refusing to hire illegal aliens in the first place.see id.at,at.no different conclusion is warranted because the defendants in this case are a general contractor and a site owner who bring madeira direct employer,c l,before the court only in a action.as already discussed,see supra,new york strong interest in such contractors and site owners guaranteeing the safety of construction sites is codified in labor law.to allow defendants to avoid paying damages to an injured undocumented worker on the ground that it was the worker direct employer who violated irca would,in essence,partially relieve defendants of their nondelegable duty and thereby produce a result that is inconsistent with labor law statutes.balbuena idr realty llc,at,at.more to the point for purposes of our conflict inquiry,there is simply no federal interest in absolving contractor and site owner defendants of their duty.unlike the termination injury in hoffman plastic,irca neither effectively requires nor condones appellants denial to undocumented workers of the duty of care mandated by.
fifth and finally,although new york allows juries to compensate injured undocumented workers for lost united states earnings,it instructs them to consider the workers removability in calculating what,if any,compensation to award.such an instruction may not totally eliminate the tension implicit in a compensatory award that presumes continued employment in violation of irca.see balbuena idr realty llc,at,at,smith,dissenting concluding that jury instruction on worker removability is inadequate to avoid irca preemption of state award of lost united states earnings pursuant to.nevertheless,the instruction in this case serves,together with the other four factors identified,to preclude us from identifying the lost earnings award to madeira as a direct and positive obstacle to the attainment of irca policy and purpose.jones rath packing,at.rehnquist,dissenting in part and concurring in part quoting kelly washington,at.thus,we can not infer that congress clear and manifest intent is to preempt established new york law awarding such compensation to undocumented workers injured in violation of its strict labor laws.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.of course,if congress thinks it necessary in furtherance of federal immigration policy to preclude state law compensatory damage awards such as the one in this case,it may certainly do so,but it must manifest that intent clearly 
in sum,although federal immigration law prohibited madeira employment in this country,where,as in this case,both his initial hiring in violation of irca and his personal injury resulted from the wrongdoing of others,we identify no clear conflict between federal immigration law and new york law allowing a jury,upon being instructed to consider an alien removability,to award some measure of compensatory damages based on lost united states earnings for a violation of labor law.it is not physically impossible to comply with both irca and new york labor law,and appellants have failed convincingly to demonstrate that new york law,as applied in this case,stands as a definite and positive obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.accordingly,we reject appellants claim of conflict preemption as without merit and uphold the damages awarded at the first phase of trial.
c.the remaining claims on appeal are without merit 
liability for madeira injuries was properly apportioned among c l,affordable,and mountain 
following the second phase of the trial,the jury apportioned liability among silva,affordable,and mountain,holding silva alter ego,c l,liable and affordable and mountain each liable for madeira injuries.on appeal,affordable and mountain argue that the district court erred in permitting the jury to apportion liability,contending that,because they were held absolutely liable under new york labor law in the first phase of the trial,there was no basis for the jury to find them contributorily negligent in the second phase and,thus,to hold them proportionally liable.they are wrong.
in the first phase of trial,the jury did find affordable and mountain liable under new york labor law for madeira personal injuries.moreover,because imposes absolute liability,see blake neighborhood hous.servs.of city,no evidence regarding negligence on the parts of affordable or mountain was presented during the first phase in the second phase,however,the jury found that an enforceable contract required c l to indemnify affordable and mountain,but only to the extent of its own negligence.indeed,the indemnification agreement provides 
indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by law,subcontractor c l shall indemnify and hold harmless the general contractor mountain and owner affordable against any claims,damages,losses,and expenses,including legal fees,arising out of or resulting from performance of subcontracted work to the extent caused in whole or part by the subcontractor or anyone directly or indirectly employed by the subcontractor.
construction contract,june,emphasis added.in order to determine how much l owed to affordable and mountain,therefore,the jury had to apportion liability for negligence among the three parties.absent apportionment,affordable and mountain stood to recover indemnification even for losses caused by their own negligence,a result at odds with the indemnification agreement itself.as the district court explained 
there was no finding of negligence in the first phase of the trial because negligence was irrelevant to plaintiff claim against affordable and mountain under.affordable and mountain could have liable to plaintiff irrespective of any negligence on their part.negligence was,however,relevant to phase ii of the trial.the jury was,therefore,asked if affordable or mountain were negligent,and,if so,to apportion fault at the conclusion of phase ii.
madeira affordable hous,d at.we agree with the district court analysis of the record and conclude that it properly rejected affordable and mountain challenge to the apportionment of liability.
the district court did not err in precluding evidence that c l lacked insurance for affordable and mountain 
affordable and mountain contend that,i n interpreting the first cause of action in their complaint as limited to breach of the indemnity provision,the district court committed error and must be reversed.br.at.although affordable and mountain fail to identify the context in which the district court interpreted its first cause of less,the place in the record where that interpretation to explain what action the district court actually took that constituted reversible error,its argument appears under the heading precluding proof of lack of insurance is erroneous as a matter of law.id.at.accordingly,we construe affordable and mountain appeal as a challenge to an evidentiary decision by the district court to preclude evidence regarding c l failure to secure insurance for affordable and mountain as additional insureds under c l policy with preferred,its insurer.we review the district court evidentiary rulings under a deferential abuse of discretion standard and give district court judges wide latitude in determining whether evidence is admissible at trial.meloff new york life ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
here,any evidence that c l failed to name affordable and mountain as additional insureds in its policy with preferred was properly excluded as cumulative and wasteful of the court and the jury time because the parties entered into a stipulation to that fact.see trial tr.see also international minerals resources,pappas,cir a district judge has discretion to exclude evidence if it is cumulative of evidence already in the record.united states holmes,cir absent a clear abuse of discretion,a trial judge retains a wide latitude to exclude irrelevant,repetitive,or cumulative evidence.see also.counsel for preferred stated the issue of the additional insured status is not being contested no evidence will be shown to the jury because it is uncontroverted that the policy in issue does not,in fact,contain any additional insured status for mountain and affordable.trial tr.counsel for affordable confirmed what we are stipulating is that the insurance contract did not provide additional insurance.id.at.we conclude,therefore,that the district court acted well within its discretion in precluding additional evidence of the stipulated fact that c l insurance policy with preferred did not name affordable and mountain as additional insureds.
the district court properly dismissed preferred 
following phase two of the trial,the district court granted preferred motion to dismiss,ruling that affordable and mountain would have to be insured s under this policy or otherwise in contractual privity with the insurance company in order to maintain a direct action against the insurance company.trial tr.on appeal,affordable and mountain charge that the dismissal was erroneous,because,while not additional insureds actually named in the policy,they were,nevertheless,entitled to coverage by virtue of their insured contract with c br.at.we are not persuaded.
it is ancient law in new york that to succeed on a third party beneficiary theory,a must be the intended beneficiary of the contract,not an incidental beneficiary to whom no duty is owed.county of suffolk long island lighting,cir citing lawrence fox,see also port chester constr.atlas.a party asserting rights as a beneficiary must establish the existence of a valid and binding contract between other parties,that the contract was intended for his benefit and that the benefit to him is sufficiently immediate,rather than incidental,to indicate the assumption by the contracting parties of a duty to compensate him if the benefit is lost.state of cal.pub.employees.ret.shearman sterling,quoting burns jackson miller summit spitzer lindner.thus,under new york law,where the insurance contract does not name,describe,or otherwise refer to the entity or individual seeking the benefit thereof as an insured,there is no obligation to defend or indemnify.state of new york am.mfrs.mut.ins,dep t internal citations omitted.here,c l insurance policy did not name,describe,or otherwise refer to affordable or mountain,and affordable and mountain present no other evidence from which any reasonable trier of fact could conclude that they were entitled to coverage under that policy.additionally,because the district court correctly found that affordable and mountain were not insureds or beneficiaries under the policy,and because they have not obtained a judgment against the alleged tortfeasor,c l,they lack standing to pursue an action against preferred.see lang hanover ins.thus we conclude that the district court correctly ruled that,as a matter of law,affordable and mountain can not maintain an action against preferred.
an enforceable contract obligated c l to indemnify affordable and mountain 
silva contends that no enforceable contract required him or c l to indemnify affordable and mountain for losses resulting from madeira damages award because the purported agreement among the parties was neither sufficiently definite in its terms nor signed by any person with authority to represent c l.in fact,silva insists that the purported contract was the result of forgery and,thus,void ab initio.we disagree.
a the terms of the contract,when viewed as a whole,were sufficiently definite 
few principles are better settled in the law of contracts than the requirement of definiteness.if an agreement is not reasonably certain in its material terms,there can be no legally enforceable contract.cobble hill nursing home,henry warren,see also express indus.terminal new york state dep t of,to create a binding contract,there must be a manifestation of mutual assent sufficiently definite to assure that the parties are truly in agreement with respect to all material terms.citation omitted see generally jur.contracts the very essence of a contract is definiteness as to material matters if an agreement is not reasonably certain in its material terms,there can be no legally enforceable terms.
in denying silva rule b motion,the district court concluded,based on a review of paulo miranda testimony at trial,that t here was evidence presented at trial from which a reasonable jury could determine that miranda understood the terms of the agreement.madeira affordable hous,d at.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to affordable and mountain and giving them the benefit of all reasonable inferences that the jury might have drawn in their favor from the evidence,stratton dep t for the aging,cir internal quotation marks omitted,we agree with the district court that the contract between c l,affordable,and mountain was sufficiently definite to permit the jury to find it enforceable.
crucial to our conclusion is the recognition that the construction contract was in two parts an oral agreement covering most of the material terms regarding the construction project and a written agreement covering insurance and indemnity issues,as required by new york law.paulo miranda testified that,prior to beginning work on the monroe construction project,he negotiated the terms of an oral agreement with jacob sofer,president of affordable and mountain.specifically,he testified that he and sofer discussed the location of the monroe project,the work that c l would perform,and the progress payments that affordable and mountain would make.see trial tr.sofer testimony largely corroborated miranda account.see id.at.
silva nevertheless argues that the written portion of the contract was insufficiently definite to constitute an enforceable contract under new york law.the district court,however,exhaustively explored and ultimately rejected as a matter of law the claim that the entire construction contract must be in writing.see trial tr.i f you view the construction contract as the amalgam of its oral and its written portions,knowing that the statute of frauds does not apply,it sufficiently definite.see also id.at.this conclusion finds support in new york law.see podhaskie seventh chelsea,dep t.moreover,because silva does not argue on appeal that the statute of frauds applies to the contract here at issue,he has,in fact,waived any argument to that effect.see norton sam club,cir.accordingly,we identify no error in the district rejection of silva definiteness challenge to c l contract with affordable and mountain.
b paulo miranda,who had authority to represent c l,assented to the terms of the contract 
on appeal,silva does not dispute that miranda assented to a deal with sofer.rather,silva asserts that miranda did not do so on behalf of c l.as the district court indicated in a colloquy with the parties,however,the issue of assent ultimately depends on whether the jury believe d paulo miranda when he said he had authority to enter into the construction contract.see trial tr.in denying silva motion,the district court also ruled that there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could conclude that miranda did in fact assent to the construction contract terms on behalf of fact,as silva partner.madeira affordable hous,d at see also id.at noting that miranda assented on behalf of himself and silva to the terms of the agreement.
miranda testified,in no uncertain terms,that he was silva partner in c specifically,miranda testified that he and silva entered an oral partnership agreement during an earlier construction project and that this agreement continued for the monroe project.see trial tr.he also testified that,as partners,he and silva split both the costs of doing business,such as insurance premiums,and the profits from their projects.see id.at.silva,not surprisingly,denied miranda account,testifying that,although he and miranda had agreed to split profits and expenses on the earlier project,see id.at,the two had no agreement,oral or otherwise,to be partners on the monroe project,see id.at.
in finding that miranda assented to the construction contract as silva partner and as an authorized agent of c l acting within the scope of his authority,we must presume that the jury found miranda credible see stratton dep t for the aging,at.because miranda testimony provided evidence in support of the jury finding,that finding must stand.we conclude,therefore,that the district court properly rejected silva claim and declined to overturn the jury finding that miranda assented to the construction contract on behalf of c 
iii.conclusion 
to summarize,we hold that irca does not preempt,either expressly or implicitly,a compensatory damages award to an undocumented worker for personal injury under new york labor law that includes some measure of lost united states earnings.hoffman plastic compounds,nlrb,d,does not dictate a different result particularly where,as in this case,neither irca nor any other law authorized the personal injury being compensated the employment of the undocumented worker originated in a knowing violation of irca by the employer rather than the employee and the jury was instructed to consider the undocumented plaintiff removability in deciding what,if any,lost united states earnings to award.for this reason and because the parties other appellate challenges to various rulings of the district court lack merit,we hold that the district court may,judgment is hereby affirmed.
