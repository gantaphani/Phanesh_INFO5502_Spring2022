when construing a statute,our overriding goal must be to determine the legislature intent.hubbard reed,citations omitted.as the new jersey supreme court has observed 
the first step in determining the legislature intent is to look at the plain language of the statute.as a general rule,when the language of a statute is clear on its face,the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.nevertheless,we also have stressed that where a literal interpretation would create a manifestly absurd result,contrary to public policy,the spirit of the law should control.thus,when a literal interpretation of individual statutory terms or provisions would lead to results inconsistent with the overall purpose of the statute,that interpretation should be rejected.

newell contends she has a meritorious claim and that she substantially complied with new jersey affidavit of merit statute.because the statute does not address its applicability to cases transferred from another jurisdiction,she argues a narrow interpretation would thwart the legislature intent of barring only frivolous claims.
in several recent decisions,the new jersey supreme court held that if reasonable effectuation of the statute purpose has occurred,the affidavit of merit statute does not require strict compliance.galik clara maass med,see also fink thompson,cornblatt barow.in appropriate cases,c ourts invoke the doctrine of substantial compliance to avoid technical defeats of valid claims.cornblatt,at quoting zamel port of.
the doctrine of substantial compliance requires the defaulting party to show the lack of prejudice to the defending party a series of steps taken to comply with the statute involved a general compliance with the purpose of the statute a reasonable notice of petitioner claim and a reasonable explanation why there was not strict compliance with the statute.id.this equitable doctrine requires a analysis involving the assessment of all the idiosyncratic details of a case to determine whether reasonable effectuation of the statute purpose has occurred.galik,at citation omitted.
there is no legal prejudice to the defendants.newell complaint,filed in new york federal court on march,was accompanied by a certificate of merit attesting to the validity of her claim.furthermore,newell supplied defendants with copies of her mammograms and took a series of steps that notified the defendants about the merits of the malpractice claims filed against them.palanque.as the new jersey superior court observed 
there is no prejudice whatever that would result to defendants,other than that they would have to defend against a potentially meritorious claim,which is not legal prejudice.certainly,there has been no showing of prejudice to defendants that would outweigh the strong preference for adjudication on the merits rather than final disposition for procedural reasons.

the second and third prongs of the substantial compliance doctrine are related.newell took steps generally complying with the purpose of new jersey affidavit of merit statute the purpose of stat.ann.s is to weed out frivolous lawsuits early in the litigation while,at the same time,ensuring that plaintiffs with meritorious claims will have their day in court.hubbard,at.as noted,new york a has the same purpose as new jersey statute to improve the quality of medical malpractice adjudications and deter the commencement of frivolous cases.harmon huntington,misc d,quotation and citation omitted.
new york a seeks to achieve this purpose by requiring that a complaint for malpractice actions be accompanied by a certificate,executed by the attorney for the plaintiff,declaring 
t he attorney has reviewed the facts of the case and has consulted with at least one physician in medical malpractice actions who is licensed to practice in this state or any other state and who the attorney reasonably believes is knowledgeable in the relevant issues involved in the particular action,and that the attorney has concluded on the basis of such review and consultation that there is a reasonable basis for the commencement of such action.
