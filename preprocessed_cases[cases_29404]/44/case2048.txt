loretha kanida appeals from a jury verdict in favor of her employers,defendants gulf coast medical personnel lp gcmp and nursefinders,which found that the defendants did not retaliate against kanida in violation of the fair labor standards act.a.kanida claims that she is entitled to a new trial because the district court refused to include a requested permissive pretext instruction in the jury charge,and also because of two additional jury instructions she requested that the district court refused to give.kanida also claims that two jury instructions the district court actually gave were improper and require a new trial.additionally,kanida challenges the district court evidentiary rulings limiting or excluding the testimony of five witnesses.finally,kanida claims that the district court erred when it concluded that a victim of retaliation can not recover compensatory and punitive damages under the flsa.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court.
in august,kanida contacted mary beth parks,the founder and owner of gulf coast medical personnel gcmp,and requested a meeting.at this meeting kanida claimed that gcmp owed her unpaid overtime compensation.parks collected kanida employment records,calculated the amount that gcmp owed,and offered payment to kanida.kanida refused gcmp offers,and demanded payment of an amount significantly higher than parks calculated.kanida filed a complaint regarding the unpaid overtime compensation with the department of labor dol,which commenced an investigation in november.while this investigation was ongoing,parks finalized the sale of gcmp to nursefinders.parks continued to work for nursefinders,and nursefinders assumed any potential liability associated with kanida claims.at the conclusion of the dol investigation,nursefinders and parks attended a conference with the dol where parks acknowledged liability for the unpaid overtime.parks subsequently offered payment of unpaid overtime compensation to all of the affected employees as determined by the dol.kanida again declined to accept payment of this amount and retained counsel to pursue the matter.kanida filed this lawsuit in may,but continued working for nursefinders until january when she left voluntarily.
kanida claimed that parks,and consequently gcmp and nursefinders,retaliated against her for filing a complaint with the dol in violation of the fair labor standards act flsa.to support her retaliation claim,kanida produced evidence to show that subsequent to her filing of the dol claim she was subject to adverse employment actions in response to kanida production of this evidence,gcmp offered legitimate reasons for the disputed actions kanida then offered evidence to show that gcmp purported reasons were merely a pretext for actions that were actually retaliation for her dol complaint.the case was tried to a jury which ruled in favor of gcmp.kanida moved for a new trial,but the district court denied this motion and entered final judgment awarding kanida only the overtime pay that the parties stipulated she was entitled to based upon the dol investigation.this appeal followed.
kanida argues that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to include the permissive pretext instruction she requested in its jury charge a permissive pretext instruction specifically informs jurors that they are permitted to,but need not,infer that an employer actions regarding an employee were based on a prohibited motivation from evidence that the reasons the employer gave for its actions were mere pretext.see ratliff city of gainesville,cir.this is,however,only an evidentiary instruction,and to prevail employees must prove that the employer actions were taken because of the prohibited motivation.id.at.kanida claims that our decision in ratliff requires district courts to give a permissive pretext instruction in employment retaliation cases.
ratliff considered a permissive pretext instruction within the context of an age discrimination claim under the age discrimination in employment act.id.at.as part of his claim,the plaintiff in ratliff presented evidence to show that the reasons the employer gave for its actions were actually a pretext for age discrimination.id.this plaintiff requested a permissive pretext instruction,similar to the one at issue here,and the ratliff district court also refused to include this instruction in its jury charge.id.the district court in ratliff also chose to instruct the jury regarding the plaintiff burden in that case by using a pretext plus jury instruction id.in ratliff we held that the district court erred in failing to give an inference instruction and in holding jurors to a pretext plus standard.id.at.relying upon reeves sanderson plumbing products,d,we correctly held that district court erred in giving the pretext plus instruction because this instruction incorrectly stated the plaintiff burden of proof.ratliff,at citing reeves,at,d holding that it is permissible for the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of discrimination from the falsity of the employer explanation emphasis in original.however,in ratliff we also relied upon reeves to decide that the district court erred when it refused to give a requested permissive pretext jury instruction in an employment discrimination case.ratliff,at.
while reeves clarified the legal burden of production a plaintiff must meet to present their case to a jury,reeves,at.at,it did not address whether a district court must give a permissive pretext jury instruction.many of our sister circuits do not understand reeves to require that instruction.see moore robertson fire prot,cir failure to include instruction on pretext is not reversible error where the given instructions correctly stated the law because the jury was still free to consider any evidence of pretext palmer bd.of regents of the.of,cir no reversible error from refusal to include permissive pretext instruction when the rest of the jury instructions correctly stated the law fite digital equip,cir finding that although an instruction that the jury can infer discrimination from evidence of pretext is permitted,we doubt that such an explanation is compulsory,even if properly requested.we recognize,however,that other circuits agree with our decision in ratliff.see ratliff,at citing smith borough of wilkinsburg,cir requiring that jurors receive a permissive pretext instruction cabrera jakabovitz,cir same townsend lumbermens mut.cas,cir requiring permissive pretext instruction when a rational finder of fact could reasonably find the defendant explanation false.
despite this concern,it is the firm rule of this circuit that one panel may not overrule the decisions of another.united states taylor,cir.therefore,we are required to follow ratliff.although ratliff decision that the district court erred by refusing to give a permissive pretext instruction in employment discrimination cases was not necessary to reach its decision to reverse the district court,see ratliff,at holding that the pretext plus instruction requires reversal,this decision is still binding precedent upon this panel as an alternative holding.see,united states adamson,cir holding that decisions on issues that were fully presented and litigated,and likely to arise on retrial,are not dictum and are still binding precedent even if the decision was not necessary to support the ultimate ruling,such as an alternative holding.
we are concerned that our permissive pretext jury instruction holding in ratliff unnecessarily expands the scope of the reeves opinion for four reasons.first,and most importantly,reeves was not a jury case.in reeves,the supreme court reviewed the evidence a plaintiff must produce to fulfill their burden and avoid summary judgment or judgment as a matter of law.reeves,at,d.reeves considered the plaintiff burden of production within the context of the burden shifting analysis first articulated in mcdonnell douglas green,d.see reeves,at,d in reeves,the circuit court understood supreme court precedent to require plaintiffs to produce evidence that the employer purported justifications were pretext plus additional evidence of actual discrimination,and held that judgment as a matter of law for the defendant was appropriate in that case because the plaintiff failed to produce any additional evidence.id.at.the supreme court found that the court of appeals misconceived the evidentiary burden bourne by plaintiffs as previously defined by the supreme court because a plaintiff prima facie case,combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer asserted justification is false,may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated.id.at.thus,reeves was intended to clarify the judiciary understanding of the evidentiary burden of production plaintiffs must meet to survive mcdonnell douglas burden shifting analysis.id.at.citing mary honor ctr.hicks,d.the mcdonnell douglas formula,however,is applicable only in a directed verdict or summary judgment situation,and is not the proper vehicle for evaluating a case that has been fully tried on the merits.powell rockwell int l,cir thus,ratliff holding that reeves also guides the evaluation of cases fully tried on the merits appears to be in tension with reeves and our own precedent.
second,reeves did not change what a plaintiff must ultimately prove to prevail on their the adverse employment action was motivated by actual discriminatory intent.reeves,at.in other words,i t is not enough to disbelieve the employer the factfinder must believe the plaintiff explanation of intentional discrimination.emphasis in original internal citations omitted.this court has consistently held that district courts should not frame jury instructions based upon the intricacies of the mcdonnell douglas burden shifting analysis.see,walther lone star gas,cir instructing the jury on the elements of a prima facie case,presumptions,and the shifting burden of proof is unnecessary and confusing.olitsky spencer gifts,cir same.instead,we have held that district courts should instruct the jury to consider the ultimate question of whether a defendant took the adverse employment action against a plaintiff because of her protected status.walther,at olitsky,at.before ratliff we only required district courts to instruct juries on the ultimate question they must answer reeves did not change this.consequently we should not have interpreted reeves to alter the instructions that district courts are required to give to a jury.
third,the pretext inference described in reeves is merely a permissive and not a mandatory inference.see reeves,at.noting that there will be instances where,although the plaintiff has established a prima facie case and set forth sufficient evidence to reject the defendant explanation,no rational factfinder could conclude that the action was discriminatory.the fifth circuit pattern jury instruction on the consideration of evidence permits jurors to draw the reasonable inferences they feel the evidence justifies.see fifth circuit dist.judges,pattern jury instructions civil of the evidence.there are numerous permitted inferences,and only requiring an instruction regarding the permissive pretext inference risks confusing the jury regarding the ultimate issue a plaintiff must prove.gehring case,cir a judge need not deliver instructions describing all valid legal principles.especially not when the principle in question describes a permissible,but not an obligatory,inference.to prevail,a plaintiff must show actual discriminatory intent successfully rebutting the defendant asserted justifications may not itself be sufficient.see reeves,at.when a plaintiff alleges disparate treatment,liability depends on whether the protected trait actually motivated the employer decision.citations omitted.diverting the jurors attention in this manner risks understating the complexity of their inquiry,and potentially places the burden of persuasion upon employers to show that the explanations they offer are true rather than requiring plaintiffs to prove that their employers acted with inappropriate intent.townsend lumbermens mut.cas,cir brorby,dissenting i n some instances,a facially neutral permissive inference instruction might draw unwarranted attention to a small portion of the evidence presented at trial or mislead the jury as to the applicable law.
fourth,and finally,in ratliff we based our holding that permissive pretext instructions are required in part on the concern that w ithout a charge on pretext,the course of the jury deliberations will depend on whether the jurors are smart enough or intuitive enough to realize that inferences of discrimination may be drawn from the evidence establishing plaintiff prima facie case and the pretextual nature of the employer proffered reasons for its actions,and concluded that i t does not denigrate the intelligence of our jurors to suggest that they need some instruction in the permissibility of drawing that inference.ratliff,at quoting smith borough of wilkinsburg,cir.however,in this case,even without the permissive pretext instruction,the jury received instructions regarding the ultimate legal question it must answer and the jury was also instructed that it was permitted to draw any reasonable inferences it felt the evidence justified.the plaintiff was free to argue that actual discriminatory intent was the appropriate inference to make from the evidence offered to show that the employer purported reasons for their actions were mere pretext for these reasons,we disagree with ratliff and urge en banc reconsideration of its holding that it is error for the district court to refuse to give a requested permissive pretext instruction in employment discrimination cases.
as discussed above,the reeves opinion,on which ratliff based its permissive pretext holding,elaborates upon the requirements of the mcdonnell douglas burden shifting analysis.retaliation claims under the flsa are also subject to the mcdonnell douglas analytical framework.see brock casey truck sales,cir holding that mcdonnell douglas pretext analysis applies to flsa claims conner schnuck,cir in analyzing flsa retaliation claims,we apply the shifting burden of proof scheme initially articulated in mcdonnell douglas.citations omitted.thus,ratliff applies as equally to flsa cases as it does to employment discrimination cases.kanida is correct that the district court was required to give her requested permissive pretext instruction,and erred by not doing so.
gcmp claims that ratliff is distinguishable from this case on its facts.in ratliff the district court chose to instruct the jury on mcdonnell douglas burden shifting.see ratliff,at.gcmp thus claims that ratliff only requires permissive pretext instructions in cases where the district court has instructed the jury as to mcdonnell douglas burden shifting,and that in cases where no such instruction was given,the permissive pretext instruction is not required.we find nothing in ratliff suggesting such a limitation.see ratliff,at.indeed it would not make sense to read ratliff this way because on remand the district court should not formulate its instructions based upon mcdonnell douglas.while ratliff did not specify the precise language a permissive pretext instruction must contain,under the stare decisis rules of this court we find that the district court erred by refusing to include a permissive pretext instruction in its jury charge.
although in ratliff we held that it was error for a district court to refuse to give a requested permissive pretext instruction,we did not consider whether,based upon the facts of that case,the failure to give the permissive pretext instruction rose to the level of reversible error.ratliff,at.this was because the improper pretext plus instruction provided reversible error and it was unnecessary to consider whether not giving the permissive pretext instruction constituted reversible error.id.at.in contrast,in this case we must determine whether the district court refusal to give the requested permissive pretext instruction is reversible error.
this court reviews a district court refusal to provide a requested jury instruction for abuse of discretion.united states mcclatchy,cir citations omitted.recognizing that district courts have substantial latitude in crafting jury instructions,the district court refusal to give a requested jury instruction constitutes reversible error only if the instruction was a substantially correct statement of law,was not substantially covered in the charge as a whole,and concerned an important point in the trial such that the failure to instruct the jury on the issue seriously impaired the party ability to present a given claim.id.
as our previous discussion indicates,the permissive pretext instruction kanida requested is a correct statement of law.in addition,based upon our understanding of ratliff,we find that the requested permissive pretext instruction was not substantially covered in the charge as a whole.the instruction on inference the district court gave in this case was a general inference instruction under ratliff,the fifth circuit pattern general inference instruction is insufficient and a permissive pretext instruction must also be given.ratliff,at.although failing to give a requested permissive pretext instruction courts reversal,based upon our consideration of the record,we conclude that this error did not seriously impair kanida ability to present her claim in this case.the district court refusal does not constitute reversible error.
other than its failure to give kanida requested permissive pretext instruction,the district court instructions properly stated the law governing this case.the jury was instructed to find for kanida if it found that she would not have suffered the adverse employment actions absent her protected activity of filing a dol complaint.unlike the plaintiff in ratliff,the instructions did not require kanida to meet a pretext plus burden.further,the permissive pretext instruction issue was resolved at the charge conference prior to closing arguments,and all of the parties understood that the law permits the jury to infer actual discrimination based only on evidence supporting kanida prima facie case under mcdonnell douglas and the evidence showing pretext on the part of gcmp.kanida was free to tailor her argument to fit the court instructions and to argue based upon those instructions that the jury should infer actual discrimination based upon the evidence she presented in this case showing pretext on the part of gcmp.defendants could not argue that this was not a permitted inference.the jury was properly instructed regarding the controlling law and trial counsel was able to present the jury with the inferences they were permitted to make from the evidence.consequently we can not conclude that kanida was seriously impaired in presenting her claim.therefore,although the district judge failure to give the requested permissible pretext instruction is error under ratliff,it does not rise to the level of reversible error in this case.
kanida claims that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to include in the jury charge two additional instructions she requested.these claims are reviewed under the same standard as the permissive pretext instruction above.mcclatchy,at.first,kanida claims the district court refusal to include a vicarious liability instruction is reversible error both parties recognize that kanida requested instruction was a correct statement of law,however gcmp argues there was no reversible error because the instruction was substantially covered in the charge as a whole and it did not concern an important point in the trial such that the failure to instruct the jury on the issue seriously impaired the party ability to present a given claim.mcclatchy,at.
gcmp only defense was that the actions its employees took regarding kanida were not retaliatory.it never disputed the issue of vicarious liability.further,kanida points to no evidence in the record suggesting that vicarious liability was ever an issue at trial.in the jury charge conference,defendants indicated that they believed that this undisputed issue was adequately addressed by the general circumstantial evidence and inference instructions and the district judge agreed.even,assuming their belief was incorrect,if further clarification or emphasis of an employer responsibility for the actions of its employees was necessary,nothing prevented kanida from highlighting this issue in her argument to the jury.this instruction did not concern a disputed issue at trial and the jury was adequately instructed on the law governing retaliation,the ultimate issues it had to resolve in this case.therefore,refusing to include the vicarious liability instruction did not impair kanida ability to present her claims to the jury.
second,kanida claims the district court erred in refusing to include a taint instruction we need not consider the merits of this claim because kanida did not adequately preserve this issue for appeal.failure to present a specific written instruction to the trial court bars an subsequent complaint on appeal that the instruction was not given.transoil jersey belcher oil,cir citing fisher indiana lumbermens mutual ins,cir.although kanida requested an instruction providing that a plaintiff does not have to prove a direct causal connection in a discrimination claim she never requested a taint instruction.her direct causal connection instruction was not sufficient to preserve a claim regarding a taint instruction for appeal.see.no party may assign as error the giving of an instruction unless that party objects thereto stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.the direct causal connection instruction differs significantly from a taint instruction because it never mentions either the relationships between employees or the circumstances under which one employee discriminatory animus can taint the actions of another employee.thus,kanida objection before the district court regarding her requested causal connection instruction failed to adequately preserve a taint instruction for appellate review.
kanida claims two instructions the district court chose to include in the jury charge are also reversible error.challenges to jury instructions are reviewed to determine whether the court charge,as a whole is a correct statement of the law and clearly instructs jurors on the legal principles at issue.rubinstein adm rs of the tulane educ.fund,cir.first,kanida claims the but for causation standard the district court used as the definition of a motivating factor is reversible error because it is the wrong legal standard but for causation is a correct statement of law in this case.this court has repeatedly stated that in retaliation cases the employee must prove that the adverse employment action would not have occurred but for plaintiff protected activity.see,rios rossotti,cir for retaliation claims,this final burden requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the adverse employment action would not have occurred but for the protected activity.seaman csph,cir in a retaliation claim,u ltimately the employee must show that but for the protected activity,the adverse employment action would not have occurred.thus,inclusion of this instruction was not error on the part of the district court.
second,kanida claims on appeal that including a business judgment instruction was reversible error because it undermined her efforts to show that gcmp stated reasons were pretext kanida failed to object to this instruction before the district court.see.no party may assign as error the giving or failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict.therefore we will only review this instruction for plain error.texas beef group winfrey,cir.including this instruction in the jury charge was not plain error because this court has approved similar business judgment instructions in other retaliation cases.see,julian city of houston,cir approving a similarly worded business judgment instruction in an adea case.therefore,kanida claim regarding this instruction fails.
kanida challenges five of the district court evidentiary rulings excluding certain testimony.we apply an abuse of discretion standard when reviewing evidentiary rulings.if an abuse of discretion is found,the harmless error doctrine is applied.thus,evidentiary r
