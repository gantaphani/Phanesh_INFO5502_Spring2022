this appeal stems from the entry of summary judgment in favor of lincoln general insurance company lincoln in a declaratory judgment action seeking the district court determination of lincoln duty to defend cesar reyna reyna.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court grant of lincoln summary judgment motion.
factual background 
lincoln issued a business auto policy to reyna.this policy was effective february,through february.it is undisputed that during the policy effective dates,a bus crash occurred in mexico involving a bus owned by reyna and driven by one of his employees,joel quinones lozano lozano,and another vehicle.as a result of the collision,jorge cantu and manuel oyervidez collectively,victims,both in the other vehicle,were killed.
mayra lizeth arellano medina,jose rodrigo garza ramos,maria del socorro cantu serna,and manuel guadalupe alaniz muniz,all relatives of cantu collectively cantu plaintiffs,filed suit in texas state court against reyna and lozano on may.lincoln informed reyna that it was denying coverage and would not be providing his defense in the state court action.reyna never filed an answer,and on september,the cantu plaintiffs obtained a default judgment against reyna and lozano.on november,the state court entered a final judgment against reyna and his driver lozano for approximately million with reyna liable for of the damages.in addition,the judgment transferred reyna right to the insurance proceeds from the policy to the cantu plaintiffs.
lincoln filed the declaratory action that is the subject of this appeal on november.lincoln sought the federal district court determination of whether coverage for the damages and loss resulting from the bus crash existed and,consequently,whether lincoln was required to defend reyna.the cantu plaintiffs,as well as maria bartolo oyervidez oyervidez,on behalf of oyervidez,collectively intervenors were permitted to intervene.lincoln and intervenors filed for summary judgment with the trial court ultimately granting lincoln motion for summary judgment.
ii.standards of review 
summary judgment standard 
in reviewing a district court grant of summary judgment,this court uses a de novo standard and applies the same legal standards as the district court summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,affidavits and other summary judgment evidence show that no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law the movant bears the burden of identifying those portions of the record it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact the burden then shifts to the nonmovant to show the existence of a genuine fact issue for trial however,the nonmovant may not rest upon allegations in the pleadings to make such a showing all evidence and reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant 
duty to defend standard 
this court examines whether lincoln had a duty to defend reyna using a de novo standard of review under texas law,an insurer duty to defend is determined by the eight corners doctrine,or complaint allegation rule in other words,the court looks only to the allegations in the pleadings and the language of the insurance policy using this analysis,the allegations in the petition are liberally interpreted 
the four corners of the complaint must allege facts that,if taken as true,could possibly assert a claim within the scope of coverage in the four corners of the insurance policy otherwise,an insurer is not legally required to defend a suit against its insured the court must look to the alleged facts in the pleadings,not the legal theories being asserted any doubt regarding the duty to defend is resolved in favor of the duty however,if the only facts alleged are excluded from the policy coverage,the insurer is not required to defend it is the insured burden to establish that a claim is potentially within the scope of coverage once the insured has established this,the burden shifts to the insurer to show that the plain language of a policy exclusion or limitation allows the insurer to avoid coverage of all claims,also within the confines of the eight corners rule.
iii.discussion 
intervenors claim in their first issue the district court erred in granting lincoln summary judgment motion.in their second issue on appeal,intervenors contend lincoln standard business auto policy requires it to provide a defense to reyna for the negligent hiring,training,and supervision claim.in their final issue on appeal,intervenors argue,based on king dallas fire.ins.that a claim for negligent hiring,training,and supervision equates to an accident under the policy,thereby independently triggering coverage and a duty to defend.
citing to the texas supreme court in king intervenors claim the district court erred in determining accident was restricted to an automobile collision and did not include coverage for negligent hiring,training,and supervision.irrespective of the bus crash occurring in mexico,they argue lincoln duty to defend reyna was triggered by reyna actions of negligently hiring,training,and supervising lozano,which occurred in texas within the coverage area,because his actions constitute an accident under the policy.lincoln contends that because the bus crash occurred outside the coverage area,under the language of the policy,coverage was never triggered therefore,it was not required to defend reyna.
alleged facts in state court petition 
in their first amended original petition petition in state court,the cantu plaintiffs assert separate claims of negligence against lozano and reyna.this court must look beyond the claims asserted,to the alleged facts paraphrasing those allegations,the cantu plaintiffs allege in the petition factual background that the bus crash,which killed the victims,occurred in mexico.the cantu plaintiffs also contend lozano operated the bus in a negligent manner,causing the collision and their damages.they add that his negligence was a breach of the duty to exercise ordinary care in operating the bus reasonably and prudently.in their allegations against reyna,they contend that reyna is vicariously liable for their damages,because of lozano negligence.they also allege reyna is directly liable to them for their damages because he breached an independent duty of care in negligently entrusting lozano with the bus,failing to implement safety policies,failing to enforce company safety policies,and negligently hiring,training,supervising,and retaining lozano.
policy provisions 
the policy explicitly sets forth the conditions which must be met in order to trigger coverage.coverage is triggered when bodily injury or property damage results from an accident and from the ownership,maintenance or use of a covered auto.the policy defines accident as including continuous or repeated exposure to the same conditions resulting in bodily injury or property damage.the accident or loss must occur within the policy period and the coverage territory.the coverage territory is defined in the policy as the united states,territories and possessions of the united states,puerto rico,and canada.
employing the eight corners doctrine,the issue before this court is whether the facts,as alleged in the state court pleadings,give rise to potential coverage under the policy,thereby triggering lincoln duty to defend reyna.
intervenors contend reyna actions in negligently hiring,training,and supervision lozano are an accident as defined by the policy,separately triggering coverage and the duty to defend.as support for their argument,intervenors rely on the texas supreme court case of king dallas fire ins.in which the court held a duty to defend existed because the claim against the insurer for negligent hiring,training,and supervision was an occurrence under the policy regardless of the underlying intentional conduct being excluded from coverage.they allege it is dispositive because the language of the policy provision in king is nearly identical to the language in the policy at issue.lincoln contends this case is more akin to fidelity guaranty ins.underwriters,mcmanus in which the court determi
