this products liability case arises out of severe and permanent injuries sustained by plaintiff karen bartlett after taking sulindac,a generic drug nsaid manufactured by among others defendant mutual pharmaceutical company mutual.sulindac is known to cause,in rare instances,a hypersensitivity reaction called stevens johnson syndrome and its more generous cousin toxic epidermal necrolysis.in december,bartlett doctor prescribed for her shoulder pain sulindac under the clinoril made by the original provider,and her pharmacist dispensed generic sulindac.
the consequences were disastrous.bartlett developed early in.ten is diagnosed when percent or more of the outer skin layer on a patient total body surface area has deteriorated,been burned off or turned into an open wound.in bartlett case,the percentage rose to percent of her body she spent days at massachusetts general over in its burn unit.both her suffering and permanent injury,including permanent,are described below in connection with the award of damages.
bartlett brought a bevy of claims against mutual in new hampshire state court,including claims for breach of warranty,fraud,and negligence,as well as the perennial trio of products liability claims design defect,failure to warn,and manufacturing defect.after mutual removed the case to federal court on diversity grounds,all but the design defect claim were dismissed by the district court on summary judgment or voluntarily by bartlett.bartlett mutual pharm,cv,wl,bartlett mutual pharm,d.
bartlett originally planned her evidence across a range of possible claims,including an attack on the adequacy of the warning label and information that accompanied mutual sulindac drug.it was not until after the trial was completed that further legal developments discussed below foreclosed a direct attack on the adequacy of the label but the district court dismissed bartlett warning claim because her prescribing doctor admitted that he had not read the box label or insert.bartlett,d at.
although bartlett experts had prepared their initial reports to cover multiple theories advanced in the complaint,by trial the core remaining theory of design defect was narrowed to this that sulindac risks outweighed its benefits making it unreasonably dangerous to consumers,despite the federal food and drug administration fda having never withdrawn its statutory safe and effective designation that the original manufacturer had secured and on which mutual was entitled to piggyback.see u.b,d id.j a.
a day trial occurred in late august and early september,during which bartlett called witnesses to her suffering and her treatment,including two important experts a burn surgeon and more critical to design.the latter expert in particular sought to show from incident reports made to the fda and other information that sulindac had a worse record of causing than other available drugs,and a safety profile similar to other drugs deemed dangerous enough to have been withdrawn from the market such as valdecoxib,another nsaid sold under the brand name bextra,which was withdrawn in.
mutual had designated its own expert in the same field as well as other witnesses but ultimately chose to put on no affirmative case of its own,although it bartlett experts vigorously and offered substantial legal arguments to the judge as to why it should not be found liable.after several days of deliberation,the jury found for bartlett and awarded million in compensatory damages.the district court denied mutual motion for judgment as a matter of law.b,and motion for a new trial.bartlett mutual pharm,d.
mutual now appeals,arguing that the district court misunderstood new hampshire law on design defect claims that such claims as to generic drugs are preempted under federal law that causation was not proved that bartlett expert evidence was inadmissible on multiple grounds that instructions as to label warnings were inaccurate that misconduct by bartlett counsel required a new trial and that damages were excessive and required a new trial.the standard of review depends upon the issue,the first two raising strictly issues of law that we review de novo.ex rel.loughren unum,cir.
design defect.although courts traditionally have refused to review the reasonableness of the designs of prescription drugs,restatement third of torts products liability,cmt.f,at,this court reads new hampshire law now to permit such review,brochu ortho pharm,cir.brochu is consistent with the new hampshire supreme court adoption of restatement second of torts,see buttrick lessard,which imposes liability for selling any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer when the product causes injury to the user or consumer.
however,mutual interprets buckingham reynolds tobacco,to require not merely unreasonable dangerousness but also proof that there exists an alternative,safer design for the product like a new guard on a motorized table saw,see id.at.the claim in brochu could satisfy such a test,because the drug at issue there contained a mix of progestogen and estrogen,and its unreasonable dangerousness could be attributed to the of an unnecessarily high proportion of estrogen.
by contrast,mutual says that bartlett failed to allege and prove that sulindac could be made in a different and safer form,and this almost certainly has to be true sulindac is a drug and the variations in suldinac as sold consist of inactive ingredients that ordinarily do not have significant pharmacological effects.but buckingham does not clearly say that a safer alternative is a necessary element of design defect over and above an unreasonably dangerous product,and a subsequent decision disavows any such requirement.
in vautour body masters sports,which followed after buckingham,the new hampshire supreme court held that proof of a safer alternative design should be neither a controlling factor nor an essential element that must be proved in every design defect case.rather,it said that a product is defective as designed if the magnitude of the danger outweighs the utility of the product.id.at quoting keeton et,prosser and keeton on the law of torts,at ed.
buckingham involved a design defect claim against cigarette manufacturers,and the court dismissed the claim on the ground that cigarettes are inherently dangerous and commonly known to be so.at see also restatement second of torts,cmt.i danger beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer.but an ordinary consumer would hardly know without further warning that sulindac or any other ordinary analgesic carries a risk of the kind of ill effects and suffering that bartlett encountered.
accordingly,the district court properly allowed bartlett to show that sulindac was in a defective condition by showing that it was unreasonably dangerous due to its propensity to cause a harrowing hypersensitivity reaction characterized by necrosis of the skin and mucous membranes,and often causing blindness or death.although mutual could still have avoided liability by proving that sulindac was unavoidably unsafe but was highly useful and had an adequate safety warning,bartlett,d at restatement second torts,cmt.k,mutual abandoned that defense on the eve of trial 
mutual restates its argument as an issue of causation but given the overwhelming evidence that sulindac triggered bartlett reaction,but for cause is plainly established,bartlett,d at.mutual position that bartlett could not present evidence that a defect in the sulindac proximately caused her injury,merely restates the argument about new hampshire law that we have just rejected.
preemption.the most of mutual objections is that bartlett design defect claim is preempted by the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act,et fdca,and in particular by the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of,stat.codified at j a hatch waxman amendments,and its regulations.whether and to what extent the fdca preempts design defect claims against generic drug manufacturers is a question of exceptional importance that the supreme court has yet to decide.
because prescription drugs and their warnings are closely regulated by the fda,congress might explicitly,or the supreme court by implication,have preempted state design defect or inadequate warning claims that allow state juries to the fda seal of approval.but the statute contains no general preemption provision,and in wyeth levine,the supreme court rejected implied preemption,saying that congress did not intend fda oversight to be the exclusive means of ensuring drug safety and effectiveness,id.at,and that state law serves as a complementary form of drug regulation,id.at.
although wyeth holding was technically limited to claims its logic applies to design defect claims as well.see wyeth,at state tort suits motivat e manufacturers to produce safe and effective drugs and to give adequate warnings emphasis added wimbush wyeth,cir negligent marketing claim not preempted.the lower courts agree that the fdca does not preempt state tort suits against drug manufacturers.see riegel medtronic,ginsburg,dissenting collecting cases.
however,in pliva,mensing,the court carved out an exception to wyeth,finding that the fdca preempts claims against generic drug manufacturers.generic drug manufacturers,unlike manufacturers,can not unilaterally change their labels,a iv,and thus can not comply with both federal labeling standards and state law requirements deviating from those standards.pliva.at.
there is no doubt that congress wanted to reduce medical costs by spurring generic copycat drugs,and accordingly generic manufacturers do not,after patent protection lapses,need separate fda approval to manufacture approved drugs or employ their approved labeling.see pliva.at,id.at see also j a.but,as the generic maker can not alter the labeling,pliva held that congress can not have wanted the generic to pay damages under state law for a label that the fda required.
mutual argues with some force that the generic maker also can not alter the composition of the drug and so pliva policy of encouraging generics by preempting state tort claims should extend to design defect as well as claims based on inadequate warning.but although mutual can not legally make sulindac in another composition nor is it apparent how it could alter a drug anyway,it certainly can choose not to make the drug at all and the fdca might permit states to tell mutual it ought not be doing so if analysis weights against the drug,despite what the supreme court made of similar arguments in the labeling context.
this is the fda unless new information emerged known to the maker but not the fda,but wyeth resolved the conflict against general preemption.and,not only has the supreme court not yet said it would extend pliva exception to design defect claims,but while the generic maker has no choice as to label the decision to make the drug and market it in new hampshire is wholly its own.thus,bartlett having lost her warning claim by the mere chance of her drug store selection of a generic,the supreme court might be less ready to deprive bartlett of her remaining avenue of relief.
true,such arguments can be turned on their head to refuse preemption here is consistent with wyeth but in tension not with the holding but with part of pliva rationale a generic maker can avoid defective warning lawsuits as well as design defect lawsuits by not making the drug and while pliva is itself a limited departure from a general rule of wyeth,an extension of pliva to design defect claims would comprise a general rule for generics although not one pliva expressly adopted.
on balance,we conclude that the court adopted a general rule in wyeth and that it is up to the supreme court to decide whether pliva exception is to be enlarged to include design defect claims.khan state oil,cir,vacated and remanded.given the widespread use of generic drugs and the developing split in the lower courts,see note,above,this issue needs a decisive answer from the only court that can supply it.
expert testimony.next in the crosshairs are bartlett experts randall tackett and burn surgeon roger salisbury.mutual argues they were not qualified to offer their opinions,and that the opinions were either unreliable or undisclosed in their expert reports.the governing law is set forth in the federal rules of evidence and civil procedure and daubert merrell dow,which makes the judge the gatekeeper to assure that purported scientific evidence has legitimate basis.we review for abuse of discretion,milward acuity specialty prods,cir,cert.denied,and find none here.
tackett and salisbury offered a variety of opinions,the most relevant here relating to sulindac risks and benefits.the district court found unreliable any explicit opinion that sulindac has a higher risk of causing than other nsaids what it called an opinion about relative risk.but otherwise,the district court allowed bartlett experts 
to opine that sulindac overall profile was unfavorable for marketing 
to opine that aspirin and acetaminophen,which have no known connection to,are safer alternatives to sulindac 
to discuss voluntary adverse event reports aers from prescribing doctors to the fda,and the limitations of such data 
to opine based on the number of aers and an estimated number of sulindac the reporting rate of,and to compare drugs reporting rates 
to offer various opinions about the inadequacy of sulindac warning to counteract its dangerousness 
and to opine that the fda lacks the resources to ensure that all marketed drugs are safe and effective.
mutual argues that the two experts were not qualified,noting that neither witness ever prescribed an nsaid,and tackett is not authorized to prescribe any drugs.but salisbury is a burn surgeon with over years experience who treated more than patients with.tackett is a pharmacologist and pharmacology professor with over years experience.both had some experience with the fda through their citizen petition requesting an risk assessment and labeling change for ibuprofen.and their reports demonstrate substantial familiarity with the relevant medical literature.
alternatively,mutual argues that the opinions lack scientific basis and were inadmissibly unreliable,focusing on their use of aers,voluntary reports from medical professionals and consumers to the fda regarding patients adverse reactions to pharmaceuticals.the fda collects this information and relevant data for sulindac included reports of from to,increasing to by cases of death and one of the highest reporting rates among nsaids.
mutual says there are no quality controls on spontaneous reports that various biases may increase reporting,including increased reporting following introduction of a new warning a phenomenon called the weber effect and the difficulty of determining the number of total prescriptions denominator data to determine a reporting rate.the fda itself warns that a ccumulated case reports can not be used to calculate incidence or estimates of drug risk.mutual also argues there is no accepted methodology for comparing drugs based on adverse event data.
but proof that a significant number of adverse reports exists is part of the calculus and surely relevant input for a witness who is prepared to opine on the ratio based on a range of considerations.mutual own designated expert,robert stern,relied on adverse event data and comparative reporting rates in a publication designed to quantify the risk of associated with the use of nsaids mockenhaupt.and the fda itself considered the reporting rate of bextra another nsaid in recommending its withdrawal,and published a study comparing reporting rates among certain nsaids.
as for biases that might distort the level of reporting,these are usually matters to be developed on and go to the weight of the evidence unless the biases are so overwhelming as to make the data useless.and,as icing on the cake,at least one limitation of adverse event data under reporting actually works in bartlett favor.bartlett,d at.controlled studies would likely be superior but apparently none were available to quantify sulindac incidence of causing.id.at.
mutual is correct that in some cases courts found aers and similar case reports insufficient to establish that a drug caused a certain adverse event,but these involved adverse events with innum
