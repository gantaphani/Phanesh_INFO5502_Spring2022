we will first review the removal provisions at issue.under u.a,defendants may generally remove civil actions from state court to federal district court so long as the district court would have had jurisdiction had the case been originally filed before it when a case is removable under a,and a plaintiff seeks remand,the plaintiff must identify a provision that prohibits removal.breuer jim concrete of brevard,d.r emoval statutes are to be strictly construed against removal and all doubts should be resolved in favor of remand.batoff state farm ins,cir quoting steel valley auth.union switch signal,cir.
plaintiffs contend that gsk most recent removal did not comply with the time limits for removal set forth in b section b contains two paragraphs,the first of which provides 
the notice of removal of a civil action or proceeding shall be filed within thirty days after the receipt by the defendant,through service or otherwise,of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief upon which such action or proceeding is based,or within thirty days after the service of summons upon the defendant if such initial pleading has then been filed in court and is not required to be served on the defendant,whichever period is shorter.
b.the second paragraph is an exception to the first paragraph.id.it provides 
if the case stated by the initial pleading is not removable,a notice of removal may be filed within thirty days after receipt by the defendant,through service or otherwise,of a copy of an amended pleading,motion,order or other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable,except that a case may not be removed on the basis of diversity jurisdiction more than year after commencement of the action.
plaintiffs also claim that the order denying remand violated u.d.that section provides that a n order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.d.though the statutory text is ostensibly broad in scope,the supreme court has not read it literally.it has held that d only bars review of orders that remand cases pursuant to c,which addresses remand based upon a lack of subject matter jurisdiction or a defect in the removal process.quackenbush allstate ins,d o nly remands based on grounds specified in c are immune from review under d.quotation marks omitted see also feidt owens corning fiberglas,cir section c provides for remand on the basis of either a procedural defect or lack of jurisdiction.if remand was based on either of those grounds,then review of the order is barred under d.agostini piper aircraft,cir.
for the reasons set forth herein,gsk is prohibited by b and remand is required.
gsk argues that b first paragraph does not bar its second removal because it does not impose any time limits on successive removals.gsk br.while the first paragraph does not explicitly mention successive removals,as gsk notes,it also does not explicitly mention first removals.instead,it uses the general term t he notice of removal,meaning the notice of removal by which the case came before the district court,and it is clear that this notice of removal must be filed within thirty days of receipt of the initial pleading.b.thus,although paragraph one does not expressly forbid successive removals it does expressly forbid untimely removals.here,the relevant notice of removal was untimely it was filed over a year and a half after gsk was served with the initial pleading,namely the state court complaint.app.because gsk second removal occurred more than thirty days after its receipt of the initial pleading,it did not comply with the first paragraph and gsk can not remove on that basis.
the second paragraph does not relieve gsk of the first paragraph bar.it is an exception to the time limit in the first paragraph.this paragraph sets a separate time limit that applies when the case stated by the initial pleading is not removable and the defendant receives an amended pleading,motion,order or other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable.b.in diversity cases,the second paragraph has a fourth requirement removal may not occur more than year after the commencement of the action.id.we will address the relevant requirements in turn.
even assuming the case stated by the initial pleading was not removable,gsk also can not rely on the second paragraph because there was no amended pleading,motion,order or other paper to trigger its time limit.in general,the terms amended pleading,motion,order or other paper only address developments within a case and,therefore,court decisions in different cases do not count as an order.dahl reynolds tobacco,cir see also green reynolds tobacco,cir collecting cases.this is because i f congress had intended new developments in the law to trigger the recommencement of the thirty day time limit,it could have easily added language making it clear that b was not only addressing developments within a case and the fact that the documents are listed in a logical sequence in the development of an individual case makes it an unsupported stretch to interpret order to include a decision in a separate case with different parties.dahl,at.
our court has recognized a narrow exception to the general rule that orders issued in other cases do not qualify as a b order.in doe american red cross,the red cross removed a case on the ground that its congressional charter conferred federal question jurisdiction.at.the district court disagreed and remanded the case.id.at.next,the supreme court decided american national red cross,d,which held that the red cross charter conferred federal question jurisdiction and gave the specific and unequivocal direction that the red cross was thereby authorized to removal from state to federal court of any action it is defending.doe,at quoting,at.
the red cross the case within thirty days of and plaintiffs moved to remand,arguing,among other things,that was not an order under b second paragraph.the doe court disagreed,holding that was an order,but it included an important qualification.to qualify as an order under b,a court decision in another case must be sufficiently related to a pending case,meaning that the order in the case came from a court superior in the same judicial hierarchy was directed at a particular defendant and expressly authorized that same defendant to remove an action against it in another case involving similar facts and legal issues.id.at.it was this last requirement that made unique.id.according to doe,was not simply an order emanating from an unrelated action.id.at.rather,it was an unequivocal order directed to a party to the pending litigation,explicitly authorizing it to remove any cases it is defending.id.
johnson is no johnson rejected the reasoning that led to the remand of this case,as it held that gsk is a delaware citizen,but it did not include the explicit authorization to remove other pending cases.put simply,johnson merely affirmed an order denying remand in the case before it.powell,wl,at.accordingly,johnson does not qualify as an order under doe.
in an attempt to extend doe,gsk cites to a pair of cases for the proposition that this court can ignore doe third requirement.see green,young chubb grp.of ins,d.these courts held that a decision in another case qualified as an order under b even though the decision did not explicitly discuss removal,much less specifically authorize removal in pending cases.green,at see young,d at.in effect,gsk wants this court to rely on these cases and hold that any subsequent decision involving the same defendant impacting removability is an order under b.
our binding precedent in doe made clear,however,that its ruling was narrow and meant to apply in unique circumstances,namely compliance with a higher court holding that explicitly authorized a particular party to remove all of its pending cases to federal court.doe,at.to treat all subsequent decisions involving the same defendant as part of a specific pending case would move the doe rule from the unique to the typical.
moreover,if a party in a pending case could each time it received a favorable ruling in another case,could be a means to disrupt the proceedings in the pending case.wilson intercollegiate big ten conference athletic ass n,cir noting that one of the purposes of removal time limits is prevent ing the delay and waste of resources involved in starting a case over in a second court after significant proceedings may have taken place in the first court.for these reasons,doe is appropriately limited to the unique circumstances that arose in that case and we decline to expand the definition of order to include orders entered in any case involving the same defendant 
because johnson did not explicitly direct removal of all cases involving gsk,but only affirmed the order denying remand of the case,it is not an order that triggers a new time period to remove plaintiffs case.for this additional reason,the second paragraph of b does not provide a basis for removal.
gsk is also barred from removal based upon the second paragraph limitation,which prohibits removal of diversity cases more than one year after the case commences.here,the case commenced on september,and the notice of removal at issue was filed on june,more than a year and a half later.app.
this time limit is procedural,not jurisdictional.ariel land owners,dring,cir.for that reason,the time limit may be equitably tolled in certain circumstances.see tedford warner lambert,cir recognizing equitable tolling exception to the removal limitation podobnik postal,cir holding that a time limitation may be modified by equitable concerns,such as tolling.
equitable tolling is not warranted in this case.cases involving equitable tolling of the time limit often focus on intentional misconduct by the plaintiff.see,tedford,at where a plaintiff has attempted to manipulate the statutory rules for determining federal removal jurisdiction,thereby preventing the defendant from exercising its rights,equity may require that the limit in b be extended.namey malcolm,d,holding that equitable exception to limitation did not apply because defendants have not met their burden of demonstrating sufficient culpability on the part of plaintiffs.at the time this case was commenced,equitable tolling also may have been proper for reasons other than party misconduct see vogel office prods,d,equitably tolling first paragraph time limit to allow where initial removal notice simply disappeared,even though plaintiffs had not engaged in behavior which might estop them from pursuit of remand,rev on other grounds,cir.
while the contours of equitable tolling vary from context to context,this court and the supreme court have held that equitable tolling may be appropriate if a litigant can demonstrate that he has been pursuing his rights diligently,and that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.pace diguglielmo,d habeas case oshiver levin,fishbein,sedran berman,cir holding time limit to file an eeoc charge may be tolled where the plaintiff in some extraordinary way has been prevented from asserting his or her rights but noting that a plaintiff who fails to exercise this reasonable diligence may lose the benefit of equitable tolling.
gsk argues that extraordinary circumstances thwarted its initial removal.gsk br.according to gsk,the extraordinary circumstances were that the remand proceedings were consolidated before a judge who had previously held that gsk was a citizen of pennsylvania and therefore was likely to find that remand was proper and that the district court erroneously remanded the case.
neither is an extraordinary circumstance.section of title provides t
