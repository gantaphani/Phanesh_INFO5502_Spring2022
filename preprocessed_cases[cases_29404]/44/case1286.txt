opinion of the court 
we weave our way in this appeal through the supreme court labyrinthine state action jurisprudence.the question presented is whether foster parents are state actors for purposes of liability under.we hold that they are not.
when appellant karen leshko was years old,her foster mother,appellee judy servis,placed her in the kitchen sink of the servis home to wash her.next to the sink was a large pot of exceedingly hot water.servis left the room.little karen pulled the pot over on herself,sustaining severe burns across much of her abdomen,legs and.neither servis nor her husband sought medical treatment for karen for more than twelve hours.
when she turned eighteen,karen leshko sued dauphin county pennsylvania social services for children and youth,dauphin county,and various county officials under for depriving her of her fourteenth amendment right to be free from physical harm,and under state negligence and constitutional theories.leshko also sued the servises,alleging liability under and state tort law.the district court dismissed the complaint in its entirety for failure to state a claim.leshko appeals only the district court dismissal of her claim against the servises,inasmuch as the court held that the servises were not state actors.
leshko was placed in the servis home in by the dauphin county social services for children and youth after being removed from her mother.the record reveals neither the reason for leshko removal,nor whether leshko mother consented to the removal.the laws governing foster care in pennsylvania are substantially the same today as they were in.a child in pennsylvania can be placed in foster care after being adjudicated a dependent child.in re frank.a dependent child in pennsylvania is one deemed by the commonwealth to be abandoned,illegally offered for care or adoption,or lacking proper parental care or control,subsistence,education as required by law,or other care or control necessary for his physical,mental,or emotional health,or morals.matter of adoption of.foster care is not the only option available for dependent children a court might alternatively order a dependent child to remain with his parents or guardian under court supervision,be transferred to the custody of an authorized private organization,or be transferred to the custody of an authorized public agency.in re lowry.state regulations govern the foster care relationship,and government funding is provided.see in re adoption of crystal.apparently for the first time,a pennsylvania court held in that foster parents in pennsylvania are county employees under pennsylvania political subdivision tort claims act.patterson lycoming county,
the fourteenth amendment provides that n o state shall deprive any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law const.amend.xiv.this amendment governs only state action,not the actions of private citizens or organizations.kohn,d citing,inter alia,civil rights cases.section subjects to liability those who deprive persons of federal constitutional or statutory rights under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage of a state.see.we consider actions under color of law as the equivalent of state action under the fourteenth amendment,at.benn universal health,cir.thus,to state a claim of liability under,leshko must allege that she was deprived of a federal constitutional or statutory right by a state actor.see benn,at.the servises concede that leshko alleges a deprivation of a constitutional right,as they must under nicini morra,cir en banc holding that a state may be liable for conduct toward foster children that shock s the conscience,so this appeal turns solely on whether the servises are state actors.
supreme court cases under the fourteenth amendment draw no simple line between states and private persons.brentwood acad.tennessee secondary sch.athletic ass n,d.the principal question at stake is whether there is such a close nexus between the state and the challenged action that seemingly private behavior may be fairly treated as that of the state itself.id.quoting jackson metro.edison,d.following the supreme court guidance for answering that expansive question,we attempt to align the case at hand with the supreme court case most factually akin to it.see robert stetson,cir brentwood,at.noting that a host of facts can bear on the fairness of attributing action to the state and counseling that a midst such variety,examples may be the best teachers.in adhering to that approach,facts are crucial.crissman dover downs entm t,cir en banc.
state action cases broadly divide into two factual categories.see brentwood,at.the first category involves an activity that is significantly encouraged by the state or in which the state acts as a joint participant.see blum yaretsky,d holding state action to be present where the state provides significant encouragement,either overt or covert for the activity lugar edmondson oil,d holding state action to be present where private citizen employed challenged state prejudgment attachment process,thus participating in the state action.determining state action in such cases requires tracing the activity to its source to see if that source fairly can be said to be the state.the question is whether the fingerprints of the state are on the activity itself.
the second category of cases involves an actor that is controlled by the state,performs a function delegated by the state,or is entwined with government policies or management.see pennsylvania bd.of dir.of city trusts of philadelphia,d per curiam holding private organization to be state actor where the organization was controlled by a state agency west atkins,d holding private doctor to be state actor where,in an institutional context,he performed a function traditionally and exclusively reserved to the state brentwood,at.holding ostensibly private association to be state actor because of the pervasive entwinement of public institutions and public officials in its composition and workings see also burton wilmington parking,d holding private business to be state actor where there were mutual benefits between the state and the business.determining state action in this category of cases consists of asking whether the actor is so integrally related to the state that it is fair to impute to the state responsibility for the action.the question here is whether the state so identifies with the individual or entity who took the challenged action that we deem the state fingerprints to have been on the action 
we see no allegation in leshko complaint that the commonwealth of pennsylvania condoned the servises decisions to leave leshko sitting unattended next to a pot of hot water and not to seek immediate medical attention,let alone significantly encouraged or participated in them.to the contrary,the general rule in pennsylvania is that courts should direct dependent children to the custody of the person or organization best suited to the safety,protection and physical,mental,and moral welfare of the child.a in re lowry,at.leshko notes that pennsylvania comprehensively regulates foster care,and funds that care together with its counties,and asks that we therefore infer a sufficiently close nexus between the servises and pennsylvania that we deem their decisions to be the commonwealth.but the supreme court repeatedly has rejected that argument,see,american manufacturers mutual insurance sullivan,d holding that a ction taken by private entities with the mere approval or acquiescence of the state is not state action,as have we,see,crissman,at holding that detailed regulation and receipt of state funds,without more,do not create state action quotation omitted.leshko does not allege that pennsylvania forced or encouraged,or jointly participated in,the services negligent behavior,and therefore she states no claim of state action on the basis of state regulation and funding 
while leshko invokes the full array of theories of state action,only one arguably applies to her case.there is no sense in which the servises are a state agency akin to the college board in board of directors of city trusts of philadelphia,which held that a college board of directors was a state agency because,while privately created and endowed,the existence and activity of the board were authorized by statute.at.nor is any kind of entwinement,pervasive or otherwise,alleged between the operation of the servis home and public institutions and officials.see brentwood,at.further,we have expressed our resolve to limit application of burton s symbiotic relationship test to cases with facts replicating burton s,see crissman,at,and this case does not test that resolve.burton involved a private business that funneled substantial funds into government coffers through a lucrative lease.at.we recognize that the servises ostensibly served the state,and they received government funds so there may have been some mutual benefit.but that is not enough.the supreme court long has taught that a private entity performs a function which serves the public does not make its acts state action,at.given that no tangible benefit flowed to pennsylvania through the servises,benn,at,we have no occasion to revive burton.our focus thus narrows to whether the servises were delegated a traditionally and exclusively state function.jackson,at.that is a closer question.
state employees as state actors 
leshko would like us to resolve the public function question in her favor on the simple ground that under pennsylvania law the servises were public employees.we can not do so,though we acknowledge the force in her argument.in pennsylvania,a ny person who is acting or who has acted on behalf of a governmental unit,whether on a permanent or temporary basis,whether compensated or not,is an employee of that governmental unit.as we noted earlier,a pennsylvania appellate court has held that under foster parents are employees of the county children and youth services agency that designates them foster parents.see patterson,at.the district court dismissed leshko tort claim against the servises in light of that case,holding that the immunity provided by pennsylvania tort claims statute applied to the servises as county employees.leshko finds it anomalous that the servises successfully contended in the district court that they are employees of the county,and yet claim here not to be state actors for purposes of liability under.
we acknowledge the seeming aspect of the servises litigation strategy,but the law is on their side.it is true that the supreme court in west declared that state employment is generally sufficient to render the defendant a state actor,at.quoting lugar,at,and observed that the only time it had held that a state employee was not a state actor was in the case of a public defender,who was tasked with acting as the state adversary.id.at.citing polk county dodson,d.nevertheless,by its own terms,west does not allow state definitions to dictate federal court decisions under.the doctor in west was employed by contract with the state,but that employment did not automatically make him a state actor.the ultimate question in west,as in all state action cases,was whether the doctor conduct was fairly attributable to the state.id.at.it is the physician function within the state system,not the precise terms of his employment,that determines whether his actions can fairly be attributed to the state,the court explained.id.at.
west s approach fits with the supreme court teaching that private contractors are not automatically state actors under,even if the state is their only patron.see,at.it also accords with the principle that labels are not dispositive in state action cases.see brentwood,at.looking to the reality over the form of the servises relationship with pennsylvania,see crissman,at,it is clear that they much more closely resemble the private nursing home contractor held not to be a state actor in than the officials the supreme court has held acted under color of state law by virtue of their governmental positions.see monroe pape,d police officers parratt taylor,d prison officials zinermon burch,d state hospital officials.as we rejected in crissman the notion that a state law designating private actors as state agents makes them state actors per se,at,we reject the proposition that pennsylvania characterization of the servises as employees automatically makes them state actors.see rayburn hogue,cir holding that possession of immunity from tort suit as employees of state does not make foster parents state actors.
foster care in pennsylvania 
the question remains,then,whether the servises performed a traditionally and exclusively public function.if so,regardless of their formal designation by the state,they are state actors.the issue thus becomes precisely what function of the servises to choose as our object of comparison.should it be their overall duties as foster parents should it be their daily care for leshko physical needs should it be their decisions related to leshko injuries the question is critical,for its answer may be outcome determinative.the supreme court appears to employ varying approaches to this issue.sometimes the court seems to identify the function broadly,as in,which held in a teachers suit for unlawful termination that the education of maladjusted high school students is not traditionally and exclusively governmental.at.at other times,the court takes a narrower view,as in blum,which held in a patients suit for unlawful transfer from a nursing home that decisions made in the administration of the home were not traditionally and exclusively governmental.at.we will follow the approach in west,which employs the broad methodology of.we follow west because,though there are critical factual differences between west and the present case,the claim in that administration of medical closely parallels leshko.in west,the supreme court considered broadly whether the provision of medical services to injured inmates was a traditionally exclusive governmental function.at.sullivan,at.describing function considered in west as provid ing medical treatment to injured inmates.we thus will ask whether the provision of care to children in foster homes is a traditionally exclusive governmental function.
no aspect of providing care to foster children in pennsylvania has ever been the exclusive province of the government even today,while removing children from their homes and placing them with other caregivers arguably are exclusively governmental functions in pennsylvania,the care may be tendered by families,private organizations,or public agencies,see,and thus is not exclusively governmental.organized placement of children in foster homes began in century pennsylvania as a service of private societies to protect children from cruelty.see leroy ashby,endangered children dependency,neglect,and abuse in american history the pennsylvania society for the prevention of cruelty to children,for example,regularly removed children from their homes in the and placed them in institutions or with other families.id.at.between and,two organizations in philadelphia,the home missionary society of philadelphia and the children aid society of pennsylvania,placed some children in foster homes.see priscilla ferguson clement,families and foster care philadelphia in the late nineteenth century,in growing up in america children in historical perspective,ray hiner joseph hawes.m ost children entrusted to the care of these agencies were not vagrants picked up by the police nor indigent children removed from their homes by budding social workers,but youngsters whose families deliberately relinquished them to child care agencies.id.at.in,pennsylvania began supervising the placement of children in foster care and regulating that care.see act of may,to regulate the treatment and control of dependent,neglected,and delinquent children hereinafter juvenile act mansfield case,holding statute unconstitutional under pennsylvania constitution commonwealth fisher,holding revised statute constitutional.thus,while over time pennsylvania began to administer aspects of the foster care system previously performed privately,providing care has never been,and is not now,an exclusively governmental function.see milburn anne arundel county dep t of soc.serv,cir concl
