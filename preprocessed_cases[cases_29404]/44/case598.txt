plaintiffs appellants wing chau and harding advisory llc appeal from a march,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york daniels,j dismissing their claims of libel against defendants appellees author michael lewis,his source,steven eisman,and lewis publisher,norton,for allegedly defamatory statements in lewis book the big short.the district court granted defendants motion for summary judgment and dismissed each of plaintiffs claims.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
the united states housing market collapse in and the ensuing global financial crisis are widely considered the worst financial disasters since the great depression their causes have been hotly debated.one of the many books that explore the genesis of the financial decline is the big short inside the doomsday machine,written by defendant michael lewis and published in by defendant norton.a work of,the big short looks at a small group of iconoclasts who shorted,or bet against,the subprime mortgage bond market at a time when most investors thought real estate prices would continue to rise,were long.one of the iconoclasts described in the big short is defendant steve eisman,who managed a hedge fund and served as one of lewis sources for the book.like many of lewis previous books,a great number of which have dealt with business and financial topics,the big short met with considerable success and spent weeks on the new york times list.
thankfully,we do not have to weigh in on the root of america fiscal crisis.the task before us is much more focused to determine whether one chapter of the big short chapter,titled spider man at the venetian contains statements that are defamatory to plaintiffs wing chau and his business harding advisory.
chapter comprises pages of the page,book,and of that chapter focuses on a dinner conversation that took place in january at the wynn las vegas hotel during the american securitization forum.the dinner was notable in its design to introduce people who shorted the market to the people who went long.eisman was in attendance and was seated next to chau.
chau,an investment professional,is the founder and owner of harding advisory llc.he received a ba in economics from the university of rhode island and an mba from babson college.after graduating from babson,he spent the next twelve years of his career in structured finance.for five years,he worked as an analyst specializing in securities at salomon smith barney and prudential securities,then spent two years as a portfolio manager at new york life investment management.with the experience he gained in securities through his work at those firms,chau set off on his own in and founded harding advisory.at the time of the january dinner,harding was a manager of collateralized debt commonly known as cdos and was on its way to issuing more cdos by volume than any other cdo manager.
spider man at the venetian recounts eisman interaction and discussions with chau at that dinner and paints cdo managers in general,and plaintiffs in particular,in a negative light.in response to this chapter representations,chau sued lewis for writing,norton for publishing,and eisman for communicating to lewis allegedly defamatory statements reproduced below.the district court granted summary judgment to defendants,finding that none of the statements were actionable defamation because they either were substantially true,were not of or concerning plaintiffs,were not reasonably susceptible to any defamatory meaning,or were mere opinions rather than assertions of fact.plaintiffs now appeal,arguing that the court erred in most of its findings.for the following reasons,we affirm.
statements at issue 
these statements are as they appear in the book,except that the bolded language in each statement is the language that was bolded by the district court in its decision.
when eisman asked exactly what harding advisory advised,wing chau explained that he was a cdo manager.i had no idea there was such a thing as a cdo manager,said eisman.i did know there was anything to manage.
statement,the big short at.
he graduated from the university of rhode island,earned a business degree at babson college,and spent most of his career working sleepy jobs at sleepy life insurance companies but all that was in the past.
statement,id.at.
danny did know wing chau,but when he heard that he was the end buyer of subprime cdos,he knew exactly who he was the sucker.
statement,id.at.
when they saw that lippman had seated eisman right next to the sucker,both danny and vinny had the same thought oh no.this is going to end well.eisman could contain himself.he figure out the guy was a fool,and let him know it,and then where would they be they needed fools only fools would take the other side of their trades.
statement,id.at.
later,whenever eisman set out to explain to others the origins of the financial crisis,he start with his dinner with wing chau.only now did he fully appreciate the central importance of the mezzanine cdo the cdo composed mainly of subprime mortgage bonds and its synthetic counterpart the cdo composed entirely of credit default swaps on a subprime mortgage bonds.you have to understand this,he say.this was the engine of doom.he draw a picture of several towers of debt.the first tower was the original subprime loans that had been piled together.at the top of this tower was the tranche,just below it the tranche,and so on down to the riskiest,tranche the bonds eisman had bet against.the wall street firms had taken these tranches the worst of the worst to build yet another tower of bonds a cdo.a collateralized debt obligation.the reason they done this is that the rating agencies,presented with the pile of bonds backed by dubious loans,would pronounce percent of the bonds in it.these bonds could then be sold to investors pension funds,insurance companies which were allowed to invest only in highly rated securities.it came as news to eisman that this ship of doom was piloted by wing chau and people like him.
statement,id.at.
the guy controlled roughly billion,invested in nothing but cdos backed by the tranche of a mortgage bond or,as eisman put it,the equivalent of three levels of dog shit lower than the original bonds.
statement,id.at.
all by himself,chau generated vast demand for the riskiest slices of subprime mortgage bonds,for which there had previously been essentially no demand.this demand led inexorably to the supply of new home loans,as material for the bonds.the soy sauce in which eisman his edamame was shared by a man who had made it possible for tens of thousands of actual human beings to be handed money they could never afford to repay.
statement,id.at 
as it happened,frontpoint partners had spent a lot of time digging around in those loans,and knew that the default rates were already sufficient to wipe out wing chau entire portfolio.god,eisman said to him.you must be having a hard time.no,wing chau said.i sold everything out.statement,id.at.
it made no sense.the cdo manager job was to select the wall street firm to supply him with subprime bonds that served as the collateral for cdo investors,and then to vet the bonds themselves.the cdo manager was further charged with monitoring the hundred or so individual subprime bonds inside each cdo,and replacing the bad ones,before they went bad,with better ones.that,however,was mere theory in practice,the sorts of investors who handed their money to wing chau,and thus bought the tranche of cdos german banks,taiwanese insurance companies,japanese farmers unions,european pension funds,and,in general,entities more or less required to invest in bonds did so precisely because they were meant to be foolproof,impervious to losses,and unnecessary to monitor or even think about very much.the cdo manager,in practice,did do much of anything,which is why all sorts of unlikely people suddenly hoped to become one.
statement,id.at.
two guys and a bloomberg terminal in new jersey was wall street shorthand for the typical cdo manager.
statement,id.at.
the less mentally alert the two guys,and the fewer the questions they asked about the subprime bonds they were absorbing into their cdos,the more likely they were to be patronized by the big wall street firms.
statement,id.at.
the whole point of the cdo was to launder a lot of subprime mortgage market risk that the firms had been unable to place straightforwardly.the last thing you wanted was a cdo manager who asked lots of tough questions.
statement,id.at.
the bond market had created what amounted to a double agent a character who seemed to represent the interests of investors when he better represented the interests of wall street bond trading desks.
statement,id.at.
to assure the big investors who had handed their billions to him that he had their deep interests at heart,the cdo manager kept ownership of what was called the equity,or first loss piece,of the cdo the piece that vanished first when the subprime loans that ultimately supplied the cdo with cash defaulted now,almost giddily,chau explained to eisman that he simply passed all the risk that the underlying home loans would default on to the big investors who had hired him to vet the bonds.
statement,id.at.
but the cdo manager was also paid a fee of percent off the top,before any of his investors saw a dime,and another,similar fee,off the bottom,as his investor received their money back.that does sound like much,but,when you running tens of billions of dollars with little effort and no overhead,it adds up.just a few years earlier,wing chau was making a year managing a portfolio for the new york life insurance company.in one year as a cdo manager,he taken home million,the haul from half a dozen lifetimes of working at new york life his job was to be the cdo expert,but he actually did spend a lot of time worrying about what was in cdos.
statement,id.at.
his goal,he explained,was to maximize the dollars in his care.he was now doing this so well that,from january until the market crashed in september,harding advisory would be the world biggest subprime cdo manager.
statement,id.at.
among its other achievements,harding had established itself as the buyer for merrill lynch awesome cdo machine,notorious not only for its rate of production merrill created twice as many of the things as the next biggest wall street firm but also for its industrial waste its cdos were later proven to be easily the worst.
statement,id.at.
he managed the cdos,said eisman,but managed what i was just appalled that the structured finance market could be so insane as to allow someone to manage a cdo portfolio without having any exposure to the cdos.people would pay up to have someone manage their cdos as if this moron was helping you.i thought,you prick,you do give a fuck about the investors in this thing.
statement,id.at.
chau real job was to serve as a new kind of front man for the wall street firms he hired investors felt better buying a merrill lynch cdo if it did appear to be run by merrill lynch.
statement,id.at.
then he says something that blew my mind,said eisman.he says,i love guys like you who short my market.without you i do have anything to buy.
statement,id.at.
that when steve eisman finally understood the madness of the machine.he and vinny and danny had been making these side bets with goldman sachs and deutsche bank on the fate of the tranche of subprime bonds without fully understanding why those firms were so eager to accept them.now he was with the actual human being on the other side of his credit default swaps.now he got it the credit default swaps,filtered through the cdos,were being used to replicate bonds backed by actual home loans.there were enough americans with shitty credit taking out loans to satisfy investors appetite for the end product.wall street needed his bets in order to synthesize more of them.they were satisfied getting lots of unqualified borrowers to borrow money to buy a house they could afford,said eisman.they were creating them out of whole cloth.one hundred times over that why the losses in the financial system are so much greater than just the subprime loans.that when i realized they needed us to keep the machine running.i was like,this is allowed 
statement,id.at.
wing chau did know he been handpicked by greg lippmann to persuade steve eisman that the people on the other end of his credit default swaps were either crooks or morons,but he played the role anyway.
statement,id.at.
between shots of sake he told eisman that he would rather have billion in crappy cdos than none at all,as he was paid mainly on volume.
statement,id.at.
he told eisman that his main fear was that the economy would strengthen,and dissuade hedge funds from placing bigger bets against the subprime mortgage market.
statement,id.at.
but when the meal was over,they watched eisman grab greg lippmann,point to wing chau,and say,whatever that guy is buying,i want to short it.lippmann took it as a joke,but eisman was completely serious he wanted to place a bet specifically against wing chau.greg,eisman said,i want to short his paper.sight unseen.thus far eisman had bought only credit default swaps on subprime mortgage bonds from now on he buy specifically credit default swaps on wing chau cdos.
statement,id.at.
upon their return they raised it to million,with new bets against the cdos created by wing chau.with only million under management,the position now overwhelmed their portfolio.
statement,id.at.
the parties and district court assume without discussion that new york substantive law applies to this defamation action.when a federal court sits in diversity,it applies the choice of law rules of the forum state,here new york.see klaxon stentor.the parties briefs assume that new york law controls,and such implied consent is sufficient to establish choice of law.krumme westpoint stevens,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
when deciding how to construe allegedly defamatory words which when written or in print constitute libel courts must do so in the context of the publication as a whole,not just the paragraph or chapter containing them,and do so in the same way that the reading public,acquainted with the parties and the subject would take them.sydney macfadden newspaper publ g,n.in new york,a plaintiff must establish five elements to recover in libel a written defamatory factual statement concerning the plaintiff publication to a third party fault falsity of the defamatory statement and special damages or per se actionability.celle filipino reporter,cir.on closer inspection,the first element of these five is actually composed of multiple parts there must be a a writing,it must be b defamatory,it must be c factual that is,not opinion and it must be d about the plaintiff,not just a general statement.issues b,c,and d take up the bulk of our analysis in the present case,with the remainder dealing with the falsity of the defamatory statement.we find,for the reasons below,the statements at issue all fail to fulfill one or more of these elements,making them unable to serve as the basis for a cause of action.accordingly,the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants is affirmed.
statements that simply are not defamatory in meaning 
not all or even most maligning remarks can be considered defamatory.a statement is defamatory if it exposes an individual to public hatred,shame,obloquy,contumely,odium,contempt,ridicule,aversion,ostracism,degradation or disgrace,or induce s an evil opinion of one in the minds of persons,and deprive s one of their confidence and friendly intercourse in society.kimmerle evening journal.a statement,therefore,can meet all of the other elements of defamation be factual,published,false,and about the plaintiff but still not be actionable if it fails to rise to the necessary level of derogation.to be actionable,therefore,the statement must do more than cause discomfort or affront the statement is measured not by the sensitivities of the maligned,but the critique of reasonable minds that would think the speech attributes odious or despicable characterizations to its subject.
if a statement is susceptible to only a single meaning,the court must determine,as a matter of law,whether that one meaning is defamatory.see aronson wiersma.of course,a statement or word is often capable of more than one definition,and in that case,in new york,courts employ an ordinary person standard to determine if that statement is reasonably susceptible to a defamatory connotation.james gannett.
statements,and are not reasonably susceptible to a defamatory connotation and are therefore.statement,for example,purports to quote chau stating i sold everything out.it is unclear how such a quote,true or not,could produce hatred,shame,or contempt of chau or his business.perhaps it would give harding investors more confidence if their money managers also had an equity stake in the investments,but that they did not does not make the statement defamatory.statement,which describes chau as almost giddily telling eisman that he had passed all the risk,is also passing risk is the business of a money manager,and we can not characterize this as defamatory.moreover,lewis or eisman characterization of chau as almost gidd y is a subjective assessment and an opinion.this same logic applies to statement.chau statement that he would rather have billion in crappy cdos than none at all,as he was paid mainly on volume merely conveys a fundamental truth worth of a lousy security is worth more than none at all.similarly,being paid on volume is a statement that is generally applicable to brokers,dealers,and firms.it is unclear how an ordinary reader would interpret this,in context,as defamatory.
statements and are also not defamatory.statement which quotes eisman,referring to chau in saying,w hatever that guy is buying,i want to short it and seeking to place a bet specifically against chau would not be interpreted by an average reader as defamatory.james,at.chau business by its very nature operated by having people to bet against.in this statement,eisman is merely expressing his intention to bet against chau to short chau long.the same reasoning applies to statement,which states that eisman did in fact make new bets against the cdos created by chau.chau correctly points out that eisman never actually bet against harding cdos and that this sentence was removed from the tenth and subsequent printings of the book but even though this statement is conceded to be false,it can not be considered defamatory for the same reasons as statement it would not be interpreted by an average reader as defamatory.
statement that chau spent most of his career working sleepy jobs at sleepy life insurance companies but that was all in the past,followed by he was newly,obviously rich was dismissed as by the district court on the basis that it was and merely lewis opinion of chau career.we disagree in part with this reasoning,but not with the result.chau spent only two years out of twelve prior to starting harding,working at a life insurance company certainly not most of his career,and lewis himself conceded that this description of chau career was incomplete.because the most of his career part of the statement is concededly false,that part was improperly characterized by the district court as opinion.it is properly dismissed,however,because an ordinary person would not take the statement albeit incorrect in context to be sufficiently derogatory to make an actionable claim for defamation.the parry at the end of the statement in question but that was all in the past,along with the following assertion that chau was newly,obviously rich makes clear that sleepy jobs at sleepy life insurance companies is being contrasted with chau new and obvious wealth.further,in this context,sleepy means a steady,typical job,or even at its most negative dictionary definition,a job having little activity,quietly slowly moving.webster third new international dictionary.such a characterization is a statement of opinion,and it also does not rise to the odium necessary to constitute defamatory meaning.
as mentioned above,only factual statements are actionable as defamation or libel.this is because,in part,new york law protects derogatory statements which may be categorized as opinion as opposed to fact.see immuno ag.moorjankowski,steinhilber alphonse.determining whether a statement is an allegation of fact or mere opinion is a legal question for the court.brian richardson.this is no easy task.over time,new york courts have identified factors to be considered in determining whether something is an expression of fact rather than opinion statements more likely to be characterized as fact are readily understood by the reader to have a precise,unambiguous and definite meaning and can be objectively characterized as true or false.steinhilber,d at.as with defamation in general,courts make these assessments by looking at the full context of the communication in which the statement appears,while also considering the broader social context or setting surrounding the communication.id.broader social context can include any particular customs or conventions that could signal to readers or listeners that what is being read or heard is likely to be opinion,not fact.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
but this is not necessarily the end of the analysis if a statement is found to contain opinion,the court must next determine whether the statement is pure opinion and thus or mixed opinion and therefore actionable.pure opinion is a statement of opinion which is accompanied by a recitation of the facts upon which it is based or does not imply that it is based on undisclosed facts.id.at.mixed opinion,on the other hand,is an opinion that does imply a basis in undisclosed facts,or facts known only to the author,and is actionable.id.
in the instant case,the district court correctly held that statements,and are opinions.in the case of statements,and,the use of phrasing such as,i had no idea and i did know are particular customs or signals to readers that something is opinion,not fact.steinhilber.at.likewise,the epithets in statements,sucker,fool,frontman,industrial waste,pilot of the ship of doom,and crooks or morons are hyperbole and therefore not actionable opinion.id.at see also weiner doubleday,dep t,aff.while someone may not appreciate being called a fool,it is an expression of one view of another,and moreover might not reflect reality history has shown many fools to have indeed been visionaries.time may prove the insult misguided,but the insult is not itself a fact but rather,is one perception of facts at the time it is uttered.
not of and concerning plaintiff 
in new york,a plaintiff can not sustain a libel claim if the allegedly defamatory statement is not of and concerning plaintiff but rather only speaks about a group of which the plaintiff is a member.kirch liberty media,cir.as many of the statements concern cdo managers generally,the district court correctly held that they are not of and concerning chau.this includes statements,and,which respectively describe the cdo manager job the typical cdo manager t he last thing you wanted from a cdo manager and the double agent created by the bond market.though chau is described in the book as a cdo manager,these statements are solely about the group.
substantial truth 
falsity of a statement is needed to make out a claim of libel.but in defamation law,as in life,determinations of fact and fiction are not.in new york,a statement need not be completely true,but can be substantially true,as when the overall gist or substance of the challenged statement is true.printers ii,prof ls publ g,cir citing rinaldi holt,rinehart winston,fairley peekskill star,dep t.
statements,and which describe plaintiffs goal to maximize dollars in their care their love of guys who short their market and chau main fear that the economy would strengthen thus minimizing the number of people betting against the subprime mortgage market are all completely or substantially true.plaintiffs sole dispute with statement,for example,is that the first part suggests that maximiz ing the dollars in chau care was chau only goal,which they state is false and defamatory.but as the district court pointed out,this sentence does not imply that chau was indifferent to his clients interests.this statement also lacks a defamatory meaning,as it merely alleges that chau intended to expand his business.likewise,statement,which includes chau supposed statement that he love s guys like you who short my market.without you i do have anything to buy is substantially true in content one literally can not take a long position without someone taking a corresponding short position.as with statement,statement is also not defamatory,but rather reflects a reality of the market.
parallel logic applies to statement chau entire business operated by having people to bet against.bets are simply gambles that the result of an event here,mortgage defaults that would devalue cdos will favor their side of the wager.while some may cringe at the thought of investing money as a gamble,such bets are the nature of much of the financial market and are especially the case with cdos.reducing risk by limiting a cdo to rated mortgage loans is merely placing the odds in favor of those who were long in the market.thus,the statement is both substantially true and not reasonably susceptible to defamatory connotation.
combined issues of statements and 
statement discusses plaintiffs investment in nothing but cdos backed by the tranche of a mortgage bond,which eisman characterizes as the equivalent of three levels of dog shit lower than the original bonds.while the dog shit comparison is a epithetic opinion,plaintiffs argue that the characterization of harding cdos as backed by nothing but mortgage bonds is false.they contend that of harding cdos,eight were,backed almost entirely by securities rated a or better.plaintiffs br.the district court found the statement to be substantially true and,as all parties conceded that a significant portion of plaintiffs collateral in cdos was rated,and a majority was.we find it unnecessary to sort out the fine and shaded distinctions of statement because even if chapter had published the truth according to chau that of harding cdos were backed by a securities or better,the effect on the reader would have been appreciably the same.fleckenstein friedman,holding that false statements are not actionable if the statement could have produced no worse an effect on the mind of the reader than the publication of the truth pertinent to the allegation.plaintiffs offered nothing in their submissions to the district court as reflected in the record or in their briefs before us that demonstrates to us the significant superiority of a rated securities over rated securities such that the average reader would come away with a different impression of chau business had lewis published the former and not the latter.this lack of proof is all the more telling considering this statement in the broad social context of the financial world at the time the big short was written.we are reminded that the various ratings assigned to bonds were ever changing and that market participants were continually coming up with new packages and terminologies to make their backings appear more attractive.indeed,this is a major theme of the big short.accordingly,statement is.
we affirm the district court assessment of statement as for similar reasons.plaintiffs rightly contend that the statement that chau took home million a year was false harding made million in fees in and chau personally received only a portion of that amount.but false statements as to chau income could have produced no worse an effect on the mind of the reader than the truth.see fleckenstein,at.if indeed chau spent only a negligible amount of time considering the quality of his cdos,we doubt it matters whether he took home million or a fraction of that amount,as conceded by plaintiffs.accordingly,statement is.
chau argument of fabricated quotes as defamatory 
the false attribution of a quotation to a speaker may be defamatory if putting the words in the plaintiff mouth cast s doubt on the plaintiff fitness for his profession.mahoney adirondack publ g.such a fabricated quotation may injure reputation if it attributes an untrue factual assertion to the speaker or if the manner of expression or even the fact that the statement was made indicates a negative personal trait or an attitude the speaker does not hold.masson new yorker magazine.to survive a motion for summary judgment,a plaintiff who denies making a statement that has been attributed to him must also demonstrate that the statement,when read in context,was defamatory.james,at.
chau denies having said portions of statements,and that are attributed to him,either as direct quotes or in the form of a paraphrase.this claim fails,because,as discussed above,chau did not show that the statements were defamatory,or were not substantially true.
conclusion 
chapter of the big short portrays chau as starting out from a series of simple jobs to becoming the founder and principal of a financial firm managing cdos,which provided him with what many americans hope for great wealth.the market events of and may undoubtedly influence one perception as to whether going long on cdos meant chau was a fool,or chau was a rube,or his motivations were avarice but hindsight can not give such opinions a defamatory meaning.lewis various implications that chau was wrong about the mortgage market are not actionable.
the law of defamation in new york is predicated on the free exchange of ideas and viewpoints.that marketplace can wound one pride for words can offend or insult but simple slights are not the stuff of defamation.the tort requires conduct that vilifies or exposes one to shame in the minds of persons.kimmerle,at.chau feelings may be hurt but his claims were rightly dismissed by the district court.
the dissent presses for reversal because,it asserts,the majority opinion evaluates statements from the big short without regard for the context in which they were made.the dissent examines a portrait of the context of the book portrayal of appellant to conclude that the majority view of the big short is not the sole meaning intended by the author or understood by the book readership.as the dissent recognizes,whether a statement is defamatory is a fact issue for a jury only if the statement is reasonably susceptible of a defamatory connotation.davis ross,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,if a writing is not susceptible of a libelous meaning,then innuendo can not make it libelous.tracy newsday.the dissent error is that it emphasizes the implication,perceived tone,and innuendo of defendants writing,even though the statements in question are either,privileged opinion,not of or concerning plaintiffs,or substantially true.we conclude that the statements are not libel as a matter of law.
consideration of the circumstances and of the broader social context confirms our conclusion that the big short does not contain actionable defamation.steinhilber,at.the dissent highlights the fact that the individual plaintiff has been professionally shunned since the big short was published in.it is understandable that chau was displeased by a book that laid a good share of the blame for the financial crisis at the feet of wall street banks and the advisors they chose to manage the cdos that collapsed so spectacularly.before the crash,chau was a top manager of cdos.by the time the book was published,every cdo managed by chau was either in default,liquidated,or downgraded to junk status,and his investors incurred substantial losses that would damage any money manager reputation.our dissenting brother exploits chau fate as context for his view that the defendants writing did not have an innocent meaning our view is that a reflection on this disastrous chapter of our nation financial history would not necessarily have an innocent meaning for those depicted.
we have considered all of plaintiffs contentions on this appeal and have found them to be without merit.for the reasons above,the judgment of the district court is affirmed as to all statements.
i respectfully dissent 
michael lewis book describes appellant as admitting to acts that a jury could easily find to have breached his obligations to investors in the fund that employed him and to have constituted civil or criminal fraud.although the authority my colleagues cite demonstrates that it is axiomatic that allegedly defamatory statements must be viewed by reading the document
