this is a product liability action,resting on diversity jurisdiction,brought in the district court for the district of massachusetts.was rendered a quadriplegic by injuries sustained when the forklift he was operating tipped over as he attempted to move a tree.attributing the accident to a problem with the forklift,he sought recovery from for alleged failures of design,lack of care in manufacturing,inadequate warning,breach of implied and express warranty,and misrepresentations in violation of the massachusetts unfair trade practices act.laws ch.for reasons we shall explain,we vacate the district court summary judgment for defendants and remand for further proceedings.
procedural background 
the accident happened in june.suit was brought nearly three years later,in march.defendants filed a motion to dismiss,and for a number of months the parties engaged in filing various oppositions and replies.the court denied the motion to dismiss in january and set a schedule that required plaintiff to disclose his experts by january.a joint motion for extension was granted in november,and the new date for plaintiff expert disclosures was april.no further extension was sought until may,three days after the deadline.
at that time,plaintiff sought an additional extension.the court denied this motion on may based on.c but plaintiff nonetheless proceeded to gather his experts reports and filed his disclosure on june weeks late.during the following nine months,four separate orders refusing reconsideration and precluding plaintiff experts putative testimony were issued.the court subsequently granted summary judgment for defendants,concluding that,without experts,the plaintiff could not establish his claims.it noted alternatively that the expert testimony would not have helped because the experts failed to address the critical issue of the forklift condition at the time of its manufacture in.
the termination of a case based on such a procedural requirement as timely disclosure of expert witnesses presents a particularly poignant issue when injuries are as serious as those suffered by plaintiff.we are nonetheless unable to say that the district court abused its discretion in impliedly finding that plaintiff failed to provide sufficient justification for his late disclosure.we are also unable at this juncture,however,to affirm the summary judgment because we lack the court considered views as to whether the harmless error escape valve of section c applies.we therefore remand for consideration of that issue.if the court on remand finds the tardiness to be harmless,its alternative ruling on the merits of the expert evidence must be revisited.
we proceed with the following steps noting the issues presented and the relevant standard of review tracing the tortuous path of this litigation,exposing the facts as the court reasonably could view them and determining how law and policy apply to the facts at hand.
ii.issues and standard of review 
the issues before us involve the application of.c,which excuses late disclosure if a party has substantial justification.the first question we face,therefore,is whether plaintiff rationale establishes justification for his untimeliness.but even if it does not,we must consider whether his delay was harmless.
plaintiff asserts that his tardiness was caused by defendants misrepresentations concerning stability testing on the forklift and by defendants long delay in giving him the names of former employees who would have knowledge about that testing.this,he maintains,establishes substantial justification.in addition,he emphasizes that his late disclosure caused no prejudice,as a trial date had not yet been set and no pretrial deadlines were impacted.
before delving deeply into the underlying circumstances,we must recognize that the expert preclusion order at issue here falls in the heartland of case management area where a trial judge has the remorseless responsibility,evenhandedly and efficiently,to govern,monitor,and police the progress of an endless line of cases through the court.our standard of review is abuse of discretion,which we have described as highly deferential,delaney matesanz,cir,requiring strong evidence that the trial judge indulged a serious lapse in judgment,texaco puerto rico,dep t of consumer affairs,cir.see also macaulay anas,cir in reviewing preclusion of expert testimony,court considers whether the ruling was so wide of the mark as to constitute an abuse of discretion.
we narrow the field further when we focus specifically on rule c.in primus united states,cir,we stressed that t he adoption of rule c in gave teeth to a significantly broadened duty to comply with case management orders.id.at citation omitted.our view of the effect of this rule is well stated in klonoski mahlab,cir,where we declared that it clearly contemplates stricter adherence to discovery requirements,and harsher sanctions for breaches,and the required sanction in the ordinary case is mandatory preclusion.
we review the facts,however,in the light most favorable to appellant,as this case comes before us on appeal of a grant of summary judgment.see burton town of littleton,cir.
iii.factual background 
the initial inspection.in,before the complaint was filed and approximately two years after the accident,two engineers were asked to review for design defects the piggyback forklift used by plaintiff.by late spring,the location of the forklift had been determined,a small farm about a drive east from montreal,canada.an affidavit of one of plaintiff attorneys,scott harris,reports that the two engineers went to the farm and spent several hours examining the vehicle.harris affidavit presents their assessment as follows 
those two consultants concluded that the machine violated the standards for rough terrain forklifts adopted by the american national standards institute ansi and american society of mechanical engineers asme.consequently,we prepared daniel gagnon case for filing.
in his brief,plaintiff asserts that the consultants did not suggest testing the weight load capacity of the forklift,and he has maintained that that issue was not pursued early on because of defendants representations that a metal plate on the machine attesting to its compliance with the standards reflected that testing had been conducted on it.plaintiff consequently looked elsewhere for a design flaw.
the complaint and answer.the complaint was filed some nine months after the experts report,in march.its allegations,although presumably based on the experts conclusions,are inconsistent in their treatment of stability and that of other alleged defects.the complaint is very specific in alleging that the driver cage is too small improperly angled,that the moveable steering column exacerbated the operator loss of control,that there was no brake,and that the seatbelt design was defective.then came the mention of instability,a generality surrounded by specifics.the allegation of defective design in count i strict liability and implied warranty concludes 
specifically,the protective cage,moveable steering column,lack of a foot pedal control for the brake,lack of a sufficient braking system,inherent instability of the machine,negligent design of the seat and seatbelt,lack of adequate rear weight,lack of a stationary steering wheel column,and other components of the piggyback forklift were designed in such a way as to pose an immediate,severe and unavoidable risk of danger to operators of the piggyback forklift,emphasis supplied 
for more than a year after the complaint was filed,plaintiff seems to have taken no steps to make a case for an inherently unstable design.much time was devoted to filings related to defendants motion to dismiss,which was denied on january.plaintiff asserts that,during this period,the two engineers had,for reasons not associated with the case,lost plaintiff confidence in their ability to be credible witnesses.after the january ruling,plaintiff began the search for new experts.
on january,defendants answered the complaint,asserting general denials of defective design and noting the absence of any information indicating how the forklift was otherwise unsafe as well as improperly,dangerously,and defectively designed.the answer also contained many affirmative defenses,including the failure to establish proximate cause,plaintiff own carelessness and failure to follow stated warnings and safe practices,and abnormal and unexpected use of the forklift.
disclosure schedule search for defendants tests.with the deadline for plaintiff disclosure of experts set for january,plaintiff focused in the spring and early summer of on requests for production of documents and answers to interrogatories.these efforts resulted in defendants submitting a compliance matrix for asme.this document described the test to determine the longitudinal stability of a rough terrain forklift,to see if a fully loaded truck would still be stable when tilted on a slope.checkmarks indicated that this was mandatory,that there had been compliance,and that the person responsible for determining compliance was someone with the initials pwn.this proved to be one paul neagle,the manufacturer former chief engineer,who then became the object of plaintiff search.
before neagle was located and deposed,the corporate designee of one of the defendants,danny denney,gave a deposition.he disclaimed any personal knowledge of specific outside tests that had been done on piggyback forklifts and then explained the manufacturer practice 
i f the machine is labeled with an ansi designation of designation,in order to do that,that meant somebody had to go to the book that existed at the time,because those standards change throughout the years,and review that and ensure that the machine met those standards at that time.somebody did that in order to put that safety compliance label on there.that a voluntary standard.we do have to meet those standards.there no entity that says you have to.it a voluntary restriction we put on our own design.so basically to do that,obviously somebody went through the review of what the standard is and ensured the forklift did it,performed within those standards.
neagle deposition was finally taken on february.his employment with the manufacturer teledyne princeton had commenced only in,after the forklift at issue had been designed and manufactured.while he had done some operational and performance testing of the model,he did not know of any formalized testing.although he thought that he had made some calculations as to the location of the center of gravity,he did not know of any prior testing of stability.
a three months extension and efforts to test.only at the end of,after denney deposition,did plaintiff decide to look for the same model forklift to obtain proof positive that the machine did not meet the represented standards.see harris affidavit at.in late march the expert disclosure deadline now set at april with the canadian owner of the forklift resulted in plaintiff purchase of the machine,which arrived in the united states on april.plaintiff had secured the services of three experts.one was ready to give his opinion by.a second expert,because of a fire at his residence overseas,had faced delay in receiving and responding to plaintiff.and the third,who had expected to do the required testing for longitudinal stability in the third week of april,had to wait until the testing could be done at a specially outfitted test center.time was running out.notwithstanding this,no attempt was made to notify the court and request a further extension.
the late motion and rejection.time had run out.april came and went.by an message on april,plaintiff asked defendants to agree to a second extension,not a matter of days,but a extension of time to disclose anticipated expert testimony.having accommodated defendants by extending a discovery deadline and agreeing to several additional depositions,plaintiff expected defendants to consent.but late in the day on april defense counsel reported that his clients refused.
only on may did plaintiff move the court for a extension.defendants opposed the motion,pointing out from information conveyed to them by the owner of the forklift that plaintiff counsel and one or more of his experts had,years earlier,taken possession of the actual forklift involved in the accident for an extended period and from all indications operated,inspected and tested the forklift,paying the then owner of the forklift for this opportunity.defendants charged that there was no reason why,some time in the more than four years since the accident,plaintiff experts could not have tested the lift.
the court denied the motion on may,citing its late filing and defendants representations that we have just quoted.notwithstanding this rebuff,plaintiff proceeded to submit,on june,a page disclosure of witnesses.these included the three experts recently retained.other named witnesses were a rehabilitation counselor,a physiatrist,an economic consultant,some sixteen institutional providers of medical care and many individuals associated with them,including treating physicians,a neurologist,a urologist,and specialists in nephrology.
the thrust of the experts proffered testimony was that the piggyback forklift had been tested for longitudinal stability according to the ansi standards and failed to handle the load for which it supposedly was certified.while the underlying causes of action in general terms covered this alleged defect,the emphasis on the forklift capacity marked a change in plaintiff focus.
the filing of this ambitious disclosure was followed by a period of frenetic activity.plaintiff had moved for reconsideration on june the court denied the motion on july after a flurry of filings in support and against it.on july,plaintiff again moved to allow a late disclosure of expert witnesses this was denied on september,the court noting that z ealous advocacy had reached its limits on the issue.
hearings magistrate judge and the court.defendants,meanwhile,had moved on july to preclude expert testimony,and the motion was granted by a magistrate judge on september.in her order,she ruled that plaintiff complaints of misconduct by defendants had not been borne out by the record,and that any such misconduct would not excuse the failure to timely disclose experts.nevertheless,recognizing that precluding expert testimony might be fatal to plaintiff claims,she allowed him opportunity to seek reconsideration before the district court.
on february,a hearing was held before the district judge,both to reconsider the magistrate judge ruling and to consider defendants motion for summary judgment.despite having ruled on three occasions the previous year may,july,and september,he was willing to reconsider in light of the fact that the magistrate judge had also reconsidered.what bothered him,in addition to the untimeliness of disclosure,was that plaintiff team had had access in to the very forklift involved in the accident,had examined it,knew where it had been ever since,and yet had done no testing until.
in response,plaintiff counsel explained that,despite the reactions of the first two experts,no defect justifying such testing had been suspected.plaintiff counsel listed the thinking that existed when the lawsuit was brought 
we thought the machine was unstable,and we thought the cage was too small,or the head bar was too small,and that the machine was unstable because of certain other defects,steering wheel that you push forward to make it go forward,and you pull it back to make it go back.
but because defendants representations indicated compliance with ansi standards,these details missed what counsel acknowledged had now become the core of this case.this significant colloquy between court and counsel followed 
the court should you have tested this i mean,after all,when you have a claim that vehicle tipped over,does it occur to you that it might have tipped over,because it could have carried the load going backwards 
does t that seem one of the first thing sic you look to 
counsel yes.
the court and you accepted that they had tested.you asked about that,and you accepted that they had tested it and that they could not find the testing before you tested this vehicle.
counsel yes,your honor.
the court and you did not test did not test it for three ye
