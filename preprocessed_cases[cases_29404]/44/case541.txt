under the distinct impression that their schooling,in the dickensian phrase,left them with a smattering of everything,and a knowledge of nothing,charles dickens,sketches by boz,seven erstwhile students brought suit against the organization that had accredited the college at which they had matriculated.their complaint raises novel questions anent an accreditor tort liability to third persons.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the accreditor.we affirm.
background 
we recount the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovants here,the plaintiffs,consistent with record support.see nieves mcsweeney,cir.
thomas college the college is a private institution of higher education in waterville,maine.jamie ambrose,kimberly bonneau,monica bryant,heather cool,lorna goodwin,laurie pelletier,and brenda tracy all attended the college between and.new england association of schools and colleges,neasc is an independent nonprofit organization that accredits institutions.neasc first accredited the college in.the college has maintained its accreditation continuously from that date forward.
each of the appellants enrolled in the college associate degree program in medical assisting expecting to be qualified,upon graduation,for an position as a medical assistant.but the program had myriad shortcomings most conspicuously,it contained no clinical component.since clinical tasks comprise an important part of a medical assistant job description,six of the seven appellants were unable to find work as medical assistants after they graduated.the only hired as a medical assistant but was cashiered in short order due to perceived inadequacies in her knowledge and training.
disgruntled by this sad state of affairs,the appellants banded together and brought suit against the college in a maine state court.they sued neasc in a separate action.see ambrose neasc,d,describing the two actions.in their suit against neasc,the plaintiffs alleged that the accreditation statements which appeared in the college course catalogs were actionable under three distinct theories fraud,negligent misrepresentation,and deceptive business practices.neasc promptly removed the case against it to the federal district court based on diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount.see a,a.this left the case against the college pending in a different forum,but the district court quite properly refused to order a remand.ambrose,d at.
after the parties had engaged in some discovery,neasc moved for summary judgment.see.judge carter referred the motion to a magistrate judge.concluding that no misrepresentation had been made and that the appellants,at any rate,failed to show that they had relied justifiably on the accreditation statements,the magistrate judge recommended brevis disposition.judge carter reviewed the magistrate judge recommended ruling de novo,accepted it,and entered judgment accordingly.this appeal followed.
ii.the accreditation statements 
since the accreditation statements lie at the epicenter of the dispute between the parties,we pause to place them into perspective.neasc wrote two approved versions of an accreditation statement and supplied both versions to accredited institutions of higher education.it permitted those institutions to publish either or both of the statements,but did not require them to do so.
six of the appellants claim that,prior to matriculating at the college,they read course catalogs which contained the version of the accreditation statement used in the college,and catalogs.this statement reads in pertinent part 
thomas college is accredited by the new england association of schools and colleges,a,nationally recognized organization whose affiliated institutions include elementary schools through collegiate institutions offering instruction.accreditation of an institution by the new england association indicates that it meets or exceeds criteria for the assessment of institutional quality periodically applied through a peer group review process.an accredited school or college is one that has available the necessary resources to achieve its stated purposes through appropriate educational programs,is substantially doing so,and gives reasonable evidence that it will continue doing so in the foreseeable future.institutional integrity is also addressed through accreditation.accreditation by the new england association is not partial but applies to the institution as a whole.as such,it is not a guarantee of the quality of every course or program offered or the competence of individual graduates.rather,it provides reasonable assurance about the quality of opportunities available to students who attend the institution.
the remaining appellant pelletier claims to have consulted the catalog,which contained the version of the accreditation statement.that version provides in pertinent part

iii.analysis 
maine law controls in this diversity case.see crellin,equipmentlease,cir.we review the lower court application of that law and its entry of summary judgment de novo.nieves,at.in that review,we focus on whether the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
the appellants complaint is composed of three substantive counts the fourth count is nothing more than a prayer for punitive damages,and need not be addressed.in the last analysis,all of those counts depend upon the existence of a false or misleading representation.we explain briefly.
under maine law,a party alleging fraud must make a showing which encompasses a false representation of material fact with knowledge of its falsity or in reckless disregard of whether it is true or false for the purpose of inducing another to act in reliance upon it,as well as a showing that the plaintiff justifiably relied upon the representation as true and acted upon it to his detriment.diversified foods,first bank,me.in contrast,a negligent misrepresentation occurs when 
o ne who,in the course of his business,profession or employment,or in any other transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest,supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions,is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by their justifiable reliance upon the information,if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.
chapman rideout,me emphasis omitted citing restatement second of torts see also,teresa marie,ii,cir.thus,these two torts,though distinct,possess a common element a false representation.
the appellants third count,as pleaded and pressed,shares this element,albeit in a slightly altered form.that count alleges a violation of maine deceptive trade practices act.ann.tit.the appellants brief focuses this count on two subsections of section of that statute.under the first subsection,a party is guilty of a deceptive trade practice if it r epresents that goods or services have sponsorship,approval,characteristics,ingredients,uses,benefits or quantities that they do not have.id.e.the other subsection renders a party liable for a deceptive trade practice if it engages in conduct of any kind that creates a likelihood of confusion or misunderstanding.id.l.thus,liability under this count turns on the existence of a false or misleading representation 
the foregoing discussion suggests an appropriate analytic framework for our consideration of this appeal.we will begin by examining the representations contained in the accreditation statements.if we find that those representations are true and not misleading,it follows inexorably that the district court did not err in entering summary judgment for neasc on all the appellants claims.only if there is an untrue or misleading representation must we go further.
the appellants effort to persuade us that the accreditation statements contain false or misleading material pinpoints four representations we deal directly with the central thrust of their concerns the first then address the remaining three representations as a group.
the appellants assert that the following excerpt from the accreditation statement is false or misleading accreditation of an institution by neasc indicates that it meets or exceeds criteria for the assessment of institutional quality periodically applied through a peer group review process.to set the stage for further analysis,we recount what the record reveals concerning the relevant phase of neasc peer review process.
once neasc has accredited an institution of higher education,it typically places the institution on a evaluation cycle.when this decennial review looms,the institution first must evaluate itself.after the institution submits a report of its,neasc commission on institutions of higher education the commission swings into action.the commission chooses an evaluation team and arranges a campus visit.the team,composed of educators and other professionals from unaffiliated schools,grades the institution in eleven substantive areas.these areas,referred to as standards,are mission and purposes,planning and evaluation,organization and governance,programs and instruction,faculty,student services,library and information resources,physical resources,financial resources,public disclosure,and integrity.the team then writes a report detailing its findings in each area.after considering both the school and the evaluation team appraisal,the commission decides whether to renew the institution accreditation.
the college went through this process in.following its receipt of a comprehensive prepared by the college,the commission sent an evaluation team to the campus in october of.the team looked into the eleven designated standards and issued a report addressing each of them.as is customary,the team added a summary of its findings.
the college survived this scrutiny.based on the report and the evaluation team assessment,the commission voted to renew the college accreditation for ten years.it warned,however,that it would perform an interim evaluation of the institution finances and programs after five years 
the appellants do not deny that this peer review process took place.they argue instead that,in implementing it,neasc failed properly to apply the criteria described in the accreditation statement and reaccredited the college even though the college did not meet or exceed criteria for the assessment of institutional quality.to buttress this argument,the appellants refer us to two pieces of evidence i the deposition of the commission director,charles cook,and ii the evaluation team report.neither item bears the weight that the appellants pile upon it.
as the appellants read cook deposition,neasc did not require the college to meet or exceed each stated standard,but,rather,engaged in a balancing process whereby shoddy performance in one area could be offset by performance in another.this reading finds support in cook holistic view of the process.he forthrightly admitted that accreditation involves a weighing of factors,and he indicated more than once that the commission,in applying the standards,endeavors to address the effectiveness of the institution as a whole.indeed,when asked if this meant that an institution could be weak in one area and strong in another,yet still gain accreditation,cook answered in the affirmative.
the appellants contend that this merging of the standards belies the representation contained in the accreditation statement because the test for accreditation should be digital,up or down,pass or fail,so that either all the standards are met or they are not.but the accreditation statements make no such commitment.the statement is entirely silent on the nature of the process for gaining accreditation.the statement declares that accreditation of an institution by neasc indicates that it meets or exceeds criteria for the assessment of institutional quality periodically applied through a peer group review process.the appellants gloss notwithstanding,nothing in this statement indicates that each standard must be evaluated separately pass or fail or that an institution must satisfy each and every standard in order to gain accreditation.the plain language of the accreditation statement does not prohibit neasc from applying the standards in a way that lets an institution strengths compensate for its weaknesses,thus allowing the standards as a whole to be satisfied by the overall assessment of the institution as a whole.
cook testimony shows this to be the case.throughout his deposition,cook emphasized that neasc does not accredit programs,and that the evaluation team probably would not consider a programmatic shortcoming if it came to the team attention at all as fatal to accreditation,but,rather,would treat it as a mundane problem touching upon the institution ability to monitor itself properly.the short of it,then,is that the protocol actually employed by neasc,as described by cook,is not at odds with the accreditation statements published in the thomas college catalogs.
nor do we think that either the law or sound scholastic practices impose a contrary duty.a certain amount of flexibility in fashioning accrediting standards long has been recognized as a virtue.see,parsons coll.cent.ass of colls.secondary,explaining that an accreditor is entitled to make a conscious choice in favor of flexible standards to accommodate variation in purpose and character among its constituent institutions,and to avoid forcing all into a rigid and uniform mold.this makes perfect sense after all,benchmarks for accreditation are not intended as reference points for laymen.to the contrary,their raison is to guide professionals in a particular field of endeavor here,education.in constructing such benchmarks,standards that are definitive in theory easily may become arbitrary in application.flexibility blunts the sharp edges of this potential hazard.
for these reasons,we conclude that neasc accreditation process,as cook describes it,recognizes the problems of attempting to gauge diverse institutions by a universal barometer.moreover,his characterization of that process is fully consistent with the depiction of the process found in the accreditation statement.as a matter of law,the plaintiffs have failed to show any false or misleading representation in this respect.
if more were we doubt that it conclusion is reinforced by context.see sidell comm r,cir c ontext is critically important in the interpretive process.reading the single sentence highlighted by the appellants in the context of the entire accreditation statement,we note that the statement goes on to say accreditation by neasc is not partial but applies to the institution as a whole.as such,it is not a guarantee of the quality of every course or program offered or the competence of individual graduates.this is in harmony with cook description of the accreditation process and refutes the appellants argument that the accreditation statements must be interpreted to mean that each of the eleven standards must be evaluated independently of the others.for these reasons,we conclude that no rational factfinder could determine that cook deposition demonstrates that the challenged passage a ccreditation of an institution by neasc indicates that it meets or exceeds criteria for the assessment of institutional quality periodically applied through a peer group review process is false or misleading.
the appellants have another blackbird baked in their pie.following the evaluation team site visit,the team issued a written report addressing each of the eleven standards.the appellants assert that the report showed the college failed to attain the benchmarks neasc itself had set that neasc blithely ignored this fact and that neasc proceeded to renew the college accreditation anyway.thus,the appellants argue,the representation that a ccreditation of an institution by neasc indicates that it meets or exceeds criteria for the assessment of
