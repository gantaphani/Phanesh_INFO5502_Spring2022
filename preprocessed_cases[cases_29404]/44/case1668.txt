on october,scic issued joseph battle battle a flood insurance policy under the nfip for his home the property located at canal drive,carolina beach,north carolina.before we continue setting forth the facts and procedural history relevant to the issues on appeal,we deem the immediately following explanation of the nfip necessary to put such information in proper context.
congress established the nfip under the national flood insurance act of,in order to make flood insurance available on reasonable terms and conditions to those in need of such protection,id.at.furthermore,as the seventh circuit recently explained 
when congress created the nfip it gave the program administrator two ways to execute the program and discretion to choose between them.the first method,the industry program,allows a pool of private insurers to underwrite flood insurance with financial backing from the government.the government program,the second option,allows the government to run the nfip federally underwritten the potential for administrative assistance from private insurers.in,the secretary of housing and urban development,who ran the nfip at the time it has since been taken over by the federal emergency management agency,decided that the industry program was unworkable and ended it.he then implemented the government program,which has continued to the present.

for more than twenty years,the director of the federal emergency management agency fema has been charged as the sole administrator of the nfip.exec.order,reprinted in making effective reorganization plan of.june,reprinted in.moreover,the director of fema is statutorily authorized to provide,by regulation,not only for the general terms and conditions of insurability which shall be applicable to properties eligible for flood insurance coverage under the nfip,but also for the general method or methods by which proved and approved claims for losses under such policies may be adjusted and paid.significantly,by fema regulation,all policies issued under the nfip must be issued using the terms and conditions of the standard flood insurance policy sfip found in part,appendix b,d,e,c.
the director of fema operates the government program of the nfip through the facilities of the federal government a.in so doing,the director of fema is authorized to use private insurance companies as fiscal agents of the united states,id.at a,and to enter into with insurance companies any necessary contracts,agreements,or other appropriate arrangements,id.at a.
in,the director of fema used this authorization to create the program wyo program.the wyo program is a program whereby private insurance companies are allowed to issue,under their own names as insurers,flood insurance policies under the government program.insurance companies which participate in the wyo program are known as wyo companies.id.notably,all flood insurance policies issued by wyo companies under the wyo program must mirror the terms and conditions of the sfip,which terms and conditions can not be varied or waived other than by the express written consent of the federal insurance administrator.b,d,e,c,d.additionally,a wyo company issuing flood insurance coverage shall arrange for the adjustment,settlement,payment and defense of all claims arising from policies of flood insurance it issues under the nfip,based upon the terms and conditions of the sfip.d.
premiums collected by wyo companies,after deducting fees and costs,must be deposited in the national flood insurance fund in the united states treasury.d pt,app.a,arts.ii e vii b.when the funds retained by wyo companies are insufficient to satisfy outstanding claims and refunds,the wyo companies must draw upon letters of credit from fema.pt,app.a,art.iv a.in short,premiums collected on policies written by wyo companies do not belong to those companies.newton capital assurance,cir.thus,claim payments on such policies are a direct charge on the united states treasury.see also f characterizing the relationship between the federal government and wyo companies as one of a fiduciary nature and intended to assure that any taxpayer funds are accounted for and appropriately expended.
scic is a wyo company.as a wyo company,scic issued battle a sfip for the property battle sfip or his sfip for a period beginning october.significantly,article r of battle sfip provides as follows 
conditions for filing a lawsuit you may not sue us to recover money under this policy unless you have complied with all of the requirements of the policy.if you do sue,you must start the suit within months from the date we mailed you notice that we have denied your claim,or part of your claim,and you must file the suit in the united states district court of the district in which the insured property was located at the time of the loss.
on july,a property loss notice was forwarded on behalf of battle to scic indicating that portions of the property had sustained flood damage on july,as a result of hurricane bertha the bertha claim.specifically,battle claimed flood damage to two structures built over the water and their miscellaneous contents,an enclosure on ground level under an elevated building,an air conditioning unit on a support stand,and the ceiling under an elevated building.
on september,another property loss notice was forwarded on behalf of battle to scic.this time scic was notified that the property had sustained additional flood damage on september,as a result of hurricane fran the fran claim.this second property loss notice reported the damage to the property as follows r oof,railing off deck,glass window seal broke,water damage inside,side of out building gone,fence damaged,contents damaged.
following a physical inspection of the property by an insurance claim adjuster from insurance network services sent by scic,battle was sent a letter dated september,stating that his sfip provided no coverage for his bertha claim although the letter was on the letterhead of the seibels bruce insurance companies,the re section of the letter correctly referenced the policy number of battle sfip and the date he claimed to have sustained flood damage to the property as the result of hurricane bertha.the letter specifically advised battle that his sfip does not provide coverage for outbuildings,walkways or contents located in the enclosure of an elevated building.the letter further advised him that his sfip does provide coverage for appurtenant structures,but only detached garages and carports,and quoted the coordinate portions of battle sfip.id.the closing paragraph of the letter states as follows 
since you did not sustain a loss that would be covered by your flood policy,i regret to inform you catawba insurance company will be unable to assist you in this matter.if you have any information which you feel may cause us to reevaluate our position,please do not hesitate to contact us by return mail.
the letter was signed by linda taylor,senior claims representative.
following another physical inspection of the property by an insurance claim adjuster from insurance network services sent by scic,battle was sent a second letter dated january,stating that his sfip provided only partial coverage for his fran claim although the letter was on the letterhead of the seibels bruce group,the re section of the letter correctly referenced the policy number of battle sfip and the date he claimed to have sustained flood damage to the property as the result of hurricane fran.the entire body of the letter states as follows 
reference is made to the flood damage your above referenced property sustained on.enclosed is a check for the undisputed amount of loss for which your flood policy provides coverage.

for reasons unexplained in the record,the check referenced as enclosed with the letter was not so enclosed.nevertheless,battle received a check for the same amount referenced in the january,letter in either late april or early may following a letter of inquiry by his attorney.
nearly three years after battle received the letter denying his bertha claim and two and years after he received the letter denying his fran claim,in july,battle filed suit in north carolina state court against scic,seibels bruce,the north carolina insurance underwriting association nciua as well as the glasgow hicks company glasgow hicks,the independent insurance agency through which battle purchased his sfip.glasgow hicks is located in wilmington,north carolina.
battle complaint alleged multiple claims,but the only claims at issue in the present appeal are his claims against scic and seibels bruce breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and conversion 
scic and seibels bruce removed battle suit to the united states district court for the eastern district of north carolina.the removal was based upon federal question jurisdiction,and upon battle did not object to the removal.
following discovery,all defendants filed motions for summary judgment.among other grounds,seibels bruce sought the grant of summary judgment with respect to all claims against it on the ground that it lacked privity of contract with battle.battle responded that liability on his sfip should extend to seibels bruce because seibels bruce logo appeared on the letterhead of the claim denial letters and on the declarations page of his sfip.agreeing fully with seibels bruce lack of privity of contract argument,the district court granted seibels bruce motion for summary judgment in toto.
among other grounds,scic sought the grant of summary judgment in its favor with respect to all claims on the ground that battle filed his lawsuit outside the limitation period set out in article r of battle sfip and.the district court partially agreed with scic,concluding that the limitation period set forth in article r of battle sfip and only applied to battle claim against scic for breach of contract.specifically,the district court ruled that the language of article r of battle sfip and describing the nature of the claims subject to the limitation period was not broad enough to cover battle claims against scic alleging breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and conversion.accordingly,the district court granted scic motion for summary judgment with respect to the breach of contract claim and remanded all claims remaining in the case,including the claims against nciua and glasgow hicks,to state court pursuant to c 
battle noted a timely appeal.on appeal,battle does not appeal the district court remand of any of his claims against nciua or glasgow hicks.neither do either of these companies on any ground.rather,battle only appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of seibels bruce with respect to all of his claims against seibels bruce and the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of scic with respect to his breach of contract claim against scic.
seibels bruce and scic noted timely.scic the district court remand of battle claims against it alleging breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and conversion.seibels bruce joins in scic in the event we reject its lack of privity of contract argument.we will address battle appeal first and scic second.
battle first contends the district court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of seibels bruce for lack of privity of contract.according to battle,he has privity of contract with seibels bruce based upon the equitable theories of apparent agency also known as apparent authority and agency by estoppel.battle theorizes that seibels bruce is a proper party because its logo appeared on the claim denial letters and on the declarations page of his sfip.
summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.baber hospital of,cir.in so doing,we view all facts and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.matsushita indus,at.
battle challenge to the district court grant of seibels bruce motion for summary judgment is without merit.every formulation of the equitable theories relied upon by battle requires as an element reliance by the plaintiff upon the apparent agency relationship with the principal involved in order to establish liability,crinkley holiday inns,cir under both equitable theories of apparent agency or agency by estoppel,though no actual agency exists,a party may be held to be the agent of another on the basis that he has been held out by the other to be so in a way that reasonably induces reliance on the appearances applying north carolina law johns hopkins ritter,like apparent authority,an agency by estoppel can arise only where the principal,through words or conduct,represents that the agent has authority to act and the third party reasonably relies on those representations.
the record in this case is bereft of evidence suggesting that battle relied upon any apparent agency relationship between seibels bruce and scic in connection with his decision to purchase flood insurance from scic or in his actions following such purchase.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of seibels bruce with respect to all of battle claims against it based upon the lack of privity of contract between battle and seibels bruce.
battle next challenges the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of scic with respect to his breach of contract claim against scic,which claim the district court determined was pursuant to article r of battle sfip and.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of scic on the basis that the claim is pursuant to article r of battle sfip.
article r of battle sfip provides 
conditions for filing a lawsuit you may not sue us to recover money under this policy unless you have complied with all the requirements of the policy.if you do sue,you must start the suit within months from the date we mailed you notice that we have denied your claim,or part of your claim,and you must file the suit in the united states district court of the district in which the insured property was located at the time of loss.
italics added.
we hold the mailing of the september,letter denying the bertha claim triggered the beginning of this limitation period with respect to the bertha claim.in his appellate brief,battle candidly acknowledges that he received the september,letter,which plainly states that it was sent in reference to the claim which was presented under the above referenced policy number.the re portion of the letter correctly states the policy number of battle sfip and the date battle claimed hurricane bertha damaged the property,july.the letter specifically references the claim inspection performed by gattiker of insurance network services and the fact that gattiker advised that you sustained flood damage to two outbuildings,contents which were located in the enclosure,and a walkway.the letter goes on to specifically state and explain why none of the claimed damage is covered by the referenced policy.finally,the letter closes with the name and telephone number of a senior claims representative and a cc to glasgow hicks.
despite all of this information,battle argues that the september,letter was ineffective to put him on notice that scic had denied the bertha claim because the letter appeared on the letterhead of the seibels bruce insurance companies,rather than on the letterhead of scic.battle contends that his argument is even stronger if we ultimately hold,as we did in part ii.of this opinion,that battle lacks privity of contract with seibels bruce.
battle argument is without merit.under federal law,a cause of action accrues when the plaintiff possesses sufficient facts about the harm done to him that reasonable inquiry will reveal his cause of action.see united states kubrick,d.all of the information in the september,letter and the fact that the cover page of battle sfip listed scic as a subsidiary company of the seibels bruce insurance companies,at a minimum,gave battle sufficient facts about the alleged harm done to him,denial of the bertha claim that reasonable inquiry would have revealed his cause of action.in short,battle was on inquiry notice that scic had denied his bertha claim at the time he received the september,letter.thus,his breach of contract claim,filed almost three years after his receipt of the september,letter,is untimely under the limitation period set forth in article r of battle sfip.
similarly,we hold the mailing of the january,letter denying the fran claim triggered the beginning of the limitation period set forth in article r of battle sfip with respect to that claim.again,battle candidly admits that he received the january,letter the letter correctly references the policy number of his sfip,correctly states the date of his claimed loss due to hurricane fran,and plainly indicates that only a portion of the fran claim is covered while the remainder of the claim is denied.
in response to these facts,battle reiterates his argument about the incorrect letterhead.we reject his argument for the same reason we rejected it with respect to the september,letter.battle receipt of the january,letter and the fact that the cover page of battle sfip listed scic as a subsidiary company of the sei bels bruce insurance companies,at a minimum,gave battle sufficient facts about the alleged harm done to him,partial denial of the fran claim that reasonable inquiry would have revealed his cause of action.see kubrick,at.thus,battle breach of contract claim against scic in connection with the partial denial of the fran claim,filed almost two and years after his receipt of the january,letter,is untimely under the limitation period set forth in article r of battle sfip.
in sum,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of scic with respect to battle breach of contract claim against scic on the basis that the claim is pursuant to article r of battle sfip 
we now turn to address scic.the district court believed that battle claims alleging breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and temporary conversion of money that scic acknowledged in its january,letter that it owed battle with respect to the fran claim collectively the remaining claims did not arise under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states,as provided in,the federal question statute.the district court also believed that the remaining claims did not come within the ambit of,the federal statute providing original exclusive jurisdiction in federal court over claims against the director of fema alleging wrongful full or partial disallowance of claims for sfip coverage of losses due to flood damage id.accordingly,the district court believed that it could only possess subject matter jurisdiction over the remaining claims under a,the supplemental jurisdiction statute having disposed of all claims in the case over which the district court believed that it possessed original jurisdiction,the breach of contract claims against seibels bruce and scic,the district court,pursuant to c,declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims pursuant to a and,thus,ordered such claims remanded to state court see hinson norwest fin,cir holding a district court power to remand pendent state claims to state court is inherent in statutory authorization to decline supplemental jurisdiction under c.
in its,scic argues the district court lacked the discretion to remand the remaining claims to state court pursuant to c,because applies to the remaining claims despite the fact that the literal text of only speaks of actions against the director of fema.id.we agree with scic that the district court lacked discretion to remand the remaining claims to state court pursuant to c,but not for the reason advanced by scic.we need not tackle the difficult statutory construction question raised by scic argument because the district court clearly possessed subject matter jurisdiction over the remaining claims pursuant to newton,at declining to address whether provided additional basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction over insured breach of contract claim against wyo company after easily concluding that district court possessed subject matter jurisdiction over the claim pursuant to.
title provides that district courts have subject matter jurisdiction of every civil action that arises under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.id.this means that congress has given the lower federal courts jurisdiction to hear only those cases in which a complaint establishes either that federal law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.interstate petroleum morgan,cir en banc quoting franchise tax bd.const.laborers vacation trust,d.
therefore,in order to determine whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to over the remaining claims,we turn to examine the allegations of battle complaint as they pertain to those two claims.count seven of battle complaint alleged that,by virtue of his sfip,scic impliedly covenanted to act in good faith and to deal fairly with him in connection with any claim that he made under his sfip and that scic breached this covenant by refusing to settle the bertha claim and the fran claim in good faith,by refusing to acknowledge his damage estimates with respect to those claims,and by refusing to assign qualified agents to identify and estimate the amount of damages to the property.count ten of battle complaint alleged in a claim entitled conversion that,until may,scic wrongfully asserted dominion and control of due him under his sfip and in the form of a check made payable to him and glasgow hicks.
battle complaint does not specify upon what law,state or federal,he premises either of these claims.accordingly,we can not conclude that battle complaint establishes that federal law creates either claim.however,we do conclude that battle complaint establishes that battle right to relief under either claim necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.interstate petroleum,at quoting franchise tax,at.first,the law is well settled that federal common law alone governs the interpretation of insurance policies issued pursuant to the nfip leland,at.see also newton,at flick liberty mut.fire ins,cir,cert.denied,d sodowski national flood ins.program,cir hanover.materials,at atlas pallet,gallagher,cir west,at.second,by force of the regulatory authority granted the director of fema by congress,battle sfip is governed by the flood insurance regulations issued by fema,the national flood insurance act of,as amended,et,and federal common law.pt,app.a,indeed,article of battle sfip contains th
