opinion of the court 
david covell and margaret covell,who are plenary guardians of their adult son david covell,appeal from a jury verdict for the defendant in their products liability suit against easton bell sports.they urge us to order a new trial on the ground that the district court erred by admitting evidence and charging the jury pursuant to sections and of the restatement third of torts,rather than section of the restatement second of torts.having held in berrier simplicity manufacturing,cir,cert.denied,d,that federal district courts applying pennsylvania law to products liability cases should look to sections and of the restatement third of torts,and seeing no reason to reverse course now,we will affirm.
david covell,a schoolteacher,sustained serious brain injuries when he was struck by a car while bicycling to work in.tragically,he is now so disabled that his parents the covells have been appointed his legal guardians.in that capacity,they filed this products liability suit against easton bell sports,bell,which manufactured the giro monza bicycle helmet their son wore during the collision.their suit,filed in the pennsylvania court of common pleas,alleged that the giro monza helmet was defectively designed and that it lacked adequate warnings about danger from impact to the helmet edge.bell removed the case to the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,where the trial proceeded according to pennsylvania substantive law.
at trial,and over the covells strident objections,the district court permitted bell to introduce expert testimony that was based in part upon the united states consumer product safety commission safety standard for bicycle helmets the cpsc standard.the cpsc standard is an administrative regulation that provides an exacting set of guidelines for impact resistance,head covering,labels on helmets and helmet boxes,helmet resistance to temperature and moisture,manufacturer recordkeeping,and much more.see.forced to respond to bell expert,the covells offered their own expert testimony regarding the cpsc standard.ultimately,experts for both sides agreed that the cpsc standard forms the starting point for any bicycle helmet design,and that the giro monza helmet satisfied the cpsc standard in all respects.
at the trial conclusion,the district court instructed the jury pursuant to sections and of the restatement third of torts.the court also instructed the jury that,in determining whether the giro monza helmet was or was not defective,it could consider evidence of standards or customs in the bicycle helmet industry,including the cpsc standard.the jury returned a verdict for the defense,finding that the helmet was not defective.the covells timely filed this appeal.
the district court had diversity jurisdiction pursuant to a.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review issues of law de novo.bear orchards,mich kim,cir.this includes a district court decision to admit or exclude evidence pursuant to pennsylvania law.dillinger caterpillar,cir.
the covells call to our attention two assignments of error.first,they contend that the district court should not have applied the restatement third of torts when instructing the jury and when admitting evidence of the cpsc standard.second,they contend that even if it was proper to apply the restatement third of torts,the cpsc standard was nonetheless inadmissible.we disagree and will affirm the district court on both counts.
we begin with the district court decisions to admit evidence and to instruct the jury pursuant to the restatement third and not the restatement second of torts.we note at the outset that the question the covells present what is the law of pennsylvania section of the restatement second of torts,or sections and of the restatement third of torts is one we laid to rest only months ago in berrier simplicity manufacturing,cir holding that if confronted with the question,the supreme court of pennsylvania would apply sections and of the restatement third of torts to products liability cases,cert.denied,d.after examining the contentions of the parties and the recent decisions of pennsylvania highest court,we conclude that the state of the law is no different now than it was when we decided berrier.rather than exhume the arguments and considerations we laid to rest there,we will apply stare decisis.
in past products liability cases,the supreme court of pennsylvania has looked to section of the restatement second of torts,webb zern,we hereby adopt the foregoing language of as the law of pennsylvania.section makes sellers liable for harm caused to consumers by unreasonably dangerous products,even if the seller exercised reasonable care 
one who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer,or to his property,if 
a the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product,and 
b it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.
the rule stated in subsection applies although 
a the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product,and 
b the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller.
restatement second of torts.section thus creates a strict liability regime by insulating products liability cases from negligence concepts.see id.a azzarello black,charging courts to avoid negligence concepts when instructing a jury pursuant to.
during the past years,however,the supreme court of pennsylvania has repeatedly addressed confusion arising from a core conflict in the structure of section itself section instructs courts to ignore evidence that the seller exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product,a,yet imposes liability only for products that are unreasonably dangerous.in many cases it is difficult or impossible to determine whether a product is unreasonably dangerous to consumers without reference to evidence that the seller did or did not exercise care in the preparation of the product.see schmidt boardman,a d,this rubric has resulted in material ambiguities and inconsistency in pennsylvania procedure.see also phillips cricket lighters,saylor,dissenting.
nonetheless,the supreme court of pennsylvania has endeavored to segregate strict liability analysis from the analysis of negligence.phillips,at w e have remained steadfast in our proclamations that negligence concepts should not be imported into strict liability law.in so doing,pennsylvania high court has stated repeatedly that negligence concepts have no place in products liability,azzarello,at.that endeavor has not always been successful,see davis berwind,holding that if a product has reached the user or consumer with substantial change,liability depends upon whether the manufacturer could have reasonably expected or foreseen such an alteration of its product.emphasis added,nor has it been uniformly embraced by the justices of that court,see schmidt,at disapproving of pennsylvania almost unfathomable approach to products litigation quotation omitted.
the american law institute responded to the core conflict in section when it published the restatement third of torts.sections and of the restatement third of torts abandon entirely the distinction that has caused so much trouble in pennsylvania 
liability of commercial seller or distributor for harm caused by defective products 
one engaged in the business of selling or otherwise distributing products who sells or distributes a defective product is subject to liability for harm to persons or property caused by the defect.
categories of product defect 
a product is defective when,at the time of sale or distribution,it contains a manufacturing defect,is defective in design,or is defective because of inadequate instructions or warnings.a product 
a contains a manufacturing defect when the product departs from its intended design even though all possible care was exercised in the preparation and marketing of the product 
b is defective in design when the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have been reduced or avoided by the adoption of a reasonable alternative design by the seller or other distributor,or a predecessor in the commercial chain of distribution,and the omission of the alternative design renders the product not reasonably safe 
c is defective because of inadequate instructions or warnings when the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have been reduced or avoided by the provision of reasonable instructions or warnings by the seller or other distributor,or a predecessor in the commercial chain of distribution,and the omission of the instructions or warnings renders the product not reasonably safe.
restatement third of torts.
section thus makes sellers liable only for the sale of products that are defective,and section provides that a product may qualify as defective if it meets one of three sets of criteria.the criteria which incorporate negligence concepts such as foreseeable risk and care directly into the definition of defective amount to an express rejection of the no negligence in products liability regime that the supreme court of pennsylvania has endorsed in cases like azzarello,at.several justices of the supreme court of pennsylvania have expressed the view that section s approach is antiquated and should be replaced.see,phillips,at saylor,castille,eakin,concurring i believe that the time has come for this court,in the manner of so many other jurisdictions,to expressly recognize the essential role of balancing,a concept derived from negligence doctrine,in design defect litigation.whether or when that court will move from the restatement second to the restatement third of torts are questions that have engendered much debate.
they are also questions that have challenged this court.in berrier,we noted that the supreme court of pennsylvania had not yet answered whether bystanders could recover on design defect claims.this question,in turn,required us to determine whether products liability cases are governed by the restatement second or the restatement third of torts,and we stated that i n the absence of a controlling decision by the pennsylvania supreme court,a federal court applying that state substantive law must predict how pennsylvania highest court would decide this case.at.after reviewing relevant state precedents,analogous decisions,considered dicta,scholarly works,and other reliable data,id.at,we concluded that if the pennsylvania supreme court were confronted with this issue,it would adopt the restatement third of torts,and,id.at.thus,we held that federal courts sitting in diversity and applying pennsylvania law to products liability cases should look to sections and of the restatement third of torts.id.the precedential holding in berrier,as set forth above,represents this court view of pennsylvania products liability law.
the district court followed berrier.in so doing it admitted evidence of the cpsc standard as relevant to the amount of care bell exercised,and it instructed the jury according to the framework set forth in sections and of the restatement third of torts.the covells contend that these decisions by the district court were erroneous,because they would be improper under section of the restatement second of torts.they maintain that section has been the law in pennsylvania since it was adopted in webb zern,and that n o decision of the pennsylvania supreme court has changed this.if the district court had applied the restatement second of torts,it would not have permitted bell to admit evidence of the cpsc standard because due care is irrelevant under the restatement second of torts,and it would not have instructed the jury to consider whether the giro monza helmet was unreasonably dangerous because the only relevant inquiry under the restatement second of torts is whether the product itself was defective.the covells maintain that each of these decisions by the district court violated the doctrine of erie railroad tompkins,as set forth in van dusen barrack,d,which requires federal courts sitting in diversity to apply state substantive law.at stating that,t he nub of the policy that underlies erie is that a suit by a litigant in a federal court instead of in a state court a block away,should not lead to a substantially different result.in short,the covells position is that section is the law of pennsylvania,and that when the district court applied the restatement third of torts it permitted bell to illicitly utilize a transfer to achieve a result in federal court which could not have been achieved in the courts of the state where the action was filed.id.
in response,bell directs us to our decision in berrier,at,wherein we held that if confronted with the issue,the supreme court of pennsylvania would apply sections and of the restatement third and not section of the restatement second of torts.such predictions by a federal court sitting in diversity are permissible absent a controlling decision by a state highest court.nationwide mut.ins.buffetta,cir.bell position is that the district court in this case did not err,because it followed berrier precedential prediction of pennsylvania law.
we will affirm the district court application of sections and of the restatement third of torts.much of the briefing from the parties,and all of the briefing from the amici,is devoted to which restatement of torts is best as a matter of policy,and which most logically extends the decisions of the supreme court of pennsylvania all of which are issues we waded through and resolved only two years ago when we decided berrier.this means that,notwithstanding the volume of briefing in this case,the dispositive question we must answer is straightforward do we follow berrier 
we will follow berrier,and affirm the district court.first,our internal operating procedures instruct us to follow prior panels decisions 
policy of avoiding conflict of precedent.
it is the tradition of this court that the holding of a panel in a precedential opinion is binding on subsequent panels.thus,no subsequent panel overrules the holding in a precedential opinion of a previous panel.court en banc consideration is required to do so.
although a panel of this court is bound by,and lacks authority to overrule,a published decision of a prior panel,a panel may reevaluate a precedent in light of intervening authority,including intervening decisions of state law but its highest court.reich sabia.cir internal citation omitted.in this vein,the covells direct our attention to bugosh north america,appeal dismissed as improvidently granted by.the bugosh petitioner had sought a holding from the supreme court of pennsylvania declaring that the restatement third and not the restatement second of torts reflects the law of pennsylvania.the court granted certiorari on the issue in,but in dismissed the appeal as improvidently granted.bugosh.the covells urge us to hold that the dismissal of bugosh indicates the supreme court of pennsylvania contentment with the restatement second of torts.
we will not do so.reading the tea leaves of a certiorari dismissal is risky business one could just as reasonably conclude that the dismissal here indicates the court approval of berrier as much as it indicates its approval of section.that is why the supreme court of pennsylvania has warned against reading between the lines of a certiorari dismissal 
in the circumstance where we have accepted an issue by granting allowance of appeal,and this court,after conducting our review of the issue,enters an order dismissing the appeal as having been improvidently granted,the effect is as though this court never granted allowance of appeal.in other words,a dismissal as being improvidently granted has the exact same effect as if this court had denied the petition for allowance of appeal allocatur in the first place.where we dismiss an appeal as improvidently granted,the lower tribunal opinion and order stand as a decision of that court and this court order has no precedential value.
