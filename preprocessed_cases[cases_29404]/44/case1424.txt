a long and winding road has brought this false claims act fca case to us on appeal a third time.after two trips to the supreme court,relator karen wilson now appeals the district court dismissal of her qui tam action for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to the fca public disclosure bar.for the reasons that follow,we reverse.
we need only briefly recount the factual and procedural history.fuller accounts of each can be found in graham cnty.soil water conservation dist.united states ex rel.wilson,and united states ex rel.wilson graham cnty.soil water conservation,cir.
when a february storm caused significant flooding and erosion in parts of western north carolina,the united states department of agriculture usda agreed to help the affected counties cover the costs of cleanup and recovery through the emergency watershed protection program ewp program.see generally.jointly administered by the national resources conservation service nrcs and the united states forest service,the ewp program provides financial assistance to eligible states and political subdivisions to relieve imminent hazards created by a natural disaster that causes a sudden impairment of a watershed.id.
north carolina graham and cherokee counties applied for storm relief under the ewp program and each was deemed eligible to receive federal funding.as required,each county entered into a cooperative agreement with nrcs,see id.c,agreeing to perform or contract out the necessary recovery work.nrcs then agreed to reimburse the counties for most of the total cost.in each county,responsibility for the ewp program fell to the respective soil and water conservation district swcd,a local government entity.both the graham county swcd and the cherokee county swcd hired independent contractors to complete the required cleanup and remediation.
appellant,relator karen wilson,worked at the graham county swcd as a secretary from until.soon after graham county received approval for the ewp program,wilson began to suspect fraud in its implementation,not only by her colleagues at the swcd,but also by nrcs officials who oversaw the program.in december,wilson wrote a letter to usda special agent richard gallo outlining her concerns.according to wilson letter,two nrcs employees,richard greene and william timpson,had agreed with the independent contractors to front the cost of supplies in exchange for a share of the ultimate profits.wilson letter also indicated that the graham county swcd had chosen as its independent contractor keith orr,who was a salaried swcd employee and so ineligible to work on the contract.in addition,wilson told gallo,the graham county swcd was at that time being audited by county auditors.
four months later,in april,those auditors formalized their findings in an agreed upon procedures report the audit report detailing several problems with the graham county swcd handling of the ewp program.the audit report characterized orr hiring as a likely violation of the county code of conduct,and pointed to a lack of proper documentation surrounding both the bidding and the invoicing of the ewp contracts.an accompanying cover letter indicated that graham county received four copies of the audit report,two for the county own records,and one each for the graham county soil water conservation district and the department of agriculture,should you be required to distribute copies to them.in the cover letter,the independent accounting firm responsible for the audit report also reported sending one copy to the north carolina local government commission and one to the north carolina division of soil and water conservation.
the audit report failed to put an end to wilson suspicions.in november,she made a written statement to another usda special agent,kenneth golec,not only reiterating and expanding on some of her earlier allegations,but also raising new ones notably that richard greene had stolen logs intended for use in the rebuilding efforts.the allegations against greene proved.in august,special agent golec completed a report of investigation usda report that concluded greene had received payment by checks issued in his name from a lumber mill for the delivery of trees removed from the emergency watershed program ewp,sites he represented.the cover page of the usda report included a distribution list to certain state and federal law enforcement agencies and a warning that it was not to be distributed outside your agency without prior clearance from the office of inspector general,usda.
in,wilson filed suit under the fca qui tam provision,alleging that fraudulent invoices were submitted to the federal government under the ewp program in both graham and cherokee counties.in,wilson filed her third amended complaint the operative pleading for this appeal in which she named as defendants graham county,the graham county swcd,and the cherokee county swcd,along with several individuals,including orr,greene,and timpson.although the intervening years,and decisions of both this court and the supreme court,have eliminated several of wilson claims for relief,her core fca claims pertaining to the ewp program in both counties survived until the district court dismissed them in the order from which wilson now appeals.
in its qui tam provision,the false claims act permits private citizens known as relators to bring suit on behalf of the united states to recover from those persons who make false or fraudulent claims for payment to the united states.graham cnty,at citing.
the statute earlier version,which applies to this appeal,contains a provision 
no court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source.
e a.this provision,known as the public disclosure bar,is designed to strike a balance between empowering the public to expose fraud on the one hand,and preventing parasitic actions on the other.united states ex rel.siller becton dickinson,cir citation omitted.in short,it mandates the dismissal of claims brought by a relator if those claims are based on a public disclosure,unless the relator qualifies as an original source 
we asked the district court on remand to make the factual findings necessary to apply this statutory scheme.pursuant to this directive,the court considered whether any relevant audits,reports,hearings,or investigations had been publicly disclosed whether wilson based her claims on any such public disclosures and if so,whether wilson was nonetheless an original source of those claims.see united states ex rel.wilson graham cnty.soil water conservation,d,on remand from app x cir.reaching all three questions,the court concluded that both the audit report and the usda report had been publicly disclosed,that wilson based her claims on these reports,and that she was not an original source of any of those claims.id.at.the district court therefore dismissed wilson action in its entirety,holding that the public disclosure bar deprived it of jurisdiction.id.at.
wilson timely noted this appeal.our review of a district court jurisdictional findings is deferential.united states ex rel.vuyyuru jadhav,cir.when a finding of fact undergirds the district court conclusion with respect to jurisdiction,we leave it undisturbed unless it is clearly erroneous.id.at.the legal conclusions flowing therefrom,however,are reviewed de novo.id.
to sustain the district court holding,we must find that the court correctly concluded that all relevant reports had been publicly disclosed,and wilson based her claims on those public disclosures,and wilson was not the original source of her claims.with respect to the first requirement public disclosure the court concluded that the audit report and the usda report,both of which contained allegations of fraud,constituted public disclosures of relevant reports because they had been distributed to public officials responsible for managing the subject forming the basis of the claims.graham,d at.the distrib
