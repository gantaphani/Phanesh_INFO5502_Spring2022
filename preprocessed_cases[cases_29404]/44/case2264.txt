malcolm moulton challenges the district court approval of a settlement agreement arising from a class action filed by the neighbors of a steel mill owned by united states steel corporation.a group of other class members,led by ron anderson,join moulton objections,and separately challenge the district court management of the process and its handling of attorney donnelly hadden attempts to represent them.we affirm,except with respect to the district court approval of the attorney fee award,which we vacate and remand for further explanation.
in,steel purchased a steel mill bordering ecorse and river rouge,michigan.at the time,the mill equipment was in disrepair.after purchasing the mill,the company spent million to upgrade the old equipment and to buy new equipment.
about a year after the purchase,several residents of ecorse and river rouge filed a lawsuit against the company.the final amended complaint,filed in,named seven residents as plaintiffs oundra stanley,malcolm moulton,karen ward,charles hunter,betty compton,marcia brown and tansley ann clarkson.the plaintiffs raised several tort and statutory claims,all to the effect that the mill wrongfully discharged harmful dust and flakes that settled on their real and personal property.roa.
in march,the district court certified a class that included all individuals owning property or residing in river rouge and ecorse at any point after steel purchased the mill.the certification order designated jason thompson and peter macuga,the attorneys who filed the final amended complaint,as class counsel.
several weeks after the court certified the class,but before it had approved a method for notifying class members,attorney donnelly hadden sent a letter to all river rouge ecorse clients regarding the suit against steel.roa.it is not clear on this record how many individuals received the letter or how many class members,if any,had previously retained hadden to represent them in the lawsuit.the letter says that hadden had been meeting with residents of the two cities about the litigation,and encourages its recipients to exclude themselves from the class,advising that doing so would be the best choice for everyone,because people who opt out always get a much higher settlement than the general population.id.to remain in the class,hadden instructed,recipients had to complete an attached form and return it to hadden office by april.id.hadden pledged to opt out any recipient who did not return the form.id.either way,the letter concluded,hadden would continue to be the recipients lawyer,whether they choose to stay in the class or opt out.id.it appears that neither steel nor class counsel learned of hadden initiative until april,when steel received a letter from hadden listing the individuals he claimed to represent and purporting to place an attorney lien on any settlement proceeds.
the court approved an official notice procedure about two months after hadden sent his letter.the court required class counsel to send each class member an form,which instructed class members who did not want to participate in the suit to sign the form and return it to class counsel by july.
as the deadline approached,hadden moved to enter an appearance as counsel for class members who purportedly had signed retainer agreements with him.two days before the deadline,hadden filed a motion on behalf of still more class members.claiming that members of the class had retained him and told him they want to be excluded from the class presumably by not returning the form hadden sent them,he asked for leave to file a collective,form.roa.the deadline passed without a ruling on any of the motions.
in august,the court denied hadden motions,finding them procedurally improper because hadden is not counsel of record in this case.roa.at the same time,it created a new period for the class members whom hadden purported to represent.hadden clients could still opt out of the suit,the court instructed,but only by submitting an individually signed form,as opposed to one signed only by hadden.once the extended period closed,the order permitted hadden to take appropriate action with respect to those persons who have opted out and who m he represents.roa.at the end of this second period,class counsel submitted a final report tallying the number of individuals who had declined to participate in the suit.
the dispute over hadden role was a sideshow to the main discovery,motions practice and eventually a proposed settlement agreement.in june,nearly four years after the initial complaint and after months of negotiation,class counsel and steel filed a joint motion for preliminary approval of a million settlement agreement.class representatives karen ward and malcolm moulton objected to initial versions of the agreement,arguing among other things that the agreement allocated too much money to class counsel fees,and that the agreement discharged claims arising from pollution emanating from the mill both prior to the agreement and in the future,roa too broad.
the parties eventually narrowed the scope of the release.rather than releasing all claims for future emissions,the final version of the release discharged claims relating to pollutants emitted at any time up to and including the agreement execution date.roa.in addition,the final version released 
claims for a ll alleged damages,past,present,or future under any theory of continuing nuisance,arising out of or relating to the maintenance of any structures,any acts,any operations,or any conditions that existed,began,or were initiated at the mill prior to the settlement effective date and that continue for an indefinite period of time,including pollutants emanating from the mill prior to the settlement effective date or during all periods of time that any such structures,any such acts,any such operations,or any such conditions continue.roa.
the release contained several exceptions.it did not bar claims based solely on a future catastrophic event.roa.nor did it preclude claims based solely on future operations by steel that i involve substantially different manufacturing processes and ii result in substantially different or greater air emissions,releases,or odors than current or historical operations.id.
moulton and ward again objected,claiming that the agreement unfairly released any claims that occur in the future.roa.attorney hadden,acting on behalf of his clients,added objections of his own.in addition to objecting to the size of the settlement and the scope of the release,hadden alleged that class members had not been included in the final report due to clerical error,making it necessary to create another period for class members.
after a final fairness hearing,at which hadden and moulton voiced their objections,the court approved the settlement agreement.in a separate order,the court addressed each objection,finding that none supported rejecting the settlement agreement.
on appeal,moulton and hadden first the settlement agreement is not fair,reasonable,and adequate.e.to determine whether a settlement agreement satisfies rule fairness standard,we consider the risk of fraud or collusion the complexity,expense and likely duration of the litigation the amount of discovery engaged in by the parties the likelihood of success on the merits the opinions of class counsel and class representatives the reaction of absent class members and the public interest.uaw motors,cir.moulton and hadden submit that the agreement disserves the public interest due to the broad scope of the release,that collusion between class counsel and steel tarnished the agreement and that the agreement improperly prioritizes the distribution of the settlement proceeds.we review the district court contrary conclusions for abuse of discretion.id.at.
the objectors charge that the release of the claims is unfair because the complaint contained no such claims and at a minimum the scope of the release goes well beyond the claims pled in the complaint.moulton br.since,however,every version of the plaintiffs versions in a claim for continuing private nuisance.roa.having expressly raised a claim in each version of the complaint,the objectors are the last individuals in a position to claim lack of notice that this claim was on the table at the settlement talks.nor can they tenably argue that the release goes beyond these claims.the question is not whether the definition of the claim in the complaint and the definition of the claim in the release overlap perfectly it is whether the released claims share a factual predicate with the claims pled in the complaint.olden gardner,app x,cir.that is true here,just as it was in olden.see also matsushita indus.epstein,d construing delaware law tbk partners,union,cir williams capital auto.lease,cir.
the objectors add that the release of claims amounts to a of future tort claims.the release prohibits class members from raising claims if they aris e out of or relat e to the maintenance of any structures acts operations or conditions that existed,began,or were initiated at the mill prior to the settlement effective date and that continue for an indefinite period of time.roa.as the objectors read the release,it gives steel a free pass to pollute however it would like,because,absent one future catastrophic events,roa forever bars class members from suing for property damage on a theory of continuing nuisance.
we do not read the release that broadly.the bar on future claims applies only to claims arising out of conditions that existed prior to the settlement.it does not preclude future claims based on emissions from new equipment installed after the date of settlement.nor does it bar future claims based on old equipment,so long as the continuing nuisance is a new one,so long in other words as the nuisance did not begin and did not begin continuing until after the settlement effective date.by releasing future claims only for conduct,the agreement steel interest in protecting itself from suits based on identical claims that existed at the time of the complaint and settlement without extinguishing the class right to file distinct claims in the future.
the objectors persist that much of the mill equipment is old and that,notwithstanding steel recent million investment in pollution control,a palpable risk of further pollution exists in the future,particularly as the new pollution controls age.at that point,even under our reading,class members seeking recovery for future property damage will have to show that the mill emissions are a new continuing nuisance,not a nuisance that existed,was abated with the new pollution controls and gradually worsened.the exceptions to the release,the objectors warn,would not help much in this situation,because they extend only to future catastrophic events or claims based solely on future operations that both i involve substantially different manufacturing processes and ii result in substantially different or greater air emissions,releases or odors than current or historical operations.roa.and because neither the process nor the pollutants it emits is likely to change materially from year to year,it may prove difficult to establish that a future claim is based on substantially different conduct.
even if this is true,it does not establish that the scope of the release disserves the public interest by removing all future incentives for steel to maintain their equipment and limit toxic emissions.the steel company,keep in mind,remains subject to the regulation of two and the united have enacted extensive environmental laws and regulations and which have sophisticated agencies devoted to ensuring compliance with them.in addition to permitting claims for new continuing nuisances,the settlement agreement says nothing thus does not enforcement actions based on statutory violations.not just the federal and state agencies may enforce these laws so too may the class members and other individuals they may act as private attorneys general to enforce the clean air act,by reporting suspected violations to the epa and by bringing a citizen suit if the federal and state authorities fail to address their allegations,see,or they may sue for declaratory and equitable relief to enforce the michigan environmental protection act,see.comp.laws.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in approving this release.the release is not as as the objectors perceive,and it is not unfair,unreasonable or inadequate.see.e.the settlement process depends on compromise,and the objectors can not expect steel to give up million dollars,based on conduct since,while leaving class members free to turn around and sue the next day for the same conduct.the release reasonably balances steel interest in resolving the claims and the public interest in protecting river rouge and ecorse residents from future harmful emissions.
neither have the objectors made the case that the agreement is a product of collusion.see williams vukovich,cir.the duration and complexity of the litigation,to start,undermines the objectors suspicions.the parties litigated for almost four years before reaching a settlement agreement.the court fielded numerous contested pretrial motions.class counsel pursued multiple avenues to gather consulting with michigan environmental authorities to conducting numerous substantive depositions.and the agreement itself was a product of months of supervised negotiations,two facilitated mediations and a settlement conference with the court.it is difficult to maintain that class counsel took all of these steps merely to mask its collusion with steel,and that the one entity with a bird eye view of the district court missed the signs that the parties were merely engaged in pretense and posturing.
the objectors also see evidence of collusion where it does not exist.the scope of the release,as we have shown,is not as far reaching as the objectors claim and will not give steel a blank check to pollute anew.and releasing a claim that the plaintiffs included in their original complaint likewise does not demonstrate collusion.see olden,app x at.
revisions to the settlement agreement that purportedly occurred without the advice,consent or knowledge of the class representative and that the court approved before notifying the class,moulton br,also do not demonstrate collusion.by narrowing the release to future claims arising out of conduct,as the targeted changes did,the court and parties responded to moulton objections.a revision that makes an agreement more favorable to class members,whether or not it occurred with the approval of the class representatives,does not establish collusion.
the objectors argue further that the agreement is collusive because the class representative had no input whatsoever on its terms.moulton br.no doubt,t he specter of collusion arises in every situation where class counsel negotiate s settlement terms without meaningful oversight by the class representative.olden,app x at citation and quotation marks omitted.but that apparition vanishes here because the objectors offer no evidence that class counsel excluded them from settlement discussions,much less that they did so for collusive reasons.
that leaves the million settlement,which the agreement distributes as follows to each covered member of the class,limited to one award per household to the seven class representatives and million in attorney fees thirty percent and in costs to class counsel.any residual,the agreement says,goes to the river rouge and ecorse public schools.because class counsel received claims,roughly million will go to the claimants and roughly million will go to the schools.
the objectors first argue that awards of are unconscionably low.but that objection is based on the misconception that the agreement releases all future tort claims.having conceded that would be sufficient to release steel from the future consequences of its conduct,moulton br,which is what the release purports to do,this contention goes nowhere.nor,it deserves mention,do the objectors or any other party protest the differential between the allotted to each class member and the allotted to each class representative.
the thirty percent attorney fee award,they add,is too high,claiming that it will exceed the recovery of the class by over.moulton br.but this estimate is wrong the objectors focus on the amo
