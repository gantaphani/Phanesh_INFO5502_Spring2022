in december,enron corporation filed for bankruptcy.seven years later,litigation involving the enron collapse endures.today decision presents another chapter in that story.
factual and procedural background 
on october,enron publicly announced that it had incurred a million loss and was taking charges of billion in the third quarter of.that week,the wall street journal published a series of articles revealing that enron and related entities had engaged in various fraudulent transactions.as a result,the price of enron stock plummeted,precipitating the decline of the company.
in late,the houston law firm of fleming associates the fleming firm filed seven lawsuits in texas state courts on behalf of several hundred clients against various defendants.pursuant to these suits,the fleming firm sought ex parte temporary restraining orders to prevent the defendants from destroying documents.meanwhile,the district court,which already had jurisdiction over various cases involving these parties as part of the enron multidistrict litigation mdl proceeding and the newby consolidated cases,had already issued a similar order against the same defendants.based on the fleming firm conduct in seeking ex parte orders in state court,on february,the district court issued a memorandum and order enjoining the fleming firm from filing any new actions without leave of the court the february,injunction.this court affirmed the issuance of the injunction.see newby enron,cir newby i.we held that the district court had the power to issue a narrowly tailored injunction under the all writs act,to enjoin repeatedly vexatious litigants from filing future state court actions.id.we noted,
the district court in this case was attempting to rein in a law firm that represents over plaintiffs the problem is fleming unjustified and duplicative requests for ex parte temporary restraining orders,without notice to lawyers already across the counsel table from fleming and engaged in the prosecution and defense of virtually identical claims in federal suits.
pursuant to the injunction,in october,the fleming firm filed a motion for leave to file two actions in state court and a motion to lift the injunction.the district court granted the motion for leave to file suit but denied the motion to lift the injunction.meanwhile,on july,the district court issued a scheduling order in the newby securities class action,and on july,the district court certified the class in newby 
on october,the fleming firm moved for leave to file lawsuits in texas courts on behalf of approximately clients.the proposed defendants included several financial institutions and enron outside officers and directors this group comprises the financial institutions the fleming firm attached its proposed state court petitions to its motion for leave to file suit.the state court suits would allege seven state law causes of action common law fraud and,negligence,statutory fraud,aiding and abetting liability under the texas securities act,civil conspiracy,aiding and abetting common law fraud,and negligent misrepresentation.
the district court denied the fleming firm motion for leave to file suit.the court determined that the statute of limitations had run for all of the fleming firm proposed state law claims and that no tolling doctrines applied.therefore,the court concluded that it would be futile to grant the motion,as the texas courts would dismiss the state law claims as.the fleming firm appeals.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
this court has jurisdiction pursuant to,as the district court issued a final judgment denying the motion for leave to file suit.the district court had jurisdiction under because the newby case involves federal securities law claims.
we review the district court actions pursuant to the injunction it issued for an abuse of discretion.see newby i,at.we review de novo underlying questions of law,such as whether the statute of limitations has run or whether equitable tolling applies.see in re hinsley,cir fdic dawson,cir.
iii.discussion 
statutes of limitations 
the fleming firm seeks to bring seven causes of action in state court.the proposed state law claims for common law fraud and count i,statutory fraud count iii,and aiding and abetting common law fraud count vi all have a statute of limitations.civ.prac.ann.common law fraud id.a statutory fraud id.aiding and abetting common law fraud.the proposed claims for aiding and abetting under the texas securities act count iv have a statute of limitations.stat.ann.h.the claims for negligence count ii,civil conspiracy count v,and negligent misrepresentation count vii all have a statute of limitations.civ.prac.ann.negligence stevenson koutzarov,civil conspiracy.civ.prac.ann,provident life accident ins.knott,negligent misrepresentation.given that the fleming firm clients had notice of their claims on october,the longest statute of limitations at issue here four years would have expired on october,unless a tolling doctrine applies.
the fleming firm submitted its motion for leave to file the state court suits on october.the district court held that as of this date,without tolling,the statutes of limitations would bar all but the claims with a limitations period.further,the court concluded that without tolling,texas law would also bar the claims that have a statute of limitations because the fleming firm did not file an original petition with a state court clerk pursuant to texas rule of civil procedure before the limitations period expired.the district court noted that under its local rule,the motion for leave to file suit would not be ripe for a ruling until twenty days after the fleming firm filed the motion,or until november,meaning that the fleming firm could not have filed the state court suits within the statute of limitations even if the court had granted leave accordingly,the court held that granting leave to file any of the proposed claims would be futile.
contrary to the fleming firm suggestion,the district court did not violate any notions of federalism by determining whether a texas state court would dismiss the fleming firm suits based on the state statute of limitations.the district court has jurisdiction over a multitude of claims under the mdl and is intimately involved in the many facets of the litigation surrounding the enron collapse.all of the parties in the fleming firm proposed state law claims are also before the district court in similar proceedings.it was not outside of the scope of the district court duties to determine if the texas courts would immediately dismiss the proposed state law claims involving parties already before the district court.further,federal courts often consider issues involving a state statute of limitations.see,vaught showa denko,cir analyzing the texas rule for tolling the state statute of limitations when the plaintiff also was involved in a federal class action.
in determining that it had the authority to deny the motion for leave based on the futility of the state law claims,the district court analogized to the rules for granting leave to file a motion to amend under federal rule of civil procedure a.that rule states that a court should freely give leave to amend a pleading when justice so requires.a.however,a court need not grant leave to amend when the filing would be futile because the proposed claims are.see fdic conner,cir.
the fleming firm argues that the district court incorrectly failed to incorporate the principle of rule c into its analysis when the court used rule a as an analogy.rule c states that an amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when,inter alia,the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set attempted to be set the original pleading.c b.the fleming firm asserts that the district court should have determined that the proposed actions would be timely because the fleming firm attached the petitions to its motion for leave to file suit,and thus they would relate back to the date of filing october,which was three days before the statute of limitations expired for some of its claims.the fleming firm also contends that the texas state courts would apply texas analogous rule for motions to amend given that the federal court denied the motion for leave on the basis of the rules regarding motions to amend.see.civ.prac.ann.finally,the fleming firm argues that the filing of its motion for leave to file suit,accompanied by the proposed petitions,served the purpose of a statute of limitations because it gave the defendants notice of the claims within the limitations period.see,moore indiana,cir as a party has no control over when a court renders its decision regarding the proposed amended complaint,the submission of a motion for leave to amend,properly accompanied by the proposed amended complaint that provides notice of the substance of those amendments,tolls the statute of limitations,even though technically the amended complaint will not be filed until the court rules on the motion.
assuming,arguendo,that rule a applies in this situation,the district court was correct to conclude that it would be futile to grant leave for the fleming firm to file the state court actions that have a or statute of limitations.that is,the state court would rule that these claims are,even with the benefit of a doctrine,because the fleming firm did not file its motion for leave to file suit before these statutes of limitations had expired.
the district court was incorrect,however,in denying the motion for leave to file suit for the claims that have a statute of limitations.the court did not cite any authority for using its own local rules to dictate the state filing date for purposes of texas principle.in effect,the district court was requiring the fleming firm either to file a motion for leave at least twenty days before the statute of limitations perhaps even earlier if the district court did not rule on the motion in to violate the injunction by filing in state court within the limitations period.schillinger union pac,cir the logic underlying using the date of filing for limitations purposes as opposed to the date the court rules on the motion is that defendants are on notice of the amendment when the motion is filed and it would be unfair to plaintiffs if a trial court waited months or years to rule.thus,the district court should have allowed the texas state courts to decide whether the filing of the state petitions relates back to the filing of the motion for leave to file suit for the claims that have a statute of limitations,meaning that these claims might not be futile.because the fleming firm sought to file these claims before the statute of limitations expired,it is up to the state court to determine how to proceed.in sum,the district court improperly denied the motion for leave to file the claims involving common law fraud and count i,statutory fraud count iii,and aiding and abetting common law fraud count vi,because these claims all have a statute of limitations,and the fleming firm submitted its motion for leave to file suit before that limitations period expired.
as discussed above,the district court properly denied the motion for leave for the claims that have a or statute of limitations unless a tolling doctrine applies.the fleming firm posits three possible tolling doctrines.first,the fleming firm argues that the district court scheduling order in the newby mdl tolled the limitations period for its proposed claims.second,the fleming firm argues that the february,injunction itself tolled the statute of limitations because it prevented the fleming firm from exercising its clients legal remedies.finally,the fleming firm asserts that the tolling doctrine from american pipe construction utah,d applies.after a careful review,it is apparent that none of the fleming firm arguments have merit.
newby mdl scheduling order 
in its july,scheduling order in the newby mdl case,the district court stated that all other suits except for those brought by plaintiffs who had decided to proceed under the newby consolidated amended complaints shall be stayed as to the filing of amended pleadings responsive pleadings until the motions for class certification in newby are resolved by the court,but discovery may proceed.the district court did not rule on the newby class certification until july.the fleming firm argues that the district court admitted in its december,order involving other claims not subject to this appeal that it had intended to toll the statute of limitations for all claims in its july,scheduling order.see in re enron,no,et,wl,at,in issuing the july,scheduling order,this court fully intended to toll the statute of limitations from running in the newby consolidated and coordinated cases from entry of the order until it certified the class in newby and gave plaintiffs in the consolidated and coordinated cases a schedule to opt out and to file motions for leave to amend.
in making its argument,however,the fleming firm misconstrues the district court july,scheduling order.in that order,the district court was contemplating cases in which the plaintiffs had already filed a complaint.in particular,the court stated that its scheduling order operated to stay the cases as to the filing of amended pleadings responsive pleadings,not initial complaints.the december,order did not state anything to the contrary,simply noting that the july,order tolled the statute of limitations from running in the newby consolidated and coordinated cases.id.thus,the district court intended to stay the cases in which the plaintiffs had already filed a complaint,not toll the statute of limitations for claims not yet before the court.accordingly,the district court did not toll the fleming firm proposed state law claims,which the fleming firm had not yet filed.
february,injunction 
the district court february,injunction,preventing the fleming firm from filing state law claims without leave of the court,also did not toll the statute of limitations.contrary to the fleming firm argument,this order did not prevent the fleming firm from exercising its clients legal remedies.see jackson johnson,cir stating that where a person is prevented from exercising his legal remedy by the pendency of legal proceedings,the time during which he is thus prevented should not be counted against him in determining whether limitations have barred his right.the injunction simply required the fleming firm to take another step and seek judicial approval before proceeding in state court.the fleming firm still could bring its claims in an attempt to vindicate its clients legal rights,so long as it first filed a motion for leave to file suit.in fact,this is exactly what occurred in october when the fleming firm successfully moved for leave to file two actions in state court.therefore,this argument is without merit.
american pipe tolling 
in american pipe,the supreme court held that the commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action.at.the policy behind this decision is that a contrary rule would induce potential class members to file protective motions to intervene or join in the event that the court denied class certification,simply to preserve their claims.see id.at.the court clarified the scope of american pipe in crown,cork seal parker,d,ruling that a class action tolls a statute of limitations for all asserted members of the class,not just potential intervenors.
the texas courts generally have adopted the american pipe tolling doctrine for state class actions.in grant austin bridge construction,the texas court of appeals held that even though the statute of limitations on a class member individual cause of action would expire during the pendency of a class action,the filing of the class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all purported members of the class.however,the texas courts have not extended this holding to allow a federal class action to toll a state statute of limitations.see bell showa denko,refusing to apply american pipe tolling to a state law mass personal injury suit based on a federal class action.the court in bell disti
