appellant denise wilkins appellant appeals the district court orders striking her expert witness denying her second motion to amend her complaint and granting summary judgment to appellee vicki montgomery,assistant director for clinical administration at central state hospital.appellant brought this action against montgomery after her son,justin lamar davis,was murdered by another patient at central state hospital.she filed three claims grossly negligent supervision,gross negligence under the virginia wrongful death act,and a claim for supervisory liability.
the district court struck appellant expert witness because he was disclosed in an untimely fashion denied appellant second motion to amend her complaint to add two defendants because such amendment would be futile and finally,concluded there was insufficient evidence to support the claims against montgomery,who was an assistant director in charge of administrative matters at the time of davis death.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
on january,justin lamar davis was transferred to central state hospital csh,an inpatient facility providing treatment for patients with mental illnesses who are referred by the court system.on february,george phillips was admitted to csh while waiting to be prosecuted for attempted capital murder.both phillips and davis were housed in the forensic unit,ward.
csh had a policy whereby staff would issue hour reports also called administrator on duty or aod reports regarding patient activity.see aod reports during the week of february,reflect that davis struck a staff member in the face and hit another patient.on february,phillips reported feeling threatened by davis,and phillips stated he will not give davis another warning and he will end up flying out of here in a helicopter to a hospital.id.at.phillips told the staff that he could get a pen out of a staff pocket if he wanted and harm him self or anyone else.id.
the next day,on february,phillips and davis had an altercation in the gymnasium.phillips attacked davis from behind,but davis was not injured.the aod report,which was issued the following day on february,explained that davis feels others want to harm him and wanted to be moved off the unit.it also stated that sridhar yaratha,the psychiatrist on davis treatment team at csh,was aware of davis desire to move.id.in addition,the report stated that after the altercation,phillips told staff he was tired of davis and that he could have easily snapped his neck.id.on the evening and night of february,phillips was monitored constantly by staff and behavior documented on every shift.id.indeed,on that day,and for at least one week prior,phillips was on suicide observation status sos,violence observation status vos,and escape observation status eos,which required minute monitoring checks by assigned staff.id.at.
on february,davis was also on vos and also required minute checks.the charge nurse,lawrence harris,assigned to essence thompson,forensic mental health technician,the duty of carrying out the minute checks that night.however,rather than conducting the required checks,both harris and thompson were watching television in a nearby room.between and that night,phillips left his room,entered davis room,and proceeded to strangle davis to death in his bed.it was not until the following morning,february,that another staff member discovered that davis was dead.
an investigation by the hospital concluded that s taff n eglect led to davis murder,and found that thompson remained seated in the chair directly facing the television on the night of davis death,which provided phillips the opportunity to do serious harm to davis.in addition,the hospital report concluded harris failed to provide the necessary supervision and leadership required to ensure thompson was at her assigned monitoring post and carrying out her assigned duties.instead,harris sat one seat from thompson directly facing the television.id.
exactly two years after davis death,february,appellant davis mother filed suit against csh,the commonwealth of virginia,vicki montgomery appellee,and several as of yet unidentified employees of csh.see wilkins cent.state,cv jag,ecf.the original complaint contained three counts wrongful death based on gross negligence,grossly negligent supervision,and a u.claim for supervisory liability.
on april,appellant filed the first amended complaint fac.in the fac,appellant dropped the state defendants,and the only defendants remaining were appellee in her individual and official capacity,who was incorrectly listed as director of the csh,and several as of yet unidentified employees of csh.the fac contained the same three counts and allegations as the original complaint.
on april,appellee filed a motion to dismiss,but withdrew that motion on may,when she filed a motion for summary judgment.in the motion for summary judgment,appellee argued that because she was not director of csh at the time of davis death,she had no supervisory responsibility or authority over any security personnel,treatment staff,or medical staff.
the district court entered a order and set the trial date for february.appellant rule a expert disclosures were to be produced by october,however,this deadline was moved back to november,by agreement of the parties.the deadline for motions challenging experts was december.on november,appellant provided the name of her purported expert witness,pogos voskanian,along with a curriculum vitae,but no written report.almost two weeks after the november deadline for rule disclosures which had been agreed to by appellant on december,appellant disclosed what she called a preliminary report by voskanian the preliminary report,as its name suggests,was only one page and simply contained a list of the materials the expert reviewed,and two sentences of opinion 
based on review of the above listed documents,it is my opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the care and treatment provided to justin lamar davis fell substantially below an acceptable standard of care.administration of the hospital failed to provide adequate services and supervision and members of the treatment team failed to provide adequate monitoring,safety and treatment,amounting to deliberate indifference to the patient needs and premature death of justin davis.
on december,appellee filed a renewed motion for summary judgment and a motion to exclude appellant expert witness.on december,now one month after the expert disclosure date agreed to by appellant,and on the court deadline for filing motions to exclude experts appellant filed an additional,expert report by voskanian.
the district court held a motions hearing on february,and granted the motion to exclude voskanian the following day.see the february order.appellant then filed a rule motion to alter or amend the february order.
in the meantime,on december,appellant filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.she sought only to add as defendants charles davis the actual director of csh at the time davis was murdered and yaratha.
on april,the district court held a hearing on the remaining outstanding motions,including the motion to amend.the court ruled from the bench,granting the motion for summary judgment,and denying the motion to amend the complaint and the rule motion to alter or amend its order excluding voskanian.a formal order issued the following day.see the april order.
appellant filed a timely notice of appeal of the february and april orders.
we review the district court exclusion of a plaintiff expert witness,its denial of a motion to amend the complaint,and its ruling on a rule motion to alter or amend for abuse of discretion.see states rack fixture,sherwin williams,cir laber harvey,cir sloas csx,cir.as to the motion to amend the complaint,we review the district court analysis of the law regarding relation back de novo.see locklear bergman beving ab,cir.

we first discuss appellant challenge to the district court exclusion of her expert,voskanian.this issue implicates both the february order excluding voskanian,and the portion of the april order denying appellant rule motion to alter or amend the february order.
at the february motions hearing,the district court ruled as follows 
the expert will be excluded.you just ca if we were to allow him to testify it would just turn everything that is in the pretrial order on its head.let me just say that i think the question of deliberate indifference,if that is the standard used in this case,is one you can argue to the jury based on what the administrators knew and when they knew it.i do think you need an expert on that.
at the april hearing,regarding the rule motion,the district court stated,
th e motion to alter or amend the february order will be denied,for two reasons.first,the plaintiff was just way late in naming an expert in this case.and i know how hard it is to find experts for cases like this.but we have those deadlines so we can move in an orderly fashion.and the lateness with which the expert was identified would not allow that to happen.second,the expert witness report is pretty much a brief of legal conclusions in the case,and i do think it is something that offers expert opinions on the issues on which an expert might be allowed to testify in this case.
the pre trial order in this case stated,the parties will disclose the information required under rule a on the following schedule party with the burden of proof on an issue by october,which was later moved to november,by consent of the parties.wilkins cent.state,cv filed,ecf at order see also id.ecf filed,order granting consent motion to amend order.
federal rule of civil procedure a provides,
a party must disclose to the other parties the identity of any witness it may use at trial to present evidence under federal rule of evidence,or unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court,this disclosure must be accompanied by a written report prepared and signed by the witness if the witness is one retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case.
a a,b emphasis supplied.furthermore,a party must make these disclosures at the time and in the sequence the court orders.a d emphases supplied.therefore,because appellant did not disclose the written report by the deadline,she necessarily violated the pre trial order and rule a.
in light of this violation,we can not say the district court abused its discretion in excluding voskanian as an appropriate sanction.rule c provides,
if a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by rule a or e,the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion,at a hearing,or at a trial,unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.
c.this court has explained,
rule disclosures are often the centerpiece of discovery in litigation that uses expert witnesses.a party that fails to provide these disclosures unfairly inhibits its opponent ability to properly prepare,unnecessarily prolongs litigation,and undermines the district court management of the case.for this reason,we give particularly wide latitude to the district court discretion to issue sanctions under rule c.
saudi northrop grumman,cir quoting states rack fixture,sherwin williams,cir alteration omitted see also states,at the rule c advisory committee notes emphasize that the automatic sanction of exclusion provides a strong inducement for disclosure of material that the disclosing party would expect to use as evidence.quoting.c advisory committee note,amendment emphasis supplied 
in southern states,we elaborated,
the language of rule c provides two exceptions to the general rule excluding evidence that a party seeks to offer but has failed to properly disclose when the failure to disclose is substantially justified,and when the nondisclosure is harmless.
i n exercising its broad discretion to determine whether a nondisclosure of evidence is substantially justified or harmless for purposes of a rule c exclusion analysis,a district court should be guided by the following factors the surprise to the party against whom the evidence would be offered the ability of that party to cure the surprise the extent to which allowing the evidence would disrupt the trial the importance of the evidence and the party explanation for its failure to disclose the evidence.
at emphasis supplied alterations omitted.the burden of establishing these factors lies with the nondisclosing party in this case,appellant.see id.at it is the obligation of the party facing sanctions for belated disclosure to show that its failure to comply with rule c was either justified or harmless.quoting wilson bradlees of new england,cir alterations omitted.appellant argues that the district court was required to weigh the southern states factors before excluding voskanian,it failed to do so,and even if it had done so,it would have concluded that the late disclosure was harmless we disagree on all counts.
first of all,the district court was not required to tick through each of the southern states factors.southern states explains that district courts have broad discretion to decide harmlessness and should not shall be guided by the five factors.states,at see also united states maria,cir t he common meaning of should suggests or recommends a course of action,while the ordinary understanding of shall describes a course of action that is mandatory.hoyle freightliner,llc,cir t he fact that the district court did not expressly mention the test we adopted in southern states is not indicative of an abuse of discretion.carr deeds,cir affirming the district court exclusion of testimony for rule a violation when the southern states factors were not mentioned.thus,the district court failure to cite southern states and specifically address each of the five factors listed therein does not amount to an abuse of discretion.
second,the district court implicitly addressed some of the southern states factors when deciding whether to exclude voskanian as an expert witness.for example,it invoked the third factor when it discussed the disruption of the trial date and pre trial scheduling order.see i f we were to allow him to testify it would just turn everything that is in the pretrial order on its head.id.at t he plaintiff was just way late in naming an expert in this case w e have those deadlines so we can move in an orderly fashion.and the lateness with which the expert was identified would not allow that to happen.the district court also touched on the fourth factor,when it stated that the expert testimony would not assist a trier of fact.see id.at let me just say that i think the question of deliberate indifference is one you can argue to the jury based on what the administrators knew and when they knew it.i do think you need an expert on that.id.at t he expert witness report is pretty much a brief of legal conclusions in the case,and i do think it is something that offers expert opinions on the issues on which an expert might be allowed to testify in this case.and,as to factor five,appellant provided no reason whatsoever for its failure to disclose the evidence in a timely manner.see appellant br.providing arguments on the first four factors but not the fifth.
finally,our own review of the southern states factors demonstrates that appellant error was far from harmless.in addition to the reasons provided by the district court,appellant initial disclosure failed to provide appellee with any concrete explanation of voskanian potential testimony.the disclosure was made after the expert disclosure date,after discovery was closed,after appellee filed a motion for summary judgment,and on the very date set by the court for the filing of motions to exclude experts.it is hard to accept that these events would not serve as a surprise to appellee,or that appellee could easily cure such a surprise.see hoyle,at finding no abuse of discretion where district court excluded expert declaration when the disclosing party notified his opponent of the declaration not only after the close of discovery but after the opponent had filed its motion for summary judgment.
for these reasons,we find no abuse of discretion in the district court exclusion of voskanian as an expert witness.
we next turn to appellant argument that the district court abused its discretion in denying her motion to amend her complaint for the second time.
in the proposed amended complaint,appellant sought to add two defendants davis,director of csh at the time justin davis was murdered,and yaratha,the psychiatrist on justin davis treatment team at csh.the district court denied the motion because it would be futile,there was no evidence of a pervasive risk of constitutional injury and no evidence that davis and yaratha were deliberately indifferent to the knowledge of the risk.as explained more fully below,we hold that appellant proposed third amended complaint would not relate back therefore,we affirm the district court on that ground.see united states aparicio soria,cir en banc we may affirm the district court on any ground in the record.
appellant filed the second motion to amend and proposed amended complaint on december,ten months after the statute of limitations had expired.see lewis richmond city police dep t,cir there is no federal statute of limitations for claims,so the state limitations period which governs personal injury actions is applied virginia has a statute of limitations for personal injury claims.citing ann.a a soc y without a name virginia,cir applying virginia law with regard to the claim,the period is two years.therefore,unless the amended complaint relates back to the date of the original filing,it will be barred by the statute of limitations and subject to dismissal.locklear bergman beving ab,cir.
in determining whether an amended complaint relates back,we look to federal rule of civil procedure c,which provides,
an amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when,
b the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence set out or attempted to be set out in the original pleading or 
c the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted,if rule c b is satisfied and if,within the period provided by rule m for serving the summons and complaint the party to be brought in by amendment 
i received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits and 
ii knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it,but for a mistake concerning the proper party identity.
c see also robinson clipse,cir explaining that when a proposed amendment changes the party against whom a claim is asserted,the amending party must satisfy the requirements set forth in rule c c i and ii.this rule presumes that the amending party can make the amendment,although it does constrain substantially the type of amendment that may relate back.goodman praxair,cir en banc.
when an amendment seeks to add a defendant,the focus turns to the notice to that individual or entity.specifically,as to rule c c ii,the supreme court has clarified,the question is not whether the amending party knew or should have known the identity of the proper defendant,but whether the potential defendant knew or should have known that it would have been named as a defendant but for an error.krupski costa crociere.we have explained,
rule description of when such an amendment relates back to the original pleading focuses on the notice to the new party and the effect on the new party that the amendment will have.these core requirements preserve for the new party the protections of a statute of limitations.they assure that the new party had adequate notice within the limitations period and was not prejudiced by being added to the litigation.
goodman,at citation omitted emphases in original see also norton int l harvesters,cir p rejudice within the meaning of rule is prima facially established where a party named as an additional defendant in the amended complaint is deprived of the defense of the statute of limitations.hageman signal gas,cir a n amendment adding another party is a new cause of action which can not be added after the time limitation has expired.goodman,at rule c must be understood to freely permit amendment of pleadings and their so long as the policies of statutes of limitations have been effectively served.
the proposed amended complaint in this case clearly meets the first requirement of rule c c that rule c b is satisfied,that is,the claims in the amended complaint arose out of the conduct,transaction,or occurrence in the original complaint because it seeks to add defendants rather than to alter the underlying causes of action.see locklear,at.therefore,we focus on whether,within the period of time provided by rule m,davis and yaratha received such notice of the action that they w ould not be prejudiced in defending on the merits,and knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against them,but for a mistake concerning the proper party identity.c c i,ii.
appellant argues that davis and yaratha had notice of the complaint and thus,there was absolutely no prejudice that could be identified.appellant br.however,the record evidence shows that yaratha did not receive notice of the lawsuit against appellee until he was asked to attend a deposition in the matter on november,eight months after the initial complaint was filed and the statute of limitations had expired,and four months after the time period set forth in rule m.see yaratha declaration i first became aware of the lawsuit on november,when i was asked to attend a deposition in this matter.davis was not made aware until december,when he received an email from appellee office about the months after the initial complaint was filed and the statute of limitations had expired,and six months after the time period set forth in rule m.see id.at davis declaration,davis deposition.
appellant offers no evidence to the contrary.instead,she merely contends that davis and yaratha clearly had notice of the complaint,based on the allegations that they were represented by the same office as appellee.appellant br.there is zero support in the record for this contention.rather,it is belied by the record.see,indicating that davis and yaratha were represented at their depositions by the law firm rawls mcnelis mitchell,not by the office of the attorney general,which represented appellee.appellant further asserts that davis had notice of the lawsuit because he still has an office and practices medicine at csh.appellant br.this assertion is also belied by the record.see davis deposition,stating that he retired from csh in may.
appellant also submits that knowledge should be imputed to davis and yaratha because they have a sufficient identity of interest with the original defendant.appellant br.quoting goodman,at.goodman states,we can conclude that when a plaintiff alleges a comprehensible claim against one of a group of closely related and functioning business entities or corporations,the other entities in that group,barring a contrary showing,will be charged with knowledge under rule of the entity properly answerable to the claim.goodman,at.
but in goodman,the business entities in question were a parent and subsidiary corporation,which were represented by the same lawyers.see goodman,at.indeed,the subsidiary corporation in goodman concede d it had notice but thought that goodman intended to sue the parent corporation.id.this case is marke
