gene stidham stidham owned a motorcycle funeral escort business.he sued the individual defendants,who are officials of the texas commission on private security tcps.the basis of his action is that,after he refused to apply for a tcps license,the defendants,in violation of his right to due process of law,sent letters to his funeral home clients telling them that stidham was operating in violation of the law and that they could be prosecuted if they continued to contract with him.he claims that this conduct destroyed his business,thus depriving him of property and his liberty right to engage in a chosen profession.stidham also contends that the defendants furthered their unconstitutional conduct and damage by refusing to notify stidham clients when the authorities exonerated him.the district court granted the defendants qualified immunity and dismissed the suit on summary judgment.because we find that the defendants deprived stidham of his clearly established rights in an objectively unreasonable manner,we vacate the district court grant of qualified immunity and remand the case for further proceedings.
stidham is a former police officer who,from to september,operated stidham motorcycle escorts he provided uniformed motorcycle escort services to control traffic and provide traffic safety for funeral processions.stidham had oral contracts with several funeral homes in tarrant county and with one funeral home in dallas county.
in june,after reading a newspaper article about an accident in which an employee of stidham motorcycle escorts was killed,jerry mcglasson mcglasson,the executive director of tcps,directed biggs,a tcps investigator,to contact stidham.biggs told stidham that he needed a license to operate his business because his business was a guard company under texas occupations code and stidham replied that he did not need a license and that he would not get one.biggs then telephoned stidham a second time,urging him to apply for a license.she also faxed him a copy of the occupations code provisions on security guards.stidham took no action to obtain a license.
on august,pursuant to the tcps manual provisions biggs obtained a misdemeanor arrest warrant in tarrant county for stidham based on his operation of a guard company without an owner license then,in september,while the criminal case in tarrant county was still pending,biggs sent letters to four funeral homes in tarrant county and one in dallas county with which stidham had been doing business.these letters stated 
this agency has received information that you are contracting with or employing stidham motorcycle escorts to provide a service funeral escort that requires a license,registration,certificate,or commission,and this does not hold a license,registration,certificate,or commission.section and of the occupations code requires that funeral escort services be licensed and regulated by the texas commission on private security.
please be advised that contracting with or employing a person company who is required to hold a license,registration,certificate,or commission by the texas commission on private security,knowing that that person or company is required to hold a license,registration,certificate or commission is a class a misdemeanor,punishable by up to year confinement a fine.however,the offense is a felony of the degree if you have been previously convicted of an offense under this act,and the offense consisted of failing to hold a registration,certificate,license or commission,as stated in of the occupations code.
one of the recipients of these letters,roger marshall marshall,managing director of greenwood funeral home,stated in a deposition that he called mcglasson to discuss the letter.he said that mcglasson threatened to report marshall funeral home to the texas funeral commission if marshall continued to use stidham motorcycle escort service.stidham maintains that these letters and the subsequent threats effectively put an end to his business.
on october,the tarrant county district attorney office declined to prosecute stidham based on its determination that stidham activity did not rise to the level of operating a guard company.stidham wrote to larry shimek shimek,tcps chief of investigations,and cliff grumbles grumbles,tcps deputy director,requesting that they inform his former clients of tarrant county refusal to prosecute him.shimek and grumbles declined to do so.
biggs also filed charges against stidham in dallas county after receiving advice from her supervisor,ryan finch,that the dallas county prosecutor might be more informed as to the scope of tcps authority to regulate businesses like stidham.
on january,the texas attorney general issued an opinion that the tcps lacked authority to regulate funeral motorcycle escort businesses.the record indicates that the tcps defendants did not inform stidham former clients that the attorney general had issued an opinion affirming that the tcps did not have the authority to regulate funeral escort services.
stidham sued the tcps and four of its under,the texas constitution,texas common law,and the texas uniform declaratory judgment act.he alleged that the defendants,acting under color of state law but without lawful authority from the occupations code,deprived him of property and liberty without procedural and substantive due process,tortiously interfered with his contracts,and intentionally inflicted emotional distress.on may,the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss as to the intentional infliction of emotion distress claim 
at summary judgment,the district court dismissed on eleventh amendment grounds stidham claims against tcps and the defendants in their official capacities.the court further found that the defendants were shielded from suit in their individual capacities by the doctrine of qualified immunity.the court reasoned that the defendants actions were objectively reasonable because they relied on legal advice and because of their history of regulating conduct similar to stidham after dismissing the claims over which it had original jurisdiction,the district court declined to assert supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.stidham appeals,arguing that the district court erred in granting summary judgment based on qualified immunity.he asks us to vacate the grant of summary judgment and to remand this case for trial on both his claim and his remaining state law claims.

stidham contends that the tcps defendants actions deprived him of his clearly established property and liberty interests without due process of law.he asserts that the letters sent by biggs and the threats made by mcglasson to marshall violated his right to due process of law by announcing his guilt before lawful proceedings determined whether he was in violation of the law.this conduct,he contends,destroyed his business.given that he only had oral,contracts with the funeral homes,he characterizes his constitutionally protected property interest as the profits from his business.he also contends that constitutional due process protected his liberty interest in operating his business as his chosen occupation.stidham maintains that these constit
