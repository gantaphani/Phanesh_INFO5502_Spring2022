appellant dean hedges,whose sailboat was destroyed by heavy seas after it was moored at the virgin islands national park,appeals from the district court dismissal of his admiralty claim against the united states for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.we must decide whether equitable tolling is applicable to save hedges claim.the district court for the virgin islands had jurisdiction under the suits in admiralty act saa,this court has jurisdiction from the district court final order pursuant to.
on december,hedges boat broke free from its virgin islands national park vinp mooring and drifted onto nearby rocks,where it was destroyed.the painter line on the mooring,which was manufactured by environmental moorings international emi,appeared to have chaffed and come apart under harsh weather conditions.hedge boat was uninsured.
shortly after the incident,hedges sought advice from several park service employees regarding the proper avenue to pursue a claim against the united states.hedges first contacted mary morris,the national park service nps concessions officer in thomas,virgin islands,who had issued hedges permit to enter the vinp.he claims that morris advised him to file a claim pursuant to the federal tort claims act ftca,and then mailed him a standard claim form.hedges then contacted department of interior doi attorney patricia,who responded by letter dated january,
enclosed per your request,please find a copy of standard form.the completed form along with copies of all supporting documentation,should be sent to linda giles the safety health manager for the national park service inquiries can be directed to the undersigned 
app.at.next,hedges claims to have contacted linda giles who confirmed that a ftca claim,filed on a form,was the proper avenue for obtaining relief.finally,hedges contacted vinp service superintendent francis peliter who,on february,sent a letter to hedges that read in its entirety i received your fax dated january,on february.i have asked mary morris and keith watson of my staff to work with you on these issues.app.at.
on december,hedges,proceeding pro se filed an administrative claim under the ftca claiming property damage of.his claim also alleged personal injury damages of due to a period of depression,allegedly brought on by the loss of his boat.on october,the doi denied his claim.the field solicitor first reasoned that hedges had alleged a maritime tort,a cause of action cognizable under the saa,not the ftca,and that under the comparative negligence regime for claims sounding in admiralty,hedges did not have a meritorious claim.he concluded that whereas the united states excercised sic reasonable care to make the mooring and the painter line safe,hedges acted negligently by leaving his boat unattended during harsh weather conditions.app.
on november,hedges wrote a letter to the doi protesting the denial of his claim,arguing that he did have a colorable cause of action under the ftca,and emphasizing that it was impractical for him to hire an attorney because attorney costs would likely be more than the value of his boat.on november,the doi issued a second denial of hedges claim.hedges once again protested this denial by submitting several letters and making several phone calls to the doi.on january,the doi issued its final denial of hedges administrative claim,stating that w e have carefully examined the facts of your case and must deny your claim under both the federal tort claims act and under the suits in admiralty act.app.at.
on january,before he had received the final denial of his claim from the doi,hedges filed a complaint against the united states and emi in the district court of the united states virgin islands,croix division,alleging diversity jurisdiction under.on january,hedges amended his complaint to assert a claim under the ftca.
on march,the united states filed a.b motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the government argued that the saa provides the exclusive jurisdiction for maritime tort claims against the united states,see falgout boats,united states,cir,cert.denied,d,and that the statutory limitations period under the saa had lapsed.in his opposition to the motion to dismiss,hedges both moved to amend his complaint to plead jurisdiction under the saa and argued that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled because he had been induced by national park service personnel to abstain from filing in district court until after pursuing an administrative claim with the federal tort claims act.app.at.
after successive motions,and an oral hearing at which hedges testified,the district court entered a memorandum opinion granting the united states motion to dismiss.the court held that the statute of limitations in the saa was a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit,and that even if equitable tolling were applicable,it was unwarranted in the present case.hedges and emi then settled,and hedges filed a timely notice of appeal from the district court june,order dismissing his action.
the applicable statute provides that suits in admiralty against the united states must be brought within two years after the cause of action arises.an action arises on the date of injury.mcmahon united states.bovell united states dep t of defense,cir.hedges concedes that his complaint,submitted on january,and amended on may,was filed after the statutory period expired.he argues,however,that the time in which he erroneously pursued an administrative claim under the ftca should be excluded under the doctrine of equitable tolling and that the district court erred by failing to do so.
we must first consider whether the doctrine of equitable tolling is available to suits brought pursuant to the saa.if the limitations period in the saa is a jurisdictional mandate,equitable tolling would not be available.see miller new jersey state dep of corrections,cir w hen a time limitation is considered jurisdictional,it can not be modified and is an absolute bar.oshiver levin,fishbein,sedran berman,cir where the filing requirements are considered jurisdictional,bars an action regardless of the equities in a given case.see also robinson dalton,cir stating that exhaustion requirement of title vii is not jurisdictional and therefore subject to equitable tolling.
in bovell,we stated that t he supreme court has construed the saa statute of limitations,as a jurisdictional prerequisite to the waiver of sovereign immunity contained in the saa.at citing mcmahon united states.accordingly,we held that the limitations period of the saa could not be tolled for the period of time that a plaintiff erroneously pursued administrative relief under the ftca.we stated that even if equitable tolling may apply to in appropriate circumstances the latitude which has allowed tolling of statutes of limitations under certain other statutory schemes,is usually not applied to statutes waiving sovereign immunity.bovell,at.we concluded that no tolling was warranted under the circumstances of that case.
bovell,however,was decided before the supreme court decision in irwin dep t of veterans affairs,d,which held that statutes of limitations governing actions against the united states are subject to the same rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling applicable to suits against private defendants.id.at.see also united states beggerly,d united states brockamp,d.
in irwin,the supreme court addressed the issue of whether equitable tolling applied to a title vii claim filed after the statutory limitations period.the court stated that 
once congress has made such a waiver of sovereign immunity,we think that making the rule of equitable tolling applicable to suits against the government,in the same way that it is applicable to private suits,amounts to little,if any,broadening of the congressional waiver we therefore hold that the same rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling applicable to suits against private defendants should also apply to suits against the united states.congress,of course,may provide otherwise if it wishes to do so.
d.in articulating this general rule to govern the applicability of equitable tolling in suits against the government,the court expressed its intent to break with the past practice of deciding each case on an ad hoc basis.id.at.the court has subsequently described the proper inquiry as follows is there good reason to believe that congress did not want the equitable tolling doctrine to apply brockcamp,at.emphasis in original.
consistent with the broad language in irwin,the federal courts have held that equitable tolling is applicable to a wide range of cases against the government,in addition to those under title vii.see,hughes united states,cir applying equitable tolling to federal tort claims act long frank,cir stating that equitable tolling applies to age discrimination in employment act,cert.denied,d nunnally maccausland,cir applying equitable tolling to the civil service reform act.
several courts of appeals have reached the same legal issue before us and have held that the limitations period in the saa is not jurisdictional.see,wilson united states gov t,cir stating that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies to raziano united states,cir same favorite marine pers.provisioning,cir same.in a recent decision,a judge of the eastern district of pennsylvania stated that under the broad language of irwin,the bar of the suits in admiralty act can no longer be considered to be jurisdictional as it had previously been interpreted.arthur united states,d,declining to follow bovell precedent.that decision was justified under the supreme court holding in irwin and we too hold that the limitations period in the saa is not jurisdictional,and therefore subject to equitable tolling.
in beggerly and brockamp,the supreme court set forth several factors that courts should consider in determining whether to rebut the irwin presumption.they are whether equity is already incorporated into the statute the length of the limitations period the substantive area of law the statutory language of the limitations period the availability of other explicit exceptions and the potential administrative burden of equitable tolling.see generally united states beggerly,d united states brockamp,d.
in beggerly,the supreme court held that equitable tolling is not available in a suit brought pursuant to the quiet title act.beggerly,at.stevens,concurring.the quiet title act includes a limitations period,which begins to run from the date the plaintiff or his or her predecessor in interest knew or should have known of the claim of the united states.the court reasoned that by incorporating a knew or should have known standard into the limitations period,congress has already effectively allowed for equitable tolling,and therefore no further tolling is justified.id.at.in contrast,the limitations period in the saa does not incorporate equitable considerations.the supreme court held in mcmahon that the statute of limitations in the saa begins to run on the date of injury.at.therefore,there is no basis for inferring that congress has equitable tolling by incorporating equitable considerations into the saa statute of limitations.
the presumption favoring equitable tolling is stronger when the limitations period is short.in beggerly,the supreme court stated that the limitations period in the quiet title act was unusually generous.at.by contrast,the limitations period in the saa is two years.we have previously held that a limitations period of this length is not so generous as to preclude equitable extension.see hughes united states,cir holding that the limitations period in the ftca is subject to equitable tolling.
the supreme court has also considered the nature of the substantive cause of action when determining whether to apply equitable principles to suits against the government indeed the basis of irwin rebuttable presumption,was that the law should provide equal treatment to private and government defendants.at.in brockamp,the court held that the limitations period for filing tax refund claims could not be tolled because t ax law,after all,is not normally characterized by exceptions reflecting individualized equities.see brockamp,at.furthermore,a claim for a tax refund can only be brought against the government,and not against a private party.see,webb united states,cir.tort claims,by contrast,can be brought against private parties in addition an action in tort requires the court to examine individual equities and balance of facts.see page keeton et,prosser keeton on the law of torts ed.tort law is overwhelmingly common law,developed in case by case decision making by courts.because actions in admiralty are based in principles of tort,we see no reason why the limitations period in the saa should not be subject to equitable tolling in an appropriate case.
we examine next the form of the statutory language used in setting forth the statute of limitations.the irwin court made clear that equitable tolling applied not only to the permissive language in title vii,w ithin thirty days of receipt of notice of final action taken by the equal employment opportunity commission an employee may file a civil action see c,but also to the mandatory language in every claim shall be barred unless the petition is filed within six years.irwin,at.moreover,we recently decided in hughes that the language of the ftca that a tort claim against the united states shall be forever barred unless it is presented within two years after such claim accrues,is not jurisdictional.at.similarly,there is nothing in the language of the saa stating that s uits as herein authorized may be brought only within two years after the cause of action arises,that ties the limitations period to the court subject matter jurisdiction.
finally,we consider the administrative burden on the government.in brockamp,the court found that the administrative burden of allowing equitable tolling to tax refund claims could overburden the irs due to the millions of claims filed each year.brockamp,at.the government does not suggest that the number of claims filed under the saa is of the same order of magnitude.
after examining the factors considered in beggerly and brockamp we conclude that the presumption that equitable tolling applies to of the saa is not rebutted.accordingly,based on the supreme court recent decisions in irwin,brockamp,and beggerly,we hold that our prior holding in bovell is no longer good law 
it follows from the above discussion that the district court erred albeit by following our prior,now outdated precedent of bovell by evaluating the government motion to dismiss under.b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,rather than under.b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.see robinson dalton,cir holding that government motion to dismiss for failure to file title vii complaint within thirty day statutory period should be treated under rule b.
in a rule b motion,the court evaluates the merits of the claims by accepting all allegations in the complaint as true,viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,and determining whether they state a claim as a matter of law.gould united states,cir.the defendant bears the burden of showing that no claim has been presented.see kehr packages,fidelcor,cir.
in contrast,the standard to be applied to a rule b motion is much more demanding.when subject matter jurisdiction is challenged under rule b,the plaintiff must bear the burden of persuasion.kehr packages,at.furthermore,the district court may not presume the truthfulness of plaintiff allegations,but rather must evaluat e for itself the merits of the jurisdictional claims.mortensen first fed.sav.loan ass n,cir.
despite the district court erroneous application of the much more stringent rule b standard in this case,we need not reverse the district court dismissal if,apply ing the same test the district court should have utilized initially,plaintiff is not entitled as a matter of law to equitable tolling.robinson,at citing colgan fisher scientific,cir cert.denied,d.
as a preliminary matter,hedges argues for the first time on appeal that the court should apply a discovery rule to of the saa.in other words,he contends that the limitations period of the saa should not begin to run until september,the date on which he clai
