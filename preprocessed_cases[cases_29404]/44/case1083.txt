opinion of the court 
cardionet,and lifewatch services,are providers of medical devices that allow physicians to monitor cardiac arrhythmias in patients not confined to the hospital.for several years,cigna health corporation provided coverage for this service.then,in,cigna reversed course and announced that it would no longer do so.cardionet and lifewatch filed this action against cigna on their own behalf and as the assignee of patients who used their services.in response,cigna moved to compel arbitration under the parties agreement.the district court agreed with cigna that cardionet and lifewatch claims fell within the arbitration clause of the parties agreement and therefore compelled arbitration.because we conclude that none of cardionet and lifewatch claims fall within the arbitration clause,we vacate the district court judgment and remand for further proceedings.
cardionet,and lifewatch services,together,the providers supply outpatient cardiac telemetry oct services.oct,an outpatient device,is used by physicians,usually cardiologists,to monitor cardiac arrhythmias.the device differs from conventional technologies for detecting arrhythmias in that it transmits electrocardiographic ekg data in real time to certified technicians,who then forward the data to the ordering physician.oct is approved by the food and drug administration,and has been covered by medicare and commercial insurers for many years.
cigna healthcare corporation administers employer sponsored health and welfare benefit plans across the country.like other health insurance companies,cigna maintains a network of health care providers.pursuant to individual agreements between cigna and its providers,cigna pays the providers directly for the services rendered to patients.
in,cardionet and lifewatch joined cigna provider network by entering into identical administrative service agreements with cigna the agreement.the agreement sets the rate at which cigna would reimburse the providers for the particular services rendered to cigna patients.it also circumscribes the services for which reimbursement is available.specifically,the providers services are reimbursable under the agreement only if they constitute covered services.app.at.the agreement defines covered services as those health care services for which a participant is entitled to receive coverage under the terms and conditions of the participant benefit plan.id.at according to the agreement,n o service is a covered service unless it is medically necessary,that is it satisfies the medical necessity requirements under the applicable benefit plan.id.
cigna first announced a policy of covering oct in.at the time,it determined that there was sufficient evidence in the published peer reviewed medical literature supporting the use of,surveillance systems.app.at.cigna maintained and reaffirmed its policy of covering oct each year through.but then,in,it abruptly terminated its coverage of oct cigna then issued a new policy statement,entitled cardiac event monitor coverage policy the policy,announcing that it would no longer cover oct for any indication because it is considered experimental,investigational or unproven.id.at.the policy acknowledged,however,that this new position would be trumped by any conflicting language in the coverage policies themselves.
although cigna oct policy had changed,its medical knowledge had not cigna relied on the same medical literature it had previously relied upon in concluding that oct should be covered.shortly after cigna announcement,the providers asked cigna to reconsider its new position on.according to the complaint,cigna intimated to the providers that its motive for reversing course was financial,but refused to back away from the policy.
subsequently,cigna issued medical coverage policy updates for heath care professionals the physician update to hundreds of thousands of its network physicians,announcing that it would not cover oct for any indication because it is considered experimental,investigational,and unproven.app.by letter,cardionet objected to cigna characterization of oct as experimental,investigational,and unproven.cardionet letter also observed that cigna unequivocal statement that cigna would not cover oct for any indications conflicted with its acknowledgement in the policy that cigna new position could be trumped by the specific coverage policies included in employee benefit plans.id.cigna neither responded to the letter nor amended the physician update.the providers allege that the physician update not only prevented patients with cigna insurance from ordering oct,but also has caused and continues to cause physicians to refrain from ordering oct for patients whose employer plans do cover id.at.
the providers filed this action in the eastern district of pennsylvania,on their own behalves and as assignees of the rights and claims of patients.app.at.the complaint contains seven counts.the providers bring counts i iv as the assignees of the claims of five cigna plan participants the participants.the participants all sought coverage for oct after the implementation of the policy,and were all denied coverage by cigna.after cigna denied coverage,the participants received oct from the providers,and in exchange assigned to the providers all of their rights without limitation under the employee retirement income security act of erisa along with any other rights under federal or state law that they may have as related to the reimbursement of coverage for the uncovered treatment.id.at.
counts i iv,the derivative counts,challenge cigna decision to deny the participants oct coverage the providers bring these claims standing in the shoes of the participants.specifically,in count i,the providers allege that cigna arbitrarily and capriciously changed its oct coverage policy,and seek to recover benefits due under erisa a b,a b.in count ii,the providers seek an injunction,pursuant to erisa a,a,directing cigna to withdraw its current coverage policy for oct and rescind the physician update regarding.in count iii,the providers allege that,by systematically denying oct coverage,cigna breached its duty to the participants to faithfully apply the terms of the governing erisa plans they seek an injunction,pursuant to erisa a,requiring cigna to process claims for oct benefits in all instances based on the terms of the erisa plans and to cease and desist from processing such erisa claims based on any conflicting terms in the policy.app.to the extent that any of the assigned claims do not arise from or are exempt from erisa,count iv asserts that cigna breached its contractual obligation to the participants by failing to cover medically necessary services.
cardionet and lifewatch bring the remaining three counts on their own behalf.these direct counts primarily concern an alleged harm stemming from cigna distribution of the physician update.in count v,the providers allege that through the issuance of the physician update,cigna tortiously interfered with the providers current and prospective business relations with physicians who have ordered,or may in the future order,oct for their patients.in count vi,they allege that the physician update constituted a misleading and deceptive commercial or promotion,in violation of a b of the lanham act,a b.finally,count vii alleges that the physician update constituted trade libel.through counts v vii,the providers seek damages,as well as the issuance of corrective advertising to the physicians who received the physician update.
shortly after cardionet and lifewatch filed this action,cigna moved to compel arbitration,or in the alternative,to stay the action pending arbitration,under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure and the federal arbitration act faa,the district court agreed with cigna that all of the providers claims,including those brought on behalf of the participants,fell within the purview of the agreement arbitration clause.it therefore compelled arbitration.
the district court began by analyzing the relevant language in the agreement concerning arbitration.it concluded that the arbitration provision was broad,so that the presumption in favor of arbitration applied with particular force.cardionet,cigna health,d.the court then assessed the arbitrability of the derivative and direct claims in turn.as to the derivative claims,the district court acknowledged that the agreement arbitration clause could not bind the participants,as an arbitration clause applies only to the parties to the agreement in which it is contained and those with whom there is privity of contract.id.at.nonetheless,it concluded that the providers could not pursue the plan participants claims in court through an assignment from the plan participants to plaintiffs.id.the district court reasoned that 
plaintiffs have a preexisting duty under their agreements with cigna to arbitrate disputes that are substantively identical to the claims they now seek to bring as assignees.all of plaintiffs claims rest on the basic argument that oct services should be covered services and therefore should be paid for by cigna.this argument strikes at the heart of plaintiffs contracts with cigna,i,claims for payment by plaintiffs will be subject to arbitration.plaintiffs can not nullify their agreements to arbitrate these claims for payment by becoming assignees of the plan participants claims.
id.accordingly,the district court concluded that,while o f course,the plan participants are free to pursue their claims independently,or via an assignment to another third party,i f plaintiffs wish to challenge defendant classification of oct services as experimental,investigative,and unproven,they must arbitrate their claims,as they had agreed to do under the agreement.id.
the district court next evaluated the direct claims.these too,it determined,were barred by the agreement arbitration clause.the district court explained that the foundation of counts v through vii the providers allegation that the physician update deterred physicians from ordering oct clearly falls within the scope of the agreement arbitration clauses.to the extent that plaintiffs disagree on whether oct services should be classified as experimental,investigative,and unproven or as covered,this disagreement must be resolved under the terms of the arbitration provision.id.at.
the providers now appeal the compulsion of arbitration of both the direct and the derivative claims 
in the vast majority of cases,the arbitrability of a dispute is a question for judicial determination.see first options of chicago,kaplan,d courts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is clea r and unmistakabl e evidence that they did so.quoting at t,commc ns workers of,d alterations in original.because neither party questions the propriety of the district court determining whether the dispute is arbitrable,we assume,without further analysis,that the agreement leaves the question of arbitrability to judicial determination.see granite rock int l of teamsters,d.
until a court determines whether arbitration should be compelled,however,judicial review is limited to two threshold questions did the parties seeking or resisting arbitration enter into a valid arbitration agreement does the dispute between those parties fall with the language of the arbitration agreement john hancock mut.life ins.olick,cir.because neither party contests the validity of the agreement,we confine ourselves to assessing whether the disputes at issue fall within the scope of the agreement arbitration clause.
the faa,establishes a uniform federal law over contracts which fall within its scope.goodwin elkins,cir.this uniform federal law places arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other contracts,and requires courts to enforce them according to their terms.at t mobility llc concepcion,d see also rent a center,west,jackson,d the faa reflects the fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of contract.dean witter reynolds,byrd,d the preeminent concern of congress in passing the faa was to enforce private agreements into which parties had entered,and that concern requires that we rigorously enforce agreements to arbitrate.thus,where a written agreement evidences an intent on the part of the contracting parties to arbitrate the dispute in question,a court must compel the parties to arbitrate that dispute.see mitsubishi motors soler chrysler plymouth,d.
but the fact that the parties have agreed to arbitrate some disputes does not necessarily manifest an intent to arbitrate every dispute that might arise between the parties,since u nder the faa,parties are generally free to structure their arbitration agreements as they see fit.green tree fin.bazzle,d rehnquist,dissenting quoting volt info,bd.of trs.of the leland stanford junior,d.accordingly,a court may order arbitration of a particular dispute only where the court is satisfied that the parties agreed to arbitrate that dispute.granite rock.at emphasis in original.ultimately,then,whether a dispute falls within the scope of an arbitration clause depends upon the relationship between the breadth of the arbitration clause,and the nature of the given claim.
we must resolve any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues in favor of arbitration.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury const,d see also medtronic ave,advanced cardiovascular,cir noting that federal policy favors arbitration.however,the supreme court has repeatedly warned against overread ing its precedent concerning the presumption of arbitrability.granite rock.at.the presumption in favor of arbitration does not take courts outside the settled framework of using principles of contract interpretation to determine the scope of an arbitration clause.id.at.quite the contrary,the presumption derives its legitimacy from the judicial supposition that arbitration of a particular dispute is what the parties intended because their express agreement to arbitrate was validly formed and absent a provision clearly and validly committing such issues to an arbitrator is legally enforceable and best construed to encompass the dispute.id.at see also sweet dreams unlimited,dial a mattress int l,cir.indeed,while the faa embodies a strong federal policy in favor of arbitration,the duty to arbitrate remains one assumed by contract.sweet dreams unlimited,at.thus,the presumption of arbitrability applies only where an arbitration agreement is ambiguous about whether it covers the dispute at hand.see granite rock.at.otherwise,the plain language of the contract controls.
in assessing whether a particular dispute falls within the scope of an arbitration clause,we focus on the factual underpinnings of the claim rather than the legal theory alleged in the complaint.medtronic ave,at quotation marks omitted.in so doing,we prevent a creative and artful pleader from drafting around an arbitration clause.chelsea family pharmacy,pllc medco health solutions,cir.
we begin by carefully analyz ing the contractual language in the arbitration clause at issue.trap rock,local,int l union of operating eng rs,cir.the agreement contains the following two paragraphs concerning alternative dispute resolution,and no other 
internal dispute resolution.disputes that might arise between the parties regarding the performance or interpretation of the agreement must first be resolved through the applicable internal dispute resolution process outlined in the administrative guidelines.in the event the dispute is not resolved through that process,either party can request in writing that the parties attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute promptly by negotiation if the matter is not resolved within days of such a request,either party may initiate arbitration by providing written notice to the other.with respect to a payment or termination dispute,provider must submit a request for arbitration within months if arbitration is not requested within that month period,cigna final decision under its internal dispute resolution process will be binding on provider,and provider shall not bill cigna,payor or the participant for any payment denied because of the failure to timely submit a request for arbitration.
arbitration.if the dispute is not resolved through cigna internal dispute resolution process,either party can initiate arbitration by providing written notice to the other.if one of the parties initiates arbitration,the proceeding will be held in the jurisdiction of provider domicile.the parties will jointly appoint a mutually acceptable arbitrator arbitration is the exclusive remedy for the resolutions of disputes under this agreement.the decision of the arbitrator will be final,conclusive and binding 
app.emphasis added.
the language makes clear that only those disputes regarding the performance or interpretation of the agreement must be arbitrated.true,the phrase regarding the performance or interpretation of the agreement appears in the internal dispute resolution paragraph section,rather than the mandatory arbitration paragraph section.but it is clear from the language of the two sections that the parties intended them to be read together,as two stages of mandatory dispute resolution.section explains that where a dispute subject to that provision can not be resolved using the internal dispute resolution process,either party may initiate arbitration.section then outlines what form such an arbitration will take.the first sentence of section requires arbitration not of all or any disputes between the parties,but of only the dispute that the parties failed to resolve through the internal process outlined in section.hence,section mandates the arbitration of only those disputes subject to the internal dispute resolution process outlined in section.and section only applies to those d isputes that might arise between the parties concerning the performance and interpretation of the agreement.accordingly,section must be limited to disputes concerning the agreement performance or interpretation.
the district court similarly reached the conclusion that sections and call for the arbitration of disputes related to the interpretation or performance of the agreement.cardionet,d at.the district court intimated,however,that the statement in the middle of section that a rbitration is the exclusive remedy for the resolutions of disputes under this agreement broadens the scope of mandatory arbitration.id.we believe that the term disputes as used here refers solely to those disputes concerning the performance or interpretation of the agreement.as we have explained previously,courts are required to read contract language in a way that allows all the language to be read together,reconciling conflicts in the language without rendering any of it nugatory if possible.ctf hotel holding,marriott int l,cir.were we to hold that disputes as used here signifies a broader swath of disagreements,it would render the first sentence of section devoid of meaning.moreover,as the providers note,the words dispute and disputes are used three other times in these two sections,each time clearly referring to the narrower set of disputes concerning the agreement performance and interpretation.accordingly,we believe that the word disputes,as employed here,must be circumscribed.see restatement second of contracts cmt.d meaning is inevitably dependent on context.a word changes meaning when it becomes part of a sentence,the sentence when it becomes part of a paragraph.
we therefore conclude that the arbitration clause in this case is limited in scope to disputes regarding the performance or interpretation of the agreement.
we next consider whether the claims at issue relate to the performance or interpretation of the agreement.
first,we examine whether the providers direct claims fall under the scope of the arbitration clause.cigna contends that the direct claims relate to the performance and interpretation of the agreement,because they unavoidably implicate cigna contractual obligation to treat as covered services any services that participants are entitled to receive under their benefits plans.appellee br.at.we disagree.
again,in determining whether these claims at issue relate to the performance and interpretation of the agreement,we focus on the factual underpinnings of the claim rather than the legal theories asserted in the complaint.although styled as distinct statutory and common law causes of action,the providers trade libel,lanham act,and tortious interference claims rest upon identical factual assertions cigna made false and misleading statements in the physician update about the nature and quality of oct cigna conveyed the false impression that oct would never be covered under any health plans cigna administers and the physician update injured them by decreasing the number of physicians willing to use oct services 
thus,the adjudication of cigna direct claims depends on whether the physician update a document completely distinct from the agreement is deceptive and misleading,and whether any deceptions therein caused a cognizable injury to the providers.the resolution of these claims does not require construction of,or even reference to,any provision in the agreement.rcm,brignik,d,fraudulent inducement claims were subject to arbitration where the claims in this case almost undoubtedly will require interpretation of the parties agreement.quite the contrary,whether cigna performed its obligations under the agreement has no bearing on whether it harmed the providers by providing physicians with misleading information on.
indeed,it is not even clear to us that the agreement is a factual predicate to these claims.theoretically,any oct manufacturer,whether it had entered into an agreement with cigna or not,would be harmed by the misleading statements ostensibly made by cigna about the oct technology and would have a basis for bringing claims identical to the providers claims here.in any event,factual connections between the agreement and the factual underpinnings of the complaint do not render these claims arbitrable 
cigna brings to our attention an array of circuit and district court cases where lanham act,tort,and trade disparagement claims were held to be arbitrable,noting that lanham act and tort claims such as those pled in counts v vii are frequently referred to arbitration when they arise out of a contractual relationship.appellee br.at.to be sure,cigna is correct that lanham act and tort claims often fall within the scope of different arbitration clauses.but that bears little relevance to whether these lanham act and tort claims fall within the scope of this arbitration clause.again,the arbitrability of a given dispute depends not on the particular cause of action pleaded,but on the relationship of the arbitration clause at issue to the facts underpinning a plaintiff claims.hence,the cases cited by cigna would be relevant only if they contained arbitration clauses of a similar scope to the one here,and concerned claims whose underlying facts bore a similar relationship to the parties contracts.
as the providers note,cigna cases are similar in neither respect.first,those cases concern arbitration clauses undisputedly broader than the clause at issue here.see,sweet dreams unlimited,at assessing the scope of an arbitration clause that sweeps beyond the interpretation or performance of the contract per se and concluding that several of plaintiff counts fall within the clause scope despite the fact that they do not raise issues of contract interpretation or performance.second,the vast majority of cigna cases involve disputes that,unlike the direct claims here,clearly do relate to the performance and interpretation of the parties contracts.see,simula,autoliv,cir compelling arbitration of a lanham act claim where resolving simula factual allegations against autoliv requires interpreting autoliv performance and conduct under the parties agreement see also norcom elecs.cm usa,d.thus,the cases cited by cigna are inapplicable.
in sum,the facts underpinning these direct claims do not concern the performance or interpretation of the parties agreement.accordingly,the direct claims fall outside the scope of the agreement arbitration clause.the providers may pursue these claims in court.
we next address the providers derivative claims.again,these claims challenge cigna decision to deny oct to the participants and more broadly the implementation of the policy,which barred future coverage of.through the derivat
