opinion of the court 
this appeal arises out of efforts by appellee william morris morris,a former employee of the federal defense logistics agency dla,to recover damages for alleged disability discrimination in the workplace.morris obtained a favorable award from the eeoc,after extensive administrative proceedings,but now seeks to recover increased compensatory damages in this federal action under c.we must decide whether,in that context,the district court may properly accept the eeoc finding of liability as binding,while providing a de novo trial as to the amount of figure having been determined not by the eeoc,but by the dla.for the reasons stated herein,we find such a partial de novo trial inappropriate.
at the time this dispute arose,morris worked for the dla,an agency of the united states department of defense,as a warehouse operator morris is disabled due to arthritis,degenerative disc disease,and hypertension.in january and february of,morris gave the dla letters from his doctor stating that morris needed reasonable accommodation of his disability,and should be permanently reassigned to an office job.on february,a dla doctor confirmed this need for reassignment.
despite the doctors recommendations,morris was not reassigned,but remained at work in his warehouse position.on april,he injured his back in the course of his duties there.morris was unable to work or care for himself for roughly two months after the injury,and he continues to suffer from its effects.
morris filed a complaint with the eeoc on august.on november,after a hearing,an administrative law judge alj at the eeoc issued a recommended decision.the alj found that morris was a qualified individual with a disability and that the dla had intentionally discriminated against him between february,and april,by failing,in spite of his repeated requests,to make any attempt to accommodate his medical restrictions.the alj found that the dla had not discriminated against morris after april.she recommended,among other remedies,that the dla provide compensatory damages to morris for his injury.
on february,the dla issued a decision that rejected the alj recommended finding of discrimination before april,but accepted her finding of no discrimination after that date.morris appealed this finding of no discrimination to the eeoc.
in october,the eeoc issued a decision restoring the alj recommended finding that the dla had discriminated against morris between february and april.the eeoc awarded some relief directly,but remanded the matter to the dla for a determination of the appropriate compensatory damages amount.the dla sought reconsideration of the eeoc liability decision,which the eeoc denied in september.
in june,the dla issued a decision awarding morris compensatory damages of for his april injury.this decision could have been appealed either to the eeoc or to a federal district court.
morris did not appeal the dla compensatory damages decision to the eeoc.instead,he filed this action in the middle district of pennsylvania,seeking a jury trial to determine the amount of compensatory damages that he should receive.the dla has paid the that it determined was due to morris,and complied with the other forms of relief awarded by the eeoc,but morris seeks a higher damages award.
in the district court,morris moved for partial summary judgment as to liability,contending that the dla was bound by the eeoc finding of intentional discrimination.the district court granted morris motion on september,finding that because two separate administrative orders had been issued regarding morris eeoc determination of liability,and the dla determination of could appeal the second,without permitting the court to the first.
on december,the district court granted the dla motion to certify the summary judgment decision for interlocutory appeal.in march this court granted permission for the interlocutory appeal.we have jurisdiction under b.
this appeal presents a question of first impression in this court whether,when pursuing an employment discrimination claim in federal court,a federal employee may elect to enforce only the liability determination of an eeoc ruling,while seeking a de novo jury trial on the question of damages.in reviewing an interlocutory appeal under b,this court exercises plenary review over the question certified.pub.interest research group of,hercules,cir.
a.the district court decision 
as a federal employee,morris brought his disability discrimination claim under the rehabilitation act,which provides federal employees protection from discrimination similar to that available to private sector employees under the americans with disabilities act.see g rehabilitation act standard ada standard.
although the rehabilitation act provides essentially the same relief as the ada,the administrative process is more complex under the rehabilitation act.see et.a federal employee must first bring a claim of discrimination on grounds of disability to an internal complaints process within the employing agency.if dissatisfied with the agency resolution,the employee may then bring the claim to the eeoc,which will investigate the claim,conduct a hearing if the employee so requests and issue a recommended decision.the agency then reviews the eeoc recommendation,and issues another decision.the employee may again appeal to the eeoc,as morris did here.the eeoc second decision may complete the administrative adjudicatory process,or may,as happened here,lead to remand of some aspect of the matter to the agency,so that the agency decision on remand at last concludes the administrative adjudicatory process.id.
on conclusion of the administrative proceeding,a district court may provide two distinct forms of relief.first,a federal employee who prevails in the administrative process may sue in federal court to enforce an administrative decision with which an agency has failed to comply.such an enforcement action does not trigger de novo review of the merits of the employee claims.see,moore devine,cir haskins dep t of the army,cir.alternatively,a federal employee unhappy with the administrative decision may bring his or her claims to a district court,under section a of the rehabilitation act,a,and receive the same de novo consideration that a private sector employee enjoys in a title vii action,under c chandler roudebush,d finding that c provides a trial de novo.
as the district court recognized,this case does not involve an enforcement action rather,the basis for morris claims is c provision for de novo consideration of discrimination claims in the federal courts as it applies to disability discrimination claims under section a of the rehabilitation act.citing black law dictionary,the district court observed that as a general matter de novo consideration means a new trial on the entire is,on both questions of fact and issues of as if there had been no trial in the first instance,noting that s everal federal courts have determined that a plaintiff who seeks de novo review of a damage award must also the merits of the underlying discrimination claim.however,the district court decided to limit its de novo review to the issue of compensatory damages,because the eeoc finding of liability and the dla compensatory damages award had been issued in separate administrative decisions.the district court based its approach on the route followed by the district court in malcolm reno,d.in that case,plaintiff malcolm had claimed disability discrimination after the fbi retracted a job offer on discovering that he had chronic lymphocytic leukemia.id.at.as in this case,the administrative decision of malcolm claim was made in two parts an administrative determination of liability and some remedies,which malcolm did not appeal,followed by a decision on compensatory damages,which he sought to challenge in the district court without upsetting the earlier liability ruling.malcolm also sought to enforce the earlier administrative ruling requirement that he be allowed to participate in the next scheduled session of special agent training the fbi had refused to comply with this requirement.
the malcolm court granted malcolm motion for a dec
