background 
freeman,a former law enforcement officer,began serving a life sentence for murder in and was eventually placed in the price daniel unit in snyder,texas,where he joined the local street church of christ tdcj assigned chaplain wayne horton,a church of christ member,to the price daniel unit.however,according to freeman,chaplain horton teachings were too ecumenical and departed from established church of christ doctrine.
on february,freeman filed an administrative grievance criticizing chaplain horton performance of the church of christ services and tdcj decision to reduce the church of christ service by one.in his grievance,freeman requested,inter alia,that the elders from the street church of christ oversee the inmates religious services,that church of christ members be permitted to conduct their services free from chaplain horton interference,and that tdcj restore their worship time to two hours.tdcj rejected the grievance and freeman administrative appeal.
freeman later circulated a statement to fellow inmates and church of christ leaders in which he denounced chaplain horton as having departed from the faith and requested that chaplain horton be removed from his leadership position over church of christ members in the prison.in his statement,freeman announced that he,and other inmates,were withdrawing spiritual fellowship from chaplain horton 
freeman asked for,and received,permission to read the statement during a church of christ service in the prison sometime after freeman began reading the statement,chaplain horton ordered him to stop.freeman complied and was escorted out of the chapel,followed by approximately inmates.the incident was written up as a major disciplinary infraction for causing a disturbance,but was later reduced to a minor disciplinary case.shortly afterward,freeman was transferred to the allred unit.
freeman and carlos patterson filed this class action suit on behalf of themselves and others against tdcj a class was certified,comprising tdcj inmates who subscribe to the church of christ faith.in the complaint,the class alleges that tdcj failure to provide them an adequate opportunity to practice the church of christ faith violates the free exercise and equal protection clauses of the constitution.the class seeks,inter alia,a permanent injunction requiring tdcj to provide additional religious accommodations additionally,freeman filed a personal claim alleging that he was transferred in retaliation for exercising his first amendment right to criticize chaplain horton publicly.
tdcj provides weekly religious services for what it considers to be the five major faith in its prisons roman catholic catholic jewish muslim and native american under the tdcj policy,the church of christ falls within the catholic.tdcj offered evidence that it attempts to place each individual worshiper with the designated he would choose on his own,while recognizing that not all elements of the individual faiths will be accommodated.
tdcj also offers a variety of supplemental devotional opportunities for church of christ members.in tdcj units,worship services are conducted by church of christ volunteers,who are often able to tailor the services to include communion and a cappella singing.immersion baptism may be arranged for and performed by a church of christ minister at the inmate request.finally,tdcj permits inmates to meet with an approved spiritual advisor twice a month.
the district court denied the class request for a permanent injunction,finding that tdcj policy does not violate the supreme court interpretation of inmate free exercise rights the district court also held that the prison officials were entitled to qualified immunity on freeman retaliation claim the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment,and this appeal followed.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court summary judgment decision de novo.chriceol phillips,cir.summary judgment is warranted if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with any affidavits filed in support of the motion,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.the moving party bears the burden of showing that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party case.celotex catrett,d.if the moving party meets this initial burden,the nonmoving party is required to set forth specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.e.however,the nonmovant can not satisfy this burden with conclusory allegations,unsubstantiated assertions,or only a scintilla of evidence.little liquid air,cir en banc.
iii.discussion 
this appeal raises three challenges to the district court summary judgment ruling the dismissal of the class free exercise claim the dismissal of the class equal protection claim and the dismissal of freeman retaliation claim.we address each in turn.
free exercise claim 
the class alleges that tdcj religious accommodation policy unconstitutionally impinges on the free exercise of their chosen faith.tdcj counters that its policy is the product of legitimate penological concerns staff supervision requirements unit and individual security concerns the availability of religious volunteers to provide assistance limited meeting time and space and the percentage of the offender population that the requesting faith group represents.thus,tdcj argues that its decision to designate five major religious,while providing supplemental church of christ services when feasible,should be sustained.
prison regulations that impinge on fundamental constitutional rights are reviewed under the deferential standard set forth in turner safley,d.under turner,a prison regulation that impinges on inmates constitutional rights is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.id.at.turner employs a test to resolve this inquiry whether there is a rational relationship between the regulation and the legitimate government interest advanced whether the inmates have available alternative means of exercising the right the impact of the accommodation on prison staff,other inmates,and the allocation of prison resources generally and whether there are ready alternatives to the regulation.id.at.see also estate of shabazz,d.a court must determine whether the government objective underlying the regulation at issue is legitimate and neutral,and that the regulations are rationally related to that objective.thornburgh abbott,d see also scott.of,cir a court need not weigh evenly,or even consider,each of these factors,as rationality is the controlling standard.
the undisputed summary judgment evidence shows that tdcj policy satisfies turner and passes constitutional muster.foremost,tdcj regulation is operate s without regard to the content of the expression.turner,at.at green polunsky,cir beard prohibition neutral because it affected all inmates,regardless of their religious beliefs.there is no evidence that tdcj policy is targeted toward the church of christ or favors one religious group over another.
tdcj policy is rationally related to legitimate government objectives.the policy may be struck down,on this basis,only if its relationship to the government objective is so remote as to render the policy arbitrary or irrational.turner,at.at.
first,we agree with tdcj that staff and space limitations,as well as financial burdens,are valid penological interests.see ganther ingle,cir.pri
