this appeal arises out of a case involving an allision between a united states army corps of engineers usace vessel and a private yacht,the marquessa,owned by wheat maritime wheat maritime and operated by its parent company wheat international communications wheat international.wheat maritime and wheat international collectively,appellants brought suit against the united states.the case proceeded to a bench trial in the district court,resulting in a damages judgment for appellants.appellants appeal from the district court award of damages in their favor,arguing that it is infirm in various respects.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
the marquessa was originally built in as a foot bertram motor yacht,but like many vessels of her kind,was subsequently extended.after the extension,the marquessa measured from bow to transom,with an additional swim platform extending beyond the transom.wheat maritime purchased the marquessa in for and made numerous modifications wheat maritime ultimately chartered the vessel to wheat international.forrest wheat owns both wheat maritime and wheat international.
on february,a usace vessel allided with the marquessa,which was docked at a pier at ocean marine marina in portsmouth,virginia.the allision occurred because the usace vessel captain fell asleep at the helm.the marquessa was damaged significantly.appellants brought the underlying action against the united states under the public vessels act,et,and the suits in admiralty act,et,in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia.
the united states admitted liability for the allision.the matter proceeded to a bench trial on the issue of damages.appellants and the united states presented evidence regarding the reasonable costs of repairing the marquessa as well as her fair market value at the time of the accident.the parties did so because,as we discuss in greater detail in the next subsection,damages determinations in admiralty are governed by the doctrine of constructive total loss.under that doctrine,where the costs of repairing a vessel exceed her fair market value,damages are limited to fair market value.
we now turn to a consideration of each component of constructive total loss.with respect to repair costs,appellants argued that they were entitled to.this figure derives from two sources.first,appellants relied upon an estimate from the shipyard,ocean marine,for in actual repair costs.second,appellants contended the additional was necessary to account for other related expenses the cost of replacing certain items that were on board the marquessa,such as certain satellite antennas and laptop computers owned by wheat international the cost for the captain to be aboard during all shipyard work travel expenses to inspect the repairs and storage costs.appellants evidence with respect to these related expenses was limited.for example,they presented no evidence that the antennas were visually inspected for damage,or tested.similarly,appellants presented an estimate of the amount required to replace the laptops,but presented no evidence that they first sought to determine whether the laptops were repairable.
three experts testified regarding the marquessa fair market value,relative to her cost of repair.two of the witnesses,jack hornor,the united states expert,and val lippa,who testified for appellants,were marine surveyors.gregory pierce,who testified for appellants,was a yacht broker.
hornor,who has been surveying vessels since and is certified as a marine surveyor by the national association of marine surveyors testified that the marquessa market value was.hornor based his assessment on his inspection of the vessel,a review of a database of sales of comparable vessels,and an evaluation of the features that added to or detracted from the vessel value.according to hornor,the database in question,is the source used most often in the industry and is generally relied upon in the field.from this website,hornor identified seven sales of similar vessels,all of which,like the marquessa,started life as bertrams,were extended just as the marquessa,and sold at various times for between and.
hornor opined that although some of the modifications enhanced the vessel value,many did not.he testified that the replumbing and sanitation work did not increase the vessel comparable value because it was mandated by law and expected on a boat such as the marquessa.he explained that the heating furnace did not increase the value of the boat because boats of her size and class are expected to have heat and air conditioning.wheat electrical alterations,he noted,were of similarly limited importance.the number of rooms on the marquessa did not increase the value of the vessel compared to the comparables,he stated,as the interior volume in the extended bertram yachts was generally the same,and dividing up the space into five rooms instead of the typical three results in very small rooms.hornor testified that the marquessa larger flybridge contributed little because,should the flybridge actually be used to hold additional people,the extra weight at that height could significantly decrease the vessel stability.finally,he noted that the swim platform,which is irrelevant for purposes of determining a vessel length as defined by coast guard standards,also did not make the marquessa so unique that she could not be compared to the other extended bertrams.
moreover,hornor opined,any increase in the marquessa value resulting from the improvements was offset by the condition of the vessel exterior and her age.hornor placed particular emphasis on the paint,noting that the condition of the finish of a vessel can be a substantial factor in establishing the vessel value.hornor stated that the paint used on yachts of this type has a maximum lifespan of ten years,in the best of conditions.hornor stated that the painting was not completed to standards,leaving the marquessa finish with the texture of an orange peel in places.he further testified that the hull also showed patches of paint from spot repairs and refinishing,as well as a halo effect that can result from spot refinishing.the government introduced into evidence photographs reflecting the patchwork effect and halos.with respect to the cost of repairing the marquessa,hornor testified that reasonable cost would be in the range of to.
lippa,also an accredited marine surveyor was called by appellants to testify as to the costs of repair.similar to hornor,lippa opined that the marquessa market value was lippa based this figure on examining the vessel and using the same subscription website as hornor did.lippa further opined that the marquessa was a constructive total loss,in that the costs of repairing the vessel exceeded her market value.
pierce,on the other hand,departed significantly from the opinions of hornor and lippa in setting the market value of the marquessa at the time of the allision at.pierce,a yacht broker,stated that he represented wheat during his purchase of the marquessa,and advised about her over the years.he estimated having visited her fifty times or more.according to pierce,these visits were primarily social occasions,and he acknowledged receiving much of his information about the vessel from wheat.pierce testified that he arrived at his valuation based on a review of market listings of asking prices in early,as well as a later review of asking prices for foot hatterases in january.he specifically identified only one sold vessel as a comparable an foot hatteras that sold for,almost double the price of boats of similar size and vintage,because of her customer improvements.as a yacht broker and not a marine surveyor,pierce described his valuation process as,not very scientific and certainly not a lot of weight in a courtroom,but it what i did.
at the conclusion of trial,the district court issued a comprehensive opinion containing its factual findings and legal conclusions.to a considerable extent,the district court findings of fact were grounded in credibility determinations.
first,the district court found that hornor and lippa were more credible than pierce.consequently,it agreed with the assessment of both surveyors that the marquessa was a constructive total loss because the cost of repairs exceeded her market value second,crediting hornor and to some extent lippa testimony,the district court found the market value of the marquessa at the time of the allision to be.
the district court further concluded that hornor methodology for computing the marquessa market value was the most sound and comprehensive.in reaching this conclusion,the district court found no reason to question the accuracy of the database.the district court held that both hornor and lippa had inspected the vessel extensively and could assess her value and condition.and the district court agreed,based on hornor testimony and the photographs in evidence,that the vessel was in worse condition than appellants claimed.
the district court noted that lippa was appellants expert surveyor,and that lippa and hornor found the value of the marquessa to be and respectively in stark contrast to pierce figure of.the district court doubted pierce estimate because of his personal relationship with wheat indeed,the court noted,pierce had only made social visits to the vessel.unlike hornor and lippa,pierce is not a surveyor but a yacht broker.pierce did not conduct an inspection of the boat or have the boat surveyed,and much of his information about the vessel condition was admittedly provided by wheat.significantly,in contrast to the other experts,pierce estimates were largely drawn from a listing service that provided asking price rather than sale price.in addition,pierce only provided the sale price for one boat he considers a comparable,which notably is almost longer than the marquessa and a different make and model.by contrast,both hornor and lippa looked to sale prices of comparable vessels when conducting their market analyses.
based on these factual findings,the district court entered judgment for appellants,finding that they were entitled to,the value of the vessel at the time of the allision.the united states moved to amend the judgment because the parties had previously stipulated that wheat maritime subrogated to its insurer its rights to recover paid toward physical damage to the marquessa.should such damages be awarded,neither wheat maritime nor wheat international could claim the right to recover the first awarded the district court granted the motion,holding that in view of the parties stipulation of subrogation,appellants were not entitled to receive from the united states.appellants now appeal from the district court amended judgment.
appellants present the following issues on appeal whether the district court erred in applying the constructive loss doctrine to this case whether the district court erred in finding that the marquessa had a market value of specifically whether the district court erred in crediting hornor and lippa testimony regarding market value and erred in failing to consider other evidence of market value whether appellant wheat international was entitled to a separate judgment for damage alleged to certain equipment on board the marquessa and whether the district court correctly amended its initial judgment to account for appellants stipulation that they were not entitled to the first in damages for the physical damage done to the marquessa.we consider each contention in turn.
we first consider whether the district court erred in applying the doctrine of constructive total loss.appellants argue that the doctrine is inapplicable where it can be shown that no vessel could provide an adequate replacement.we review this legal question de novo.see garris norfolk shipbuilding drydock,cir.
it is fundamental in the law of damages that the injured party is entitled to compensation for the loss sustained.std.oil southern pac.we have held that restitutio in integrum that is,restoration of the injured party to the position it occupied before the wrong is the precept in fixing damages.hewlett barge bertie,cir.accordingly,where repairs are practicable,the general rule followed by the admiralty courts is that the damages assessed against the respondent shall be sufficient to restore the injured vessel to the condition in which she was at the time the collision occurred.id.quoting the baltimore,wall.in the event of a total loss,the injured party is restored to the position it occupied before the wrong if it receives the vessel fair market value.std.oil,at.hewlett,at.similarly,if the cost of repairing the vessel exceeds her fair market value,the limit of compensation is the vessel fair market value at the time of the casualty.hewlett,at citing v.the helen moran,cir see also fire ins.allied towing,cir reversing the district court damages calculation without disturbing its finding that the vessel was a constructive total loss because the cost of repair exceeded the value of the vessel at the time of the collision.
this rule flows from the principle that by receiving the vessel monetary equivalent in damages,the owner is put in as good of a position pecuniarily as he would have been in if his property had not been destroyed.see std.oil,at.moreover,the rule limiting damages to market value in the event of constructive total loss is premised on the sound assumption that a shipowner of ordinary prudence would not go to the expense of repairing a vessel if the cost of repair would be greater than the fair market value of the vessel after repair.a plaintiff is therefore entitled to be made whole,but only in the least expensive way market value or replacement cost,whichever is less maryland cas.armco,cir noting that the purpose of damages is to replace the loss in value with a sum of money and that it might very well cost far more to restore damaged property than it would to pay damages for its loss citing peevyhouse garland coal mining,fisher qualico contracting,affirming new york rule that as between market value and replacement cost,the plaintiff is entitled to the lesser of the two douglas laycock,modern american remedies ed noting that new york lesser of two rule is in most jurisdictions,although not entirely uncontroversial.
appellants argument regarding the uniqueness of the marquessa is not without some merit.we recognize that courts have awarded a vessel replacement cost,even when it is greater than her purported market value,where the person who suffered the loss proved a unique use for the vessel that would not be recognized in her market price.see king fisher marine,np sunbonnet,cir upholding a replacement cost award where plaintiff had purchased a barge because of her unique capabilities and repurposed her as a drydock platform and the market did not value the barge use as a drydock platform thomas schoenbaum,admiralty maritime law,at ed observing that replacement cost may be determined to be a more accurate measure where the person who suffered the loss proved a unique use of the vessel.in those rare cases,the vessel effectively has no market value because of her unique use,and it may be appropriate to award her replacement cost in damages.allied towing,at concluding that a court may permissibly value a vessel for which a market value is not ascertainable by relying upon any number of methodologies,including the vessel replacement cost depreciated.
because we agree with the government that appellants simply used the marquessa as a yacht and did not prove that their use of the vessel was so idiosyncratic as to lack any market comparables,we hold that the marquessa possessed no special qualities that filled legitimate commercial needs that would not be recognized in her market price.
we therefore affirm on these facts the longstanding rule that if the cost of repairing a vessel exceeds her fair market value,the limit of compensation is the vessel fair market value at the time of collision.
we next consider whether the district court erred in finding that at the time of the allision,the marquessa had a market value of.appellants raise two challenges in this regard.first,appellants contend that the district court erred in crediting the testimony of hornor and lippa regarding market value over that of pierce with respect to lippa,they also assert that the district
