this case involves a steel fabricating company,famm steel,famm,that fell on hard times while trying to expand its business.the company defaulted on its loans,and it was shut down and had its assets liquidated in.thereafter,it brought suit against sovereign bank sovereign,which provided the loans,claiming that the bank had caused its demise by forcing it to hire an incompetent financial manager who mismanaged the company accounts and then engaging in a course of action that exacerbated the problem.the company alleged the bank was liable under a slew of theories,including an instrumentality theory,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealings,breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,duress,and interference with advantageous business relations.
the district court granted the defendant bank summary judgment in a careful and opinion.gavin sovereign bank,wl.june.we affirm.this is our first occasion to deal with the instrumentality theory of lender liability.
we describe the facts as outlined by plaintiffs.famm was a steel fabricating company that operated out of rindge,new hampshire.it built projects such as ballparks,hotels,apartments,and office buildings throughout the northeast.famm sales revenue was million at the end of and grew to million by the end of.famm was run by ann gavin,who served as the company president and secretary,and her father paul gavin,who served as its vice president and treasurer.austin realty,austin was the record title owner of famm fabrication facility in rindge.
in,as its business expanded,famm developed a plan to expand its facility and revamp its operations by purchasing equipment.that year,it entered into a banking relationship with fleet national bank,the to defendant sovereign for simplicity we will refer to the bank as sovereign throughout.between and the end of,sovereign extended approximately million in credit to the plaintiffs,which famm used to expand its facility and upgrade its equipment.during that time,edward powers,sovereign vice president,was famm main point of contact with the bank powers was the loan officer in charge of famm account until march.
in the fourth quarter of,famm suffered an operating loss due to an unexpectedly harsh winter and other external adverse economic factors,along with the continued costs of renovating its facility.famm informed powers of its financial difficulties.
around the same time,famm comptroller,charles stearns,informed the company he would be leaving at the end of the year,and famm began searching for a replacement.as the process dragged on,famm sought to hire an accountant from the firm of paul seelye,who was famm cpa,to oversee its finances on an interim basis.in january,ann gavin discussed this plan with powers.powers stated that he was uncomfortable with this choice because he did not want someone from the company that did famm auditing review also to be involved in famm daily operations.he wanted gavin to hire someone he had confidence in to oversee famm accounting until the company could get a handle on its accounting department.powers informed gavin that person would be david lee,an outside consultant with whom powers and the bank had had some limited experience in the past.gavin objected because lee was at the time providing consulting services to a company owned by a former business partner of the gavins with whom the gavins were not on good terms,and because lee did not have experience in the steel industry.powers insisted,however,saying it was the bank prerogative to have a consultant hired who made the bank feel secure in its financing.famm acquiesced and hired lee.
famm continued to search for a permanent replacement for stearns,the comptroller.it received the resume of keith woolford,along with those of several other prospective candidates,from seelye seelye interviewed woolford before passing on his resume to ann gavin.gavin then interviewed woolford and four other candidates.she narrowed the field to woolford and one other candidate.the two were then interviewed by ann gavin,paul gavin,five famm managers,and lee.at some point during the process,ann gavin sent powers an email with woolford resume attached indicating that famm was very interested in woolford and was probably going to make an offer to him.ann gavin claims that powers wanted lee to be involved in the interviewing process so,in essence,famm needed lee approval to make the decision,although powers claims the bank was not involved at all in the process.regardless,the gavins and the group of famm managers who conducted the interviews concluded that they could work with either candidate,and lee preferred woolford,so woolford was chosen.woolford was hired as famm permanent comptroller,and began working in march.after woolford was hired,the bank instructed famm to retain lee to supervise and train woolford and to provide general oversight to famm accounting department.
in the meantime,famm financial condition continued to deteriorate.as a result of its losses in,famm became in default of certain covenants contained in the sovereign loan documents no later than february,when ann gavin and lee met with powers to discuss the company ongoing financial problems the losses continued in the first quarter of.famm remained in covenant default in and sovereign agreed to waive the covenant default in it did not waive the covenant defaults for and,although plaintiffs claim the bank indicated such waivers would be forthcoming.
lee and woolford management did not help matters.during,lee and woolford failed to reconcile famm general ledger accounts and grossly overstated job revenues for work in progress.they had also neglected to reconcile famm monthly bank statements and failed to pay monthly sales taxes.lee and woolford presented famm with inaccurate financial data that showed the company was turning a profit when in fact it was still losing money.according to lee and woolford numbers,the company expected a profit that year in reality,it lost million.famm relied on these numbers in making business decisions over the course of the year.plaintiffs claim that if the company had known its true financial conditions,it would have booked additional projects that were available to it,reduced overhead,withheld bonuses from employees,and avoided perks such as buying company cars and giving employees extra vacation days.
according to plaintiffs,famm did not become aware of these irregularities until october,when lee revealed to ann gavin that he had not reviewed or reconciled certain accounts since he started shortly thereafter,on november,lee resigned.on january,famm fired woolford.
in january,after learning the full extent of these irregularities,ann gavin met with powers to discuss the situation.powers instructed gavin to hire a turnaround consultant,joe picano powers stated that if famm did so,the company account would remain with him and would not be moved to another department.nonetheless,in march,famm account with sovereign was transferred to john bowen in the managed assets division.
in the months that followed the revelation of lee and woolford alleged misconduct,sovereign engaged in a series of actions that plaintiffs claim seriously exacerbated the situation according to plaintiffs,sovereign goal was to close famm,minimize sovereign exposure and maximize the value of its credit.this theory about sovereign purported motive is not further explained.
in february,sovereign terminated automatic sweeps between famm checking account and its line of credit,without notifying famm this caused the account to be overdrawn.after the automatic sweeps were stopped,famm had to manually manage its account however,it was unable for some reason to view its account online,and thus could not determine which of its checks had cleared on a daily basis.plaintiffs claim that sovereign also mishandled famm general disbursement account,causing at least one check to bounce,and that it failed to reproduce in a timely manner certain bank statements and checks from that famm had requested.sovereign did not respond to inquiries from famm suppliers,subcontractors,and other third parties.it also failed to enter into a forbearance agreement with famm and did not respond to various workout or refinancing proposals.
plaintiffs claim sovereign committed to issuing a forbearance agreement and to extending famm line of credit if famm paid down the line.nonetheless,no forbearance agreement was issued,and sovereign terminated famm line of credit on may.in march,sovereign sold famm loans to a third party for million after the sale,famm facility was shut down and its assets were liquidated.sovereign lost over million.
famm,austin,ann gavin,and paul gavin brought suit against sovereign on december.the complaint raised twelve claims against the bank breach of contract count i breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing counts ii,iii,and iv breach of fiduciary duty counts v and vi aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty count vii liability under an instrumentality theory count viii fraud count ix duress count x interference with advantageous business relations count xi and violation of chapter of the massachusetts general laws count xii.on november,after discovery was completed,the gavins agreed to voluntarily dismiss their claims against sovereign,but famm and austin claims remained.sovereign filed a motion for summary judgment against the remaining plaintiffs on november.
the district court granted summary judgment to sovereign on all claims on june.it found that the level of control necessary for liability under an instrumentality theory did not arise in this case.gavin,wl,at.it rejected the covenant of good faith and fair dealings claims,which plaintiffs based on nine separate events.the court found that seven of these alleged events,even if true,did not involve dishonesty or an attempt by the bank to injure famm purposefully.see id.at.as for the other two allegations that sovereign promised and failed to issue a forbearance agreement and that it similarly promised and failed to extend famm line of credit if famm paid down the court found plaintiffs had not provided sufficient support,so there was no genuine issue of material fact.see id.at.the court held that no fiduciary relationship arose in this case and added that a finding to the contrary would transform all lenders who exercise oversight of their financially distressed borrowers into fiduciaries.id.at.the court rejected the interference with advantageous business relations claim on the grounds that,even if sovereign knew its actions would prevent famm from pursuing certain business opportunities,there is nothing to suggest its actions were improper in motive or means.see id.at.it found there was no evidence that sovereign knowingly made misrepresentations or that it was the constructive author of any false statements allegedly made by lee it also found the circumstances in this case did not rise to the level of economic duress.see id.at.finally,the court found that because plaintiffs common law claims failed,their claim under.laws ch.was necessarily foreclosed.id.at.
plaintiffs timely appealed.
because we affirm the grant of summary judgment on the merits,we do not resolve whether plaintiffs tort claims were barred by massachusetts statute of limitations.laws ch.
covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
plaintiffs claimed in counts i through iv of the complaint that sovereign was liable for breach of the state law implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under massachusetts law,every contract is subject to an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing the purpose of the implied covenant is to ensure that neither party interferes with the ability of the other to enjoy the fruits of the contract and that when performing the obligations of the contract,the parties remain faithful to the intended and agreed expectations of the contract.chokel genzyme,quoting uno,boston kenmore realty.t he scope of the covenant is only as broad as the contract that governs the particular relationship.id.quoting ayash cancer,internal quotation marks omitted.the covenant does not supply terms that the parties were free to negotiate,but did not,nor does it create rights and duties not otherwise provided for in the contract.id.citation omitted quoting ayash,at.in the context,the implied covenant would require that the bank be honest in its dealings with plaintiffs and that it not purposefully injure their right to obtain the benefit of the contract.shawmut bank,wayman,accord in re greenberg,ferris fed.home loan mortgage.
before the district court,plaintiffs based their breach of implied covenant claim on nine actions taken by sovereign in the period after famm discovered lee mismanagement.these actions were terminating in february the automatic cash sweeps failing thereafter to allow famm to manage its account online,thus making it impossible for famm to verify on a daily basis which of its checks had cleared mishandling famm account and causing at least one check to bounce refusing to answer third party phone calls or inquiries from famm subcontractors,suppliers,tax collection agencies,and others failing to respond to restructuring proposals or offers to purchase failing to respond in a timely manner to famm requests for copies of certain checks and bank statements failing to waive the and covenant defaults failing to issue a forbearance agreement despite promises to do so and failing to extend famm line of credit despite saying it would do so if famm paid down the line.
as to the first seven allegations,the district court found that even if true,none of these actions involved dishonesty and that plaintiffs failed to show that any were purposefully done to injure famm.gavin,wl,at.we agree with the district court conclusion,and plaintiffs make no attempt to explain how it was erroneous.moreover,both before the district court and on appeal,plaintiffs pointed to no provision in the loan agreements that obligated sovereign to take actions such as continuing the automatic sweeps,providing the desired online access,engaging in workout negotiations,or answering third party questions certainly there is no evidence the loan agreements required sovereign to waive the or covenant defaults although it could have chosen to do so as it eventually did for the default.
moreover,it is important that at the time all these events occurred,famm was in covenant default.see leblanc,cir finding,under massachusetts,law no breach of the implied covenant in a bank dealings with a borrower where it was undisputed that the bank did not take any of the adverse actions before the borrower defaulted.when the borrower is in default,that necessarily alters the contours of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
as to the final two allegations,the district court found there was insufficient evidence to support the allegation that sovereign misled famm by promising to issue a forbearance agreement and further promising to extend famm line of credit if famm paid down the line.gavin,wl,at.we agree.in their opposition to summary judgment,plaintiffs presented the following evidence in support of their claims first,ann gavin testified that we were told we would have a forbearance agreement by the end of march,then the end of april,then the end of may,then the end of june,and that when this did not happen,famm decided to try to engage in workout negotiations.moreover,she stated,we had been told that the line was going to be extended,and bowen asked us to make some paydowns based on that,which we did.second,famm turnaround consultant,picano,testified that through august,no terms of any formal forbearance agreement had been negotiated.third,plaintiffs point to a letter ann gavin sent to bowen after the line was not extended that said my line was shut off in may you advised joe picano and i that it would be extended.i made a paydown based on your commitment.
on the other hand,ann gavin also admitted that no specific discussion of terms had ever occurred with regards to a potential forbearance agreement,and that bowen merely told me that he would get it to us.moreover,in response to the contents of gavin letter to bowen,picano testified that he did not remember bowen ever advising us that the line was going to be extended,and that he was not surprised when he learned the line of credit was not going to be extended.
even taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,this evidence can not reasonably support the conclusion that sovereign misled famm or attempted purposefully to injure it.famm and sovereign were engaged in negotiations that never yielded an agreement in fact,these negotiations never even reached the stage of discussing specific terms.this does not constitute any breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
for the first time on appeal,plaintiffs assert that sovereign forcing famm to hire lee,in and of itself,was a breach of the implied covenant they claim powers misrepresented that he had the authority to demand that famm hire lee.this argument is waived.even if it were not,it fails.there is no evidence that sovereign acted dishonestly or purposefully to injure famm by insisting that it hire lee.there is no evidence that sovereign or powers had any indication that lee would not perform his job adequately.
plaintiffs also raise new arguments based on illinois law,under which they assert that the implied covenant requires a bank to exercise its discretion reasonably,see ba mortgage int l realty am.bank trust of.these arguments are also waived,and regardless,plaintiffs point to no case law suggesting that this reading of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is accepted under massachusetts law,or to any evidence demonstrating that sovereign exercised its discretion in an unreasonable manner.
fiduciary duty 
plaintiffs claimed in counts v and vi that sovereign was liable for breach of fiduciary duty.as plaintiffs wisely concede,under massachusetts law,the relationship between a lender and a borrower,without more,does not establish a fiduciary relationship.see,superior glass first bristol county bank,see also in re greenberg,at collecting cases lender liability law,practice and prevention.a fiduciary relationship may arise in this context where the borrower reposes its trust and confidence in the lender and the lender knows of and accepts the borrower trust.see superior glass,at broomfield kosow,t he plaintiff alone,by reposing trust and confidence in the defendant,can not thereby transform a business relationship into one which is fiduciary in nature.the catalyst in such a change is the defendant knowledge of the plaintiff reliance upon him.warsofsky sherman,blais warren five cents sav.bank.div.dist see also pimental wachovia mortgage,d,in re greenberg,at lender liability law,practice and prevention,supra.
no fiduciary relationship arose in this case famm relationship with sovereign was an,business relationship,not one of trust and confidence.even if famm had reposed its trust in sovereign,plaintiffs provided no evidence that sovereign was aware of or accepted this trust,a necessary condition for finding a fiduciary relationship.see warsofsky,at finding that where defendant,a member of the security committee of a cooperative bank,acting solely in his capacity as an official of the bank,was given confidential information by plaintiff,an individual seeking to secure a loan from the bank,and defendant understood that the information was given to him in confidence as a director and member of the security committee of the cooperative bank,and he received the information in that capacity and solely for the purpose of enabling himself and other officials of the bank to determine whether the security warranted the granting of the loan,the defendant bank officer had a fiduciary relation toward the plaintiff with reference to the matters disclosed and could not use the information for his personal gain as against either the plaintiff or the bank see also patsos first albany,finding that a jury could reasonably conclude a fiduciary relationship existed between a broker and his customer where the customer lacked sophistication and experience as an investor,the broker was aware of this inexperience and encouraged the customer to rely on his expertise by promising financial benefits,favorable margin treatment,and private stock sales,the broker told the customer he was conducting transactions solely for the customer benefit,the broker was in complete control of the account and executed transactions without the prior authorization of the customer,and the broker,when questioned by the customer,told the him that he need not worry about his inability to understand the monthly statements or the terms of the customer agreement.moreover,the record is that famm did not repose its trust in sovereign.to the contrary,famm alleges it resisted powers recommendation that it hire lee,and that it only hired lee because it was forced to do so,over its objection.
plaintiffs argue,in the alternative,that a fiduciary relationship arose in this case because sovereign exerted control over famm massachusetts courts have recognized that,under certain circumstances,a lender may actively participate in or exercise control over the business of a borrower to such an extent that a fiduciary relationship arises.see shawmut,at levesque ojala,wl,at,see also in re fordham,lender liability law,practice and prevention,supra.massachusetts courts have not defined what level of control is sufficient to give rise to a fiduciary duty under this theory,but have held that involvement in the debtor affairs that is not unusual in the context of a commercial loan is clearly insufficient.shawmut,at holding that a bank right to receive regular financial reports and monitor the debtor performance,and even to limit salaries paid,was not at all unusual in the context of a commercial loan and did not create a fiduciary relationship see also in re fordham,at holding that a lender meeting with consulting engineers,reviewing and approving construction plans,approving the construction manager,and reviewing requisitions was insufficient control to give rise to a fiduciary duty.in general,c ontrol does not arise unless the plaintiff can show that the creditor has obtained the power to direct the management of the debtor.lender liability law,practice and prevention,supra,see also id.a lender may offer advice and use the leverage which its position gives it the debtor,without being viewed as controlling the debtor,so long as the debtor continues to operate,and the management of the debtor continues to make its own business decisions.
plaintiffs have not produced facts permitting the conclusion that sovereign exerted a level of control over famm that was unusual in the commercial context or that sovereign was able to direct famm affairs.even if sovereign required that famm hire lee,there is no evidence that lee acted under sovereign directions.more importantly,ann and paul gavin remained the president and vice president of the company,and plaintiffs do not allege the gavins did not have final say over the company decisions.beyond this,famm hired a permanent comptroller,woolford,in march lee was to train and oversee woolford,and there is no evidence woolford decisions were dictated by lee or sovereign.thus,plaintiffs have not shown sovereign controlled famm to such an extent that a fiduciary relationship was created.
plaintiffs further claim sovereign aided and abetted a breach of fiduciary duty on the part of lee by directing lee to suspend famm monthly financial reports,and thus that the district court erred in granting summary judgment as to count vii of their complaint.the record shows that after he was hired,lee asked powers for permission not to turn in famm monthly financial statements until the permanent comptroller was hired,that powers agreed,and that by april,just three months later,famm resumed regular reporting and also submitted the previous months reports.plaintiffs perfunctory argument does not explain how this action constituted a breach of fiduciary duty by lee,much less one which sovereign aided and abetted.
instrumentality theory of lender liability 
count viii of plaintiffs complaint alleged that sovereign was liable on the basis of an instrumentality theory.where the theory is recognized,a lender may be held liable under the instrumentality theory when the lender exerts such a degree
