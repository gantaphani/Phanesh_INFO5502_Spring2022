in january,christine ribik filed a qui tam suit under seal in the eastern district of virginia on behalf of the united states against manor care as a former occupational therapist for manor care nursing facilities,ribik alleged that she witnessed therapists and other staff members commit numerous offenses in violation of medicare regulations,which give rise to violations of the false claims act.the complaint alleged that manor care inflated its revenues through overbilling medicare for skilled physical therapy and rehabilitation costs.ribik claimed that manor care regularly and fraudulently classified its patients as needing more physical therapy than necessary and instructed its physical therapists to spend more time than needed with the patients,resulting in higher medicare payments.she also alleged that manor care sent some patients to physical or occupational therapy who did not need it at all and refused to discharge patients for whom physical therapy was no longer useful.ribik amended her complaint in april.
in september,carson filed a qui tam suit under seal in the eastern district of virginia on behalf of the united states and several individual states against manor care under the fca and the statutes.the suit sought 
to recover on behalf of the government damages and civil penalties arising from false or fraudulent claims that defendants submitted or caused to be submitted to federal health insurance programs for skilled nursing facility stays and the therapies administered during those stays to health insurance including,but not limited to,medicare,medicaid,and fehbp beneficiaries.
carson alleged that manor care had committed fraud upon the government through its billing practices,including a overbill ing for therapy services provided b bill ing for therapy services not provided c bill ing activities as skilled therapy and d bill ing for unreasonable,unnecessary and at times harmful therapy.the complaint also alleged that manor care spent more time than necessary with patients to increase billing and postponed the discharge of patients for days and sometimes weeks longer than medically appropriate.carson claimed that he witnessed these practices while working for manor care nursing facilities as a physical therapist assistant.
carson also made a claim of retaliation under the fca,alleging that his employment with manor care was terminated in november of due to his repeated complaints about the fraudulent billing practices concerning patients associated with government funded health programs including,but not limited to,medicare and medicaid.the complaint stated that carson informed management,human resources,and the corporate office of the continued billing fraud in february and multiple times in,with a final complaint to manor care corporate compliance office in november.he was fired less than a week later.manor care stated that carson employment was terminated for changing a plan of care in violation of state law,given that only a physical therapist may change a treatment goal within a plan of care.carson was not a licensed physical therapist.however,carson claimed this reason was merely pretext,especially since the goal changed by carson was approved by the physical therapist,consistent with the practice utilized by manor care.
carson filed an amended complaint with causes of action in may the only change from the original complaint was to remove certain defendants.claims one through eight were qui tam claims under the fca,including a conspiracy claim.the ninth was an fca retaliation claim.the remaining causes of action were brought under the various state statutes.
ribik and carson cases were consolidated in june,and a third case was added in november.the united states government filed a notice of election to intervene in the consolidated case in december,and its consolidated complaint in intervention was filed in april.in july,manor care filed a motion to dismiss the government complaint,arguing that the complaint failed to state a claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b and was improperly pleaded under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court denied the motion.
manor care then filed a motion to dismiss carson amended complaint.among other arguments,manor care contended that the fca and michigan qui tam claims were barred by the rule,and the fca and all the qui tam claims,save the wisconsin claim,were barred because they were based on public disclosure.further,manor care argued that all claims failed because they were not plausibly or sufficiently pleaded pursuant to rules b and b.the district court granted the motion in december in a order,concluding that carson complaint was based upon the same material elements of alleged fraud as ribik complaint,and therefore the fca rule barred all of carson claims.the court dismissed carson complaint in its entirety for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.carson filed a timely notice of appeal,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.

a private citizen may bring a civil action on behalf of the federal government for violation of the fca.b.the fca encourag es citizens to act as whistleblowers,while also seek ing to prevent parasitic lawsuits based on previously disclosed fraud.united states ex rel.carter halliburton,cir,aff in part,rev in part on other grounds sub nom.kellogg brown root,united states ex rel.carter.the government may intervene in the action or allow the person filing the suit,called a relator,to proceed.b.if the government intervenes,the relator shall have the right to continue as a party to the action.id.c.notably,w hen a person brings an action under the qui tam subsection,no person other than the government may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.id.b.the purpose of this restriction,known as the rule,is to provide incentives to relators to promptly alert the government to the essential facts of a fraudulent scheme,united states ex rel.wilson squibb,cir,while also keeping in mind the fca goal of maintaining the balance between encouraging citizens to report fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits,united states ex rel.lacorte wagner,cir.
the court applies the material elements test in determining whether a complaint is based on the facts underlying a complaint.carter,at.the material elements tests bars a later suit if it is based upon the same material elements of fraud as the earlier suit,even though the subsequent suit may incorporate somewhat different details.see also grynberg koch gateway pipeline,cir.stating that the rule applies when a subsequent complaint raises the same or a related claim based in significant measure on the core fact or general conduct relied upon in the first qui tam action.d ifferences in specifics such as geographic location or added facts will not save a subsequent case.carter,at.a belated relator who merely adds details to a previously exposed fraud does not help reduce fraud or return funds to the federal fisc,because once the government knows the essential facts of a fraudulent scheme,it has enough information to discover related frauds.united states ex rel.branch consultants allstate ins,cir.if a court finds that the particular action before it is barred by the rule,the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the matter.carter,at.in that circumstance,the court must dismiss the action under federal rule of civil procedure h if the court determines at any time that it lacks jurisdiction,the court must dismiss the action.
carson argues that his allegations go well beyond ribik allegations and include improper conduct that is wholly additional to anything contained in any previously filed complaints.opening br.while he contends that the district court conducted only a cursory review of the allegations generally,opening br,our review is not cursory,yet we arrive at the same result.indeed,carson claims are essentially the same as those found in ribik complaint.the shared contention of both complaints is that manor care implemented a scheme of overbilling for medical and physical therapy costs in order to defraud the government.a comparison of the two complaints reveals how similar they are.see united states ex rel.heath,cir.similarity is assessed by comparing the complaints,and asking whether the later complaint alleges a fraudulent scheme the government already would be equipped to investigate based on the first complaint.compare ribik complaint,with carson complaint.
ribik claimed that she observed various fraudulent and improper practices related to billing and provision of medicare related benefits.her complaint stated that manor care classified various patients in high and ultra high rug classifications,even when their physical condition did not warrant the need for such extensive services.ribik alleged that manor care encouraged their physical therapy staff to maximize the number of minutes that they would spend with a patient during a reference period the period of time used to determine a rug level,resulting in physical,occupational,and speech therapy continuing beyond what the patients needed.she claimed that manor care submitted billing to medicare for patients who simply did not require skilled physical or occupational therapy and failed to discharge patients who were ready for discharge to outpatient services,so they could bill medicare for skilled therapy that was no longer necessary.the complaint stated that ribik observed manor care employees occupational therapy patients with a physical therapist,yet reporting the time separately to increase costs to medicare.further,she alleged that manor care had practices of billing treatment time even when patients were not engaged in treatment but were asleep,walking to treatment,toileting,or because of dementia,were actively resisting care,falsely stating that treatments were performed when in fact a patient had not been given treatment,and billing for services which were not medical sic necessary or appropriate for patients,including use of peg boards and pumpkin carving.also,ribik claimed that manor care instructed its employees to plac e patients,who could independently ambulate in excess of feet and perform their acts of daily living in skilled therapy programs when they did not qualify for or require such services.she maintained that manor care employees would pull patients from the general nursing home who were not eligible for physical therapy,particularly individuals with advanced alzheimer disease or dementia,in order to bill for unneeded services.finally,ribik alleged that manor care encouraged and assented to these illegal activities by providing incentives and bonuses to those directors at manor care facilities who had the highest utilization rates.
much like ribik,carson claimed that manor care utilized improper billing practices and methodologies to present or cause to be presented false claims to the government for payments under the health insurance programs.he alleged that manor care instructed its staff to indiscriminately shift minutes amongst the three therapy disciplines physical,occupational and speech,to capture all prescribed minutes from patients from government funded health programs,so that manor care facilities would not lose a high rug category.the carson complaint also stated that manor care employees would often continue to treat patients who have already attained their treatment goals patients whose treatment goals are clearly unattainable,that m ost patients at the facility who receive physical therapy also receive occupational therapy,regardless of medical need,and that manor care often delay ed the discharge of patients from the facility for days and sometimes weeks longer than medically necessary,all in order to increase billing.carson alleged that sessions were and that manor care employees routinely bill ed for therapy that was refused by the patient not even attempted by the staff member,made claims for patients not actively engaged in therapy,and billed for various services and activities designed to motivate and entertain the patients,such as singing christmas carols.in addition,he maintained that manor care employees provided excessive therapy to alzheimer patients and patients suffering from other forms of dementia.finally,carson alleged that manor care employees were rewarded with free lunch for reaching a corporate goal of utilizing certain treatments.
it is clear that carson allegations are materially similar to those found in ribik complaint.he attempts to distinguish his complaint by arguing that he is the sole relator to argue that manor care improperly increased their billings to health programs by consistently administering modalities like electric stimulation,diathermy,and ultra sound to inappropriate patients.opening br.while carson maintains that these modalities somehow constitute schemes different from those alleged in ribik complaint,those treatments fall under ribik general claim that manor care billed the government for unnecessary treatment.the allegations in ribik complaint provide the government with enough knowledge of essential facts of the scheme to discover related fraud.see carter,at.neither carson factual additions nor the fact that his experience took place in pennsylvania,as opposed to ribik experience in virginia,saves him from the bar.see id.at.carson has not managed to avoid b bar simply by alleging additional facts relating to how manor care overbilled the government,even though some of those specific allegations were not mentioned in ribik complaint.see grynberg,at see also branch consultants,at any construction of b that focused on the details of the action would allow an infinite number of copycat qui tam actions to proceed so long as the relator in each case alleged one additional instance of the previously exposed fraud.
alternatively,and even assuming carson complaint contains substantially the same claims as ribik,he argues that his complaint should not be dismissed because the district court consolidated his claims with ribik.because the government intervened in the consolidated action,carson argues that his claims survive application of the bar.while a novel argument,it has no merit.the fca does not make an exception to the rule for consolidated complaints.the rule is an absolute,unambiguous rule.carter,at.the statute is clear w hen a person brings an action under this subsection,no person other than the government may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action.b emphasis added.the statute does not read that no person other than the government may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action unless that person case is consolidated with the case.carson has not directed the court to any authority supporting his unique position,which contravenes the plain language of the statute.see united states ex rel.lacorte smithkline beecham clinical,cir.stating that merena filed his complaint before any of the other consolidated relators,and b therefore would bar any claims in the other complaints consolidated with merena that repeat merena a
