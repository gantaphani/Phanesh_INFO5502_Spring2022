opinion of the court 
this appeal raises questions regarding the liability of a police officer and a landlord involved in an ex parte private repossession by a former boyfriend of the plaintiff.we hold that a police officer actively involved in such a repossession may be engaged in state action in violation the fourth amendment.we will reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of the officer because the district court improperly resolved a material factual dispute in favor of the police officer on this issue.we also hold that the landlord,who,according to the plaintiff,participated in the repossession by opening the door to the plaintiff apartment at the direction of the police officer,was not engaged in state action.we will therefore affirm summary judgment in the landlord favor.we will also affirm summary judgment in favor of the police department,the police chief,and the township board because the plaintiff did not show any evidence of deliberate indifference.
facts procedural posture 
this case centers around a private repossession of property by an from his former residence in,elizabeth harvey and her edward olowiany jointly leased an apartment in the township of plains,pennsylvania.after the relationship deteriorated,harvey obtained a protection from abuse order pfa against olowiany,which granted harvey the exclusive right of possession of the apartment,and ordered olowiany to retrieve all of his belongings immediately after entry of the pfa.at the pfa hearing,olowiany requested that he be allowed to return to the apartment,in order to pick up furnishings and other things that would be difficult to remove during his first trip.his request was denied,although he claims that the judge noted that he could return if he made arrangements with harvey.
olowiany attorney sent a letter to harvey asking her to set a time for olowiany to retrieve his remaining property.the letter also contained an itemized list of that property.harvey did not to respond to the letter.the attorney sent a second letter,stating that on september,at,olowiany would arrive to retrieve his belongings accompanied by a plains township police officer.he sent a copy of this letter to the plains township police department police department and to harvey landlord,joan chukinas.because she was residing elsewhere at the time,harvey claims she never received the second letter.
on september,officer ronald dombroski was sent to the harvey residence by a supervisor in order to keep the peace at the repossession.dombroski was given a copy of the list of items to be retrieved,as described in olowiany attorney first letter.at the time,olowiany,dombroski,and chukinas arrived at the apartment.harvey,apparently unaware that her apartment was to be entered,was not present.dombroski directed chukinas to unlock the door,so that olowiany could retrieve his property after entry,olowiany removed items from the apartment.while dombroski claims that he attempted to verify that only listed items were taken,upon returning to the apartment,harvey found that it was in disarray and that many items were missing,including several that were not included in the list accompanying the first letter.
harvey brought suit under against dombroski,chukinas,police chief edward walsh,the plains township police department,and the plains township board the essence of her complaint is that the actions of dombroski and chukinas were in violation of the fourth amendment,and that walsh,the police department,and the township failed to adequately train dombroski.the defendants moved for summary judgment,and the district court found for all of them.it held that dombroski was protected by qualified immunity,because,although he violated harvey clearly established fourth amendment rights,he acted reasonably.chukinas prevailed because,in the district court view,she was not acting under color of law or in concert with dombroski.the failure to train claim against the remaining defendants failed because harvey did not set forth any evidence of deliberate indifference or identify an appropriate alternative training program.harvey appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendants 
ii.officer dombroski 
to prevail on this appeal with respect to officer dombroski,harvey must show that dombroski took part in state action that the state action violated her asserted constitutional rights and that dombroski is not entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the constitutional violation.we address these issues in that order.
state action 
to state a claim under,a plaintiff must allege the violation of a right secured by the constitution and laws of the united states,and must show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.west atkins,d.to satisfy the state action requirement,the defendant must have used authority derived from the state in causing the alleged harm.see abbott latshaw,cir.
in abbott,we considered the state action question under facts somewhat similar to those in this case.mark abbott and laurie latshaw were a divorced couple.during their marriage,latshaw father purchased a van for the couple and eventually sold any interest that he may have had in it to abbott in exchange for abbott promise to pay off the loan,which abbott fulfilled.however,abbott never received the title from latshaw father,and after the divorce,the father transferred the title to his daughter,rather than abbott.she then sought repossession of the van by enlisting albert diehl,a county constable,notifying him of these facts and paying him to help her retrieve the vehicle.to prove that she owned the van,latshaw showed the constable the title and a temporary registration.diehl asked abbott for the keys to the van,but abbott refused,arguing that he paid for the van and he owned it.diehl then summoned the police,and,in response,three officers arrived officer sarsfield,officer stafford,and lieutenant george.at about the same time,abbott attorney arrived at the scene and boxed in the van,just as a locksmith had completed a duplicate key for latshaw.lieutenant george ordered the attorney to unblock the van,and arrested the attorney after he refused to do so.in the meantime,latshaw got into the van and managed to get around the attorney car and drive away.abbott filed a action against his latshaw,constable diehl,officers sarsfield and stafford,and lieutenant george,alleging that they deprived him of his due process in violation of the fourteenth amendment.the district court dismissed all of the claims based on qualified immunity or lack of state action.on appeal,we considered whether state action could be found with respect to the various actors.
we found that diehl actions could be considered state action 
the constable played a principal role in the seizure.latshaw enlisted him,and paid for his help because she believed that she could not take the van from abbott without it.according to abbott,diehl walked into my office and identified himself as a constable and told me that he was there to take my vehicle,and that we going to take the vehicle one way or another.the constable threatened to arrest abbott for driving her vehicle if he tried to drive the van home.viewing the record in the light most favorable to abbott,we find that a reasonable jury could conclude that diehl used his public authority to help latshaw take possession of the van,and as such was obligated to notify abbott of the seizure in advance and to provide him with a meaningful opportunity to be heard.
id.at.as to the police officers,we found that the mere presence of sarsfield and stafford at the repossession did not constitute state action 
the greensburg police officers were called to the scene to check latshaw documentation,which they did.there is no evidence that two of the and any more than this.the mere presence of police at the scene of a private repossession does not,alone,constitute state action causing a deprivation of a protected property interest officers sarsfield and stafford confined their conduct to the routine police procedures of checking the vehicle registration,and can not be said to have used state action to deprive abbott of his due process rights.
id.at.we,however,did find george actions to qualify as state action at least for summary judgment purposes 
lieutenant george did not remain neutral,but advised latshaw that she had a right to immediate possession of the van.george also ignored abbott attorney ardent protest of the seizure,and threatened to arrest the attorney if he did not move his car to make way for latshaw.although he was not the instigator,a jury could find that george,by his conduct,joined forces with diehl in the unconstitutional deprivation,going beyond the permissible conduct outlined in menchaca.
id.as to latshaw,we first noted that,a lthough not an agent of the state,a private party who willfully participates in a joint conspiracy with state officials to deprive a person of a constitutional right acts under color of state law for purposes of.id.at.we reinstated the claim against latshaw,finding that state action was sufficiently alleged,as abbott had alleged in his complaint that diehl acted at the instance and request of defendant latshaw and the complaint depicted joint action by latshaw and diehl in effectuating the recovery of the van,and that the allegations had at least some support in the facts.id.at.
here,dombroski argues that his action does not constitute state action,because he merely was present at a private his conduct to officers sarsfield and stafford in abbott.we reject this argument.in an answer to an interrogatory,chukinas,the landlord,states that she opened the door at the direction and with the permission of the plains township police.app.see also app.confirming that dombroski ordered her to open the apartment.thus,for purposes of summary judgment,we must accept for a fact that dombroski directed chukinas to open the door.moreover,chukinas stated,in her deposition,that i would never have opened the door if i did have permission from the policeman.app.like in abbott,viewing the facts in this manner,it appears that dombroski played a principal role in the seizure and a reasonable jury could conclude that dombroski used his public authority to help the gain entry to and seize property from harvey apartment.the record supports a finding that he was not a mere spectator,but in fact a cause of the seizure.
dombroski relies on cases that allegedly suggest that the plaintiff presence,here harvey presence,was necessary for state action to have taken place.see,barrett harwood,cir breiner litwhiler,d.while the presence of the plaintiff at the alleged constitutional violation was important in these cases,it was important not in itself but as an indicator of the role that the defendant likely played.in barrett,the second circuit found that an officer warning to the plaintiff against start ing any trouble was a reasonable peacekeeping response to the plaintiff violent opposition to the repossession.at.the court stated that the crucial question was whether or not the officer was taking an active role that either affirmatively assisted in the repossession over the debtor objection or intentionally intimidated the debtor so as to prevent him from exercising his legal right to object to the repossession.id.at.however,we believe that the implication that the plaintiff must be present was in response to the factual situation presented.this is made clear by the court earlier more general formulation of the issue when an officer begins to take a more active hand in the repossession,and as such involvement becomes increasingly critical,a point may be reached at which police assistance at the scene of a private repossession may cause the repossession to take on the character of state action.id.at.thus,we do not read barrett as embracing a rule that requires the plaintiff presence in order to find state action.
in breiner,the district court assigned significance to the plaintiff absence at the scene because it showed that she was not intimidated by the police being one method by which an officer might help effectuate a constitutional violation.id.at.however,as in barrett,what was ultimately important was whether the injury to the plaintiff was aided by the use of authority,not whether the alleged state action was immediately directed at the plaintiff.here,the record supports a finding that the officer used his authority to compel chukinas to open the door.thus,the use of order to open the critical to the repossession,satisfying the test discussed above 
constitutional violation 
the district court found that t he law was unquestionably clear in september,that the fourth amendment prohibited unreasonable searches and seizures of a person home by the police without a warrant.app.citing payton new york,d.in arguing that the district court should be affirmed,the defendants including dombroski do not appear to deny this contention instead,dombroski focuses on state action,as discussed above,and on the argument that he was at a private repossession merely to keep the peace and did not go beyond performing that function.accordingly,we will not disturb the district court finding that dombroski actions violated the fourth amendment.
in addition to the fourth amendment violation,harvey notes in her reply brief that she also claims that her right to due process was violated.reply br.of appellant at.it is unclear whether a due process claim was properly raised in her complaint or explicitly made before the district court,as the finding by the district court that dombroski violated the fourth amendment allowed it to move to the reasonableness prong of qualified immunity without having to consider other constitutional claims.of course,that claim could have provided a ground to deny qualified immunity,but we need not dwell on this issue.as harvey neglected to raise this argument in her opening brief,we find it waived united states pelullo,cir it is well settled that an appellant failure to identify or argue an issue in his opening brief constitutes waiver of that issue on appeal.citing in re surrick,cir.
qualified immunity 
qualified immunity shields public officials performing discretionary functions from and fourteenth amendment liability insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.abbott,at quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.our qualified immunity inquiry is a two step process.first,we must determine whether the defendants violated clearly established rights.id.this entails a finding of a constitutional or statutory violation as well as a finding that the violated right was clearly established at the time of the violation.second,we determine whether a reasonable officer would have believed that his or her conduct deprived the plaintiff of his or her constitutional rights.id.
the fourth amendment right violated here was clearly established at the time that the events that gave rise to this case took place.as the district court noted,payton made clear in that warrantless searches are not permissible absent an exception no such exception is implicated here.
the main issue here is whether dombroski belief that he was acting lawfully was reasonable.the district court found that dombroski conduct was reasonable,because he was ordered by his superior to keep the peace during the repossession,was given the letters sent by olowiany attorney,and believed that harvey and chukinas had received the letter detailing the time of the repossession and the items to be removed this latter belief was deemed reasonable because the letter indicated that it was sent to those parties.thus,the district court reasoned,as far as dombroski knew,the necessary arrangements had been made for olowiany to retrieve his belongings,and his role was simply to keep the peace.app.accordingly,dombroski reasonably believed that by allowing chukinas to unlock the door,and his entering the apartment,he was acting to keep the peace.the district court found that dombroski was acting under a belief that the owner of the property was retrieving possessions with permission from the possessor.id.
the essence of the district court analysis appears to be that it was reasonable for dombroski to conclude that harvey consented to the repossession.this belief was based on the fact that the letter detailing the time of the repossession was sent to harvey.we believe that it is unreasonable to conclude,on the basis of a letter that the attorney sent harvey,to which she did not respond,that harvey consented to the repossession officer dombroski had no reason to believe that harvey had received the letter or,more importantly,that she had consented to the repossession.especially with knowledge of the existence of a domestic violence order,a reasonable officer should have determined whether consent was given by harvey for the repossession.a reasonable officer at least would have refused to assist with opening the door until he was satisfied that consent was given.see payton,at.reiterating that physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the fourth amendment is directed quoting united states district court,d.that he was ordered to keep the peace should be irrelevant,as officer dombroski actions went well beyond merely keeping the peace.dombroski supervisor simply ordered him to keep the peace,not to have the door opened in order for the to remove property.app.i was to go down there and to keep the peace down there,because there was a pfa in effect,and olowiany was going to be removing some of his items from the residence.
our dissenting colleague argues that our conclusion runs afoul of anderson creighton,d,because dombroski could have believed that his conduct was lawful in light of the information in his possession.we certainly agree,as we must,that creighton requires a particularized inquiry,involving consideration of both the law as clearly established at the time of the conduct in question and the information within the officer possession at that time.however,we part ways when considering whether the information in dombroski possession could reasonably have supported the belief that his actions were constitutional.as an initial note,there is no need to particularize the fourth amendment right implicated here beyond the basic rule,well established by supreme court cases,that,absent consent or exigency,a warrantless search of the home is presumptively unconstitutional.groh ramirez,d citing payton,at.discussing qualified immunity and noting that n o reasonable officer could claim to be unaware of this rule.as in groh,there was no exigency here,and the groh court rejected,over a dissent,the notion that ample room must be made for mistaken judgments of law or fact in cases in which no exigency exists.id.at.thus,the simple question we are faced with is whether it was reasonable for dombroski to infer consent from the knowledge in his possession.our dissenting colleague notes that there is a presumption that a properly mailed item is received by the addressee.however,we do not see how dombroski could reasonably infer from the presumption of mailing that harvey consented to anybody entering her apartment our colleague seems to question what dombroski should have done at what he understood to be a long prearranged appointment.he should have done exactly what he was dispatched to the not affirmatively aid in the removal of property from harvey apartment.we stress that,at this stage,we must take for a fact that the officer ordered the landlord to open the door.this,and only this,is the action we find to be unreasonable,and clearly so.
because we find officer dombroski conduct to be unreasonable given the facts presented,we will reverse the district court grant of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds to dombroski 
iii.joan chukinas 
the district court,as regards to the culpability of the landlord,found that,as a matter of law,chukinas conduct did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation because she neither acted under color of law,nor did she act in concert with dombroski.app.it found that she did not assert any state authority in opening the door and that there are no facts alleged that support a finding that chukinas and dombroski acted in concert.our discussion of the law regarding state action and of the alleged constitutional violations provides the relevant background.
harvey argues that,because the door was unlocked through some sort of interaction between dombroski and chukinas,they,by definition,acted jointly,satisfying the test from united states price,d private persons,jointly engaged with state officials in the prohibited action,are acting under color of law for purposes of,for private party state action.however,the price test requires more than joint action,but rather requires that the private actor at least be a willful participant in joint activity with the state or its agents.at.emphasis added.thus,compelled participation by a private actor may fall outside of the contours of state action.
as we are considering chukinas motion for summary judgment here,we construe the facts in the most favorable light to harvey.the record supports three possible scenarios with respect to chukinas she acted on her own in opening the door for olowiany she acted with dombroski permission in opening the door,but the choice of whether or not to open it was hers or she acted at dombroski direction in opening the door.if,under any of these scenarios,chukinas could be considered to have engaged in state action,we must reject the district court finding that chukinas did not engage in such action.
under the first scenario,in which chukinas acted without any input from dombroski,dombroski would merely have been present at the scene and would not have used any of the state coercive powers.accordingly,there would be no state action by dombroski,and chukinas could not have acted jointly in state action as there was none.therefore this scenario is of no help to harvey.the second which chukinas chose to act with the permission of not materially different from the first,as the action is not coerced.see supra note.
this leaves the last scenario,under which dombroski ordered chukinas to open the door.chukinas argues that,unlike in cases in which private parties have been found to have acted jointly with state actors,she did not direct dombroski to do anything nor did she request his assistance with anything.moreover,she argues,she had no personal interest in getting the door opened,unlike,for example,latshaw use of the constable in abbott.
the supreme court language requiring joint action or action in concert suggests that some sort of common purpose or intent must be shown.see lugar edmondson oil,d finding that t he court of appeals erred in holding that in this context joint participation required something more than invoking the aid of state officials to take advantage of attachment procedures emphasis added.although the facts of this situation appear to render chukinas a participant,they do not suggest that she was a willful participant.price requires willful participation a private citizen acting at the orders of a police officer is not generally acting in a willful manner,especially when that citizen has no in taking the action.see black law dictionary defining willful as v oluntary and intentional,but not necessarily malicious see also united states cheape,cir noting that the jury found that the defendant actions were wilful,and not the product of coercion or duress.for the reasons just discussed,we believe that the willful participation required under price means voluntary,uncoerced participation.see sutton providence joseph med,cir w e would expect that the private defendant is not responsible for the government compulsion.chukinas would therefore not be liable here because she had not willfully participated in the state action,as compulsion by the state negates the presence of willfulness 
harvey points out that,in reitz county of bucks,we noted that o ther courts have recognized that conduct as seemingly benign as towing a vehicle at the direction of a police officer can result in liability for a private defendant,cir citing goichman rheuban motors,cir.the situation described in goichman,however,arose within a detailed statutory scheme empowering the towing companies that was created by t
