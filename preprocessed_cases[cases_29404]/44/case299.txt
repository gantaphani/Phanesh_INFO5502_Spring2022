vital to our resolution of this appeal is an understanding of the controversy extensive and convoluted procedural history.our story begins in august when luis adorno cabán adorno fatally shot jaime pagán avilés pagán.the unfortunate incident occurred while both men were working at pfizer facility in barceloneta,puerto rico.pagán common law wife,emma fernández vargas fernández,and their minor son,survived him.pagán also left behind and,two minor daughters from his prior marriage to anabel sánchez valle sánchez.pfizer is the appellee in this appeal.sánchez is the appellant.sánchez asserts the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction from the outset,improperly dismissed her wrongful death,issued a judgment that was null and void,and erroneously enjoined her from suing pfizer in commonwealth court.we exercise jurisdiction under,and affirm.
shortly after pagán death,fernández filed a workmen compensation claim with the puerto rico state insurance fund sif on behalf of herself and see laws.in submitting her claim,fernández disclosed the dependent status not only of pagán son,but also of pagán two daughters,and sánchez did not file a separate claim with the sif on behalf of and.after an investigation,the sif denied fernández claim in a terse order 
from the investigation conducted it is established that the aggression occurred when pagán,in a joking manner,threatened the injured party with a firearm that accidentally went off.said aggression has no bearing whatsoever with the functions performed by the employee,nor with the functions performed by the assailant,it does not constitute an occupational risk nor a risk of the work environment,and the assailant was in violation of a company rule,of not bearing arms on the employer premises.
in re pagán avilés,order state ins.fund,july,certified translation mc.because,according to the sif,pagán death was not related to his occupation,his death was not compensable under puerto rico work accident compensation act waca.id.fernández did not appeal the sif decision to the puerto rico industrial commission as permitted by the waca.see laws.
instead,in august,fernández and sánchez commenced separate lawsuits in puerto rico commonwealth court seeking damages related to pagán death.sánchez wrongful death lawsuit named as plaintiffs herself and her two minor daughters,as well as pagán father,aunt,uncle,and brother.named defendants included pfizer,adorno,and the medical personnel responsible for treating pagán.sánchez did not join fernández or see pagán valentín pfizer,llc,no.cdp,amended complaint arecibo sup,certified translation mc.
fernández filed a lawsuit on behalf of herself and fernández named,among others,pfizer and adorno as defendants.importantly,she also named and as defendants through their mother,sánchez.according to the complaint,fernández named and as defendants because sánchez had not authorized their joinder as plaintiffs,and they might be entitled to share in a recovery as pagán heirs.see fernández vargas pfizer,no.cdp,complaint arecibo sup,certified translation mc.
fernández complaint alleged two theories of recovery.first,like sánchez,fernández alleged wrongful death against pfizer and adorno.second,unlike sánchez,fernández alleged pfizer had wrongfully denied her disability benefits.the latter claim arose from fernández status as a pfizer employee.fernández alleged she suffered emotional damages because pfizer,instead of providing her with disability benefits,forced her to return to work after pagán death.
pfizer removed fernández action to federal district court in november.pfizer argued erisa preemption of fernández employee benefits claim made the claim removable under a.see a b see also aetna health davila,d explaining that because erisa completely preempted a state law cause of action,a claim coming within the scope of that cause of action,even if pleaded in terms of state law,was actually based in federal law.the district court supplemental jurisdiction extended to fernández wrongful death claim,which arose under puerto rico law.see c.
once in federal court,pfizer moved to dismiss fernández complaint pursuant to.b.pfizer argued erisa preempted fernández denial of benefits claim.notwithstanding the sif prior decision that pagán death was not related to his occupation,pfizer further argued that because pagán death occurred in the course of his employment,pfizer was immune from fernández wrongful death claim under waca.section provides 
when an employer insures his workmen or employees in accordance with this chapter,the right herein established to obtain compensation shall be the only remedy against the employer,even in those cases where maximum compensations and benefits have been granted in accordance thereof but in case of accident to,or diseased or death of,the workmen or employees not entitled to compensation under this chapter,the liability of the employer is,and shall continue to be,the same as if this chapter did not exist.
laws emphasis added.the district court granted fernández leave to file an amended complaint,while reserving ruling on pfizer immunity defense pending submission of an english translation of the sif decision.
fernández filed her amended complaint in february.fernández again named pagán two daughters as defendants,through sánchez,their mother.fernández alleged wrongful death against pfizer and adorno.she also alleged pfizer had improperly denied her disability benefits under an plan under plaintiff emma fernández is entitled to seek from pfizer the benefits owed to her under the long term disability plan offered to her as an employee of pfizer.fernández vargas pfizer,civ.jaf,amended complaint february.a s a further violation of erisa,fernández alleged pfizer had wrongfully refused to tender the proceeds from pagán and plans.pfizer answered by renewing its motion to dismiss fernández wrongful death claim.pfizer again asserted employer immunity under waca.additionally,pfizer moved to dismiss fernández erisa claims,arguing she failed to exhaust the administrative remedies outlined in pfizer benefits plan.
finally,in april,sánchez,on behalf of and,appeared for the first time and answered fernández amended complaint.sánchez acknowledged the district court federal question and supplemental jurisdiction.sánchez also filed a,on behalf of her daughters,against pfizer and adorno for wrongful death.sánchez set forth essentially the same allegations as those contained in the complaint she filed nine months earlier in the puerto rico commonwealth court.
pfizer moved to dismiss sánchez,yet again asserting employer immunity under waca.sánchez received an extension of time until june to oppose pfizer motion to dismiss her.on june,sánchez filed a second request for an extension.the district court did not grant the second extension.instead,on june,the district court issued an opinion and order addressing pfizer respective motions to dismiss.see fernández vargas pfizer,d.that same day,the district court denied as moot sánchez second motion for an extension of time to respond to pfizer motion to dismiss.
the district court first denied pfizer motion to dismiss fernández erisa claims.according to the court,fernández allegation that pfizer had refused to provide her benefits before she filed her lawsuit was sufficient to establish exhaustion under the standard.see.a.second,the district court addressed whether pfizer was entitled to immunity from suit under waca.the court initially considered the preclusive effect of the sif decision.because pfizer was not a party to the sif proceedings,the court reasoned that pfizer was not precluded from challenging the sif decision and asserting immunity under the act.see fernández vargas,d at.
turning to the merits,the district court concluded the sif had interpreted the waca too narrowly and,thus,wrongly concluded pagán death was not compensable under the act.the court cited numerous puerto rico court decisions holding that if an accident occurs on an employer premises,the causal connection required to make the injury compensable is satisfied.id.at collecting cases.even assuming,contrary to the sif finding,that the shooting was intentional,the court reasoned that where the intentional aggression is unexplained or without a known motive,the benefit of the doubt favors the worker,and it must be assumed that the aggression was and,therefore,compensable.id.at collecting cases.because neither fernández nor sánchez alleged any motive behind pagán shooting or provided any explanation for it,the district court held pagán death was compensable under the waca,and pfizer was entitled to the immunity provided by.accordingly,the court dismissed fernández wrongful death claim and sánchez wrongful death against pfizer 
as part of its dismissal order,the court scheduled a show cause hearing to determine whether and,through sánchez should remain in fernández erisa suit and,if so,whether they we re appropriately joined as.id.at.sánchez filed a motion to reconsider the court dismissal of her therein,sánchez suggested for the first time that adorno had a motive for shooting pagán related to an emotional relationship,and that discovery was necessary to establish such motive.
with sánchez motion to reconsider pending,pfizer moved for summary judgment on fernández erisa claims.pfizer again asserted fernández failure to exhaust her administrative remedies.fernández,whose counsel had been permitted to withdraw on july,never responded.consequently,on august,pfizer asked the court to deem its motion for summary judgment unopposed.pfizer further moved to dismiss fernández case for failure to prosecute.see.b.
oddly,the district court granted sánchez an extension of time to respond to pfizer motion for summary judgment a motion that by all appearances was directed solely at fernández erisa claims.sánchez filed a formal opposition to pfizer motion for summary judgment on august.sánchez for the first time argued she had alleged,as part of her,claims on behalf of and sánchez urged the court to forego ruling on pfizer motion and allow discovery.
on august,the district court granted pfizer motion to dismiss fernández action for failure to prosecute.the next morning,the court held a show cause hearing on the lawsuit continued viability in light of two outstanding matters sánchez motion to reconsider the court prior dismissal of her wrongful death against pfizer,and sánchez opposition to pfizer motion for summary judgment on fernández erisa claims.that afternoon,the court entered an order denying sánchez motion to reconsider without comment.the court then dismissed the case in its entirety and entered final judgment thereon 
there being no pending erisa cause of action pleaded by,the remaining portion of this case is dismissed.any claims by the sánchez claimants are not properly before the court and are,if at all,premature.the dismissal as to any future erisa claims by these claimants is without prejudice.
fernández vargas pfizer,civ.jaf,order.
sanchez filed another motion to reconsider which,properly construed,constituted a motion to alter or amend the judgment.see.e.in her motion,sánchez suggested,for the first time,that the district court judgment was null because fernández son,had an unspecified conflict of interest with his mother and lacked legal representation at a crucial stage of the proceeding.sánchez asserted the court failure to appoint a guardian ad litem rendered its judgment void.sánchez also argued that she had alleged a cause of action under erisa,and summary judgment was premature prior to discovery.with sánchez rule e motion outstanding,pfizer moved the court for injunctive relief pursuant to the anti injunction act.pfizer urged the court to enter a permanent injunction precluding sánchez and her family from relitigating the issue of pfizer immunity from suit in commonwealth court.
in november,the district court denied sánchez rule e motion and enjoined her and her family from relitigating the immunity issue.see fernández vargas pfizer,civ.jaf,wl,unpublished.the court again rejected sánchez argument that she had actually pled erisa claims against pfizer.the court declined to address the need for a guardian ad litem to represent,or for discovery.the court viewed these arguments as premised on the erroneous supposition that they sánchez and her daughters had an erisa against pfizer in the first instance.id.at.
turning to pfizer motion for injunctive relief,the district court recognized that sánchez wrongful death against pfizer was identical to her wrongful death claim pending in commonwealth court.the court reasoned that because it had already conclusively determined waca rendered pfizer immune from sánchez wrongful death,permitting sánchez to relitigate the immunity issue in commonwealth court would cause pfizer irreparable harm.see id.at.consequently,the court issued the injunction against sánchez and her family.see.sánchez appealed.our jurisdiction arises under.we affirm.
on appeal sánchez challenges the district court judgment on four grounds.first,sánchez argues pfizer removal of fernández complaint to federal court was improper and the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action from the outset.second,she claims the court improperly dismissed her against pfizer based on the erroneous view that waca provided pfizer immunity from suit.third,she suggests the court failure to appoint fernández son,a guardian ad litem renders its judgment a nullity.finally,sánchez asserts the court improperly enjoined her from pursuing her wrongful death claim against pfizer in commonwealth court.
sánchez argument that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction presents a legal question we consider de novo.see united seniors ass n,philip morris usa,cir reviewing de novo the district court implicit legal conclusion that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint.our resolution of sánchez jurisdictional concern need not detain us long.whether pfizer removal of fernández original commonwealth action to federal court was defective is immaterial.fernández amended her complaint to plainly allege jurisdiction in the context of her erisa claims.once fernández did so,any initial jurisdictional defect in removal was cured.see brough united steelworkers,cir 
in brough,we plainly held that a federal claim,raised for the first time in an amended complaint,cured any jurisdictional defects in an action otherwise improperly removed from state court.id.at.when fernández amended her complaint,the district court undoubtedly possessed original federal question jurisdiction over her erisa claims pursuant to,and supplemental jurisdiction over her wrongful death claim pursuant to.
sánchez against pfizer acknowledged both the court original and supplemental jurisdiction under and,respectively.courts have long recognized that a party can not voluntarily invoke and then disavow federal jurisdiction.new mexico general,cir internal quotations omitted accord bernstein lind waldock,cir citing brough.accordingly,we reject sánchez challenge to the district court subject matter jurisdiction in this case 
next we consider sánchez argument that pfizer is not immune from suit under waca.this issue arose within the context of pfizer rule b motion to dismiss,and we consider it de novo.see fitzgerald barnstable school,cir see also manager of the state ins.fund flores hermanos cement,offic.trans,characterizing an employer immunity under the waca as an absolute defense based on the complete absence of a cause of action arthur larson lex larson,larson workers comp.law,at hereinafter larson describing an employer claim of immunity in the workers compensation context as an affirmative defense.
at the outset,we,like the district court,recognize that because pfizer was not a party to fernández action before the sif,the sif decision that pagán death was not compensable under the waca does not bind pfizer.in negrón fin,offic.trans,the sif denied benefits to the beneficiaries of the decedent.the industrial commission upheld the sif decision and the beneficiaries took no further appeal.see laws providing for appeals from sif decisions to the industrial commission see also id.providing for appeals from industrial commission decisions to the courts of justice.instead,they filed a wrongful death suit against the employer in puerto rico commonwealth court.in rejecting the sif decision,the puerto rico supreme court said this about the preclusive effect of that prior decision upon the employer 
although the fund ruling denying compensation rights is final and unappealable,because the commission upholding resolution was not appealed,the employer,petitioner herein,was not a party to that administrative proceeding.the fund ruling is res judicata between the fund and the employee beneficiaries,respondents herein.but that administrative ruling can not represent a bar in the judicial ambit in order to determine its correctness to the effect of the exclusiveness,immunity clause invoked by the petitioner.since it was not a party to said action,the ruling is not res judicata as far as the petitioner is concerned.
negron,offic.trans.at.the court concluded that neither it,nor the employer,was bound by an erred ruling of the fund and the commission.id.at.similarly,neither we,nor pfizer,are bound by the sif decision that pagán death was not compensable.
as such,we assess pfizer entitlement to immunity under waca anew.we conclude the sif construed the waca scope of coverage too narrowly.lópez cotto western auto of puerto rico,no.cc,slip,wl,may,certified translation mc,best illustrates our conclusion.in that case,employees of defendant western auto locked lópez,a fellow employee,inside the men restroom at the store.lópez apparently had notified management that a lock on the outside of the restroom door attracted practical jokesters.as part of their practical joke,lópez coworkers emptied the contents of a fire extinguisher underneath the door.lópez suffered permanent pulmonary damage and stress disorder.id.at.lópez sought benefits from the sif.the sif labeled the incident a work accident,and awarded lópez compensation.
subsequently,lópez and his conjugal partner sued western auto for damages in commonwealth court.the trial court refused to dismiss the complaint on the basis of employer immunity.the puerto rico court of appeals reversed,holding western auto enjoyed immunity under waca.lópez and his partner appealed to the puerto rico supreme court,where they unsuccessfully argued that the appellate court erred when it ruled on the employer lack of intent in the abstract,without allowing discovery or permitting an evidentiary hearing.id.at.importantly,the supreme court understood the question of waca immunity to turn solely on whether western auto had intentionally caused lópez injuries 
an examination of the facts arising from the file of the case show that,at the most,the only thing that may be charged on the mentioned employer,regarding the incident occurred,is having been negligent by not having corrected the situation of the lock of the bathroom in spite of having been,allegedly,advised of it prior to the occurrence of the facts.in this kind of situation,ordinarily,the worker does not have any cause of action whatsoever against the employer.the argument of petitioners to the effect that lópez cotto was a victim of an intentional act of the employer is totally unwarranted t he most that could be charged on western auto is that it was negligent.
i n the complaint filed,the plaintiffs allege,in the alternative,that western auto is responsible for the intentional acts of lópez cotto coworkers.they are not right w hen the person who intentionally injures the employee,is not the employer,in its personal capacity or a person who is an alter ego of the employer or corporation and whether it is a mere employee or supervisor,a cause of action in damages against the employer for the acts committed by its employees is not proper.
id.at emphasis added.
in view of lópez cotto,we have little choice but to conclude that the gunman adorno mental state is only tangentially related to the question of whether pagán death was compensable under the waca certainly,sánchez has not suggested that adorno was the alter ego of pfizer.under lópez cotto rationale,sánchez,to withstand pfizer immunity defense,must establish that pfizer intentionally caused pagán death.see id.at.
larson,a leading commentator on workers compensation law,explains the usual meaning of intentional within the worker compensation context.his view is undoubtedly consistent with lópez cotto view 
t he liability of the employer can not,under the almost unanimous rule,be stretched to include the accidental injuries caused by the gross,wanton,wilful,deliberate,intentional,reckless,culpable,or malicious negligence,or other misconduct by the employer short of a conscious and deliberate intent directed to the purpose of inflicting an injury.
larson,supra,at emphasis added footnotes omitted.even if the alleged conduct includes such elements as wilfully failing to furnish a safe place to work or failing to protect employees from crime,the conduct still falls short of the kind of actual intention to injure that robs the injury of accidental character.id,at footnotes omitted.
sánchez argues,as lópez did in lópez cotto,that we should direct the district court to allow discovery on the intent issue.but sánchez alleges only that pfizer acted with intentional,negligent and reckless disregard in preventing,avoiding detecting firearms within its premises and failing to investigate and adequately supervise its workforce.fernández vargas pfizer,civ.jaf,answer to amended complaint,april,emphasis added.in other words,sánchez alleges pfizer failed to ensure a safe workplace for its employees,despite having a written policy forbidding its employees from possessing firearms on the plant premises.these allegations do not amount to a claim that pfizer,consciously and deliberately intended to cause pagán death.see larson,supra,at.perhaps like western auto in lópez cotto,pfizer was careless or indifferent to the need for a safe workplace.such nonfeasance,however,falls far short under puerto rico law of the intent required to deprive pfizer of the benefits of waca immunity.
to be sure,a worker assault upon a coworker may not be compensable if based on animosity or conflict arising out of a purely private and personal matter between the workers.see ortiz perez state ins.fund,no.ce,slip op.at,certified translation mc.but sánchez contains no allegation that some private and personal conflict between the two men motivated adorno action.the sif found that adorno was threatening pagán in a joking manner when the gun went off.none of the allegations in sánchez contradict the sif finding.sánchez alleges only that pfizer is responsible for the negligent,careless and reckless acts caused by the employee adorno.the makes no reference to adorno motivation.
adorno motive for shooting pagán,if he had one,remains unapparent and unexplained.given puerto rico courts recognition of the doctrine of neutral or unexplained assaults,which provides waca coverage in cases where an employee is injured as a consequence of an assault without an apparent and unexplainable motive,pagán death undoubtedly was compensable under the waca.and the sif erroneously held otherwise.ortiz perez,slip.op.at.consequently,the district court properly held that waca employer immunity shielded pfizer from sánchez wrongful death.
next,we address sánchez argument that the district court failure to appoint,fernández minor son,a guardian ad litem pursuant to.c voids its judgment.among other things,rule c provides that where a minor is not otherwise represented in an action,a federal court shall appoint a guardian ad litem or shall make such other order as it deems proper for the protection of the minor.the decision as to whether to appoint a special representative for a minor under rule c rests within the district court sound discretion.and we will not disturb that decision absent an abuse of discretion.see developmental disabilities advocacy,melton,cir.
state law generally governs the capacity of one to sue as a representative of another.see id.puerto rico law grants parents a wide range of rights in the exercise of patria potestas.these include the right to represent their minor children in civil litigation.see ex parte torres ojeda,offic.trans.absent some conflict of interest between a parent and child,or apparent wrongdoing on behalf of the parent,that right surely encompasses the right to decide whether to proceed with the prosecution of a civil lawsuit by weighing the attendant costs and benefits.civ.pro.prohibiting a default judgment against a minor unless such minor is represented by the father,mother,or other such representative who has appeared therein accord.b same.after all,a parent is presumed to act in the best interest of her child.see suboh district attorney office,cir.
consistent with this view,we have interpreted rule c,specifically the language not otherwise represented in an action,as permitting appointment of a guardian ad litem when it appears that the minor general representative has interests which may conflict with those of the person he is supposed to represent.melton,at internal quotations omitted.similarly,we have interpreted the district court authority to make such orders as it deems proper for the protection of the minor as encompassing situations where it is clear the interests of the parent and child conflict.id.at.
the district court implicitly recognized fernández right to act as the representative of her minor son,from the outset of this action.we seriously doubt sánchez,having no natural or other official relationship to,has any standing under rule c to challenge the nature of that representation.see id.at see also charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,at ed explaining that a court may properly refuse to appoint a guardian under rule c where the appointment is sought for ulterior reasons that have nothing to do with protecting the minor.notably,sánchez never formally moved the court to appoint a new representative.rather,sánchez claimed in her rule e motion that fernández and had some unspecified conflict of interest requiring an appointment.sánchez has provided us with only vague,unverified assertions,and we have no idea what that conflict might be 
our careful review of the documents pfizer filed in support of its summary judgment motion on fernández erisa claims indicate that fernández,in all likelihood,failed to exhaust the administrative remedies contained in pfizer plan.see madera marsh usa,cir construing erisa to require exhaustion of administrative remedies.absent evidence or a course of conduct suggesting otherwise,we presume fernández saw nothing to be gained by continuing to expend resources on a case in which she and had little chance of prevailing.we see no conflict inherent in fernández decision not to respond to pfizer motion for summary judgment,and we presume she acted in best interests.see suboh,at.thus,we reject sánchez challenge to the district court judgment based upon its failure to appoint a guardian ad litem.
lastly,we review the district court decision to enjoin sánchez commonwealth action under the anti injunction act for an abuse of discretion.see zurich american ins.superior court,cir.within this context,we evaluate the court underlying factual findings for clear error and its legal interpretation of the anti injunction act de novo.id.for our purposes,we are concerned only with the relitigation exception to the act.the anti injunction act prohibits a federal court from grant ing an injunction to stay proceedings in state court except where necessary to protect or effectuate its judgments.the words protect or effectuate in are generally viewed as incorporating the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel,which come into play only when there is a final judgment or appealable order to be protected or effectuated.see james bellotti,cir.
the relitigation exception provides that where a federal court has conclusively decided an issue,it may prevent the unsuccessful party from relitigating that same issue in state court.application of the exception reinforces the preclusive effect of federal court judgments,ensures the finality of federal court decisions,and prevents harassment through repetitive state court proceedings of those litigants prevailing in federal court.the relitigation exception applies where,because of preclusion principals,the state court should not hear a case but still may do so.see erwin chemerinsky,federal jurisdiction,at ed.
certainly,a federal court should not lightly undertake the task of deciding whether to enjoin state court proceedings.that injunctive relief may issue does not mean it must issue.see sma life assurance sanchez pica,cir.the court needs a substantial justification for issuing such injunction.id.at.and the general prerequisites for injunctive relief must usually be met.see james,at.based on concerns of comity and federalism,a federal court must ask whether requiring the moving party to raise a preclusion defense in state court would be the wiser course.at the same time,the court must remain mindful that the state court rejection of a preclusion defense effectively proscribes a federal court from issuing a subsequent injunction to effectuate its judgment.see parsons steel,first alabama bank,d holding the relitigation exception was limited to those situations in which the state court has not yet ruled on the merits of the res judicata issue.
with these precepts in mind,we decline to disturb the district court injunction in this case because it is substantially justified puerto rico employer immunity defense is of an absolute character which creates a legal immunity in favor of an insured employer against any other action in other words there is no cause of action.flores hermanos cement prod.offic.trans.at.as a defense from suit rather than a defense from liability,the immunity provided by waca is effectively lost if a case is allowed to proceed against the very employer it is designed to shield.see lowinger broderick,cir.allowing wrongful death proceedings against pfizer to continue in puerto rico commonwealth court would wrongly require pfizer to answer a claim that the law does not recognize.as such,the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that such proceedings would constitute irreparable harm to pfizer see metro goldwyn mayer,safety,cir listing the factors to be considered before issuing injunctive relief.moreover,the injunction does not harm the public interest,but rather serves the public policy of the commonwealth of puerto rico favoring the unique liability enacted by the waca.lópez cotto,slip op.at.
for all the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the wrongful death claims against adorno given those claims were sufficiently separate from fernández erisa claims.see united mine workers gibbs,d.accordingly,the district court dismissed the wrongful death claims against adorno without prejudice.see fernández vargas,d at.
while the federal rules do not provide for a motion to reconsider,a district court has the inherent power to reconsider its interlocutory orders,and we encourage it to do so where error is apparent.see warren american bankers,cir.
sánchez argument that erisa does not provide fernández a private right of action does not bear upon the district court subject matter jurisdiction,but only upon the question of whether fernández stated a cause of action under erisa.in verizon maryland,public serv.comm n,d,the supreme court rejected the argument that a law failure to provide a private right of action bears upon the district court jurisdiction to entertain suit.the court explained that,unless the claim is wholly insubstantial or frivolous or made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction,the absence of a valid as opposed to arguable cause of action does not implicate jurisdiction.id.at.section a b of erisa plainly provides that a plan participant or beneficiary may bring a civil action to recover benefits due him under the terms of the plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the pl
