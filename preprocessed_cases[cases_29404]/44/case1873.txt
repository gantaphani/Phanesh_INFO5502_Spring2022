cheryl weems and touro infirmary touro moved to remand this class action lawsuit to state court under the local controversy exception of the class action fairness act of cafa,d.the district court granted their motion to remand,and shono,specialty hospital of new orleans shono timely appealed the order.we reverse the district court judgment.
factual and procedural background 
on august,cheryl weems,individually and on behalf of her deceased mother and all others similarly situated,filed a class action petition against touro and shono in the civil district court for the parish of orleans,louisiana.weems claims involve injuries deaths allegedly caused by defects and unreasonably dangerous conditions at the medical facilities of touro and shono on august,the date of hurricane katrina.weems further contends that touro and shono failed to provide adequate transportation away from the premises after hurricane katrina made landfall.in the petition,weems proposes to certify the following class of persons 
all persons,except defendants employees,who sustained injury damage,including but not limited to,personal injury or wrongful death,as a result of unreasonable dangerous conditions defects in on the premises of touro and shono on or about august,as a result of the failure of touro and shono to attain,maintain,provide an adequate means of transportation to timely safely move persons off its premises in the wake of hurricane katrina.
on august,shono removed the action to federal court pursuant to cafa.d b.neither weems nor touro contests that shono satisfied the threshold requirements for removal.d.instead,weems and touro moved to remand the case under the local controversy exception.on december,the district court granted their motion to remand.the district court opinion reads in pertinent part that 
the court concludes that the controversy in this case is truly local inasmuch as it affects the new orleans area to the exclusion of all others.the alleged injuries occurred in louisiana,and the two defendants are louisiana corporations.further,the best evidence that is available at this time indicates that more than of the proposed plaintiff class are citizens of louisiana as to the citizenship of those who may be filing wrongful death or survival actions,shono does not challenge touro contention that seven patients died.assuming that all of their representatives are not citizens of louisiana,the number of louisiana class members would still exceed of the class.
shono sought permission to appeal,and on february,the court granted permission under c we address whether weems and shono presented sufficient evidence to establish the citizenship requirement under the local controversy exception,d a.

iii.discussion 
statutory background 
congress enacted cafa to encourage federal jurisdiction over interstate class action lawsuits of national interest.cafa contains a basic jurisdictional test,which requires a removing defendant to prove minimal diversity and an aggregated amount in controversy of or more.d.the district court can decline jurisdiction under three provisions the home state exception,d b the local controversy exception,d a and discretionary jurisdiction,d.
pursuant to the local controversy exception,the only provision at issue in this appeal,the district court shall decline to exercise jurisdiction when the action meets the following criteria 
i greater than of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate are citizens of the state in which the action was originally filed 
ii at least defendant is a defendant 
aa from whom significant relief is sought by members of the plaintiff class 
bb whose alleged conduct forms a significant basis for the claims asserted by the proposed plaintiff class and 
cc who is a citizen of the state in which the action was originally filed and 
iii principal injuries resulting from the alleged conduct or any related conduct of each defendant were incurred in the state in which the action was originally filed and 
ii during the period preceding the filing of that class action,no other class action has been filed asserting the same or similar factual allegations against any of the defendants on behalf of the same or other persons.
b.the local controversy exception 
burden of proof and evidentiary standard 
in the consolidated case,preston memorial medical center,we held that the parties moving to remand the class action to state court must prove that the cafa exceptions to federal jurisdiction divest the district court of subject matter jurisdiction.serrano connect,cir frazier pioneer ams.llc,cir.we also held that the party moving for remand must prove the statutory citizenship requirement by a preponderance of the evidence.welsh am.surety of,cir.we reasoned that congress explicitly enumerated any envisioned deviations from the general removal statute,and nothing in cafa text suggests that congress meant to impose a heightened burden of proof on parties attempting to remand a class action lawsuit to state court.
proving citizenship to defeat diversity jurisdiction 
in determining diversity jurisdiction,the state where someone establishes his domicile serves a dual function as his state of citizenship.stine moore,cir.a person state of domicile presumptively continues unless rebutted with sufficient evidence of change.acridge,at citing palazzo corio,cir.domicile requires the demonstration of two factors residence and the intention to remain.when challenged as here,the burden rest s on the plaintiff to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he was a citizen of that state.welsh,at internal citations omitted see also garcia koch oil of,cir.therefore,weems and touro must show that greater than of the putative class members were citizens of louisiana on august,the filing date of the class action petition.d citizenship of the members of the proposed plaintiff classes shall be determined for purposes of paragraphs through as of the date of the filing of the complaint.
evidence adduced to prove the citizenship requirement 
shono argues that the evidence presented by weems and touro,the addresses of the hospitalized patients,does not satisfy the local controversy exception.specifically,the medical records do not establish that on august,the date weems filed her class action petition,at least of the putative class members were louisiana citizens.touro and weems contend that the presumption of continuing domicile requires shono to demonstrate that the relocated class members,who were louisiana citizens as evinced by the medical records,do not intend to return home.
medical records 
weems made no effort to provide citizenship data,stating in her motion that plaintiffs believe that the majority of the members of this class,and certainly more than of the members are from louisiana.emphasis added.touro submitted an affidavit from sandy mccall,its director of medical records,stating that 
there were two hundred and patients present on the premises of touro infirmary,immediately before,during and immediately after hurricane katrina made landfall in new orleans on or about august.this number includes individuals who were patients of specialty hospital of new orleans shono,and kindred hospital.of the patients present on the touro premises during and immediately after hurricane katrina,two hundred and of those patients identified a louisiana address as their primary billing address and residence.
shono confirmed that of the patients listed in touro affidavit provided an orleans parish address as their primary residence.weems and touro presented no evidence,however,to demonstrate that these patients not only resided in orleans parish at the given addresses but also were domiciled in louisiana at the time of hurricane katrina.a party residence in a state alone does not establish domicile.mas perry,cir.domicile requires residence in the state and an intent to remain in the state.band of choctaw indians holyfield,d.therefore,the medical records are not tantamount to sufficient proof of citizenship.see coury,at m ere presence in a location does not constitute domicile it must be accompanied with the requisite intent.in most cases,the difficult issue is not presence but whether the intent to change domicile can be shown.
weems and touro ask this court to presume,despite the forced mass relocation of orleans parish citizens after hurricane katrina,that the patients primary billing addresses listed in the medical records accurately reflect their domicile at the time of the filing of this action,august,nearly a year after the hurricane.weems cites no authority to support her argument that the medical records serve as a proxy for domicile.see combee shell oil,cir for purposes of diversity jurisdiction,the domicile of the parties,as opposed to their residence,is the key.mas,at for diversity purposes,citizenship means domicile mere residence in the state is not sufficient.stine,at residence alone is not the equivalent of citizenship,although the place of residence is prima facie the domicile and citizenship is not necessarily lost by protected absence from home,where the intention to return remains.touro argues that proof of citizenship based on a party residence alone permits the district court to assume that a person state of residence and state of citizenship are the same unless rebutted with sufficient evidence.see kitson bank of edwardsville,wl,dist.lexis,holding that evidence of the putative class members residence creates a rebuttable presumption,and if not contested by the opposing party,then residency demonstrates citizenship for cafa jurisdictional purposes.this approach finds limited support in the case law of our sister circuits.see,hendrix new amsterdam cas,cir quoting kelleam maryland cas.of baltimore,cir i t was indicated that proof that a person is a resident of a state is prima facie evidence that he is a citizen thereof and shifts burden of showing that his domicile and citizenship are elsewhere than at the place of his residence to the party so alleging.
in state farm mutual automobile insurance company dyer,the tenth circuit held that the defendant allegation in the state court complaint that the plaintiff was a wyoming resident created a presumption of continuing residence in wyoming.cir.in determining citizenship,the court found that no contradictory evidence appears in the record before us and therefore there is a permissible inference that the plaintiff remained a wyoming resident until commencement of the action.at.based on this inference,the tenth circuit concluded that w hile there are references in the evidence to the plaintiff residence instead of his domicile and citizenship,we feel this is not fatal to jurisdiction we are not satisfied that the evidentiary showing in the record is such that the determination of diversity for jurisdictional purposes was not clearly erroneous and should be sustained.id.at citations omitted.
in denlinger brennan,the defendant listed an indiana state prison as his residence.cir.based on deposition testimony,the district court discovered that prior to his imprisonment,the defendant resided in new york state,where his wife still resided during his incarceration,and he worked as a minister from offices in elmont,new york.id.at.the seventh circuit held that s ince domicile is a voluntary status,a forcible change in a person state of residence does not alter his domicile hence the domicile of a prisoner before he was imprisoned is presumed to remain his domicile while he is in prison t he presumption articulated in sullivan is rebuttable,but on this meager record it has not been rebutted.id.at.in sligh doe,the fourth circuit reasoned that there was some affirmative evidence pointing toward virginia citizenship the license plate of a driver wherein accident occurred in virginia,not conclusive evidence by any means,but sufficient to support a finding in the absence of any contradictory proof,cir.finally,in fort knox transit humphrey,the sixth circuit concluded that upon the whole record and in the absence of any challenge to the jurisdiction,the plaintiff residence in ohio is prima facie evidence of his citizenship in that state and is not overthrown by residence in kentucky as a member of the armed forces of the united states,and there being no substantial evidence of voluntary relinquishment of an ohio domicile,cir emphasis added.here,the medical records alone show mere presence in the state.neither touro nor weems provided any additional evidence,such as vehicle registration or an extended period of residency and employment in louisiana prior to the forced evacuation prompted by hurricane katrina.see denlinger,at sligh,at.the cases cited above undeniably incorporate language amenable to an argument that the court may determine citizenship based solely on evidence of residency,but touro fails to appreciate that in these lawsuits,the moving party did not ultimately prevail just because the opposing party offered no rebuttal evidence.instead,the court considered the entire record to determine whether the evidence of residency was simultaneously sufficient to establish citizenship.even in kitson,the only case related specifically to the citizenship requirement,the class action had been pending for over two years when the district court remanded the lawsuit to state court under the local controversy and home state exceptions.wl,dist.lexis.the court noted the extensive record adduced over the course of the proceedings,and concessions from both defendants regarding the overwhelming likelihood that substantially more than of class members are illinois citizens.kitson,wl at,dist.lexis at.accordingly,weems and touro proposed approach for determining citizenship gives undue attention to the naked statements of law as opposed to the substance of the relevant opinions.based on the record,which includes only the primary billing addresses of the hospitalized patients,weems and touro still fail to establish the type of residency information reviewed in other circuits employing the presumption that a person residency forms an adequate basis for inferring citizenship unless contested with sufficient evidence.
despite the undeniably local character of this class action lawsuit,congress enumerated objective requirements for remanding a case to state court under the local controversy exception,including a citizenship requirement.weems and touro did not raise arguments pursuant to the discretionary jurisdiction provision in their remand motions to the district court.accordingly,our review entails an analysis confined to the citizenship requirement instead of the totality of the circumstances analysis applied in the consolidated case.yet even under the discretionary jurisdiction provision employed in preston,which permits district courts to weigh the local characteristics of the litigation as part of the remand determination,the movants must still prove that between and of the putative class were citizens of the state in which the suit was filed.while the plaintiffs in preston chose to rely on affidavits from a representative number of the class members and the emergency contact information of the deceased patients,parties may also produce more traditional forms of proof used to establish citizenship.
prior to cafa,the removing parties needed to show citizenship with respect to the named plaintiffs.d.in these instances,the district court could consider the places where the litigant exercises civil and political rights,pays taxes,owns real and personal property,has driver and other licenses,maintains bank accounts,belongs to clubs and churches,has places of business or employment,and maintains a home for his family.acridge,at quoting coury,at.these indicators of a person citizenship are often a mat
