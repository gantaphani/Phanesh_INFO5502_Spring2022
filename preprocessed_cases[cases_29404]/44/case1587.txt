after john wiley,a seaman,was injured aboard the tug pusher heavy line snapped and struck his tug owner,norfolk dredging company,commenced this action in admiralty to limit its liability to the value of the tug,in accordance with the limitation of liability act,app,et,and supplemental admiralty and maritime claims rule f.the district court approved the value of the tug tendered by norfolk dredging and enjoined all other actions against norfolk dredging or the pusher arising from the incident,requiring claimants to file their claims in this action.
wiley,the only person injured in the accident,filed a claim exceeding the tug value,together with a motion to dissolve the injunction and stay this action to permit him to pursue his jones act claim and related admiralty claims in state court.in support of his motion,wiley stipulated to exclusive federal jurisdiction over all limitation of liability matters,to the value of the pusher,and to norfolk dredging right to limit liability.he also committed that he would not undercut norfolk dredging limitation of liability right by asserting res judicata arguments based on any state judgment that he might obtain.wiley did not,however,agree that the value of the pusher alone was the maximum limit of norfolk dredging liability he alleged that pursuant to the flotilla doctrine,the maximum limit of norfolk dredging liability also included the value of three other vessels involved in the dredging operations when he was injured.accordingly,wiley filed a motion to increase the limitation fund to the value of all four vessels involved in the dredging operation.
resolving the tension between wiley right to bring a jones act claim in state court and norfolk dredging right to have its liability limited by a federal court under the limitation of liability act,the district court entered an order dated february,dissolving the injunction and staying this action in accordance with the principles stated in lewis lewis clark marine,d.the court found that wiley stipulations adequately protected norfolk dredging right to limit its liability.the court temporarily denied wiley motion to increase the limitation fund through the application of the flotilla doctrine,reasoning that wiley flotilla doctrine argument would become moot if a state jury awarded wiley less than the value of the pusher.the court permitted wiley to renew his motion in the limitation action,if necessary.
from the district court interlocutory order dissolving its earlier injunction,norfolk dredging filed this appeal,contending that wiley stipulations do not adequately protect its federal right to limit its liability and that,in any event,wiley waived his right to move the district court to dissolve the injunction by filing motions for affirmative relief and by pursuing discovery in this action.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dissolving the injunction and therefore affirm.
on november,norfolk dredging was dredging a docking basin at an ammunition depot in the port of sunny point,north carolina,using four vessels that it tug pusher,the tug norfolk,the hydraulic dredge charleston,and the anchor barge diadapper.wiley,a crew member on the charleston,was serving as a deckhand on the pusher when a line parted and struck him in the face,seriously injuring him.no one else was injured in the incident.
norfolk dredging commenced this action on october,to limit its liability to the value of the pusher,pursuant to the limitation of liability act,app.et.norfolk dredging claimed that the value of the pusher,a tugboat,was no greater than and tendered that amount as a limitation fund.by order dated october,the district court approved norfolk dredging proffered value and entered an injunction enjoining all suits against norfolk dredging or the pusher and directing all persons with claims arising out of the november,incident to file them in this action.
wiley filed a claim in this action seeking million as damages.he also filed a motion to increase the limitation fund,asserting that pursuant to the flotilla doctrine,norfolk dredging limit of liability should be no less than the value of all four vessels involved in the dredging operation on november.he alleged that all four vessels were working together all were owned by norfolk dredging and all were contractually engaged in a common enterprise under a single command.
wiley also filed a motion to dissolve the injunction and stay the federal proceeding to allow him to pursue his claim under the jones act before a jury in state court.to support his motion,wiley stipulated that the district court had exclusive jurisdiction to decide all limitation of liability issues that the value of the pusher was,reserving his contention that the limitation fund should also include the value of the other three vessels pursuant to the flotilla doctrine and that he was the only claimant with respect to the november,incident.he also assured the court that he would not make any res judicata argument based on a judgment in state court that he might obtain and that he would not seek to enforce any such judgment in excess of the limitation fund as determined by the district court.
the district court concluded that wiley stipulations and undertakings would adequately protect norfolk dredging limitation of liability right and accordingly granted wiley motion to dissolve the injunction,staying the federal proceeding to permit wiley to pursue his jones act claim in a separate action before a jury in either state or federal court.the court denied wiley motion to increase the limitation fund under the flotilla doctrine because the motion may be rendered moot if the claimant judgment in state court does not exceed the limitation fund as it now stands.the court agreed,however,to reconsider the flotilla doctrine argument if wiley jones act judgment were to exceed and wiley again filed the motion to increase the fund.
from the district court order of february,dissolving its october,injunction and staying this action,norfolk dredging filed this interlocutory appeal.see a.
norfolk dredging contends that the district court february,order dissolving its earlier injunction contravenes the fundamental purpose of the limitation protect shipowners rights to limited liability.because wiley never stipulated to the value of the limitation fund and therefore failed to file all of the required stipulations emphasis added,norfolk dredging argues that its right to limited liability is left unprotected.although wiley did agree that the pusher was properly valued at,he nonetheless contended that the fund should also include the value of norfolk dredging three other vessels engaged in the dredging operation at the time he was injured.norfolk dredging asserts that the district court abused its discretion in deferring its ruling on the limitation fund and staying this action and that we should reverse the district court order and direct the court to adjudicate the issues of liability and limitation.
wiley contends that the district court does not,under the principles of lewis,have to decide the limitation fund value as a condition of exercising its discretion to dissolve the injunction.he argues 
if it is necessary to come back to the limitation court to decide limitation of liability and the true amount of the limitation fund,including the flotilla doctrine,the federal district court can be relied on to make appropriate findings and decisions 
thus,the issue presented is whether the district court order permitting wiley to pursue his jones act claim in a separate action improperly denied norfolk dredging its limitation of liability right,particularly when the district court postponed making a determination of the amount of the limitation fund.we review for abuse of discretion.see lewis,at.
the jones act gives wiley the right to redress his personal injury in state or federal court,before a jury or not,as he elects.see app.consistent with this array of choices available to a jones act claimant,the admiralty jurisdiction of federal courts is limited so as to save to seamen their remedies.section of title provide
