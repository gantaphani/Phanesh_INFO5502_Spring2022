on april,plaintiff richard hatch was arrested by the middletown,rhode island police department and charged with assaulting his adopted son john doe there was immediate media interest in the arrest due to hatch impending television appearance on the reality game show survivor during its premier season.although the police initially released only a redacted copy of hatch arrest report to the press,the national enquirer soon procured hatch redacted mug shot and a copy of his son statement to the police,featuring both in an article published on may.hatch subsequently filed this and state law action against the town of middletown,shawn brown,frank kluth,barry smith,david leonard and other unnamed police officers in the united states district court,claiming fourth amendment violations arising from a false arrest and violations of his right to privacy under federal and state law.
the district court initially granted defendants summary judgment motion in part,dismissing hatch fourth amendment claim,his claim,and his state law privacy claims against all defendants except unidentified officers.with respect to the claims against captain leonard and lieutenant smith,the court determined that the individual police officers could assert qualified immunity to escape civil liability under rhode island privacy statute.the court at first denied defendants motion for summary judgment on the state law privacy claims against various unnamed police officers who allegedly released hatch mug shot and excerpts of the statement made to the police by appellant son.the judge issued an order to show cause why the case should not be dismissed since the only remaining defendants were unidentified officers.hatch failed to answer the order to show cause,and the district court dismissed the case.
hatch now appeals only his state law privacy claims against captain leonard and lieutenant smith after reviewing the record,we agree with the district court that captain leonard acted reasonably in the face of two conflicting state statutes,and further conclude that hatch has failed to establish a claim for violation of privacy against lieutenant smith under rhode island privacy statute.accordingly,we affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
the events leading up to richard hatch arrest are well documented in hatch dep t for children,youth their families hatch i,cir we briefly recount them here before turning to the period.on the morning of april,a teacher and nurse at john elementary school noticed that john had a bump on his forehead and red marks across his neck.john disclosed that he had sustained the injuries during an early morning run with his father.according to john,he was having trouble keeping the pace set by the appellant,causing him to fall to the pavement.john claimed that hatch reacted by first pulling the boy up by his earlobe and then forcing him to do pushups by grabbing his neck and pushing his head into the cement.after hearing john story,school officials contacted the rhode island department for children,youth and their families dcyf and the middletown police.two police officers brought john to the middletown police station,where he was interviewed by a dcyf caseworker and examined by a doctor.the police then contacted hatch and asked him to report to the police station.upon his arrival he was arrested and charged with assaulting his son.the next day,captain david leonard,the public information officer for the middletown police,redacted a copy of plaintiff arrest report and released it to the media.the information withheld from the report included the mug shot of the plaintiff and the identification of the child.
over the next few days captain leonard fielded requests from the local and national media for hatch arrest report and arraignment information.after the initial media blitz,lieutenant barry smith received a call from the national enquirer.he informed the enquirer that the bump on the boy head was the size of an egg.he had red marks on his neck and other bruises.a may,article reporting hatch arrest included this comment as well as the mug shot withheld from his arrest report and large excerpts of john statement to the police.lieutenant smith denied having released the mug shot or john statement to the national enquirer.although appellees concede that this release was a violation of department policy,hatch offered no evidence to implicate lieutenant smith or any other middletown police officer in the unauthorized release of these materials.
the district court granted defendants summary judgment motion and dismissed hatch false arrest and privacy claims.in this appeal,hatch challenges the district court bench ruling that the two police officers were entitled to qualified immunity given the uncertainty under rhode island law as to what information concerning hatch arrest could be released as a public record 
that would be a very difficult question because there two statutes that seem to conflict here given those conflicting statutes and given the fact that hatch privacy right under rhode island law arises from a statute that requires,among other things,that the fact be a private fact,it seems to me that it is totally unreasonable and unrealistic to expect that a reasonable officer,under these circumstances,would have recognized that releasing this information violated some right of hatch if,in fact,it did.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,kelley laforce,cir,and begin our analysis by examining the relevant rhode island statutes.
ii.discussion 
a.the dissemination of arrest information under rhode island law 
appellant bases his state cause of action on rhode island general laws b the privacy statute,which states in relevant part 
every person who subjects or causes to be subjected any citizen of this state to a deprivation violation of his or her right to privacy shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law,suit in equity,or any other appropriate proceedings for redress in either the superior court or district court of this state.
to recover civil damages for a privacy violation,the plaintiff must establish that 
a there has been some publication of a private fact 
b the fact which has been made public must be one which would be offensive or objectionable to a reasonable man of ordinary sensibilities.
for a fact to be private within the meaning of the statute,plaintiffs must demonstrate that they actually expected a disclosed fact to remain private,and that society would recognize this expectation of privacy as reasonable and be willing to respect it.pontbriand sundlun.while this standard frequently presents questions of fact,the supreme court of rhode island has categorically determined that plaintiffs have no reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to information contained in a public record i t is clear that the statutory right to privacy in rhode island does not extend to those records deemed public.doe edward sherman publ g.consequently,the critical issue in this case is whether hatch arrest report is considered a public record under rhode island law.the parties point us to two statutes that bear on the classification of this rhode island access to public records public records statute that compels the release of all arrest records,and the child abuse statute that requires all records concerning reports of child abuse to be kept confidential 
the rhode island access to public records statute 
of the two statutes that potentially govern the status of richard hatch arrest information,only the public records statute refers specifically to arrest records.see laws i d.the statute narrowly circumscribes the universe of records maintained by law enforcement agencies that are not considered public records,providing that records shall not be deemed public only to the extent that the disclosure of the records or information c could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.id.however,this provision concludes with the following caveat records relating to management and direction of a law enforcement agency and records or reports reflecting the initial arrest of an adult and the charge or charges brought against an adult shall be public.id.emphasis added.
the significance of classifying particular documents as public records under rhode island law is twofold.first,any person is entitled to review duplicate public records under reasonable conditions prescribed by the custodian except as provided in,all records maintained or kept on file by any public body shall be public records and every person or entity shall have the right to inspect copy those records at such reasonable time as may be determined by the custodian thereof.laws a.hence,sections i d and a impose an affirmative obligation on law enforcement agencies to make arrest records available to the public.second,as noted above,a determination that particular records are public is dispositive as to any privacy claims arising from the release of those records.edward sherman publ g,at.
the rhode island child abuse statute 
recognizing that certain state or federal laws may impose confidentiality requirements with respect to specific information,the public records statute places that information outside the scope of title for the purposes of this chapter,the following records shall not be deemed public s records,reports,opinions,information,and statements required to be kept confidential by federal law or regulation or state law,or rule of court.laws i s.
the rhode island child abuse statute arguably functions as such a law.without explicitly mentioning arrest records,the statute provides that a ll records concerning reports of child abuse and neglect,including reports made to the department shall be confidential except as specifically provided by this chapter laws a.the subsequent clause of the provision imposes penalties for the disclosure of these records,but limits the class of people subject to punishment any employee or agent of the department violating any of the provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor,and shall be fined not more than two hundred dollars or shall be imprisoned for not more than six months or both.laws b.
interpreting the public records and child abuse statutes 
read together,the public records and child abuse statutes are susceptible to at least three reasonable interpretations.appellees observe that i d of the public records statute classifies all records or reports reflecting the initial arrest of an adult and the charge or charges brought against an adult as public documents.they argue that because hatch arrest record clearly falls within the scope of this provision,captain leonard and lieutenant smith only divulged information that was already deemed public under rhode island law.appellees further assert that of the child abuse statute does not specifically refer to arrest records in its confidentiality provision,and by its terms in subsections a and b appears only to encompass dcyf records and personnel rather than the records of a local police department.hence,the child abuse statute does not undermine the public status of the arrest information in the records of the middletown police department.
alternatively,the language of a of the child abuse statute emphasizes that all records concerning reports of child abuse and neglect,including reports made to the department,shall be confidential laws a emphasis added.significantly,the phrase all records in a is not modified by any language restricting the confidentiality requirement to dcyf records or personnel.thus the child abuse statute might be precisely the kind of confidentiality statute contemplated by i s of the public records statute,which removes particular records from its purview if another law mandates that the records remain confidential.under this reading of the statutes,of the child abuse statute creates an exception to the final sentence of i d of the public records statute,and prohibits the release of any information concerning reports of child abuse.
hatch forgoes this hardline stance in favor of a third interpretation of the statutes.focusing on the language of i d of the public records statute,he argues that the phrase records or reports reflecting the initial arrest of an adult and charges brought against him only authorizes the disclosure of a skeletal account of the arrest consistent with the provision denial of public record status to information that could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.to the extent that any information beyond richard hatch name and a simple recitation of the charge was released to the media,hatch insists that his right to privacy was violated.
we find no guidance in the statutes or common law of rhode island to aid us in determining what level of detail runs afoul of the reflecting language in i d of the public records statute.indeed,the reasonableness of all three interpretations illustrates the difficulties faced by rhode island police officers unsure as to whether an arrest record containing a report of child abuse is considered a public record.
qualified immunity 
general principles 
we observed in hatch i that the law strives to balance its desire to compensate those whose rights are infringed by state actors with an equally compelling desire to shield public servants from undue interference with the performance of their duties and from threats of liability which,though unfounded,may nevertheless be unbearably disruptive.hatch,at quoting buenrostro collazo,cir.in the context,the united states supreme court has struck this balance by applying a test to determine whether plaintiffs may hold government officials civilly liable for alleged violations of constitutional and federal statutory rights 
a ppellate assessment of a qualified immunity claim is apportioned into two analytic components.first,if the right asserted by the plaintiff was clearly established at the time of its alleged violation,we are required to assume that the right was recognized by the defendant official,see harlow fitzgerald,d rodriguez comas,cir second,we will deny the immunity claim if a reasonable official situated in the same circumstances should have understood that the challenged conduct violated that established right,see anderson creighton,d rodriguez,at.
burns loranger,cir see also zapata,cir aponte matos toledo davila,cir.
both prongs of this standard afford government officials some degree of protection when they confront statutory ambiguity while executing their official duties.if we assume that state officers in rhode island may seek the same qualified immunity from state law actions that is available to state officials sued under,the contradictory provisions in the case at bar in the public records and child abuse statutes undermine hatch claim that his rights were clearly established with respect to the narrow question of whether police officers are prohibited from releasing arrest reports containing information of child abuse.as we observed in aponte matos,this resolution of the first prong is sufficient to support a finding of qualified immunity.aponte matos,at.alternatively,under the objective reasonable officer standard embodied in the second prong,captain leonard and lieutenant smith are strong candidates for qualified immunity given the absence of any basis for a reasonable officer to conclude that one of the three interpretations outlined above is the only correct one.
however,before we can conclude that the two police officers are entitled to qualified immunity,we must examine our earlier assumption that rhode island provides immunity in state law actions comparable to the immunity that state officers enjoy in cases,and determine whether this is actually the case.
qualified immunity under rhode island law 
although counsel for hatch conceded at oral argument that qualified immunity is available to state officers defending claims under rhode island law,there is no decision from the supreme court of rhode island expressly affording government officials common law immunity from state law claims.nonetheless,rhode island high court has left little doubt that the defense exists for state officers under certain circumstances.in pontbriand,the governor of rhode island
