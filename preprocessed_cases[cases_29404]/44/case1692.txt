appellants christus spohn health system,christus spohn health system christus spohn hospital corpus,and christus health collectively christus appeal the district court denial of their rule b motion to dismiss appellee susanna hinojosa rodriguez state law claims based on government immunity.the primary issue on appeal is whether rodriguez claims fall under the texas tort claims act.if so,defendant christus is entitled to government immunity on her state law claims and defendant john hill must be dismissed pursuant to the tort claims act election of remedies provision.the district court denied christus motion to dismiss under rule b,holding that rodriguez claims were statutory claims and therefore not covered by the tort claims act.we vacate that order but a limited claim is approved.
background 
rodriguez brought suit alleging that while receiving voluntary inpatient mental health treatment at christus spohn hospital corpus,behavioral medicine department she was sexually assaulted by a staff member,john hill hill.along with allegations of violations of the texas and united states constitutions,she pleaded causes of action against christus for violations of chapter of the texas civil practice and remedies medical liability act chapter of the texas civil practice and remedies sexual exploitation by mental health services provider act and chapter of the texas health and safety code patient bill of rights.additionally,she pleaded a cause of action against hill for assault and battery.
christus filed a rule b motion to dismiss based on immunity and election of remedies,or alternatively a motion for partial summary judgment.with one small exception,the district court denied christus b motion,ruling that christus did not have immunity from suit on rodriguez claims.the district court granted christus motion to certify its order under b.we subsequently granted their motion for leave to appeal.we,therefore,have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal pursuant to b.
ii.discussion 
we review a ruling on a.b motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.a district court may determine its jurisdiction based on the complaint alone the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts evidenced in the record or the complaint supplemented by undisputed facts plus the court resolution of disputed facts.i f the court decision rests on one of the first two of these which case the court need not decide among conflicting factual review is limited to determining whether the district court application of the law is correct and,if the decision is based on undisputed facts,whether those facts are indeed undisputed.but,if the court has relied on its own determination of disputed factual issues,we must then review those findings as we would any other district court resolution of factual must accept the district court findings unless they are clearly erroneous.
claims against christus 
as a threshold matter,the parties do not contest the district court determination that christus is a hospital district management contractor as defined by section of the texas health and safety code.since christus is a hospital district management contractor,it is entitled to governmental immunity for the purposes of chapters,and of the texas civil practice remedies code chapter is the texas tort claims act,while chapters and cover tort claims payments by local governments,and limitation of liability for public servants,respectively.and rodriguez does not claim that a tort claims act tort would be entitled to the limited waiver of immunity provided by the act where the parties part ways is on the question whether rodriguez three state law claims are torts that fall under the act.
torts falling under the tort claims act 
christus contends that the district court erred when it held that statutory claims may never fall under the tort claims act,and argues that texas courts have long applied the act to various statutory causes of action.rodriguez argues that the waiver granted to hospital district management contractors should be extremely to common law torts only to read it otherwise would essentially make these contractors a part of the government.however,the statute itself and the case law do not support her argument.
the tort claims act itself contains no language limiting its scope to common law torts.instead,the act limited waiver allows for certain actions for which a person would be personally liable to the claimant according to texas law,not texas common law also,the texas legislature placed it in title of the civil practice and remedies code,entitled liability in tort,which codifies,or makes statutory,many traditional common law torts,such as,and products.and,the legislature clearly contemplated the interplay of statutory torts with the tort claims act.for example,in chapter medical liability act,the legislature provided that in the event of a conflict between this chapter and section,or,those sections of this code control to the extent of the conflict,and specified that t his chapter does not waive sovereign immunity from suit or from liability.nor does the plain language of of the texas health and safety code,conveying governmental immunity to hospital district management contractors,limit immunity to common law torts alone 
the texas supreme court has held that causes of action based on statutes containing their own waiver of immunity do not fall under the act however,the texas supreme court has never barred all statutory claims from falling under the tort claims act.and,subsequent cases from the state courts of appeals have followed the pattern of distinguishing claims based on statutes containing independent waivers of immunity further,texas courts treat statutory torts like common law torts absent some conflicting statutory provisions we are,therefore,persuaded that statutory claims may fall under the tort claims act provided they are tort claims,and they do not contain independent waivers of sovereign immunity,and we analyze rodriguez claims accordingly.
it should be understood that the tort claims act does not create a cause of action it merely waives sovereign immunity as a bar to a suit that would otherwise exist.claims brought under the tort claims act must first be claims based on a viable theory of tort liability.so,the phrase brought under the tort claims act is merely shorthand for the fact that the government may not be sued in tort unless a separate,viable tort fits within the limited waiver provided by the act.
therefore,the question becomes whether rodriguez statutory claims sound in tort,and,if so,whether they contain an independent waiver of immunity.the tort claims act does not define tort,so we apply its commonly accepted meaning.tort liability depends on both the existence and violation of a duty statutes may create duties on which tort liability is premised not all statutory claims sound in tort,so the court must examine each claim to determine its basis.the precise nature of the claim is ordinarily identified by examining the damages alleged when the damages are purely economic,the claim sounds in contract,but a claim alleging damages for death or personal injury sounds in tort.
chapter claim 
in her first claim against christus,based on chapter of the texas civil practice and remedies medical liability act,rodriguez alleges inter alia that christus owed her a duty to keep her safe by following proper procedures for warning patients,hiring and training employees,and providing a safe environment.because of christus alleged breach of its duty,rodriguez claims that she was sexually assaulted by an employee.she seeks damages for her injury.chapter does not create a separate cause of action,but rather governs all tort claims that are considered health care liability claims as defined by the statute but even if it did create a statutory cause of action,it would sound in tort.the texas legislature classified chapter as affecting tort claims when it placed it in title of the texas civil practice and remedies code,entitled liability in tort.rodriguez chapter claim sounds in tort.additionally,chap
