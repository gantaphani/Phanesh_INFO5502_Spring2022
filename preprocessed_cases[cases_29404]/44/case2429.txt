in this sexual harassment case,defendant flying j,appeals from a jury verdict finding it liable for supervisory sexual harassment resulting in a tangible employment action.flying j argues that there was no tangible employment action when it fired but then plaintiff kyle keeton the same day and when it laterally transferred keeton to a different location.for the reasons explained below,we conclude that the termination was not a tangible employment action but that a reasonable jury could have decided that the transfer was a tangible employment action.accordingly,we affirm.
flying j operates travel plazas that cater to interstate travelers.each plaza has a restaurant.kyle keeton applied to be an assistant restaurant manager at a flying j plaza.on his employment application,he stated that he was willing to relocate to other flying j travel plazas.keeton agreed because he believed that relocation would increase his chances for advancement.keeton lived in georgia when flying j hired him,but he agreed to relocate to tennessee for training.
after he completed his training in june of,flying j assigned keeton to work as an associate manager at the walton,kentucky plaza.flying j orally committed to keep keeton at the walton store for five years.judy harrell was the general manager and his immediate supervisor.in september,harrell began making several sexual advances toward keeton,which he rejected.
even though keeton was not scheduled to work on december,harrell called him at home and asked him to come to the restaurant so that she could speak to him in person.when keeton arrived at the restaurant,harrell told him that he was fired,explaining,you not supporting me.prior to this meeting,harrell had never disciplined keeton formally or informally,had not criticized him at all during management meetings,and keeton had no warning that his job was in jeopardy.after the meeting,an assistant manager escorted keeton from the building.
keeton returned home and phoned jamal abdalla.abdalla had been the manager of the district encompassing walton when keeton was hired,but in december of abdalla was the district manager of another district that included cannonsburg,kentucky,a town miles away from walton.keeton told abdalla about the termination and that he thought it resulted from sexual harassment.abdalla called keeton back about hours later and told him that he could maintain his position as associate manager if he transferred to cannonsburg.later that same day,his termination was formally changed to a suspension,then a suspension,then to however fast keeton could get over to cannonsburg.abdalla told him that he was being reinstated.it took keeton one week to move to cannonsburg,and he was paid for that week.keeton maintained the same title,responsibilities,salary,and benefits in cannonsburg that he had in walton.keeton wife could not move with him to cannonsburg because of a debilitating back problem that resulted in serious surgery.while he was working in cannonsburg,keeton maintained two for himself and one for his wife.keeton worked at the cannonsburg flying j restaurant until,when he left for a position with another restaurant chain.
keeton filed this lawsuit against flying j for sexual harassment,retaliation,and constructive discharge under title vii and kentucky revised statute chapter.keeton alleges that he suffered from sexual harassment resulting in a tangible employment action,or alternatively that he suffered from sexual harassment resulting in a hostile work environment.the district court rejected flying j motion for summary judgment.the parties then consented to the jurisdiction of a magistrate judge for the jury trial.flying j moved for judgment as a matter of law after keeton presented his case to the jury and again after it presented its defense,but the magistrate judge denied the motions.
the jury found flying j liable only for sexual harassment resulting in a tangible employment action.following the format of the verdict form,the jury did not answer the interrogatory regarding sexual harassment with no tangible employment action.the jury answered no to the interrogatories asking if flying j was liable for retaliation or if keeton was constructively discharged.the jury awarded keeton in compensatory damages for emotional suffering,but with no back pay.flying j renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law on the grounds that keeton had failed to produce evidence that he suffered a tangible employment action,but the court again denied the motion.pursuant to,the trial court awarded keeton attorney fees and costs of as the prevailing party.
we review de novo a district court denial of judgment as a matter of law.white burlington santa fe ry,cir en banc,petition for cert.filed.in determining whether a motion should have been granted,we must review the entire record,we must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,and we may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.mccombs meijer,cir quoting reeves sanderson plumbing,d.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate where a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.fed.civ.a.
sexual harassment claims under the kentucky civil rights act and title vii are analyzed in the same manner.clark united parcel,cir.an employer liability for supervisory sexual harassment depends on the consequences of the supervisor actions.if proven sexual harassment by the supervisor did not result in a tangible employment action,then the employer may not be liable if it engaged in preventative or corrective measures and the plaintiff unreasonably failed to utilize the measures the employer provided.faragher city of boca raton,d burlington,ellerth,d.if the sexual harassment did result in a tangible employment action,the employer will be strictly liable for the supervisor sexual harassment.ellerth,at.clark,at.when a plaintiff proves that a tangible employment action resulted from a refusal to submit to a supervisor sexual demands,he or she establishes that the employment decision itself constitutes a change in the terms and conditions of employment that is actionable under title vii.ellerth,at.the ellerth court defined a tangible employment action as a significant change in employment status,such as hiring,firing,failing to promote,reassignment with significantly different responsibilities,or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.id.at.accordingly,we have stated that an employment action must be materially adverse for an employer to be strictly liable for sexual harassment.kocsis mgmt,cir 
the jury found that harrell sexually harassed keeton and that the harassment resulted in a tangible employment action.flying j argues on appeal that the termination was not a tangible employment action because it was too temporary,and that the transfer was not a tangible employment action because it was lateral.
a.the termination 
we have decided that when an employer imposes an employment action that would be an adverse employment action but then quickly reverses the action,the employee has not suffered an adverse employment action.birch cuyahoga county probate court,cir bowman shawnee state,cir.in birch,a probate court magistrate sued for race and sex discrimination under title vii and the ohio civil rights statute.at a meeting with the presiding judge after she complained about unequal pay,the presiding judge told her that he would not like her to be a magistrate any longer.birch.at.when the plaintiff asked if she was being fired,the judge told her that she was not.id.the plaintiff argued that his comment was a termination and that it was an adverse employment action under title vii.id.at.we concluded that the presiding judge remarks did not amount to an adverse action because,even if she was terminated for a moment,there was no real change in her employment status.id.
likewise,in bowman we determined that a temporary removal of responsibilities was not an adverse action.there,the plaintiff had been an instructor and the coordinator of sports studies at a university,and he alleged that his supervisor,a woman,sexually harassed him,ultimately resulting in her removing him as coordinator.at.ten days later,he was restored to his previous position and the termination letter was removed from his file.id.we held that e ven if we assume that the loss of the coordinator position constitutes a significant change in employment status,there is no tangible employment action in this case because the very temporary nature of the employment action in question makes it a adverse employment action.id.at.other courts have also held that when an otherwise adverse employment action is rescinded before the employee suffers a tangible harm,the employee has not suffered an adverse employment action.see pennington city of huntsville,cir and cases collected therein.therefore,the only reasonable conclusion the jury could have reached in this case is that keeton termination lasting only hours was not a tangible employment action.
b.the transfer 
flying j maintains that a transfer without a change in status,benefits,or salary is not a tangible employment action.we have held that reassignments without salary or work hour changes do not ordinarily constitute adverse employment decisions in employment discrimination claims.kocsis,at emphasis added.in kocsis,a nursing supervisor was reassigned as a unit nurse.there was no evidence that the new position held less prestige,earned a lower salary,demanded worse hours,or entitled her to any difference in employment related benefits of any kind.id.at.therefore,we concluded that the reassignment was not an adverse action.id.in white,a female railroad employee sued her employer for sex discrimination.after she had complained about sexual harassment committed by her immediate supervisor,she was removed from her forklift position and reassigned to a track laborer position.at.her pay and benefits were the same,but the job was dirtier,more labor intensive,more difficult,required fewer qualifications,and was considered a worse job by the other employees.id.at.we concluded that even though there was no loss in salary or benefits,the factors listed above were unique to the plaintiff situation and rendered the transfer a demotion.id.at.
in this case,keeton responsibilities in cannonsburg were not different from his responsibilities in walton.the only difference between the two positions was location,and keeton did not present any evidence that cannonsburg was objectively a worse location than walton.cannonsburg was,however,a substantial distance from walton.defendant correctly points out that koscis and white focus on the differences in job duties and not other impacts on the employee.we have not precluded consideration of such factors as commuting distance or relocation,however.in policastro northwest airlines,cir,we explicitly stated that increased distance to a work site can amount to a constructive discharge.there,the plaintiff was a sales agent living in the cincinnati area.id.at.her sales territory included louisville and lexington,kentucky,which were one hundred miles and eighty miles,respectively,from her home.id.the region comprised about forty percent of her sales,and she was required to be physically in the region four to six days per month.id.she was assigned to work the areas exclusively following a corporate restructuring,and she was expected to be physically present there four days per week.id.she was not required to relocate and chose not to,commuting instead and spending three nights per week in kentucky.id.she did not experience any change in salary,benefits,diminution in responsibilities,or a modification of her title,and the reassignment was expected to advance her career.id.at.she was unhappy with the change and resigned about ten months later.id.at.she sued her employer for sex and age discrimination,claiming that the reassignment amounted to a constructive discharge.id.
we held that the reassignment was not objectively intolerable and therefore was not a constructive discharge because t he only aspect of her job that changed was that she was required to spend her time solely in kentucky rather than splitting her time with the cincinnati market.the distance policastro had to travel did not increase,although the number of times per month that she had to travel that distance did.id.at.flying j places importance on our statement that a n employee subjective impressions as to the desirability of one position over another are not relevant to the decision of whether an employee was constructively discharged.id.flying j maintains that a dislike of a long commute or relocation is an example of the subjective desirability of a position to the employee and we therefore should disregard keeton dislike of his new location.the very next sentence after the one quoted directly above,however,is we note that increased distance from home to a new position is a factor in determining whether a constructive discharge has occurred.id.if dislike of increased commute or relocation for a new position merely represents the subjective taste of the employee,then we would not have expressly stated that increased distance is a relevant consideration.we have also considered commute distance in other decisions.in akers alvey,cir,a state employee who complained about sexual harassment was transferred to a different county office.we decided that the transfer was not an adverse employment action because there was no significant change in her pay or duties,and the transfer actually reduced aker round trip commute from her home by miles per day.id.at.we have also affirmed an eastern district of kentucky decision that held in the constructive discharge context,a lateral transfer with an added twenty minutes of commute time did not constitute a constructive discharge.darnell campbell county fiscal court,aff,cir.the district court admitted that transfer over a great distance can amount to a constructive discharge.id.at,citing christensen equitable life assurance soc y,cir.although much of our case law focuses on transfers in the context of the plaintiff effort to demonstrate a constructive discharge,we have not precluded the possibility that a transfer not rising to the level of a constructive discharge might nonetheless constitute a tangible employment action.see hollins atl,cir noting that other indices that might be unique to a particular situation can turn what would ordinarily not be an adverse employment action into one.while this jury found that keeton was not constructively discharged,it could reasonably have found that keeton transfer,which increased his commute to the extent that he needed to consider relocation,was an adverse employment action 
flying j also argues that the transfer could not have been an adverse employment action for two additional reasons keeton had agreed to relocate on his employment application,and keeton did not seek damages incurred by the transfer.keeton employment application does not negate the transfer impact on keeton because when he agreed to be transferred,he did so with the understanding that a transfer would be for advancement within the company and not as a result of unlawful sexual harassment.moreover,defendant position that keeton did not seek damages because of the transfer is disingenuous.it is based on keeton trial testimony during in response to the following question and you not claiming any damages,money damages,in this case because you were moved from walton within five years now,are you keeton answered no.the question inquired as to whether keeton was pursuing a claim for defendant failure to honor its oral commitment to keep keeton in walton for five years,not whether keeton incurred any damages because of the transfer.flying j only ground for reversal was that the jury improperly found a tangible employment action.having determined that the jury could have reasonably concluded that keeton suffered an adverse employment action,we affirm.
just last year,in white burlington northern santa fe railway,cir en banc,this court granted a rehearing en banc to clarify the proper inquiry for determining whether the victim of alleged discriminatory conduct has suffered an adverse employment action.the comprehensive opinion traced the history of the requirement,rejected a definition proposed by the eeoc and adopted by the ninth circuit,and instead reaffirmed a definition that this court had previously utilized.id.at.under that definition,a plaintiff seeking relief under title vii must demonstrate a materially adverse change in the terms of her employment.id.at citations omitted.
i believe that the majority has now muddied the waters that white had clarified,swayed by keeton sympathetic family situation and isolated dicta from cases whose actual holdings contradict the conclusion that the majority reaches.having injected keeton particular personal circumstances into the analysis,the majority takes up an argument that keeton himself had abandoned and proceeds to hold what no court in or outside of this circuit ever has that a purely lateral transfer that carries with it no change in salary,benefits,responsibilities,or prestige is an adverse employment action when undertaken as a solution to a supervisor discriminatory conduct.because i believe that white and the caselaw leading up to it call for a result contrary to the one reached by the majority today,i would reverse the decision below and remand the case to the district court with instructions to grant judgment as a matter of law in favor of flying i therefore respectfully dissent.
termination and immediate reinstatement 
i agree with the majority that an employee who is illegally discharged,but who secures immediate reinstatement without the loss of any benefits,has not suffered an adverse employment action for purposes of the federal laws.op.at.starting with the decision in kauffman allied signal,cir,this court has recognized a de minimis exception to the general rule that an adverse employment action following discriminatory conduct gives rise to employer liability under title vii.the plaintiff in kauffman was a female machine operator who took medical leave to undergo breast enhancement surgery,and who was harassed by her male supervisor upon returning to work.when she told her supervisor that she had had enough of his overtures,he briefly assigned her to a manual machine that was difficult to operate and that was called torture by other employees.this court rejected the company argument that an adverse employment action must be economic in nature,but remanded the case to the district court because the transfer might fall into a de minimis exception for temporary actions,such as where further remedial action is moot and no economic loss occurred.id.at.
our decision in bowman shawnee state university,cir,on which the majority properly relies,is an application of the principle first articulated in kauffmann.the plaintiff in bowman was the coordinator of sports studies at a university,and he claimed that a female dean had stripped him of his duties as coordinator after he resisted her sexual advances.ten days after the dean actions,however,the school provost rescinded the dean decision and removed the termination letter from bowman personnel file.this court held that the removal from the coordinator position,with no loss in salary or benefits,was properly characterized as a de minimis employment action that does not rise to the level of a materially adverse employment decision.id.although the loss of coordinator responsibilities might be materially adverse if permanent,the court said that the very temporary nature of the action placed it within the de minimis exception carved out by kauffman.at.
the majority,therefore,correctly concludes that bowman disposes of keeton argument that a temporary termination,even if followed by immediate reinstatement,comprises an adverse employment action.our unanimous conclusion on this point should,in my opinion,end our review of the present case because the termination theory of liability is the only one that keeton advanced in his appellate brief.see radvansky city of olmsted falls,cir stating the general rule that failure to raise an argument in an appellate brief constitutes a waiver of the argument on appeal citation omitted.
but instead of deciding the present case on the best and narrowest ground available,air courier conference american postal workers union,d stevens,concurring in the judgment,the majority reaches out and affirms the jury verdict on the basis of a theory that even keeton does not defend.this theory of a purely lateral transfer can constitute an adverse employment action when undertaken as a solution to a supervisor unlawful from existing caselaw and the policies underlying title vii.
ii.lateral transfer 
i begin with this court recent en banc decision in white,where the court reaffirmed that,i n this circuit,kocsis cir is the seminal case for defining an adverse employment action.white,at.the supreme court relied in part on kocsis in describing an adverse or tangible employment action as a significant change in employment status,such as hiring,firing,failing to promote,reassignment with significantly different responsibilities,or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.id.at citing burlington indus.ellerth,d emphasis added.
kocsis provides guidance beyond the supreme court brief description in burlington industries.the kocsis court looked to cases from the seventh circuit and joined that circuit in concluding that victims of prohibited discrimination must prove that they have suffered a materially adverse change in the terms or conditions of their employment because of their employer conduct.koscis,at citing spring sheboygan area sch,cir emphasis in original.although outright termination is a materially adverse change,reassignments without salary or schedule changes do not constitute adverse employment actions unless they carry with them a decrease in wage or salary,a less distinguished title,a material loss of benefits,significantly diminished material responsibilities,or other indices that might be unique to a particular situation.koscis,at citing crady liberty bank and trust,cir.these business decisions may be adverse employment actions,white,at,but only if they are more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities.kocsis,at citing crady,at.
the kocsis court borrowed extensively from the seventh circuit decision in spring.there,a school principal was transferred to a new position farther away from her home.she sued the school board under the age discrimination in employment act adea,alleging that she had been transferred on account of her age.spring,at.observing that the only negative aspect of spring new job assignment was that she would have to travel farther from home to get to work,id.at,the seventh circuit held that spring had not suffered an adverse employment action.increased commute time alone did not suffice to show a materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of spring employment.id.
another adea case in the educational area makes the same point.in sanchez denver public schools,cir,a longtime school teacher was transferred to a different elementary school when enrollment at her current school declined.the location of the new school increased sanchez commute time from between five and seven minutes to between thirty and forty minutes.id.at.sanchez sued the school district under title vii and the adea,alleging that she had been transferred because of her age and her gender.in affirming the grant of summary judgment in favor of the school district,the tenth circuit emphasized that sanchez salary and benefits remained the same,that she retained the same job and responsibilities,and that neither the increased commute time nor other special circumstances demonstrated that this employment action was anything beyond a mere inconvenience or alteration of responsibilities.id.
similarly,the transfer in the present case did not alter the terms or conditions of keeton employment at flying j.he retained his status and responsibilities as an assistant manager and continued to enjoy the same salary and benefits that he had received prior to the transfer.the new job was,as the magistrate judge described it,virtually identical to his previous position in walton,kentucky.because the transfer left keeton employment status unaltered,burlington industries,at,he simply did not suffer an adverse employment action.
what must drive the majority contrary conclusion,then,is one of two theories,both of which are unsupported by existing law.one theory rests on the fact that the distance of keeton transfer was greater than that of the transfers in cases like spring and sanchez,cases the majority does not even cite.the second theory stems from the majority apparent belief that flying j solution to the discriminatory conduct of keeton supervisor,combined with keeton own personal circumstances,convert an otherwise permissible employment decision into an adverse one.these two theories will be addressed in turn.
a.a longer commute does not constitute a material change in the terms or conditions of employment 
first,the principle that the majority appears to employment decisions increasing commute time can,in and of themselves,be materially adverse if undertaken as a solution to a supervisor discriminatory little basis in our caselaw.as the majority acknowledges,none of our cases has ever found that increased commute time,standing alone,transforms an otherwise lawful lateral transfer into an adverse employment action.
this court,for example,affirmed a district court opinion holding that an increase of minutes in commute time amounted to neither a constructive discharge nor an adverse employment action.darnell campbell county fiscal court,aff,cir unpublished.more recently,in policastro northwest airlines,cir,this court rejected a plaintiff claim that she suffered an adverse employment action when her employer required her to travel to cities and miles from her home four days per week,instead of four days per month.the policastro court refused to rely on the plaintiff subjective displeasure over the airline business decisions,instead concluding that the increased travel time each month did not render the terms or conditions of her employment objectively intolerable.id.
two unpublished cases from this circuit add to the steady stream of authorities holding that increased travel time is insufficient to render a transfer an adverse employment action.one is nelson general electric company,cir unpublished,where the company was reducing its staff at one facility and offered the plaintiff a position at another.the new position would have required her to commute miles to work each day.this court held that a longer commute with the same job title,salary,and benefits is not an adverse employment action.id.at.in the other case,an interviewer at a public defender office in ohio was transferred from the adult division to the juvenile division,requiring her to spend additional time driving between county buildings.smith county of hamilton,cir unpublished.this court again relied on darnell and held that the increased travel time did not amount to a materially adverse change.id.at.
beyond lacking support in the caselaw,the majority disposition suffers from subjective problems.this disposition is inconsistent with prior cases that examine the effect of an employment decision on a reasonable person.see policastro,at.if a increase in daily commute time,an extra miles of driving on additional days per month,and a increase in a daily commute are not objectively intolerable changes in the terms and conditions of employment,what makes the transfer in the present case an adverse employment action see darnell.at policastro,at.and if the transfer had been to a location,say,miles away,would the change in keeton employment status still be materially adverse kocsis,at see sanchez,at finding no adverse employment action despite a potential increase in commuting time spring,at finding no adverse employment action where increased travel time to work was the only negative consequence of an employee transfer nelson.at holding that a increase in commuting distance did not constitute an adverse employment action where the employee retained the same job title,salary,and benefits.when,in other words,would a reasonable person need to consider relocation op.at.the majority has not articulated answers to these questions.
in the face of the consistent and compelling authorities cited above,the majority relies on a single sentence in policastro stating that courts can consider increased commuting distance as a factor in determining whether a constructive discharge has occurred.op.at citing policastro,at emphasis added.but the jury ruled against keeton on his constructive discharge claim,so the only issue before us is whether keeton suffered an adverse employment action.i therefore find the statement from policastro on which the majority relies unpersuasive for two reasons.first,the majority has cited no authority for the proposition that something that is only one factor in the inquiry can,in and of itself,constitute an adverse employment action.second,even if that proposition had legal support,the jury whose verdict the majority affirms in the present case found that the transfer did not rise to the level of a constructive discharge.as a consequence,neither the holding in policastro nor the principle that the majority extracts from that case supports the majority conversion of one factor in the analysis into the sole basis for finding an adverse employment action.
this is not to say that lateral geographic transfers can never amount to a constructive discharge and therefore satisfy the requirement.assume,for example,a hypothetical case where the employer repeatedly ships its employee to different locations,ordering another transfer each time the employee settles in at the new location.a jury under such circumstances might reasonably conclude that the continuous transfers created an objectively intolerable working situation.but this hypothetical neither bolsters the majority analysis nor helps keeton,because his theory was specifically rejected by the jury.
the majority next resorts to the general statement,made in yet another case finding no adverse employment action,that this transfer falls into the category of other indices that might be unique to a particular situation.op.at citing hollins atl,cir.but these other indices,which this court also mentioned in white,at,refer not to the plaintiff personal or family situation,but instead to the terms and conditions of employment.kocsis,at quoting spring,at.that much is clear from the context of this court first use of the other indices language in kocsis.see at quoting crady,at.
in kocsis,the quoted language appeared at the end of a list of employment actions short of termination that would nevertheless qualify as adverse.because that list,like most,was not meant to be exhaustive,the court added the category of other indices unique to a particular situation,a type of meant to include employment decisions that,although not universally recognized as negative,would likely be viewed as adverse by an employee in a particular setting.see,molnar booth,cir applying crady and concluding that a school principal act of taking away the supplies of an art teacher constituted an adverse employment action because the supplies were necessary for her to be able to perform her assigned job.
what,then,are the other indices unique to keeton situation that convert an otherwise legitimate lateral transfer into an adverse employment action the majority discussion seems to turn on three factors that keeton transfer was a direct result of unlawful discriminatory conduct on the part of his supervisor that keeton wife suffered from a back problem that prevented her from accompanying him to cannonsburg and that keeton chose to maintain two residences,one in each town.
the first factor,however,is common to all cases brought under federal laws.that is,all plaintiffs in sexual harassment suits brought under title vii necessarily must allege that their employers subjected them to discrimination because of their sex.see prohibiting discrimination because of an individual race,color,religion,sex,or national origin oncale sundowner offshore services,d observing the title vii is directed at discriminat ion because of sex citation omi
