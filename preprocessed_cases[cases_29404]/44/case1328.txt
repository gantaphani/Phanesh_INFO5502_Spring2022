this appeal in a bivens action arose out of an international child custody dispute.aniko kovacs,a citizen and resident of hungary,wanted to regain custody of her son,oscar jonathan egervary oscar.the father,oscar egervary egervary,had taken oscar from hungary to pennsylvania without kovacs permission.frederick rooney,a private attorney acting at the request and with the assistance of state department officials,agreed to represent kovacs in a proceeding to regain custody of oscar.pursuant to the international child abduction remedies act icara,et,rooney presented a petition to a united states district judge at an ex parte hearing.during this hearing,rooney argued successfully for the issuance of an order permitting him to enlist the aid of local law enforcement officials and marshals in seizing and removing oscar from the united states without notice to egervary.it is now clear that minimal due process required notice and an opportunity to be heard.for that reason,the ex parte order was unconstitutional insofar as it permitted oscar removal from the united states without providing egervary with either a pre or hearing.
as a result of his son removal,oscar egervary brought a bivens action to recover monetary damages from rooney as well as from his associate,james burke,his local counsel,jeffrey nallin,and the two state department officials,virginia young and james schuler,who assisted rooney in this matter the district court granted summary judgment to nallin but found triable issues as to the other four defendants.we granted permission to appeal.because the order entered by the district judge in the underlying icara proceeding was a superseding cause of egervary injury,we conclude that egervary is unable to establish in this bivens suit that the actions of the defendants in the custody proceeding proximately caused his harm.thus,we will reverse the district court denial of summary judgment to rooney,burke,young,and schuler,and we will affirm on alternative grounds its grant of summary judgment to nallin.
plaintiff oscar egervary is a native of hungary,who emigrated to the united states in and became a citizen in.he became romantically involved with fellow hungarian aniko kovacs in while she was studying in the united states.they were married in hungary in and established their residence in new jersey.their son,oscar,was born in new jersey in july.
in february,kovacs took oscar with her on a trip to hungary.although they were scheduled to return to the united states in early april,kovacs twice delayed the return trip and then informed egervary that neither she nor oscar would return at all.after attempts to reconcile the relationship had failed,kovacs sent a farewell letter to egervary in september,stating that she and oscar were moving to an undisclosed location within hungary.in december of that year,egervary went to budapest and located kovacs and oscar.he took oscar from kovacs,against her will,and returned with him to monroe county,pennsylvania.
kovacs instituted legal proceedings in hungary seeking oscar return.as a result,the hungarian government contacted the state department in order to obtain its assistance.on or about may,young,a member of the state department bureau of consular affairs,asked rooney to file an icara petition on behalf of kovacs.by his own admission,rooney was not extremely on the hague.nevertheless,he agreed to represent kovacs pro bono.during the course of this representation,rooney was in regular contact with officials at the state department and routinely received assistance from them.the assistance provided by the federal defendants included,inter alia,providing the attorney defendants with copies of hungarian governmental and court documents related to the case,as well as model icara pleadings published by the american bar association information regarding oscar location and advice on the proper preparation of the icara pleadings.rooney did not have any direct contact with his client,kovacs.
the model pleadings rooney received from the federal defendants contained three separate proposed orders,all of which provided for an ex parte proceeding prior to the seizure of the child,followed by a hearing at which the alleged could be heard.although rooney used the model pleadings as the basis for his icara petition,he added a fourth option that would permit law enforcement officials to take oscar into protective custody and deliver him to rooney for immediate return to the physical custody of kovacs.thus,the fourth option did not provide for a hearing.
the attorney defendants filed the icara petition in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania on may.the petition contained all four proposed orders.in presenting the petition to the district court during the ex parte proceeding,rooney argued for the fourth option,the one he had drafted himself and the only one that did not call for a hearing prior to oscar removal from the united states.
no court reporter was present during the ex parte proceedings so that no transcript exists.however,both rooney and the judge were deposed in connection with the bivens action,and both discussed their recollection of what transpired.although rooney and the judge agree on most points,some discrepancies exist.
specifically,both generally agree that the judge expressed reservations as to whether he had the authority to grant the fourth option,whether he could order that the child be removed from the united states without providing at least a hearing for the father.in view of this doubt,rooney then called the state department from the judge chambers during a break in the proceedings.rooney spoke to schuler and asked him whether the judge had the authority to issue such an order.according to rooney deposition testimony,schuler said something to the effect,he the judge.he can do whatever he feels is appropriate.based on this representation from schuler,rooney apparently told the judge that rooney believed the judge did in fact have the legal authority to enter such an order.
the discrepancies between rooney and the judge accounts do not involve any factual aspect of the custody matter but only the legal limits of the judge ability to act on the undisputed facts.the discrepancies center around the discussion of the icara pleadings and the representations made by rooney regarding his relationship and contacts with the state department.with respect to the icara pleadings,rooney states that he and the judge discussed all four alternatives and that the judge mentioned that it was friday and it might be difficult to contact anyone from child protective services to take custody of oscar.rooney also states that he told the judge that,if the fourth option was granted,rooney would personally take oscar to hungary.however,the district court in this bivens action has summarized the judge testimony as follows rooney portrayed himself as representing the state department stated that he was seeking to have the judge enforce a hungarian court order had already made arrangements to return the child to hungary that day and never suggested any remedy that would require the judge to conduct a hearing on the matter.
in addition,the judge has stated that,although the other three options all of which provided for an ex parte proceeding before the seizure of the child and then a hearing were contained in the papers,they were not discussed by rooney,who argued only for the fourth option.the judge also stated that he selected the fourth option based on what he believed to be the state department representation,made through rooney,that he had the legal authority to do so 
and as i it too much trust,but you inclined to rely on the expertise of a federal department that purportedly has expertise in that area.but i did have qualms about it.i mean,i just did sit down and sign it.i said i want you to get an assurance that this is the appropriate thing to do.
despite these concerns,the judge eventually entered an order selecting the fourth option,directing law enforcement officers to take into protective custody oscar jonathan egervary and deliver him to petitioner agent for immediate return to the physical custody of petitioner hereinafter the order.
once the order had been signed by the judge,rooney and burke sought out marshals to execute it.upon arriving at the district marshal office,rooney placed a call to the state department to notify them of what had transpired.rooney and burke then followed the deputy marshals to egervary residence but did not enter the home with them.when oscar had been removed from the residence,he was placed in rooney car and driven to newark international airport.according to burke testimony,rooney was in constant contact with the state department both during the trip to the airport and throughout the rest of the day.
during the trip to the airport,rooney also contacted lori mannicci,an associate in his office,and asked her to arrange for oscar return to hungary.this not only involved making the necessary travel arrangements,but also obtaining permission from the state department to remove oscar from the united states without a passport.according to mannicci testimony,she does not remember either the name of the person with whom she spoke or the content of their conversation.however,she does have handwritten notes from the conversation that include young home phone number.once the passport waiver was obtained,rooney flew with oscar to frankfurt,germany.kovacs met them there,and rooney turned over custody of oscar to her at that time.
following oscar removal from the united states,egervary filed a motion for reconsideration of the order.egervary subsequently withdrew this motion and filed the bivens action.
ii.procedural history 
egervary filed his original complaint in the united states district court for eastern district of pennsylvania on april.pursuant to bivens,he seeks compensatory and punitive damages,together with interest,attorney fees,and costs from defendants young,schuler,rooney,burke,nallin,and john does one through ten the john does are alleged to be agents or representatives of the state department.the complaint contained both a substantive bivens claim alleging that the defendants violated egervary fifth amendment due process rights by taking custody of his son without a hearing,and a conspiracy count.
the federal defendants filed a motion to dismiss and to stay discovery.on january,the district court stayed discovery but declined to rule on the motion to dismiss because of concerns as to whether venue was appropriate in the eastern district of pennsylvania.the court therefore granted egervary leave to file a motion to transfer the case to the middle district of pennsylvania pursuant to a within days,noting that the court would grant the federal defendants motion to dismiss if egervary failed do so.
egervary timely moved to transfer.on april,the case was transferred to the middle district and assigned to the judge who had issued the order in the icara matter.however,it soon became clear that that judge might be called as witness.thus,all of the judges in the middle district recused themselves,and a district judge from the district of delaware was designated to hear the case.
the federal defendants again moved to dismiss the claims asserted against them,and this motion was granted by the new judge on august.following the dismissal of these defendants,egervary filed an unopposed motion to have the case transferred back to the eastern district of pennsylvania pursuant to.this motion was granted and a new district judge was assigned to the case.
once back in the eastern district of pennsylvania,the attorney defendants moved for summary judgment.they asserted that there was no violation of egervary due process rights and that,even if such a violation had occurred,his bivens claim against them failed on grounds of waiver,collateral attack,lack of damages,and immunity.
the district court denied the motion on january,concluding that minimal due process required that egervary be given either a pre or hearing.in the order accompanying the january opinion,the court gave the attorney defendants twenty days to submit briefs explaining why the court should not enter summary judgment in favor of egervary with respect to the issue of liability.in reply,the attorney defendants asserted that they were not acting as federal agents and,in the alternative,that their defense of good faith precluded summary judgment.
relying upon our decision in jordan fox,rothschild,frankel,cir,the district court august,opinion focused on the attorney defendants participation in the execution of the order.the court concluded that nallin was not acting as a federal agent because he did not participate in the execution of the order.however,because rooney and burke did participate in the order execution,the district court ruled that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that they were acting as agents of the federal government during the commission of the acts which were at the heart of the due process violation suffered by egervary.the court further held that,pursuant to jordan,rooney and burke could assert a good faith defense to the claims asserted by egervary.finally,the court concluded that the issue of good faith presented a jury question so that the issue of liability could not be resolved at the summary judgment stage.
discovery continued and rooney and burke were both deposed,with rooney testimony revealing a number of facts not previously known to either egervary or the court.specifically,rooney testified that 
defendant young asked rooney to represent kovacs and sent him hungarian government documents regarding the alleged abduction and model icara pleadings while he was preparing the icara petition he consulted with the state department a bunch of times someone from the state department had called the judge office that morning to inform the court that a petition was going to be filed he spoke with schuler while he was in the judge chambers in order to confirm that the child could be removed from egervary custody and returned to hungary without a hearing and the state department arranged for a waiver of the child passport so that he could be removed immediately from the country.
based on this new evidence,egervary moved for leave to amend his complaint to again include the federal defendants,asserting that there was no longer any basis for their dismissal from the case.the district court granted this motion on march.
egervary filed his amended complaint on march.the federal defendants again moved to dismiss and,prior to receiving a ruling on this motion,also moved for summary judgment based on their lack of personal involvement in the actions giving rise to egervary claim.
the district court september,opinion rejected the federal defendants arguments and denied their motion for summary judgment.a subsequent order issued on january,denied the federal defendants motions to dismiss and for summary judgment for the reasons stated in the september,opinion.
the district court then certified the following orders for immediate appeal pursuant to b the january,order denying the federal defendants motions to dismiss and for summary judgment the january,order denying the attorney defendants motions for summary judgment the august,order granting summary judgment as to nallin and denying egervary motion for summary judgment with respect to the issue of liability the march,order granting egervary leave to file an amended complaint reasserting his claims against the federal defendants and the march,order denying the federal defendants motion for reconsideration of the march,order.
on january,the federal defendants appealed the district court january,order denying their motions to dismiss and for summary judgment with respect to the issue of qualified immunity.subsequently,on january,they filed a petition for permission to present additional issues on appeal pursuant to b.egervary filed a similar petition the same day,and the attorney defendants filed a petition for permission to appeal three days later.on march,the clerk office consolidated the three petitions for permission to appeal and submitted them for our review.on april,we granted the petitions and each appeal was then transferred to the general docket these three appeals were then consolidated and submitted to us for decision on the merits.
iii.jurisdiction 
these consolidated appeals involve a cause of action brought to remedy alleged constitutional violations pursuant to the supreme court decision in bivens.as such,the district court exercised subject matter jurisdiction over this case pursuant to.we have jurisdiction over the federal defendants appeal of the district court decision regarding qualified immunity pursuant to.our jurisdiction over the remainder of the issues certified for appeal is premised on b.
as the text of b indicates,appellate jurisdiction applies to the order certified to the court of appeals,and is not tied to the particular question formulated by the district court.pollice national tax funding,cir citation and internal quotations omitted.thus,w e may address any issue fairly included within the certified order because it is the order that is appealable,and not the controlling question identified by the district court.id.quoting abdullah american airlines,cir see also ivy club edwards,cir.this plainly includes the threshold question of whether egervary has established a prima facie case under bivens.
iv.standard of review 
where,as here,we have jurisdiction to review an order rejecting qualified immunity at the summary judgment stage,our review of the order is plenary.eddy virgin islands water power,cir.we similarly exercise plenary review over all other issues decided on summary judgment.chisolm mcmanimon,cir.in so doing,we apply the same test applied by the district court.id.thus,s ummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.quoting.c.
discussion 
defendants raise a number of defenses to the claims asserted against them,including lack of venue,waiver,absolute immunity,qualified immunity,and good faith.however,we need not reach any of these issues,as we conclude that egervary,by failing to demonstrate proximate cause with respect to any defendant,has failed to establish an essential element of his claim 
we begin our analysis with the principle that,because bivens actions are simply the federal counterpart to claims brought against state officials,see brown philip morris,cir,and because tort law causation analysis serves as the basis for determining causation in actions,see hector watt,cir citing hedges musco,cir,tort law causation must govern our analysis of this bivens claim.thus,as in any tort case,egervary must demonstrate that defendants actions were the proximate cause of the harm he suffered.
traditionally,in tort law,proximate cause has been defined as a person wrongful conduct which is a substantial factor in bringing about harm to another.see restatement second of torts.however,an intervening act of a third party,which actively operates to produce harm after the first person wrongful act has been committed,is a superseding cause which prevents the first person from being liable for the harm which his antecedent wrongful act was a substantial factor in bringing about.see restatement second of torts.
this concept has been recognized in cases such as the one before us.courts have held that,under certain circumstances,the actions of a judicial officer may sever the chain of causation.for example in hoffman halden,cir,overruled in part on other grounds,cohen norris,cir,the plaintiff alleged that the defendants had violated his civil rights by wrongfully committing him to a state mental institution.in examining the proximate cause issue,the court held that it was the order of the court,not the preliminary steps taken to obtain it,that was the proximate cause of the injury 
in a civil rights conspiracy case,the injury and damage must flow from the overt acts.where the gravamen of the injury complained of is commitment to an institution by court order,this order of the court,right or wrong,is ordinarily the proximate cause of the injury.various preliminary steps occur before the order is made.these preliminary steps may range from such matters as filing of petitions to the various clerical and procedural activities which lead to the order.in the ordinary case,the order is made after a hearing in court or after consideration by the court of the supporting documents and evidence.therefore,the various preliminary steps would not cause damage unless they could be said to be the proximate cause of the injury.in the usual case,the order of the court would be the proximate cause and the various preliminary steps would be remote causes of any injury from imprisonment or restraint under the court order.
at emphasis added.
over time,the law in this area has developed around the general principle that the decision of an independent intermediary will only constitute an intervening cause if the decision is genuinely free from deception or coercion.hector,at citing cases from the second,fifth,seventh,eleventh,and circuits nygaard,concurring.
we had an opportunity to consider this issue,albeit in a somewhat different context,in hector.there,the plaintiff,following the suppression of evidence seized by pennsylvania state troopers and the dismissal of charges against him,brought a action against the troopers based on their alleged violation of his fourth amendment rights.see at.the troopers asserted several defenses to these claims,including the argument that the independent decisions of the prosecutor and grand jury to indict the plaintiff were superceding or intervening causes that broke the causal connection between the fourth amendment violation and hector subsequent expenses in mounting a legal defense.id.at.
although judge nygaard would have reached the proximate cause issue in hector,see id.at nygaard,concurring,the majority found it unnecessary to do so in view of its resolution of the other arguments raised by the defendants,electing instead to leave a more thorough analysis of our stance with respect to the relevant proximate cause question for another day.see id.at.because the threshold inquiry into proximate cause is outcome determinative in this case,we now accept the invitation to delve deeper into this issue.in so doing,we begin,as judge nygaard did in hector,with the fifth circuit court of appeals decision in hand gary,cir.
hand involved allegations of malicious prosecution against a deputy sheriff.the fifth circuit court of appeals,rejecting the plaintiff claim,held that even an officer who acted with malice in procuring the warrant or the indictment will not be liable if the facts supporting the warrant or indictment are put before an impartial intermediary such as a magistrate or grand jury,for that intermediary independent decision breaks the causal chain and insulates the initiating party.id.at quoting smith gonzales,cir.however,as the ninth circuit did in hoffman,the fifth circuit in hand cautioned that,in order for the chain of causation to be broken,the independent intermediary must be presented with all of the facts a ny misdirection by omission or commission perpetuates the taint of the original official behavior.id.at.applying this ruling to the facts presented in hector,judge nygaard concluded that the chain of causation had been broken and that the officers should not be held liable for damages incurred following the initial detention.see hector,at nygaard,concurring.
egervary contends,however,that if we rule that the ex parte order constituted a superseding cause,our decision would run counter to the supreme court decision in malley briggs,d.malley was a action in which plaintiffs claimed that a state trooper,in applying for warrants to arrest them,had violated their rights under the fourth and fourteenth amendments because the complaint and supporting affidavit failed to establish probable cause.the district court directed a verdict for the trooper because the act of the judge in issuing the arrest warrants had broken the causal chain between the filing of the complaint and the arrests and because the trooper was
