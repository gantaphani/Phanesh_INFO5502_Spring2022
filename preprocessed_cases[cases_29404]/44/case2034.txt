in this negligence action under the federal employer liability act fela,union pacific railroad company union pacific appeals the district court denial of its alternative motions for judgment as a matter of law or new trial following a jury verdict in favor of railroad employee rene rivera on his personal injury claims.for the following reasons,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
rivera fela action against union pacific claimed that he sustained a herniated disk on july,as a result of the railroad failure to provide him with a safe work place by assigning him to a task which it knew or should have known was beyond rivera physical capabilities.at the time of the incident in question,rivera was employed by union pacific as a track welder.his job responsibilities included destressing rails,a process through which sections of the track that have bowed are restored to their original form in order to avoid derailments.destressing involves cutting out small portions of the bowed rail,rewelding the rail,and smoothing the edges of the repaired section with a rail shear.the physically demanding task requires repeated bending,stooping,pulling,pushing,and lifting loads weighing in excess of to pounds.
at some point in early june,rivera began noticing pain in his lower back and groin,which became progressively worse.on june,rivera filled out an accident report and informed his supervisor,leroy nettles,that he was suffering from lower back and groin pain.that same day,rivera went to abilene regional hospital,where a doctor diagnosed his condition as low back strain.rivera back and groin pain persisted.on july,rivera sought advice from a chiropractor,who wrote a note recommending that rivera be restricted to moderate work status at this time n o heavy lifting,pushing or pulling.the july note further stated that rivera was to be in to days.when rivera presented the note to nettles,nettles requested clarification of the term moderate.accordingly,rivera returned to the chiropractor and obtained a second note dated july.that note restricted rivera to to hours of work a day,and specified no heavy lifting,pushing,or pulling not to exceed to pounds.the note further stated that the restrictions are expected to last until at least.although rivera testified that he showed nettles the second note,nettles denied that he ever saw it.
the following day,july,rivera went to the emergency room in abilene,where he was again diagnosed with low back strain.lynn barlow,who examined rivera,gave him a note instructing that he do no lifting for days find a doctor for further care on monday,and with a doctor if his groin pain persisted.rivera testified that he gave the note to nettles.at nettles urging,rivera then decided to use the one week he had remaining of his vacation time to rest.
rivera testified that upon his return to work on july,he informed nettles that his back was still sore.though nettles claimed at trial that rivera said he felt fine,nettles also testified that he told rivera that as far as he was concerned,rivera was still on restricted duty.nonetheless,according to rivera,nettles directed rivera to go to ranger and destress a rail there will be a gang out there to help you.rivera did so,and worked a full day without incident.the next day,july,nettles again assigned rivera to a destressing project.during the course of this task,rivera attempted to pick up a rail shear with the assistance of mark lucky.the rail shear weighed pounds,but the pair had difficulty prying the shear from the track and had to pull on the shear.rivera testified that at the moment the rail shear came loose,he heard a loud pop noise and felt sharp,burning pain in his lower back,causing him to collapse to the ground in pain.the other union pacific crew members improvised a back board and stretcher to carry rivera to a crossing where he was met by an ambulance.at the hospital,rivera was given steroid shots and released.
on july,robert legrand,a neurosurgeon,diagnosed rivera with a herniated disk between and.approximately six months later,after attempts at conservative treatment did not alleviate rivera condition,legrand performed surgery on rivera back.
on march,rivera brought this fela action against union pacific,seeking damages for his groin and back injury under a theory of negligent assignment.at trial,union pacific orally moved for judgment as a matter of law when rivera rested and at the close of evidence,arguing that no evidence supported submission of the issue to the jury for the reason that there was no medical restriction limiting rivera on july.the district court denied both motions and submitted the issue to the jury.the jury found both sides negligent,attributing fault to union pacific and the balance to rivera,and awarded rivera,primarily for lost earning capacity.rivera moved for judgment for,conceding that there was no evidence supporting certain expenses for which the jury had awarded damages.union pacific renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law and alternatively moved for a new trial,asserting that it was not negligent,that rivera had a herniated disk prior to the july lifting incident,and that no evidence supported the jury findings.the trial judge denied both motions and rendered judgment in the amount requested by rivera,plus interest at a rate.the trial judge also denied union pacific subsequent motion for a new trial,but granted the railroad motion to modify the judgment and issued a nunc pro tunc judgment reducing interest to.union pacific timely filed notice of appeal.
