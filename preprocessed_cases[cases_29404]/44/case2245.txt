when the enterprise,a large cargo ship,positioned itself to receive a load of coal on the shores of lake erie,it struck a machine operated by bessemer lake erie railroad company and the pittsburgh conneaut dock company.bessemer and its affiliate filed this admiralty action against the enterprise and its owners and operators,seaway marine transport,upper lakes shipping and upper lakes group,seeking recovery of repair costs and lost profits.the district court granted bessemer summary judgment as to liability,finding seaway and its affiliates wholly at fault.when it came to damages,the district court awarded in damages to bessemer but determined that bessemer did not adequately disclose the basis of its claim and thus granted seaway summary judgment on that claim.we affirm the district court rejection of bessemer claim but reverse in part as to liability,finding a genuine dispute of fact over bessemer comparative negligence.
the shiploader.bessemer owns and operates several docks on the coast of lake erie in conneaut,ohio.ships arrive at dock to receive loads of coal from the dock shiploader,a large,steel structure.conveyor belts transport coal from silos to the shiploader,and a part of the shiploader known as the steel,from its upright storage position to extend horizontally across the ship receiving the load.a chute hangs from the boom and deposits coal in the ship hatches.
shiploader operators employed by bessemer control the movement of the boom and the chute.an operator initially lowers the boom from its vertical stowed position using controls in a small compartment in the shiploader.after positioning the boom over the ship,the operator walks out across the boom and enters the operator cab,which is suspended from the center of the boom.from inside the cab,the operator adjusts the angle of the chute and controls the dispensing of coal into the ship.the operator also has some control over the boom,with controls that allow the operator to raise the boom by as much as fifteen degrees.
the enterprise.seaway operates the enterprise,a cargo ship,which has hatches for storing coal.on its deck near the stern,it has a boom,a device that allows the ship to unload its own cargo.controls allow the crew to swing the to either side of the vessel.
the incident.in october,the enterprise pulled into dock to receive a load of coal from the shiploader.captain frederick penney secured the ship and turned control over to first mate louis drolet,who coordinates the loading process.with the boom extended across the ship and shiploader operator james fertig in the cab,the shiploader emptied coal into hatch five,which is near the bow of the vessel.the loading plan then called for the shiploader to empty coal into hatch fourteen,located midship,which required the ship to move forward feet to align hatch fourteen with the boom and the chute.because the ship obstructs access to hatch fourteen when it is in a resting position,the crew swung the to the side of the ship away from the dock before beginning the shift.
with the off to the ship side,drolet radioed fertig and asked for permission to shift the ship,which fertig granted.the crew began to move the boat slowly,with drolet using controls at the bow,wheelsman jim donnelly using controls at the stern and two deck hands handling the ship wires from the dock.drolet could not see the from his location,and donnelly acknowledges that he was looking at the controls,not the.fertig watched the ship move beneath him from his cab suspended over the deck of the ship.he faced forward with the shiploader behind him,and he had windows in front of and behind him but watched the ship only from the front windows.throughout the maneuver,fertig counted off the distance the ship needed to travel and radioed the distances to drolet.
with about feet to go,the ship struck the shiploader boom,causing damage to the boom,which took five weeks to repair.bessemer sued,alleging that the ship crew negligently failed to swing the out far enough to clear the shiploader boom.relying on the rule of the oregon.a rebuttable presumption that,when a moving object strikes a stationary object,the moving object is at district court granted summary judgment on liability,holding seaway solely responsible for the incident and entitling bessemer to in damages.at the same time,however,the district court found that bessemer had failed to comply with civil rule requirement that it produce documents supporting its claim for lost profits damages.in view of bessemer noncompliance with rule,the court excluded evidence of lost profits under civil rule c and granted summary judgment on the claim to seaway.seaway appeals the liability ruling,and bessmer appeals the ruling.
as to liability,seaway concedes that it bears some fault for what happened,but it argues that it should not be held solely to account for the accident.seaway principally claims that the district court misapplied the oregon rule presumption of fault and failed to account for genuine issues of fact concerning bessemer comparative negligence.
admiralty law draws a distinction between allisions and collisions.an allision occurs when a moving vessel strikes a stationary object,and a collision occurs when two moving vessels strike each other.see fischer neraida,cir.an elision occurs when lawyers mistakenly lump the two concepts together.the oregon rule applies to allisions,establishing a rebuttable presumption that,when a moving object hits a stationary object,the moving object is at fault.see the oregon,at.see also superior constr.brock,cir.in their appellate papers,the parties primarily square off over whether the oregon rule claiming that the rule does not apply because bessemer movable boom is not a stationary object and bessemer insisting that simply because the boom can move does not show whether it was stationary at the time of the incident.
but the outcome of this case does not turn on this distinction or for that matter on whether the oregon rule applies.not unlike the doctrine of res ispa loquitur,the oregon rule creates a prima facie case of negligence,not a final case of sole negligence.see in re towing,cir see also thomas schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law,ed.based on the observation that moving vessels do not usually a llide with stationary objects unless the vessel is mishandled in some way,the rule presumptively allocates fault when the circumstances of an allision are the party most likely to know what happened the moving vessel to present evidence to rebut the presumption of fault.city of chicago morgan,cir.but when the parties have introduced evidence to dispel the mysteries that gave rise to the presumption,the oregon rule has no factual void to fill.in re towing,at.
that is true here,as seaway has admitted some negligence,but not full responsibility,for the accident.what matters then is not whether the vessel bears some responsibility for the accident.it admits that it does.the question is whether,even if the vessel was negligent,may it still shift some responsibility for the accident to the dock owner due to its alleged comparative fault the answer to that question does not turn on the oregon rule.id.
perhaps as a result of the way the parties briefed the case,the district court took the view that,once it determined that the oregon rule presumption of fault applied to this case,seaway had to rebut the presumption of fault before it could consider seaway comparative negligence defense.at.when seaway could not do so,the court found seaway solely liable for the accident.
that is not how the oregon rule works.it is a doctrine,not a rule of ultimate liability.city of chicago,at.while it may be the case that a moving vessel must rebut the presumption to absolve itself of all liability,id.at,we know of no case law to the effect that the vessel must rebut the presumption to relieve itself of some is,to raise a comparative fault defense against the stationary object.t he oregon rule speaks explicitly only to a presumed breach on the part of the alliding vessel,and is not a presumption regarding either the question of causation or the percentages of fault assigned parties adjudged negligent.in re towing,at accord zerega realty hornbeck offshore,llc,cir.
were it otherwise,the moving vessel could never raise a comparative fault defense.once the oregon rule is triggered,the moving vessel has three ways to rebut all liability the allision was actually the sole fault of the stationary object the moving vessel acted with reasonable care or the allision was the result of an inevitable accident.city of chicago,at.no matter which of these routes the vessel takes,all of them require the vessel to prove it bore none of the fault.that leaves the moving vessel in an position.if it can not rebut the presumption,that puts it completely at fault.and if it can rebut the presumption,that makes it completely fault free.either way,the approach leaves no room for a comparative negligence defense.yet comparative and contributory negligence not only are venerable doctrines in general,but they also turn on principles that have centuries of relevance in the context of admiralty law.see rolls of oleron,article xiv circa fault should ordinarily be apportioned between moving vessel and stationary object,contained in schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law and cited with approval by united states reliable transfer,d.the rule in admiralty,when property damage results from a n a llision between ship and shore,is comparative negligence.shipping paul fire marine ins,cir.it would be odd,we think,to transform a modest evidentiary presumption into a rule that wiped away a longstanding tradition of shared fault in allision cases.
city of chicago does not support a different rule.after finding that the moving vessel had not rebutted the oregon rule presumption,city of chicago apportioned damages between the moving vessel and the stationary object based on the stationary object comparative fault.see at.
seaway also challenges the district court alternative conclusion that,even if the vessel was entitled to prove comparative fault without rebutting the oregon rule,there was no triable issue of fact over bessemer comparative negligence.seaway raises three theories of comparative fault that bessemer did not show that it had a proper permit for the boom,suggesting it was an illegal obstruction to navigation that the boom,even if authorized by permit,became a de facto obstruction to navigation during the loading process,seaway br.and that factual issues remain over whether bessemer should have moved the boom out of the ship way or checked to see whether the would clear the boom.we consider each in turn.
federal law prohibits build ing any wharf,pier,boom or other structure without a permit from the united states.yet,as seaway points out,the only permit that bessemer has produced authorizes two steel sheet pile cells to support a coal conveyor system,not the boom itself.see at.in the absence of the requisite permit for the boom,seaway says,bessemer would be negligent as a matter of law.
a statutory violation,it is true,may provide a basis for negligence.see phillips petroleum stokes oil,cir the pennsylvania,wall.placing burden on the party in breach of a navigational statute to prove that its violation could not have been a contributing cause.but if the statutory violation did not affect the allision,a party noncompliance does not factor into the apportionment of fault.see folkstone.csx,cir describing ways to rebut the presumption of fault against the party in breach of a navigational statute.
here,we can not say and seaway has not argued that the statutory violation,if any,proximately caused the allision.the enterprise pulled into bessemer docks so that the boom could lower over the vessel and load coal into its hatches.there is no reason to think that the absence of a permit for the boom affected this sequence of events.when supplies a premise for liability,that is normally because the violation involves unauthorized and unattended machinery extended over the water with enough permanency to bring them within the prohibition of the statute.see city of portland luckenbach,cir city positioned a crane over the water in violation of its permit and left it there for more than a year royster guano outten,cir illegal obstruction of navigation to extend a crane over the navigable water while not in use.when,by contrast,a temporary obstruction occurs as a necessary part of the loading process,that is not the kind of obstruction that was designed to prevent.see city of portland,at if the boom were lowered only for unloading operations there would have been no violation of.because bessemer alleged noncompliance was not a contributing cause of the allision and because the damage was not the kind the statute was designed to prevent,see folkstone,at,the district court properly rejected this theory of comparative fault as a matter of law.
seaway adds that,even if does not supply a basis for liability,the boom became a de facto obstruction to navigation when bessemer left it positioned inappropriately over the enterprise while the vessel completed its shift.seaway br.in support,seaway points to three cases where a moving vessel recovered damages for striking machinery that obstructed its path across a waterway.see city of portland,royster guano,consolidated rail lagada beach.but all of these cases involved machinery left extended over the waterway while not in use and with a sufficient degree of permanency to become an obstruction to navigation.see consolidated rail,at finding owner of a crane negligent for allowing the operator cab to extend,when in a stowed position over the water city of portland,at royster guano,at.an theory of liability does not apply where the alleged obstruction was a temporary,anticipated and necessary part of the loading process.
worse,royster guano and city of portland found liability primarily on the basis of a demonstrated violation of,which has not been shown here.city of portland,at royster guano,at violation of predecessor statute to,comp.statutes.nor does city of portland alternatively hold that,even in the absence of a statutory violation,an inappropriately extended crane can become a de facto obstruction to navigation.contrary to seaway argument,the court speculated that the district court would have found portland entirely responsible even without a statutory violation and noted that it might not have arrived at the same conclusion.at.royster guano,for its part,theorized that even if the crane had not violated the permitting statute,it would have been an obstruction to navigation,but based its holding on a proven statutory violation.at.in the end,the only holding seaway has to support its theory that a stationary object can become an obstruction to navigation absent a violation is a factually dissimilar district court case involving a crane extended over navigable water while not in use.see consolidated rail,at.the district court properly rejected this theory of comparative fault.
that does not end the matter.as the operator of a dock,bessemer had a duty to provide safe facilities to vessels using its facilities.smith burnett.see also algoma cent.michigan limestone operations,cir.and in this instance bessemer alleged noncompliance with its own internal operating procedures establishes a material issue of fact over whether bessemer met this standard of care.see in re city of new york,cir ferry boat internal rules bear on the reasonable care under the circumstances.
bessemer internal operating procedure required shiploader operators to raise the boom each time a vessel shifts to a compartment that is immediately adjacent to or in close proximity to any vessel structure which would come in contact with the shiploader chute,boom,cab.bessemer personnel acknowledged that the was part of the enterprise vessel structure and that the internal rule suggests that the operator had some responsibility to ensure that the boom would not contact the.the record,moreover,contains sufficient evidence to create a dispute over whether fertig decision not to raise the boom was a proximate cause of the allision.fertig acknowledged at his deposition that raising the boom high enough to avoid the enterprise was feasible and maybe would have avoided the accident.see at.
