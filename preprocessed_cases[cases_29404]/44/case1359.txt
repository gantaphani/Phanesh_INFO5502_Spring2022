opinion of the court 
background 
on october,an agusta helicopter the helicopter crashed in lacey township,new jersey killing the pilot,and three executives of the trump organization.costruzioni aeronautiche giovanni agusta caga,a subsidiary of agusta,manufactured the helicopter.caga and agusta are part of gruppo agusta,which does business in the united states through a american subsidiary,agusta aerospace corporation aac.all of these entities are named as defendants in this suit.
caga sold the helicopter to aac in november.aac then sold it to soundview leasing in.soundview in turn sold it to clifton park association,which ultimately sold it in to its owner at the time of the accident,fsq air charter corporation fsq.after purchasing the helicopter,fsq entered into a management agreement with paramount aviation corporation paramount,the in this suit.paramount is in the business of providing helicopter management and maintenance services to owners and lessees of helicopters.pursuant to the management agreement,paramount advised fsq in all matters relating to the helicopter.among other things,it provided fsq with pilots,performed maintenance,prepared the helicopter for flight,determined whether flight conditions permitted a safe flight,and facilitated the scheduling of flights.under the management agreement,paramount was an independent contractor providing management and administrative services to fsq without any ownership interest in the helicopter and without any right to use it for its own account 
aac operated a helicopter maintenance facility and paramount would from time to time engage its services to repair and maintain fsq helicopter.the record contains no evidence of a written agreement between paramount and aac.paramount would refer to aac problems and complaints about the helicopter,and aac would investigate the matter and perform whatever maintenance and repairs that it deemed necessary.in each instance,aac would prepare an invoice covering these services and any replacement parts and forward it to paramount for payment.there is nothing in the record to suggest,and we do not understand aac to contend,that the services performed on fsq helicopter were performed under the terms of its original sale of the craft to soundview leasing.
in this suit,paramount asserts a strict liability claim against all of the agusta defendants alleging that the accident was caused by a defect in one of the main rotor blades.it also asserts a negligence claim against aac,alleging that it was negligent in performing services on the helicopter when addressing complaints about certain vibration problems.
paramount does not claim that any of its property was damaged or destroyed in the crash.its claims are solely for economic losses.specifically,it alleges that as a result of the accident all agusta model helicopters were grounded.this caused paramount to lose the profit it would have otherwise received under the management agreement as well as the profit it would have received under other agreements it had for managing other helicopters.paramount further alleges that media coverage of the accident produced a negative public perception resulting in a downturn of its business.
the parties to this diversity action agree that it is governed by new jersey law.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on the sole ground that the economic loss doctrine first articulated in spring motors distributors,ford motor,bars recovery of economic losses in a tort action.the sole issue before us is whether the teachings of spring motors and its progeny foreclose paramount from proceeding here on theories of strict liability and negligence.
ii.spring motors 
spring motors was a suit by a purchaser of trucks against the dealership from which the trucks were purchased,the truck manufacturer,and the supplier of transmissions to the manufacturer to recover for economic loss allegedly occasioned by defective transmissions in the trucks.the supreme court of new jersey held that a commercial buyer seeking damages for economic loss resulting from the purchase of defective goods may recover from an immediate seller and a remote supplier in a distributive chain for breach of warranty under the uniform commercial code,but not in strict liability or negligence.at.the court explained that in this context e conomic loss can take the form of either direct or consequential damages.a direct economic loss includes the loss of the benefit of the bargain consequential economic loss includes such indirect losses as lost profits.id.at.
in order to determine the critical issue of whether new jersey version of the uniform commercial code the provided the exclusive remedies available to the plaintiff,the court turned to the structure and purpose of the code,which constitutes a comprehensive system for determining the rights and duties of buyers and sellers with respect to contracts for the sale of goods.id.underlying that scheme,the court concluded,is the principle that parties should be free to make contracts of their own choice,including contracts disclaiming liability for breach of warranty.id.at.primarily for this reason,the court determined that the is the more appropriate vehicle for resolving commercial disputes arising out of business transactions between persons in a distributive chain.id.allowing the plaintiff to recover from the manufacturer under tort principles would,the court pointed out,dislocate major provisions of the code by,for example,depriving the seller of the ability to exclude or limit its liability for economic loss.id.at.this,inter alia,could foreclose the parties from effecting the most efficient risk allocation.
spring motors also teaches that a commercial buyer can recover economic losses from the manufacturer of a product who is remote in the chain of distribution under an implied warranty of merchantability.it thus dispensed with the requirement of privity between parties in that chain,vertical privity.it pointed to its prior decision in santor v.a and m karagheusian,for the rationale which justified ignoring the lack of privity a manufacturer,by putting its product in the market for distribution through market channels,represents to all who might buy the product that it is at least merchantable and can reasonably foresee both reliance by buyers and the economic consequences of that reliance.
twelve years later,the new jersey supreme court was asked to decide whether the teachings of spring motors governed claims of a purchaser of a defective boat against the manufacturer and its dealership for direct economic loss.see alloway general marine.the court held,as follows 
by providing for express and implied warranties,the amply protects all purchasers and consumers economic loss arising out of the purchase of a defective product.in addition,many buyers insure against the risk of the purchase of defective goods under the as construed by this court,moreover,the absence of privity no longer bars a buyer from reaching through the chain of distribution to the manufacturer accordingly,we hold that plaintiffs tort claims are barred.
id.at.the alloway court declined to reach the issue as to whether a tort action is nevertheless available where the defective product poses a serious risk to either property or persons,but has caused only economic loss.id.at.
for present purposes,it is important to note that spring motors and alloway deal exclusively with product liability law in the context of relationships governed by the and with parties in the direct line of the product chain of distribution.spring motors does,however,mention in passing that the provides warranty remedies to other parties that can fairly be said to be third party beneficiaries of transactions between parties in the distribution chain.see at citing stat.ann.west.also,both cases cast the issue for decision in terms of whether allowing the plaintiff a tort remedy would subvert the statutory scheme embodied in the 
iii.spring motors and the negligence claim 
the commercial warranty provisions found in article two of the apply only to transactions in goods,and the implied warranty of merchantability,which was the concern of spring motors and alloway,provides only that such a warranty is implied in a contract for their sale.see stat.ann.and.moreover,section provides that r emedies for breach of any obligation ancillary to a contract for sale are not impaired by the provisions of article two,and new jersey commentary explains that this section is intended to make it clear that obligations which are associated with a contract of sale,a promise to repair goods are not governed by article.see stat.ann.and cmt.
when a contract is for goods and services,a court must determine which aspect of the contract,the goods or the services,predominates.see integrity material handling,deluxe.in making this determination,a court must examine the whole transaction and look to the essence or main objective of the parties agreement.see.de forest.c ourts look to the language and circumstances surrounding the contract,the relationship between the goods and services,the compensation structure and the intrinsic worth of the goods provided.integrity material handling,at.
the district court did not,and could not,on the basis of the current summary judgment record,conclude that the arrangement between paramount and aac was predominantly a contract for the sale of goods.if anything,the record suggests that aac was engaged as a problem solver and provided predominantly maintenance and repair services.see,thoroughbred helicoptor.agreement to overhaul helicopter engine predominantly a service contract.it is sufficient for present purposes,however,to say that there is at least a material dispute of fact as to whether the relationship between paramount and aac was governed by the.this means that we must assume that it was not based on that assumption,paramount negligence claim is governed by our decision in merritt logan,fleming in re merritt logan,cir.
in merritt logan we applied new jersey law,including the teachings of spring motors,to determine the rights of the purchaser of a refrigeration system for its grocery store merritt logan against the manufacturer of the systems hussman,the dealer from whom the system was acquired fleming,and a firm which contracted to install the system e r.merritt logan sought recovery of economic losses only.one of merritt logan claims against e r was for negligent installation.we held as follows 
the does not apply to e r,which provided services and was not a seller of goods.therefore,the does not preclude merritt logan negligence claim against e 
we also held that e r contract with fleming to install the system would,under new jersey law,contain a common law implied warranty of good workmanship and merritt logan was a third party beneficiary of that contract.id.at.we thus sustained a negligence recovery against e r on a negligence theory despite the existence of a common law contractual remedy against it.
as noted,we are required to assume that acc,like e r,entered a contract to provide services.its contractual relationship,like that of e r,was not governed by the even though acc may have had contractual obligations with respect to the quality of those services,it,like e r,may nevertheless be the subject of a negligence claim.as with e r in merritt logan,spring motors does not preclude a negligence recovery against acc in this case.
iv.spring motors and the strict liability claim 
spring motors and alloway reflect a deference to legislative will where the legislature has provided a comprehensive scheme controlling the relationship between the parties and,more specifically,a recognition of the importance of the allocation of risk of economic loss against the background of the rights and remedies provided by the.as we have indicated,they make clear that as far as parties whether commercial or within the distribution chain of goods are concerned,the alone controls the liability of a seller of goods for economic loss arising as a result of a defect in those goods there is,accordingly,no liability in a tort action whether it be one asserting strict liability or negligence.
the situation before us differs from spring motors and alloway in that paramount is neither a purchaser in the distribution chain nor within the limited class of parties outside that chain who can fairly be said to be third party beneficiaries of transactions between parties in the chain of distribution.accordingly,paramount is not in a position to engage,directly or indirectly,in the risk allocation contemplated by the for this reason,we conclude that the supreme court of new jersey would find spring motors and alloway inapplicable to paramount strict liability claim against the agusta defendants.
under new jersey,a seller of goods,absent disclaimer,impliedly warrants that its goods are merchantable to all foreseeable,subsequent buyers.see henry heide,wrh prods,cir applying new jersey law this implied warranty runs to,and is enforceable by,not only subsequent buyers,but also to those who subsequently acquire an interest less than fee title in the goods,as for example a lessee of the goods.see cintrone hertz truck leasing rental,damin aviation sikorsky aircraft.thus,what is called vertical privity is not a requirement of a warranty claim under new jersey law.
section of new jersey provides for a limited extension of express and implied warranties to some persons who are not in the distribution chain.that section is entitled third party beneficiaries of warranties express and implied and provides in relevant part 
a seller warranty whether express or implied extends to any natural person who is in the family or household of his buyer or who is a guest in his home if it is reasonable to expect that such person may use,consume or be affected by the goods and who is injured in person by breach of the warranty.
stat.ann.thus,a natural person who is a member of the household or guest of a buyer and who receives personal injuries from the defective product,may recover for those injuries from a seller under the.a seller can not contract away the operation of this section,though it can limit its liability to third party beneficiaries by disclaimers in its agreements with its immediate purchaser.a member of the household or guest of a buyer in the chain of distribution is subject to the same defenses that would be available to the buyer.
comment of the speaks of section in the following terms 
this section expressly includes as beneficiaries within its provisions the family,household,and guests of the purchaser.beyond this,the section is neutral and is not intended to enlarge or restrict the developing case law on whether the seller warranties,given to his buyer who resells,extend to other persons in the distributive chain.
id.at cmt.it is arguable that section was intended to provide the only situations in which parties not in the line of distribution are entitled to the benefits provided by new jersey version of the.one can draw a negative inference from the reference to vertical privity in comment that only decisions on dispensing with the vertical privity requirement have been left to the courts.see article two warranties in commercial transactions an update,cornell,characterizing this as the better view.indeed,the only new jersey court to directly rule upon the issue held that section is exclusive with respect to parties who are not in the distributive chain.monsanto alden leeds.
we do not predict,however,that the supreme court of new jersey will find section to be the exclusive situation in which someone not in the distribution chain will be able to recover from a seller under the indeed,the supreme court of new jersey has permitted an employee of a firm which leases trucks to recover from the lessor of the trucks.see cintrone,at.we do,however,predict that one who has neither purchased nor leased a good,but rather has been engaged to provide services to the owner of that good and who has suffered solely economic injury as a result of the malfunction of the good will not be entitled to recover from the manufacturer or other sellers in the distribution chain under new jersey 
as we have noted,the provides a comprehensive scheme applicable to sellers and buyers of good
