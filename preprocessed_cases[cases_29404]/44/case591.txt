glenn harris and his daughter together,plaintiffs filed suit in against the city of hartford and hartford police officers johnmichael and anthony pia together,defendants,for damages stemming from the officers warrantless entry onto harris property on december.after entering the property,shot and killed seven,the family pet saint bernard,at close range and within earshot,if not in front of,harris daughter,k.during the entirety of the litigation leading up to trial,defendants argued that there was no fourth amendment intrusion because the entry into the yard was not a fourth amendment search,that it was reasonable in any event,and that they were entitled to qualified immunity.the district court denied the parties for summary judgment in march and the parties submitted their joint trial memoranda in january.more than a year later,weeks before trial,defendants filed an addition to their trial memorandum adding the affirmative defense of exigent circumstances as an exception to the fourth amendment warrant requirement.plaintiffs objected to this defense.the district court permitted it over objection,and the jury returned a verdict for defendants.
for the reasons set out in this opinion,we hold that there was insufficient evidence to support a factual finding of exigent circumstances,and that this substantive error requires reversal of the judgment.we therefore reverse the judgment entered in favor of defendants,and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
during a trial held in may,the jury heard evidence concerning and pia warrantless entry onto plaintiffs property following their receipt of a tip about guns being stashed in an abandoned nissan maxima.the officers entered the property at the same time that harris daughter,had returned from school and was playing with her saint bernard dog,seven,in the backyard of the family hartford home.the following facts are taken from the testimony and other evidence presented at trial.
relevant factual background 
plaintiffs home on enfield street 
from to,plaintiffs lived in a home at enfield street.their home was surrounded entirely by a chain link fence.in december,harris lived there with his daughter,tashonna ayers,who was harris girlfriend and stepmother,and two pet saint bernards,seven and deuce.
the house had a front yard and backyard,which the family used for cookouts,playing with the dogs and hanging out together and with friends.during the summer,plaintiffs would have pool parties and water fights with a pool they set up.there is a front gate which remains closed with a latch.the gate opens onto a walkway leading up to the front steps and front door.on the front of the house is a beware of dog sign.
harris testified that during his ownership of the property,there were no utility meters that would require utility personnel to enter the property.further,when water company personnel needed to enter the property to place a water meter in the north side yard,they obtained his permission before they entered onto his property.
testified that when she played with her dogs in the yard,they would run all around the periphery of the house.when the dogs were playing with in the yard,she never needed to leash them.no one would ever come into the yard while was playing if they were not invited.at the relevant time in,harris had two cars,a dark suv and a white truck that he drove to work each day.
b.the officers gun tip 
on december,officers and pia were on duty in the vicinity of enfield street.both were part of the northeast conditions unit,which had its officers under orders to get as many guns off the street as they could.trial tr.vol.i at.then officer gabriel laureano,who is not a party in this action,was also on duty that day,specifically a few streets over on garden street.while patrolling with,laureano saw george hemingway,a member of the west hell gang whom laureano knew to have been recently released on parole.laureano noticed hemingway drop something that looked like little plastic sleeves very discretely,which appeared to laureano to be heroin or another type of drug.id.at.this substance was later confirmed to be heroin.id.laureano and placed hemingway under arrest,handcuffed him,and put him in the back of the patrol car.later that evening,laureano filled out an application for an arrest warrant.
hemingway,while alone in the car with laureano and knowing he was in a bind because he had been arrested with drugs while out on parole,told laureano that he could get them some guns.id.at.laureano understood hemingway to be hoping for some sort of consideration from a prosecutor in light of this arrest,and permitted hemingway to make a call on his cell phone,during which time laureano recalled hemingway was sweating and was kind of frantic about figuring out where the guns could be located.id.at.specifically,hemingway informed laureano that there were two small caliber guns stashed under the driver seat of an abandoned grey nissan maxima in the rear yard of enfield street.hemingway did not tell laureano how he knew about the guns.
laureano had never used hemingway as an informant before.neither had or pia.armed with hemingway tip,laureano informed officers and pia to go check out the information.id.at see also application for arrest warrant at.officer pia could not recall the route that he and took to enfield street,but they headed over immediately,without a warrant and without informing their sergeant of what they were doing.
c.the encounter at enfield street 
proceeding without a warrant,pia and entered the front gate at enfield street.the officers did not go up to the front door to knock and explain their presence,nor did they look to the front door,or notice the beware of dog sign.they did not look to see if a grey nissan maxima was parked in the driveway.they also did not drive on a parallel street to check if they could see anything in the backyard from the street.once they entered the property,the officers did not see any abandoned vehicles.in fact,although it is undisputed that harris suv was in the driveway at the time,testified that he did not recall seeing any vehicles on the property.
as pia and began walking along the side of the house toward the rear yard,both of the officers had their service weapons out in a tactical low ready approach,which explained was a grip,trial tr.vol.iii at.pia recalled seeing the dog towards the rear corner of the side yard,as he peeked into the back yard.pia saw the dog take a few steps towards him.yelled to pia to run,and pia turned around and ran until he exited the yard.heard the dog growl,and believed that the dog was chasing him.rather than run out the way he had entered,ran back across the front lawn,turning to face the dog as he continued to back up.then fired three shots at the dog at range.after shooting the dog,saw 
had returned from school and had taken seven outside,which was a regular chore.testified that after seven urinated against the back fence,he ran around towards the front of the house.went around the opposite way,t o cut him off.id.at.by the time she got to the area where her father suv was parked,heard two gunshots.ran to the front yard and she saw a police officer,with his gun aimed at seven,who was laying in the grass.screamed,and testified that the police officer shot seven a third time in the head,in front of her her stepmother ran outside upon hearing gunshots,saw holding a gun next to seven,pia standing in the driveway,and on her knees over seven,who was lying on his side on the lawn.
no nissan maxima was ever found on or anywhere near the premises,and no guns were ever recovered.
ii.proceedings before the district court 
harris commenced suit in against,pia,and the city of hartford for damages stemming from the entry onto his property on december,and the shooting and killing of seven.plaintiffs complaint alleged eight counts two constitutional claims brought pursuant to for illegal search and seizure in violation of the fourth amendment,and a fourteenth amendment substantive due process violation,as well as six state law claims for a violation of the connecticut state constitution intentional infliction of emotional distress trespass conversion negligence and indemnification against the city of hartford.
throughout the litigation,defendants contended that there was no fourth amendment intrusion because the entry into the yard was not a fourth amendment search,that it was reasonable in any event,and that they were entitled to qualified immunity.the district court denied the parties for summary judgment in march including defendants motion asserting entitlement to summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity.in january,the parties submitted their joint trial memoranda.there,too,defendants maintained that their entry into harris yard was not a fourth amendment search,as it was not curtilage.
weeks after the pretrial conference,and just before trial,defendants filed an addition to their trial memorandum,which added the affirmative defenses of exigent circumstances and community caretaking as exceptions to the warrant requirement,and requested supplemental jury instructions on these defenses.plaintiffs objected to these defenses as extremely prejudicial.the district court permitted evidence to be introduced at trial in contemplation of allowing these defenses over plaintiffs objection.
inclusion of the exigent circumstances defense 
at the close of evidence,and after both parties had moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,the district court asked defense counsel about the state of the evidence with regard to the exigent circumstances exception.trial tr.vol.iii at.defense counsel noted that there were two categories of evidence,the first being the officers general experience,which he conceded was only of limited relevance.id.at.the second,which defense counsel called the hardcore facts,were described as follows 
w e had a man by the name of george hemingway we know he was released from prison,on parole,caught with heroin,with a serious motive to try and help himself.we know that he said,i can find you some illegal guns.guns is our business since the northeast conditions unit started.they recover illegal guns all the time.they ask for illegal guns all the time,and they make these quick recoveries once they get tips t hey get from laureano there are two guns over in an abandoned vehicle with a particularized description of the home,it enfield street,the location in the home,in the rear yard,in a nissan maxima,under the front seat,and it gray.
id.at.defense counsel concluded,illegal guns that are unsecured are a present and immediate danger to the public and to the community.id.at.he further offered that the officers were not looking for any evidence to try and arrest someone or to try and develop a case or whatever we were going onto that property to take two unsecured illegal guns out of the community and into destruction.no arrests,no nothing.id.at.
jury instructions 
the jury was instructed that the fourth amendment warrant requirement extends to the curtilage of a home an area immediately adjacent to the home in which the individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy because the area in question is like part of the home itself.trial.tr.vol.v jury instructions at.the jury was given a series of factors to consider in making its determination about whether the property in question was curtilage.
the jury was also instructed that even if the property in question was curtilage,they were to decide whether the warrantless entry was lawful under the exigent circumstances exception to the fourth amendment warrant requirement.the district court charged the jury as follows 
u nder the exception to the warrant requirement for exigent circumstances,conducting a warrantless search for contraband or evidence of a crime is justified if the police reasonably believe that unless they immediately conduct a warrantless search,the items in questions will be removed or destroyed.a mere possibility that such items could be removed or destroyed is not sufficient rather,for the exigent circumstances exception to apply,the officers must be justified in reasonably believing that the items are in the process of being removed or destroyed or that removal or destruction of the items is imminent.exigent circumstances justifying an immediate search may not be present if police have a reasonable opportunity to secure a residence to prevent destruction or removal of contraband or evidence while a search warrant is obtained.
plaintiffs did not object to these instructions on the basis that they were legally incorrect.rather,plaintiffs asserted that the instruction should not have been given because there was no evidence to support the application of this exception.the district court overruled the plaintiffs objection in an ruling.over defendants objection,the jury was not charged on the community caretaking exception.
jury verdict and interrogatories 
following the trial,the jury returned a verdict for defendants on all counts.the district court then issued two interrogatories to the jury,specifically on the issue of curtilage and exigent circumstances.the jury did not reach a conclusion on the issue of whether the area of the property that the defendants entered was curtilage,but found that the exigent circumstances exception applied.
post trial motions 
all parties filed motions.harris and moved under rules and of the federal rules of civil procedure on the basis that defendants should not have been permitted to add exigency as a defense weeks before trial,and that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury verdict on this ground.defendants moved pursuant to rule on the basis that even notwithstanding the verdict,they were entitled to qualified immunity.
in a brief ruling,the district court denied plaintiffs motions,holding that the jury could reasonably conclude that the officers entry was supported by probable cause and exigent circumstances.dist.dkt.ecf.at.with regard to exigent circumstances specifically,the court held that 
the jury could credit the officers testimony that they had an urgent need to take action to seize the guns before a warrant could be obtained.the officers explained that in their experience,illegal guns moved quickly,and they did not expect the guns to be in the maxima for long.the jury also could credit the officers testimony that there was no reasonable alternative to entering the property to seize the guns,such as cordoning off the property while a warrant was obtained.
id.at.the court also denied harris motion for a new trial,holding that the jury verdict was not against the weight of the evidence.id.at.having affirmed the jury verdict,the district court denied defendants qualified immunity motion as moot.id.
discussion 
on appeal,harris and challenge the jury verdict and the district court denial of their rule and rule motions on several grounds,all relevant to the fourth amendment claims.plaintiffs assert that the issue of whether the property constituted curtilage should not have been submitted to the jury because as a matter of law,the property in question is curtilage that it was error to permit the exigent circumstances defense so close to the commencement of trial,that,as a matter of law,the evidence did not support a finding of probable cause and exigent circumstances,and that the district court abused its discretion in permitting testimony about defendants understanding that hartford was one of the most dangerous cities in america at the time of the officers entry into harris yard.as a result of these errors,plaintiffs argue that the remainder of the jury verdict can not stand,because all counts of the complaint relate to whether the entry and shooting were reasonable or unreasonable under the fourth amendment.
standards of review 
we review a district court denial of a rule motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.in doing so,we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion was made and give that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences that the jury might have drawn in his favor from the evidence.ex rel.feldman van gorp,cir alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.we will reverse the judgment of the district court i f a party has been fully heard on an issue during a jury trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.a.
a denial of a rule motion for a new trial is reviewed for abuse of discretion,which occurs when the decision rests on an error of law or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or the decision though not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.zervos verizon new york,cir.

ii.analysis 
fourth amendment warrantless searches 
the core premise underlying the fourth amendment is that warrantless searches of a home are presumptively unreasonable.united states simmons,cir citing kentucky king,it is a basic principle of fourth amendment law that searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.as relevant to this case,police officers need either a warrant or probable cause plus exigent circumstances in order to make a lawful entry into a home.kirk louisiana.
we first address the question of curtilage,a concept which originated at common law to extend to the area immediately surrounding a dwelling house the same protection under the law of burglary as was afforded the house itself.united states dunn.plaintiffs maintain that the question of whether the property constituted curtilage should not have been submitted to the jury,and that instead the district court should have instructed the jury that curtilage was established as a matter of law.
we need not address this argument because plaintiffs suffered no harm from the error they contest.as indicated in the special interrogatories,the jury did not decide whether the area in question constituted curtilage,but focused directly on whether the officers intrusion into that area was excused by exigent circumstances.because the district court instructed the jury only to consider the exigent circumstances defense if it found the area in question was curtilage,this case was decided on the jury apparent presumption that defendants could escape liability only if they succeeded in establishing their affirmative defense,which assumes sub silencio that the side yard of enfield street was curtilage and therefore subject to the warrant requirement.moreover,when the district court affirmed the jury verdict on the basis that sufficient evidence existed to support the finding of exigent circumstances and probable cause,it reinforced the jury implicit conclusion that the officers had encroached on the curtilage of plaintiffs home.
probable cause 
we address whether the officers had probable cause to proceed with investigating hemingway tip,which is the first requirement for a warrantless search on the basis of exigent circumstances.kirk,at.plaintiffs contend that as a matter of law,there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of probable cause here.we disagree,and affirm the district court with respect to its denial of plaintiffs rule and motions on the basis of probable cause.
p robable cause is a fluid concept turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts not readily,or even usefully,reduced to a neat set of legal rules.informants tips doubtless come in many shapes and sizes from many different types of persons.illinois gates.informants tips,like all other clues and evidence coming to a policeman on the scene may vary greatly in their value and reliability.id.internal quotations omitted.
in rejecting harris motion for judgment as a matter of law,the district court concluded that under the practical,nontechnical conception of probable cause described by the supreme court,the jury could credit the experienced officers testimony that hemingway tip provided probable cause that two guns would be found at this location.dist.op.at.the district court also highlighted that hemingway tip was reasonably detailed.id.at.
we agree with the district court ruling on the issue of probable cause.the jury had evidence that on the day in question,the police officers identified hemingway as a high level member of the west hell gang,which officer laureano described as a v iolent street gang comprised of teenagers and some that committed homicides in the neighborhood.trial tr.vol.i at.he testified further that w e were constantly going there for shots fired.and a lot of west hell members themselves were suspects in shootings all over the city.id.at.on the day of the incident,laureano and defendant had caught hemingway with eight bags of heroin,and they knew that hemingway had recently been released from prison and was on parole from a prior gun conviction.laureano testified that,once caught,hemingway started volunteering information that he knew where guns were,he could get us guns.trial tr.vol.i at.hemingway described in detail where the guns would be found under the front seat of an abandoned nissan maxima in the rear yard of enfield street.
when asked why laureano found hemingway reliable,laureano explained 
he reliable in the sense where he a known gang member who based on our intelligence was a high ranking,if not the leader.his friends had been arrested with guns,he had a prior gun conviction,we were responding over there on a daily basis for gunshots,people shot.and so when it came to guns,in my eyes,he was very reliable.
id.at.pia testified that hemingway was an active gang member.he was a member of west hell,a leader.he had the power,he had the authority and the access to firearms.so in his area,in that context,he was reliable to us.trial tr.vol.ii at.explained further,hemingway was now in a position of self preservation.it would be detrimental to him to provide us false information.at that point he was looking for consideration and this was common practice we employed at the time to recover most of our illegal firearms.trial tr.vol.iii at.
at this stage of the proceedings,this court is not permitted to substitute its own view of what weight,if any,to give to hemingway tip.see reeves sanderson plumbing,on review of a rule motion,the court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence credibility determinations,the weighing of the evidence,and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions,not those of a judge citations omitted.there is evidence in the record to support the jury inference that the officers believed that hemingway legal predicament he had just been arrested with eight bags of heroin close to a school,while on parole for a prior gun conviction made him more likely to tell the truth about a gun tip,in order to help himself in whatever way he could.further,the officers testified that,in the past,they had successfully procured illegal guns by securing tips from gang members against other gang members.as such,there was sufficient evidence to support the jury finding of probable cause to act on hemingway tip.we therefore affirm the district court with respect to its denial of harris rule and motions on this basis.
exigent circumstances 
though we hold that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury finding on probable cause,we do not reach the same conclusion with respect to exigent circumstances.
the essential question in determining whether exigent circumstances justified a warrantless entry is whether law enforcement agents were confronted by an urgent need to render aid or take action.loria gorman,cir alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.in answering that question,we must be cognizant of the supreme court admonition that exceptions to the warrant requirement are few in number and carefully delineated and that the police bear a heavy burden when attempting to demonstrate an urgent need that might justify warrantless searches or arrests.id.quoting welsh wisconsin,quotation marks and citation omitted.
there was simply insufficient evidence to warrant the application of the exigent circumstances exception here.in ruggiero krzeminksi,we explained,in a similar fourth amendment context,that the presumption of unreasonableness attached to warrantless searches may cast upon the defendant the duty of producing evidence of exceptions to the warrant requirement,cir.in the face of patently insufficient evidence to support the defense,the district court erred first by allowing the exigent circumstances question to go to the jury,and second,in denying plaintiffs motions 
legal standards for exigent circumstances 
recognizing that the warrant requirement is subject to certain reasonable exceptions,king.at,we employ an objective test in deciding whether a claimed exigency justifies a warrantless intrusion on fourth amendment interests.the objective test turns on an examination of the totality of circumstances confronting law enforcement agents in the particular case.united states macdonald,cir.
we have often referred to six factors,adopted from the circuit opinion in united states dorman,d,as guideposts for determining whether exigent circumstances are present 
the gravity or violent nature of the offense with which the suspect is to be charged whether the suspect is reasonably believed to be armed a clear showing of probable cause to believe that the suspect committed the crime strong reason to believe that the suspect is in the premises being entered a likelihood that the suspect will escape if not swiftly apprehended and the peaceful circumstances of the entry.
united states moreno,cir cert.denied.citing macdonald,at omission in original and internal quotation marks omitted.
defendants concede that these factors although informative,are not directly applicable to recovery of property scenarios because there is no specific suspect of interest to the law enforcement defendants.as relevant here,federal courts,including our own,have considered an additional factor,namely whether quick action is necessary to prevent the destruction of evidence.moreno,at alteration omitted citing united states brown,cir see also king.at t he need to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence has long been recognized as a sufficient justification for a warrantless search.internal quotation marks omitted.defendants claim only this last factor that there was a need to prevent the imminent removal of the illegal guns as justification for their entry into harris yard.
b.the evidence adduced at trial permits no reasonable inference of urgency 
stated that,on the day in question,the officers purpose was to retrieve the two firearms from the nissan maxima before anyone else could get to them,and that the officers made a tactical approach onto harris property due to the fact we in a high crime neighborhood.trial tr.vol.iii at.also noted that he was sure if this would be an ambush.id.
though genuinely held,the officers concerns about getting illegal guns off of the streets of hartford are not pertinent to an exigency analysis.this is because testimony about how fast guns move in hartford,or about the violent gangs in that part of the city,are not specific facts or evidence particular to this case.rather,they are generalized facts about the city and about the nature of gun trafficking.such general knowledge,without more,can not support a finding of exigency.the exigency inquiry turns on the district court examination of the totality of circumstances confronting law enforcement agents in the particular case.macdonald,at emphasis added.
in determining whether there was an urgent need to take action,the gravity of the underlying offense is considered an important part of the constitutional analysis.welsh,u.at.here,there was no underlying offense,only a tip about guns left in an abandoned maxima.defendants counsel conceded that there was no evidence,and no allegation,that harris was the holder,owner,or trafficker of the illegal guns mentioned by hemingway thus,pia and,who admit that they had no suspect in mind,must have had evidence of something more than the existence of guns in order for a jury to reasonably find that exigent circumstances warranted their immediate,tactical entry onto plaintiffs property following the receipt of hemingway tip.
the core question is whether the facts,as they appeared at the moment of entry,would lead a reasonable,experienced officer,to believe that there was an urgent need to render aid or take action.simmons,at emphasis added alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to defendants,and crediting and pia testimony that they went over to enfield street in order to seize two illegal guns stashed in an abandoned car,the record lacks any evidence of an urgent need to take action.see id.first,it is undisputed that the property was entirely surrounded by a chain link fence,making much of the property visible from the street.pia acknowledged that from the front of the property,you could see the backyard from different angles.trial tr.vol.ii at.though he noted that his view of the backyard was obstructed from our angle,he also conceded that he and did not try to drive around the property,or try to see what they could observe from the street,prior to parking and entering the property.id.at.second,at the moment of the officers entry,no nissan maxima was located on or near the property.there was only one vehicle harris suv parked in the driveway,though defendants paid no attention to the suv as they entered the premises.hemingway had stated that the guns would be stashed in the maxima,and the officers testimony confirms that they saw no vehicles when they first entered the property.thus,on this record,and under the standard governing exigent circumstances,a reasonable,experienced officer would not have perceived sufficient evidence giving rise to an urgent need to take action at the moment of the warrantless entry.
a bsent exigent circumstances,a warrantless entry to search for weapons or contraband is unconstitutional even when a felony has been committed and there is probable cause to believe that incriminating evidence will be found within.groh ramirez,internal quotation marks omitted.thus,mere suspicion or probable cause for belief of the presence of a firearm does not,on its own,create urgency.see simmons,at of course,absent such an urgency,the gun alone did not justify the officers search of the bedroom.emphasis added united states johnson,cir the mere presence of firearms does not create exigent circumstances.
in the rare cases where we have found exigent circumstances to be present on account of a firearm,the firearm is only one of multiple factors that are found to contribute to the urgency.for example,in macdonald,new york city drug enforcement task force had observed numerous indications that a retail narcotics exchange was being operated out of an apartment,and an undercover officer had entered into the apartment for an undercover drug purchase.at.while in the apartment,the undercover officer saw two loaded weapons.id.there,our court concluded that a warrantless entry that occurred subsequent to the officer confirmation of the presence of drugs and weapons in the apartment,was reasonable under the fourth amendment.see id.at.
similarly,in united states brown,we affirmed the district court denial of a suppression motion on the basis of exigent circumstances where officers who violated the knock and announce rule were investigating the underlying offense of trafficking in crack cocaine and heroin and the use of a firearm incident to that trafficking,and the suspects were reasonably believed to be armed in light of a past attempt to collect a debt from a confidential informant with a shotgun,cir.
in united states crespo,we also found exigent circumstances based on several of the dorman factors,and noted that crespo prior use of guns made it reasonable to believe he was either armed when he answered polkowski knock,or that he would arm himself immediately upon retreating into his apartment,cir.see also united states gordils,cir affirming denial of motion to suppress,in light of sever
