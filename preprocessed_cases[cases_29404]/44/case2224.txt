in,the michigan court of appeals overturned kimberly sykes and tevya urquhart convictions for the state crimes of larceny by conversion and false report of a felony on the grounds that their convictions were based on mere speculation and layers of impermissible inferences.after their release from prison,sykes and urquhart the plaintiffs brought actions against several detroit police officers,asserting claims of false imprisonment,malicious prosecution,and denial of due process.the plaintiffs also brought suit against the city of detroit on the grounds that the city failed to respond to citizen complaints and failed to train and supervise its employees.the district court dismissed the claims against the city of detroit prior to trial but submitted the remaining claims to the jury.ultimately,the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs on three claims against two individual officers the defendants and awarded the plaintiffs over million in compensatory and punitive damages.the defendants now contest the district court denial of their motion for judgment as a matter of law and appeal the damage award.
for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court as to the plaintiffs claims of false arrest,malicious prosecution,and violations of due process we remand the case for the sole purpose of having the district court articulate,in the first instance,an explanation for its denial of the defendants motion for remittitur and we hold in abeyance the plaintiffs in case numbers and,pending our review of the district court explanation for the denial of the defendants motion for remittitur.
facts procedure 
background facts 
on march,sykes,urquhart,and a third individual,kimberly holmes,arrived at their place of employment,a sprint pcs store,in detroit,michigan shortly before in order to open the store for business.as urquhart disabled the alarm and the three women entered the store,two men approached and forced their way into the store foyer despite sykes and urquhart attempt to close and lock the door behind them.once inside,one of the men told the women to shut the f up before somebody get s shot and revealed a gun that he had been concealing under his shirt.dist.docket doc.urquhart trial test.at.the two men then marched the women at gun point through the employee door to the back of the store where they were ordered to lie on the floor.urquhart testified that one of the robbers proceeded to say that one of them better get the f up and open up the safe door.doc.urquhart trial test.at.urquhart,who was three months pregnant at the time,was the only one who had the combination to open the safe.she was led at gunpoint to the room where the safe was located and was ordered to enter the room and remove the money contained inside the safe.in compliance with the armed robber demand,urquhart crossed the small room to the safe,pulled out a money bag and slid it across the floor to the man at the door.id.at.retrieving the money bag,the armed man then ordered urquhart to shut up and get back on the ground,threatened to come back and shoot the women if they tried to do anything,and closed the door as he left.id.at.the two robbers fled with approximately.
within minutes of the perpetrators exit,holmes and sykes approached the room containing the safe to check on urquhart.when urquhart rose from the floor to let holmes and sykes into the safe room,she was hysterical and crying uncontrollably.sykes immediately called the police on her cellular phone.still fearing that the robbers would return,the women decided to barricade themselves under the table in the safe room and wait for help.id.at.during the period that the women waited for the police to arrive,urquhart remained inconsolable.at one point,she briefly emerged from under the table,crawling a few feet to a trash receptacle positioned next to the safe where she proceeded to spit up into the trash.holmes also emerged from under the safe haven of the table sometime after urquhart returned,crawled to the safe,opened the door,took out the remaining money bag,and then returned the money bag to the safe.id.images of the robbery were captured on the store surveillance cameras with the exception of several dead spots,locations that were outside of the cameras view,which included the hallway where the women initially were forced to lie down and the space underneath the table in the safe room.
when officers from the detroit police department arrived on the scene,defendant sergeant carol nichols,the officer in charge,and officer terrence sims began taking witness statements.urquhart became increasingly agitated and extremely emotional when nichols attempted to interview her in the room where the robbery had just occurred and with the door closed.nichols testified that she found urquhart agitation suspicious and believed her to be full of crap,doc.nichols trial test.at quoting nichols deposition,although nichols did recognize that the interview took place in the same room where the pregnant urquhart was held at gunpoint less than two hours earlier.urquhart ultimately required medical treatment at the scene.following nichols conversation with urquhart,urquhart signed a written witness statement that nichols had drafted,providing urquhart account of the robbery.both sykes and holmes also provided statements to the police at the scene,and,as with urquhart,nichols found sykes statement suspicious,albeit for reasons.nichols and officer sims also interviewed the store assistant manager,deshawn mallory,who confirmed that he had placed two money bags in the safe the previous evening and that only one of them was missing.
during the ensuing police investigation,nichols began to suspect that the robbery was an inside job and that the three women had staged the crime.in addition to finding suspicious both urquhart agitation at being interviewed and sykes witness statement,nichols also had uncovered that holmes was a frequent gambler at a local casino,which possibly supplied a motive.on march,nichols prepared a subpoena to serve on motorcity casino casino.ten days later,on march,the casino faxed to nichols attention at the police station holmes gaming records for the three days immediately following the robbery march,march,and march.those records indicated that holmes player card was used to gamble at the casino over those three days.importantly,however,the casino cautioned in a disclaimer letter included with the gaming records that the amount of money wagered with a player card was not reliable as to the amount of money wagered or the identity of the gambler.the casino further disclosed that the records were estimates developed for marketing purposes and would not establish in any reliable manner the dates of attendance,gambling activities,or winnings or losses of a player.doc.casino letter at.
nichols never received the casino records because she had been replaced as the officer in charge by defendant sergeant derrick anderson.it was thus anderson who retrieved the fax.despite the disclaimer letter on the front of the records stating explicitly that the gaming records neither confirmed that holmes had wagered the amount listed nor that holmes was actually even present at the casino,anderson conducted no further investigation.as the new officer in charge,anderson and his partner,police investigator maurice mcclure,obtained the original vhs tape from the sprint pcs store and digitized the tape with the help of the michigan state police technical services unit so that the images could be viewed in sequence according to anderson,he viewed the tape numerous times.
based on the evidence that both he and nichols had gathered,on april,anderson prepared an investigator report and sought authorization for an arrest warrant for sykes,urquhart,and holmes from assistant prosecuting attorney,rita lewis,at the wayne county prosecutor office.in addition to his written report detailing his investigation,anderson also submitted to lewis the digitized surveillance tape from the sprint pcs store,all of the witness statements,the preliminary complaint report pcr,and a list of potential witnesses.no one else in the detroit police department reviewed anderson request prior to its submission to lewis,thereby allowing to go undetected several flagrant misrepresentations,exaggerations,and omissions of evidence that were key to determining whether probable cause existed to believe that the plaintiffs had committed any crime.lewis authorized the issuance of warrants for all three women,charging them with larceny by conversion and false report of a felony.in her notes on why probable cause existed to arrest and charge the women,lewis reproduced several of anderson misrepresentations of the evidence.
armed with arrest warrants,anderson and officer mcclure arrested sykes at her home on may.following sykes arrest,urquhart,now pregnant,turned herself in to the police.a state court conducted a preliminary examination for urquhart and sykes on july and july,at which time the state court determined that probable cause existed to bind the plaintiffs over for trial.nichols was the only officer to testify at the hearing,and her testimony contained at least two false statements that bore upon whether there was sufficient evidence to prosecute.urquhart and sykes case proceeded to trial before a jury on october,during which both nichols and anderson testified on behalf of the state.because the prosecution principal theory of the case relied heavily on holmes gambling habit,the state called anderson to testify about the gaming records that he had received from the casino.troublingly,anderson had failed to turn over the gaming records to the plaintiffs defense attorneys.anderson also never either the prosecution or the the gaming records had been accompanied by a disclaimer letter,and in direct conflict with that letter,anderson testified that the records established conclusively that holmes had gambled approximately the same amount of money taken in the robbery in the three days following the robbery.

proceedings 
following her release from prison,sykes filed suit in wayne county circuit court in march against six police officers involved in the investigation of the robbery and the city of detroit,alleging both state and violations in connection with her arrest and prosecution.the action was removed to federal court.urquhart similarly filed suit in federal court in october,and the cases were consolidated.together,the plaintiffs alleged violations of the fourth and fourteenth amendments in light of their arrests and subsequent prosecutions,claiming that there was an absence of probable cause.they also argued that they were denied due process during their criminal trial because anderson withheld exculpatory evidence in violation of brady maryland,d.in their claim against the city of detroit,the plaintiffs asserted that the city was liable under for its failure properly to train,monitor,direct,discipline and supervise its officers,specifically referring to the city policy of having the same individual write and approve an application for a warrant and its failure to respond adequately to citizen complaints against its police officers.
the defendants filed their first motion for summary judgment in june,which the district court denied without prejudice to the defendants right to seek summary judgment after the plaintiffs have had an opportunity to conduct full discovery.doc.dist.order at.in june,the defendants filed their second motion for summary judgment.the district court denied the motion as untimely and also held that the city motion failed on the merits because the city could not demonstrate an absence of material fact relative to its claim when it continually refused to comply with discovery orders related thereto.in november,the case was reassigned from judge friedman to judge edmunds.following the reassignment,judge edmunds sua sponte requested that the city of detroit refile its motion for summary judgment on the issue that judge friedman had denied and then granted the city of detroit motion for summary judgment as to all the claims against it for failure to train or supervise its police officers and failure to respond to citizen complaints.extensive motion practice subsequently resulted in the dismissal of several individually named police officers,and the case ultimately proceeded to trial on february,against the following parties on the following claims sykes claim of false arrest against anderson sykes and urquhart claims of malicious prosecution against anderson and nichols,and sykes and urquhart claims of violations against anderson,nichols,and officer mcclure.
following trial,the jury found anderson liable for false arrest,malicious prosecution,and the violation of the plaintiffs rights.the jury found nichols liable for malicious prosecution,but found in favor of officer mcclure.the jury awarded sykes in compensatory damages and in punitive damages,and urquhart received a award of and in punitive damages.on march,the defendants filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure b and for remittitur of the jury verdict,both of which the district court denied.the defendants timely appealed,and each plaintiff filed a timely conditional challenging the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the city of detroit,as well as several of the district court evidentiary rulings 
ii.analysis 
on appeal,the defendants challenge the district court denial of their motion for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure b.they specifically allege that the district court erred in rejecting their claims that they were entitled to qualified immunity,insufficient evidence supported the jury verdict as to the claim,insufficient evidence supported the jury verdict as to the claims,insufficient evidence supported the jury verdict as to the claims that the plaintiffs rights were violated as a result of a brady violation,they were entitled to a new trial because the jury verdict was unsupported by the evidence,insufficient evidence supported an award of punitive damages,and they were entitled to remittitur because the damages award was clearly excessive.
the defendants first argue that the district court erred in denying their rule b motion on grounds.as the plaintiffs correctly contend,however,the defendants have waived this claim by failing to raise the matter in their rule a motion prior to the district court submission of the case to the jury.federal rule of civil procedure a allows a party to bring a motion for judgment as a matter of law at any time before the case is submitted to the jury.a.if the district court denies that motion and the case is submitted to the jury,the movant may file a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law within ten days after the entry of judgment on the verdict.id.b.it is a proposition,however,that a motion for judgment as a matter of law is not available at anyone request on an issue not brought before the court prior to submission of the case to the jury.ford county of grand traverse,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also.b providing explicitly that a rule b motion is a renewed rule a motion.
in the instant case,the defendants moved orally for judgment as a matter of law under rule a,prior to the case submission to the jury,asserting only that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the defendants violated the plaintiffs fourth and fourteenth amendment rights.although the defendants attempt to argue on appeal that their rule a argument necessarily included a claim of qualified immunity because the sufficiency of the evidence is inextricably intertwined with qualified immunity,we have rejected such an argument.see ford,at.instead,in ford county of grand traverse,this circuit reaffirmed that while rule is not rigidly applied in all circumstances,a motion and a motion must be similar enough to provid e notice to the court and opposing counsel of any deficiencies in the opposing party case prior to sending it to the jury,thereby fulfilling the stated purpose of the rule.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.here,the defendants oral rule a motion failed to provided the required notice.the defendants never mentioned qualified immunity,and they never referenced clearly established law or objectively unreasonable actions,all of which are terms that might have put the court and the plaintiffs on notice as to the defendants claim.
to the extent that the instant case is distinguishable from ford because the defendants did raise their argument in their first unsuccessful motion for summary judgment,that is a distinction without a difference.e ven if a defendant raises qualified immunity at summary judgment,the issue is waived on appeal if not pressed in a rule a motion.parker gerrish,cir see also.the defendants failure to make a motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule a on the grounds of qualified immunity precluded them from making a motion under rule b on that ground.the claim is waived.

in the instant case,a reasonable jury could have concluded that the evidence introduced at trial showed that anderson deliberately made false or misleading statements and omitted material information from his warrant application in order to manufacture probable cause.most strikingly,anderson warrant request made several assertions as to what the store surveillance video revealed about the robbery that were plainly misleading,if not entirely false.for example,anderson asserted that although urquhart stated that she handed the perpetrator a money bag from the safe,she did not,in fact,hand the money bag to the perpetrator.doc.warrant request at.anderson also claimed that t he videotape revealed that urquhart never had contact with the perpetrator in the safe room or at any time during the robbery.id.although those statements are not obviously false,they certainly are misleading the video shows urquhart engage in movements indicating that she slid,as opposed to handed,the money bag to the perpetrator,which anderson did not acknowledge in his investigation materials moreover,despite the fact that the perpetrator never made physical contact with urquhart,the video clearly shows him standing in the doorway while urquhart was forced to remove the money bag.
in addition to these misleading statements,some of anderson claims were simply false.for instance,although the warrant request stated that holmes was observed to remove one large money bag from the safe and toss it under the table where the defendant sic urquhart and sykes were hiding and that urquhart was also observed to exit from under the table and place an item possibly the money bag into the trashcan,the video shows no such thing.id.first,the video does not show holmes tossing anything under the table,let alone a bag of money,and,second,anderson inexplicably misrepresented the chronological order of the video by stating that urquhart emerged from under the table to put something in the trash can after holmes had removed the money bag from the safe.in fact,however,the video time stamps indicate that urquhart emerged from under the table and crawled to the trash can well before holmes opened the safe.
in addition to making these material misstatements,anderson inexplicably omitted perhaps the most probative evidence as to whether a robbery presence of the two armed men.his notes make no mention of the fact that the videotape surveillance shows two men entering the store,thus corroborating urquhart and sykes statements and account of the robbery.instead,anderson stated that the investigation revealed that no robbery took place,and that the defendant sic met in the parking lot to conspire to commit larceny prior to work and then met under a table in the safe room to divide the funds taken from the safe by defendant holmes.id.but these conclusions are simply not supported by any of the information available to anderson at the time he submitted his warrant application.confronted with this evidence,a reasonable jury could have concluded that anderson deliberately made numerous misleading,if not patently false,statements and omitted key information from the warrant application establishing that there really was a robbery.
disregarding anderson false and misleading statements and considering his material omissions,the evidence plainly supports the jury finding that probable cause was lacking.at the time anderson submitted his investigatory report and warrant request to assistant prosecuting attorney,rita lewis,at the wayne county prosecutor office,his investigation merely revealed the following on the morning of the robbery,two men entered the sprint pcs store behind sykes,urquhart,and holmes and forced them toward the back.although the robbers never fully entered the room with the safe,one of them stood in the doorway and had urquhart open the safe and slide a money bag to him,and then ordered urquhart to the ground.following the robbery,sykes called the police on her cellular phone,and the plaintiffs sat under a table in the safe room,which was out of the camera view,to wait for police.holmes opened the safe at some point,and removed a money bag.the video does not readily show what she did with the money bag,but witness statements taken at the scene revealed that only one of the two money bags originally in the safe was missing,which necessitates the conclusion that holmes replaced the money bag that she briefly handled following the robbery and could not have thrown it under the table.anderson also had discovered that holmes liked to gamble,and that her player card had been used in the days following the robbery to wager an amount that approximated the amount stolen.but he also knew that the fact that holmes player card had been used was not evidence that holmes,in fact,used it,or that the dollar amounts were accurate.
this evidence simply can not support a finding of probable cause to believe that sykes was involved in the robbery.her behavior was entirely consistent with being the victim of a robbery and not incriminating in the least as the michigan court of appeals aptly concluded,there is simply no particularized evidence connecting sykes to the robbery other than sykes mere presence at the scene of the crime,see sykes,wl,at,and mere presence is not sufficient to meet the threshold.harris bornhorst,cir,cert.denied,d i t is that an individual mere presence at a crime scene does not constitute probable cause for an arrest.even if anderson was ultimately correct in his conclusion that the robbery was an inside job,there was absolutely no evidence indicating that sykes herself had knowledge of the plan or otherwise committed a crime at the time he sought his warrant.speculation does not equate probable cause,united states mcclain,cir,and no reasonabl y competent officer would have concluded on these facts that probable cause existed.malley briggs,d.
in short,we affirm the judgment of the district court as to sykes claim of false arrest because probable cause was lacking at the time anderson submitted a warrant application for sykes,and anderson can not rely on the warrant facial validity because it contains his deliberate material misrepresentations and omissions.
anderson and nichols next appeal their liability for malicious prosecution on two bases no reasonable jury could have concluded that they lacked probable cause to arrest the plaintiffs,and because anderson and nichols did not make the decision to prosecute,the plaintiffs claims fail for lack of causation.
elements of a claim 
the sixth circuit recognize s a separate constitutionally cognizable claim of malicious prosecution under the fourth amendment,which encompasses wrongful investigation,prosecution,conviction,and incarceration.barnes wright,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the tort of malicious prosecution is entirely distinct from that of false arrest,as the tort remedies detention accompanied not by absence of legal process,but by wrongful institution of legal process.wallace kato,d internal quotation marks omitted.neither the supreme court nor the sixth circuit has yet articulated the elements of a fourth amendment claim under with any specificity,wallace,at briner city of ontario,app x,cir unpublished opinion,but because exploration of the showing required under federal law is necessary to resolve the instant case,we do so now.
to succeed on a claim under when the claim is premised on a violation of the fourth amendment,a plaintiff must prove the following first,the plaintiff must show that a criminal prosecution was initiated against the plaintiff and that the defendant ma d e,influence d,or participate d in the decision to prosecute.fox desoto,cir see also mckinley city of mansfield,cir darrah city of oak park,cir skousen brighton high,cir.second,because a claim is premised on the violation of a constitutional right,the plaintiff must show that there was a lack of probable cause for the criminal prosecution,fox,at voyticky,at.third,the plaintiff must show that,as a consequence of a legal proceeding,the plaintiff suffered a deprivation of liberty,as understood in our fourth amendment jurisprudence,apart from the initial seizure.johnson knorr,cir see gregory city of louisville,cir discussing the scope of fourth amendment protections beyond an initial seizure,including continued detention without probable cause heck humphrey,d u nlike the related cause of action for false arrest or imprisonment,an action for malicious prosecution permits damages for confinement imposed pursuant to legal process.fourth,the criminal proceeding must have been resolved in the plaintiff favor.heck,at one element that must be alleged and proved in a malicious prosecution action is termination of the prior criminal proceeding in favor of the accused.
this circuit has never required that a plaintiff demonstrate malice in order to prevail on a fourth amendment claim for malicious prosecution,and we join the fourth circuit in declining to impose that requirement.see brooks city of,cir.the circuits that require malice have imported elements from the common law without reflecting on their consistency with the overriding constitutional nature of claims.see manganiello city of new york,cir requiring a fourth amendment violation plus each element of the applicable state law mckenna city of philadelphia,cir requiring malice lassiter city of bremerton,cir same wilkins dereyes,cir same grider city of auburn,cir same.and claims have different foundations.as the supreme court explained in albright oliver,the constitutional tort authorizes stands on its own,influenced by the substance,but not tied to the formal categories and procedures,of the common law,d ginsburg,concurring see also carey piphus,d requiring courts to adapt rules of damage when adjudicating cases because the interests protected by a particular constitutional right may not also be protected by an analogous branch of the common law torts pierce gilchrist,cir mcconnell,rejecting the view that a plaintiff does not state a claim actionable under unless he satisfies the requirements of an analogous common law tort.this court recognized the difference in frantz village of bradford,in which we h e ld that albright precludes reliance on state law to define a federal cause of action and reject ed the reasoning of courts which have relied on the state law elements of malicious prosecution,cir,abrogated as recognized by thacker city of columbus,cir see also darrah,at confirming that this language in frantz survived abrogation.
in the context of malicious prosecution,the fourth amendment violation that generates a cause of action obviates the need for demonstrating malice.for instance,if the harm alleged is a seizure lacking probable cause,it is unclear why a plaintiff would have to show that the police acted with malice.gallo city of philadelphia,cir.in fact,fourth amendment jurisprudence makes clear that we should not delve into the defendants intent.t he reasonableness of a seizure under the fourth amendment should be analyzed from an objective perspective,which,even in the context of claims,renders irrelevant the subjective state of mind of the defendant,whether good faith or ill will.brooks,at 
we recognize that designating the constitutional claim as one for malicious prosecution is both unfortunate and confusing.a better name that would perhaps grasp the essence of this cause of action under applicable fourth amendment principles might be unreasonable prosecutorial seizure.frantz,at gilman,dissenting on other grounds to a holding that was abrogated by darrah,at.still,we are stuck with that label,and we conclude that malice is not an element of a suit for malicious prosecution 
for the reasons explained below,we conclude that a reasonable jury could have found the defendants liable for malicious prosecution.in the instant case,there was not only a lack of probable cause to institute a criminal proceeding against the plaintiffs,but the defendants actions in this case were sufficient to qualify as either influence over or participat ion in the decision to prosecute regardless of the fact that the defendants,themselves,did not make the ultimate decision.fox,at.
no probable cause to initiate criminal 
the defendants first claim that they had probable cause to arrest the plaintiffs,and they argue that this fact necessarily defeats the instant claim.in order to distinguish appropriately this claim from one of false arrest,we must consider not only whether the defendants had probable cause to arrest the plaintiffs but also whether probable cause existed to initiate the criminal proceeding against the plaintiffs.see,fox,at what is certain is that a malicious prosecution claim fails when there was probable cause to prosecute emphasis added barnes,at t he defendants had probable cause to seek an indictment against the plaintiff.emphasis added.
we have already concluded that the defendants lacked probable cause to arrest sykes,and the defendants have pointed to no evidence uncovered subsequent to sykes arrest that would call into question the jury belief that there was no probable cause to initiate criminal proceedings against her.turning to urquhart,we similarly conclude that probable cause to arrest and prosecute was lacking.as outlined above,apart from inviting pure speculation as to the plaintiffs potential involvement,the facts revealed by the surveillance video from the sprint pcs store provided no reasonable ground for the belief that urquhart was a perpetrator of the robbery,as opposed to its victim.to the extent that the defendants assert that urquhart behavior at the time nichols interviewed her provides support for a finding of probable cause,we wholly disagree.it bears repeating that at the time that nichols asked urquhart to provide a statement,only two hours had passed since the robbery.urquhart was visibly shaken and required medical treatment.moreover,urquhart was pregnant at the time of the robbery and had been the victim of a home invasion just days earlier,and nichols was aware of these facts.a reasonable jury could have found that any one of these factors explained and justified urquhart amplified agitation and displeasure with having to remain at the scene to speak with police.mere disinterest in speaking with an officer under the circumstances here is not sufficient to meet the threshold.furthermore,as with sykes,the defendants have failed to point to any untainted and truthful evidence bearing upon whether there was probable cause to institute a criminal proceeding against urquhart.
contrary to the defendants claim,viewing the totality of the circumstances at the time of the plaintiffs arrest and through the time that the criminal proceeding against them commenced,a reasonable jury could have concluded that there was no probable cause to believe that either sykes or urquhart had committed any crime.
defendants influenced decision to prosecution 
the defendants further claim that they can not be held liable for malicious prosecution because they did not make the decision to prosecute the plaintiffs.there is very little case law in this circuit discussing precisely what role an investigating officer must play in initiating a prosecution such that liability for malicious prosecution is warranted,but existing cases do indicate that an officer may be responsible for commencing a criminal proceedings against a plaintiff,where the officer ma d e,influence d,or participate d in the decision to prosecute.fox,at.thus,contrary to the defendants assertion,the fact that they did not make the decision to prosecute does not per se absolve them from liability.instead,the plaintiffs were entitled to prove that the defendants either influence d or participate d in the decision to prosecute.id because nichols and anderson played distinct roles in the process,we analyze their actions separately in order to determine whether the plaintiffs have met their burden with respect to this element.
nichols testimony at the plaintiffs preliminary hearing.the plaintiffs claim of malicious prosecution against nichols is predicated on two misrepresentations that she made during her sworn testimony at the preliminary hearing where the decision was made to bind the plaintiffs over for trial.it is well established in this circuit that p olice officers can not,in good faith,rely on a judicial determination of probable cause to absolve them of liability when that determination was premised on an officer own material misrepresentations to the court.gregory city of louisville,cir.this means that in order to establish that a testifying officer was responsible for commencing a criminal proceeding for purposes of a claim,the plaintiffs were required to present evidence that nichols stated a deliberate falsehood or showed reckless disregard for the truth at the hearing and that the allegedly false or omitted information was material to the court finding of probable cause.see molnar care house,app x,cir unpublished opinion even accepting the allegation that the officer knowingly supplied the magistrate with false information,darrah,at,the state court did not rely on her testimony to establish probable cause.
based on the evidence in the instant case,a reasonable jury could have concluded that nichols testified falsely at the preliminary hearing and that her statements were material to the state court finding of probable cause.first,the evidence before the jury revealed that only officer called to testify at the preliminary that the evidence contradicted urquhart witness statement and account of the robbery when,in fact,urquhart statement was entirely consistent with that evidence a reasonable jury could have found not only that nichols statement amounted to false testimony but also that it was material to the state court determination that there was probable cause to bind the plaintiffs over for trial.had nichols testified that urquhart account of the robbery was entirely consistent with the video evidence,nichols truthful statement might have resulted in a conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to bind the plaintiffs over for trial.united states wallace,cir noting in the context of a perjury charge that a false declaration satisfies the materiality requirement if a truthful statement might have assisted or influenced the court in its investigation.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.consistency between an alleged perpetrator statement and the remaining evidence in a case is certainly relevant to determining not only whether the alleged perpetrator was involved in criminal activity but also the credibility of the alleged perpetrator repeated exclamations of innocence.united states rose,cir indicating that a police officer discovery of evidence contradicting the alleged perpetrator previous statements could elevat e the agent suspicion to probable cause.in fact,the materiality of nichols false testimony in determining whether there was probable cause to prosecute is highlighted by the prosecutor reliance on the alleged discrepancy between urquhart statement and the video evidence when the prosecutor argued at the preliminary hearing that probable cause existed to believe that the plaintiffs were involved in the robbery not only does urquhart say in her statement that she handed the bag to this alleged armed robber,her statement makes it sound like there an armed robber in the room with her.doc.nichols trial test.at quoting prosecutor closing argument at the preliminary hearing.
the second falsehood that the plaintiffs highlight is nichols testimony at the preliminary hearing that sykes and urquhart witness statements were suspicious because they were too similar.as the plaintiffs revealed to the jury in the instant case,however,nichols later testified that sykes and urquhart witness statements were actually not similar,but were suspicious because they were so different again,a reasonable jury could have concluded that nichols statements amounted to false testimony.given that she was the only officer to testify at the preliminary hearing,a reasonable jury likewise could have found that nichols misrepresentations of the facts regarding not only the evidence in the case but also the credibility of the suspects were material to the state court decision to bind the plaintiffs over for trial.as a result,we have no trouble concluding that a reasonable jury could have found that nichols influenced or participated in the decision to prosecute and that her false testimony was thus one cause of the commencement of the criminal proceedings against the plaintiffs 
anderson investigatory materials.turning to anderson,the plaintiffs predicate his liability on his affirmative misrepresentations and omissions in his application and investigative report.this circuit has had few opportunities to address the nexus between an officer statements in his or her investigatory materials and the institution of a criminal prosecution sufficient to sustain a claim for malicious prosecution.it is absolutely clear,however,that an officer will not be deemed to have commenced a criminal proceeding against a person when the claim is predicated on the mere fact that the officer turned over to the prosecution the officer truthful materials.mckinley,at skousen,at wysong city of heath,app x,cir unpublished opinion kinkus village of yorkville,ohio,app x,cir unpublished opinion holding that the officer played no role in the prosecution because the police report provided to the prosecutor did not contain false information.
as discussed above in the context of sykes claim,however,anderson liability is not premised on his disclosure of truthful investigatory materials.the matter that we must resolve,then,is whether anderson falsehoods,misrepresentations,and omissions,which clearly led to the plaintiffs arrests,can survive a number of intervening decisions by others such that anderson can still be said to have influenced or participated in the decision to institute criminal proceedings.considering causation broadly,as the plaintiffs urge,it certainly was anderson arrest that started the chain of events that ultimately led to the prosecutor decision to proceed with the criminal charges against the plaintiffs looking at causation more narrowly,anderson reasonably could have foreseen that by providing false information to the prosecutor that bore directly on whether there was probable cause to believe that the plaintiffs committed a crime,his misconduct could result in not only the plaintiffs initial seizure but also their eventual incarceration.and holding anderson liable for all reasonably foreseeable consequences of his initial misdeeds finds support in the supreme court decision in malley briggs,d.in malley,the supreme court made clear that normal causation principles apply to actions by stating that if an officer caused a plaintiff to be unconstitutionally arrested by presenting a judge with a complaint and a supporting affidavit that failed to establish probable cause,id.at,it is clear that the argument that the officer should not be liable because the judge decision to issue the warrant breaks the causal chain between the application for the warrant and the improvident arrest would be inconsistent with its interpretation of,id.at.but in the instant case,anderson actions were even more removed from the ultimate relevant decision than those of the officer in malley,and the plaintiffs reliance on this case is not entirely convincing.here,anderson submitted the warrant application and investigatory materials containing false and misleading information to prosecutor,the prosecutor approved the warrant application,a magistrate issued the warrant,and the plaintiffs were arrested.see.comp.laws west walczak city of detroit,table cir describing the process in michigan.following the plaintiffs arrest,however,there was a preliminary hearing during which the state court made a determination that probable cause to prosecute existed based,in part,on nichols false testimony,and it is undisputed that anderson did not testify at the preliminary hearing.although this circuit has not confronted a case entirely analogous to the instant one,gregory is again helpful in determining whether anderson actions survive these intervening decisions such that he can be said to have influenced or participated in the decision to institute criminal proceedings against the plaintiffs.
in gregory,this court upheld a district court grant of summary judgment on a claim of malicious prosecution in favor of two who had fabricated investigative notes indicating that the plaintiff possessed independent knowledge of facts from the crime that only the perpetrator would know.gregory,at.the panel reasoned that the plaintiff had failed to establish a fourth amendment injury from the notes existence and creation because the plaintiff had presented no evidence that the notes were presented to the court at the preliminary hearing thereby contribut ing to the court determination of probable cause to hold plaintiff over for trial or that the notes influenced any decision to proceed to trial.id.at.the conclusion not only that the consequences of the officer actions must be reasonably foreseeable but also that the officer action must have influenced the continued detention is consistent with other circuits that have confronted cases similar to the instant one.for example,in reed city of chicago,the seventh circuit noted that although i t is conceivable that a wrongful arrest could be the first step towards a malicious prosecution,the chain of causation will be broken by an indictment absent an allegation of pressure or influence exerted by the police officers,or knowing misstatements made by the officers to the prosecutor.reed city of chicago,cir citing senra cunningham,cir,which held that a t he chain of causation will be broken if the filing of the information by the attorney at the state attorney general office was free of pressure or influence exerted by the police officers or knowing misstatements made by the officers to the attorney general office taylor meacham,cir adopting reed reasoning and holding that no claim could be sustained against a sheriff who may have set in motion a malicious prosecution because the preliminary hearing broke the chain of causation and there was no evidence that the sheriff made false or misleading statements following the plaintiff arrest,nor that he somehow caused false or perjured testimony to be presented at the preliminary hearing.likewise,in higazy templeton,the second circuit concluded that d efendants may be liable for consequences caused by reasonably foreseeable intervening forces,and the chain of causation need not be considered broken in a claim against an officer if the officer deceived the subsequent decision maker or could reasonably foresee that his misconduct would contribute to an independent decision that results in a deprivation of liberty.higazy templeton,cir internal quotation marks,citation,and alteration omitted.
based on the foregoing caselaw,we conclude that in order to show that anderson participated in or that his actions influenced the commencement of criminal proceedings as required to sustain a claim of malicious prosecution,the plaintiffs were required to present some evidence that the impact of anderson misstatements and falsehoods in his investigatory materials extended beyond the plaintiffs initial arrest and ultimately influenced the plaintiffs continued detention.we also conclude,however,that such influence is not narrowly limited to the introduction of anderson false statements as evidence at the preliminary hearing but can also be based on anderson knowing misstatements to the prosecutor or his pressure or influence,reed,at,over an individual who either made the decision to prosecute or testified at the preliminary hearing.
employing this standard in the instant case,a reasonable jury could have found that anderson participated in or influenced the decision to prosecute the plaintiffs such that liability for malicious prosecution is proper.perhaps the most telling evidence of anderson influence over the decision to commence criminal proceedings against the plaintiffs resides in his investigatory materials,which were clearly in the prosecution possession.not only did these materials contain knowing misstatements,as outlined previously,but also it is apparent from the record that the prosecution actually relied on many of anderson falsehoods in proceeding against the plaintiffs by reproducing many of the very same material misrepresentations of the evidence that anderson had made.for example,lewis stated in her notes that the surveillance video tape does not show an armed robbery because nothing was taken from the safe until the defendants were alone in the room,and that the plaintiffs appear ed to be counting money.doc.prosecutor notes.this is plainly not the case,and a reasonable jury could have concluded from the striking similarities between prosecutor lewis unsupported conclusions and anderson falsehoods that the prosecution relied on anderson misstatements in filing criminal charges.anderson influence can likewise be seen in the prosecution reference to the holmes gaming records.notwithstanding the fact that the prosecution had not seen any documentation from the casino,lewis noted that holmes had spent almost the exact amount stolen at a casino and that anderson,the officer in charge,ha d the records to prove it.id.
in short,the fact that anderson did not make the decision to initiate the criminal proceedings against the plaintiffs is of no moment,as the record contains ample evidence that anderson influenced or participated in the ultimate decision to prosecute the plaintiffs by way of his knowing misstatements to the prosecutor.as the seventh circuit stated in jones city of chicago,i f police officers have been instrumental in the plaintiff continued confinement or prosecution,they can not escape liability by pointing to the decisions of prosecutors or grand jurors or magistrates to confine or prosecute him.jones city of chicago,cir.they can not hide behind the officials whom they have defrauded.id.we thus affirm the judgment against the defendants as to the plaintiffs claims for malicious prosecution 
anderson also challenges on appeal the jury conclusion that his failure to disclose the letter from motorcity casino casting doubt on the reliability of holmes gaming records violated the plaintiffs right to a fair criminal trial in violation of due process.specifically,anderson claims that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to determine that he concealed exculpatory evidence in violation of brady maryland,d,because a brady claim can not be raised against a police officer in a action,brady is inapplicable where the evidence is available from another source,the evidence was not favorable to the plaintiffs,and the plaintiffs are unable to show prejudice.we address and reject each of anderson assertions in turn.
as discussed previously,the contested evidence consisted of a letter from the motorcity casino that was sent as part of the casino longer,response to nichols subpoena for holmes gaming records.numerous pages from the casino provided information that indicated that holmes player card had been used to wager approximately within days of the robbery.the first three pages of the casino response,however,consisted of a letter from the casino legal counsel that stated,in relevant part 
our office is in receipt of your request for information regarding kimberly holmes detroit entertainment,may have documentation in its possession prepared and filed in accordance with federal statute and regulations,which detroit entertainment,motorcity casino believes that it is prohibited from disclosing we recommend that you contact the internal revenue service to obtain any such documentation filed by motorcity casino in connection with holmes.
i would like to state in writing the position of motorcity casino with respect to the documentation you seek.the documentation that motorcity casino retains in connection with the play of its customers is compiled primarily for marketing purposes it is not compiled in a manner that ensures either accurate or full reporting of the time spent at the casino,the time spent gambling,or the actual play wins or losses of a customer.indeed,if the records indicate slot machine activity,they only reflect the fact that a player card bearing the identification name was that the person to whom the card was issued actually used it.furthermore,records regarding table game activity are based on periodic visual inspections by various pit employees who then manually input data into the computer system.note,too,that some entries may simply reflect the fact that a motorcity casino employee logged on to the system to check the player status,thereby creating the appearance of that player attendance at the casino at the time of the when no such attendance occurred.accordingly,the documentation would not establish in any reliable manner the dates of attendance,gambling activities,or winnings or losses of a player.therefore,i would advise discretion in utilizing the enclosed information.
doc.casino letter at emphases added.despite receiving this letter,anderson did not request surveillance tapes from the casino or otherwise attempt to confirm holmes presence and did no further investigation into the accuracy of the records.
at sykes and urquhart criminal trial,the prosecution principal theory of the case was that the robbery was an inside job and that holmes had gambled away the loot.anderson was the key witness,and he testified that he had received documentation from the casino that holmes had used her player card to wager around immediately following the robbery.the prosecution then admitted into evidence the single page from the casino that anderson had provided to the prosecution,which set forth the wagering data that included the amounts that holmes purportedly lost.as noted,there were several problems with this evidence.first,anderson had not disclosed the existence of the gaming records to the plaintiffs defense attorneys prior to trial,so the first time that the defense gained knowledge of the casino records was while anderson was on the stand.second,anderson never revealed to either the prosecution or the defense that the casino sent anything other than the one page that was introduced as evidence,and he made no mention of the casino disclaimer letter at any time.third,as compared to the original document that the casino had sent in response to the subpoena,the one page from the casino that the prosecution introduced as evidence had been magnified and cropped in a manner that removed the fax time stamps and page numbers,erasing any evidence that it was only one page of a much lengthier document.in other words,there was nothing to put urquhart or sykes on notice that the information that anderson was presenting from the casino on this one page was incomplete.
following the introduction of the casino document,the prosecutor proceeded to question anderson about the accuracy of the wagering calculation contained therein 
q now you also received some information from motor city regarding the absolute accuracy of those numbers.
q what did motor city convey to you as to whether or not those are absolute hard
