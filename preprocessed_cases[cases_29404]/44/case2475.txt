plaintiff lamar william jones bey appeals from an order entered by the united states district court for the western district of michigan,granting summary judgment to defendants kelly johnson and wayne trierweiler and dismissing with prejudice jones bey first and eighth amendment claims brought pursuant to.because jones bey did not fully exhaust his administrative remedies,we reverse and remand this case to the district court to dismiss his petition without prejudice.
procedural history 
jones bey is a prisoner at the alger maximum correctional facility in munsing,michigan.johnson is a guard at the facility,and trierweiler is the prison grievance coordinator.between october and april,jones bey filed nine grievances against johnson alleging various instances of misconduct and one against trierweiler alleging a mishandling of these grievances.
jones bey filed this action against the defendants in their individual capacity in july claiming that both defendants violated his first amendment rights,and that johnson also violated his eighth amendment right to be free from the use of excessive force.the district court referred this case to a magistrate judge.the magistrate judge recommended that summary judgment be granted to the defendants because jones bey had not fully exhausted his administrative remedies as required by the prison litigation reform act plra.alternatively,the magistrate judge stated that even if jones bey had exhausted his administrative remedies,none of his claims was sufficient to survive summary judgment.the district court adopted the report and recommendation and granted the defendants motion for summary judgment 
factual history 
claims against defendant johnson 
in october,jones bey alleges that he was arbitrarily refused his yard,or his time to exercise in the prison yard.johnson claims that jones bey was not fully dressed when she came to his cell,and,therefore,he was not entitled to leave his cell.jones bey filed a grievance over this incident,in accordance with the michigan department of corrections grievance procedure it was denied at all three steps.
after filing this initial grievance,jones bey contends that johnson engaged in a series of retaliatory acts against him.johnson allegedly came to jones bey cell and said,you like to write grievances huh you know me and the counselor are related.i going to see if i can have him put some pressure on you to break you up from that habit.jones bey filed a grievance concerning this statement which he claims was appealed through step iii,but the record shows that the director office never received the grievance.
jones bey also contends that five days later,while he was out on his yard period,johnson searched,or shook down,his cell.when jones bey returned to his cell,he allegedly found his possessions in disarray and pages torn out of two of his islamic books.when jones bey confronted johnson on the issue,she allegedly used racial slurs and told him to write a grievance about his complaints.he did file a grievance against johnson,complaining both about the search and the use of racial slurs.he attached handwritten affidavits from two other prisoners claiming that they heard the sounds of paper tearing and the toilet flushing when johnson was searching jones bey cell.again,this grievance was not appealed through step iii.jones bey sent a letter to the director office concerning this grievance,but the return letter indicated that the director had not received jones bey appeal on this grievance.
in december,jones bey filed another grievance against johnson for her use of racial slurs and derogatory language.he again attached handwritten affidavits from other prisoners who claim to have overheard these comments.this grievance was fully exhausted,but the prison determined that these claims had already been addressed at the local level and in jones bey earlier grievances filed against johnson.
on the same day,johnson filed a major misconduct report against jones bey alleging assault and battery.johnson report alleged that in the course of returning jones bey to his cell,he spun his body around and swung johnson hands against the food slot as she was trying to remove his handcuffs,resulting in some redness and pain in her hands.jones bey,however,claimed that she handcuffed him too tightly and that she pulled on the handcuffs forcing his hands against the food slot.he claims that he suffered extreme pain as a result of this altercation,but an showed no broken bones.three days later,jones bey filed a grievance against johnson alleging that johnson filed the major misconduct report in retaliation for all of the grievances he filed against her.he additionally alleges that johnson fabricated the misconduct report in order to conceal her alleged misconduct in january,he was cleared of all wrong doing against johnson after an independent hearing on the major misconduct charge.
jones bey alleges that after he was acquitted of the major misconduct,johnson made threatening remarks about getting even and put him in a segregation yard as retaliation.he filed and exhausted a grievance with respect to this claim.he also filed another grievance against her for alleged use of more racial slurs.this grievance,too,was denied at all three stages.finally,jones bey alleges in his complaint that an officer named zimmerman shook down his cell and confiscated some of his legal papers on johnson orders.however,this complaint was never grieved.johnson denies all of the allegations against her,claiming that she never made intimidating statements or retaliated against jones bey in any way.
claims against defendant trierweiler 
jones bey only claim against trierweiler stems from trierweiler alleged mishandling of grievances filed by jones bey.jones bey states that trierweiler arbitrarily rejected or denied his grievances because they were unclear,not concise,contained extraneous information,or related to or already grieved issues.he also claims that trierweiler did not follow the prisoner grievance policy set forth by the michigan department of corrections.when this grievance reached step iii,the director noted that even if trierweiler denied a grievance at step i,jones bey could always have appealed his complaints to steps ii and iii.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.copeland machulis,cir.furthermore,we review the district court exhaustion determination in a plra case de novo.curry scott,cir.
because jones bey complaint alleged both exhausted and unexhausted claims,we must definitively answer an open question in this circuit whether the plra requires a complete dismissal of a prisoner complaint when that prisoner alleges both exhausted and unexhausted claims.we hold that it does.
the plra requires that a prisoner must exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit in the district court.it states no action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section of this title,or any other federal law,by a prisoner confined in any jail,prison,or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.a.the has the burden of proving that a grievance has been fully exhausted,baxter rose,cir,and the prisoner must attach documentation to the complaint as proof.brown toombs,cir.exhaustion is not jurisdictional it is mandatory,wyatt leonard,cir,even if proceeding through the administrative system would be futile.hartsfield vidor,cir.
although the plra exhaustion requirement is clearly mandatory as to each individual claim,we have specifically left unanswered the question of whether the plra exhaustion requirement applies such that a mixed complaint,alleging both exhausted and unexhausted claims,must be completely dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.see knuckles el toombs,cir we reserve to another day the question of whether exhausted claims in a mixed complaint should be addressed when such claims otherwise meet the pleading requirements or whether such a complaint should be dismissed in its entirety.
our cases addressing plra exhaustion are somewhat inconsistent.at least one of this court prior decisions suggests that total exhaustion is not required under the plra.in hartsfield,at,the plaintiff complaint alleged misconduct by five prison officials however,the plaintiff only exhausted his administrative remedies against three defendants.without addressing the issue of total exhaustion,we held that the exhausted claims could be addressed on the merits while the unexhausted claims could be dismissed without prejudice.id.this procedure has been followed in some of our unpublished opinions.see williams mcginnis,wl,at cir,unpublished table decision mcelhaney elo,wl,at cir unpublished table decision wash rout,wl,at cir.may,unpublished table case riley richards,wl,at cir,unpublished table case.however,other unpublished decisions have affirmed the decisions of district courts requiring total exhaustion.see bomer hakola,cir kemp jones,cir mack dewitt,cir overholt unibase data entry,wl.lexis,at cir.june.
acting without clear guidance from this court,the district courts in this circuit are split on whether the plra requires total exhaustion in cases involving mixed complaints.compare hubbard thakur,d,rejecting total exhaustion rule alexander davis,d same and jenkins toombs,d same with chamberlain overton,d,applying total exhaustion and smeltzer hook,d same.similarly,a split exists among the other circuits that have addressed this issue.compare ross county of bernalillo,cir applying total exhaustion kozohorsky harmon,cir same and graves norris,cir same with ortiz mcbride,cir rejecting total exhaustion.we now join the tenth and eighth circuits in holding that total exhaustion is required under the plra.
the dissent suggests we are going contrary to stare decisis by refusing to follow a rule set out in hartsfield,at.although that decision follows the principle in application,it does not discuss exhaustion.perhaps the issue was not raised by the parties in that case.we would never suggest repudiating a holding in a prior decision,but the author of the hartsfield decision was also the author of the subsequent decision in knuckles el,at,in which this court reserve d for another day this very question.id.the author of the dissent herein was also a member of the panel that decided knuckles el.moreover,if the decision in hartsfield was so clear,it is strange why other panels of this court and district courts in this circuit have not always followed it.
we adopt the total exhaustion rule,in large part,because the plain language of the statute dictates such a result.section a states that no action shall be brought in federal court until administrative remedies have been exhausted.however,in subsection c,the statute allows district courts to dismiss frivolous actions or claims.c.congress use of the word claims in subsection c indicates that claims are individual allegations and actions are entire lawsuits.see ross,at to start,the language in a itself suggests a requirement of total exhaustion because it prohibits an action as opposed to merely preventing a claim from proceeding until administrative remedies are exhausted.see also smeltzer,d at.
furthermore,reading subsection a and subsection c together demonstrate that congress intended for action to mean suit.if a district court is presented with a mixed petition,it has the power under subsection c to dismiss any frivolous claims,exhausted or not,with prejudice.however,dismissal under subsection a allows the court to dismiss the entire action without prejudice.the smeltzer court recognized that congress must have intended that courts could use subsection c to dismiss unexhausted claims as frivolous to keep them from holding up the others.smeltzer,d at.in the alternative,the court could dismiss the entire action without prejudice and allow the prisoner to only exhausted claims.
the policies underlying the plra also suggest that congress intended the courts to apply total exhaustion to a prisoner petition.one purpose of the act is to reduce the sheer number of prisoner suits,especially frivolous actions.see ortiz,at citing cong.rec.statement of hatch.congress also intended to give increased powers to prisons so that they could solve their problems according to their own internal dispute resolution systems.see alexander hawk,cir citing cong.rec.in the plra context,a total exhaustion rule would encourage prisoners to make full use of inmate grievance procedures and thus give prison officials the opportunity to resolve prisoner complaints.ross,at.when the courts dismiss the actions without prejudice,prisons would have the opportunity to fully resolve the complaint.if the complaint can not be resolved within the prison,the prisoner could file an action in court with a complete administrative record that would ultimately assist federal courts in addressing the prisoner claims.see also rivera whitman,d.
additionally,adopting the total exhaustion rule creates comity between claims and habeas corpus claims.the supreme court requires total exhaustion in habeas cases to allow state courts the first opportunity to solve prisoners cases because they are arguably in a better position to analyze and solve the problems.see preiser rodriguez,d.the plra,too,was enacted to allow state prison systems the first chance to solve problems relating to prison conditions.because both bodies of law were created for similar reasons,their exhaustion rules should be interpreted in a similar manner 
courts which have not applied the total exhaustion rule claim that there is little similarity between habeas petitions and actions.these courts note that total exhaustion is required in the habeas context out of a need for state sovereignty.see ortiz,at jenkins,d at.however,these courts fail to recognize that while state courts have an interest in resolving habeas cases,state prison systems have a similar interest in resolving cases involving their own institutions.this circuit has already noted the similarities between habeas petitions and claims.in brown toombs,we noted the plra has extensive benefits.it recognizes that it is difficult to explain why we require full exhaustion in habeas corpus cases involving life and liberty,but allow direct access in prison rights cases under.at.because we recognize the correlation between habeas petitions and actions,we find it appropriate to interpret the plra exhaustion requirements in light of habeas corpus rules 
adoption of the total exhaustion rule would also deter prisoners from bringing additional,piecemeal litigation.see ross,at.a prisoner whose mixed complaint was dismissed by the district court would be left with two options.first,he could wait until all of his claims are exhausted and the action at that time.or,he could simply institute an action with only the exhausted claims,and then later bring other actions in court after the other issues have been fully addressed through the prison grievance process.while it is true that an action would require an additional filing fee,we reject the notion that this rule is unduly punitive,because it does not prevent the prisoner from proceeding in forma pauperis.contra jenkins toombs,d at.under the total exhaustion rule,a prisoner will have the choice of bringing forth each exhausted claim one at a time,at a potentially greater expense to himself,or to wait and bring all exhausted claims together in one action.
furthermore,we reject the notion that the total exhaustion rule would create additional,rather than fewer,prisoner lawsuits.contra ortiz,at noting that such a regimen would create an incentive for prisoners to file section claims,if they have more than one,in more than one lawsuit.even the ortiz court recognized that there are significant procedural rules in place that would encourage bringing all exhausted claims in one action,rather than filing separate actions for each individual claim.see id.at.the most obvious deterrent is the filing fee.however,the three strikes rule,codified in g,creates an additional incentive for prisoners to join all of their issues in one action 
finally,we believe that the total exhaustion rule could be easily administered by the district courts.as noted in ross,this rule would relieve district courts of the duty to determine whether certain exhausted claims are severable from other unexhausted claims that they are required to dismiss.at citing rose lundy,d.the district courts would simply apply the familiar rule from the habeas context to claims.furthermore,prisoners who are well acquainted with this rule in the habeas context should be expected to adhere to this straightforward exhaustion requirement in the context.id.
for the reasons stated above,we now adopt the total exhaustion rule and we reverse and remand this case to the district court to dismiss jones bey petition without prejudice 
while i join,in part,the majority ultimate conclusion that first amendment retaliation claim against defendant johnson must be dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies i believe that the majority failed attempt to apply a total exhaustion rule is foreclosed by our prior decision in hartsfield vidor,cir.although i respectfully dissent from the exhaustion holding reached by my colleagues,i am not sure that a dissent is actually necessary because the majority decision constitutes a nullity to the extent that it conflicts with hartsfield.
in hartsfield,this court confronted exactly the same situation that we face today and reached the opposite conclusion.the in hartsfield filed a complaint with various claims against multiple defendants,some of which were exhausted and some of which were not.we held that the unexhausted claims must be dismissed however,we permitted the exhausted claims to move forward and be resolved on the merits.id.at.hartsfield is a binding opinion in this circuit,and it has been correctly cited in a number of our unpublished decisions as holding that if a complaint contains exhausted and unexhausted claims,the district court may address the merits of the exhausted claims and dismiss only those that are unexhausted.williams mcginnis,wl at cir citing hartsfield,at accord fisher wickstrom,wl at cir mcelhaney elo,wl at cir wash rout,wl at cir riley richards,wl at cir.additionally,even if one were to argue that hartsfield did not expressly hold that a partial exhaustion rule applies,the hartsfield panel indisputably could not have decided the case in the way that it did if total exhaustion was required.thus,hartsfield definitively foreclosed the application of the total exhaustion rule in this circuit.
the majority completely ignores hartsfield import,instead relying on our subsequent opinion in knuckles el toombs,in which we purported to reserve for another day the question of whether exhausted claims in a mixed complaint may move forward.see,cir.however,the majority reliance on knuckles el is misplaced knuckles el failed to even cite to hartsfield,and thus it incorrectly described the state of plra exhaustion in this circuit.the question knuckles el claimed to leave open was not an open question at all it had already been answered in hartsfield.furthermore,because hartsfield was decided first,subsequent panels are required to follow it under cir.c,which mandates that r eported panel opinions are binding on subsequent panels.thus,no subsequent panel overrules a published opinion of a previous panel.court en banc consideration is required to overrule a published opinion of the court.see united states davis,cir citing rule c valentine francis,cir same.because we are bound by hartsfield unless and until the en banc court holds otherwise,the majority contrary opinion is not the controlling law in the sixth circuit,and should not be followed by future panels of this court.
the majority feebly attempts to disclaim the precedential value of hartsfield by noting that the same judge authored both hartsfield and knuckles el,and that i sat on the knuckles el panel however,these facts are of no consequence whatsoever.regardless of its author or panel membership,it is clear that knuckles el incorrectly construed the state of exhaustion law in this court by improperly ignoring precedent.in addition,the majority suggestion that hartsfield was unclear is undermined by the fact that numerous panels properly construed hartsfield both before and after the issuance of knuckles el.see,williams,wl decided after knuckles el fisher,wl same mcelhaney,wl same wash,wl decided before knuckles el riley,wl same instead of acknowledging that knuckles el mistakenly overlooked precedent,the majority condemns itself to repeat the mistake by once again misconstruing hartsfield.
notwithstanding the fact that the majority holding ignores the principle of stare decisis,its reliance on the plra language to apply the total exhaustion rule is unpersuasive.while it is true that a states that no action shall be brought as opposed to no claim,it does not follow that the only possible response to the impermissibility of the bringing of the action is to dismiss it in its entirety to kill it rather than to cure it.ortiz mcbride,cir.the text of a is far too ambiguous to sustain the conclusion that congress intended for a total exhaustion rule to be applied.id at quoting rose lundy,d see also henderson sebastian,wl at,quoting alexander davis,d,noting that courts have characterized this linguistic interpretation as a thin reed on which to base such a weighty conclusion.it is precisely because of this ambiguity that the majority must necessarily perform a gymnastic interpretation of other subsections of the statute in order to reach its conclusion that congress intended total exhaustion.
the majority discussion of c is entirely unhelpful,inasmuch as that section appears to use the term action interchangeably with claim.henderson,wl at.additionally,applying the tenet of statutory construction that similar language contained within the same statute must be accorded a consistent meaning,national credit union administration first national bank and trust,d,under a total exhaustion regime the application of a consistent meaning to action in a and c renders subsection c superfluous.section c states that a court shall dismiss any action brought if the court is satisfied that the action is frivolous,malicious,while c states that i n the event that a claim is,on its face,frivolous,malicious,the court may dismiss the underlying claim without first requiring the exhaustion of administrative remedies.in order to be consistent,a court would be required to dismiss a prisoner entire complaint under subsection c if any of the claims therein were found to be frivolous or insufficient to justify relief.jenkins toombs,d.however,if subsection c requires dismissal of an action for frivolousness,then subsection c reference to dismissal of frivolous claims would be entirely unnecessary.accord hubbard thakur,d.
because the statutory language does not unambiguously require total exhaustion,the majority turns its discussion to the purposes behind the plra.it is undisputed that congress enacted a to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of prisoner suits.porter nussle,d.however,the purposes underlying the statute are better served by a partial exhaustion rule than by the total exhaustion rule advocated by the majority.there is a danger that rather than lessening the number of suits filed,the total exhaustion rule will increase piecemeal litigation by encouraging prisoners to file additional lawsuits.see ortiz,at holding that it is doubtful that dismissing actions rather than individual claims will do more than require plaintiffs who bring mixed actions to refile their claims with the claims that were held by the district court to be unexhausted simply omitted.in other words,prisoners are likely to simply amend their complaints to eliminate the unexhausted claims and refile,leaving the district court with exactly the same claims that could have been resolved at the outset.jenkins toombs,d.consequently,the partial exhaustion rule is more efficient,and thus more in line with the purposes of the plra,than the total exhaustion rule the majority seeks to adopt.in addition,regardless of whether total or partial exhaustion is applied,prisoners are still required to fully exhaust any claims they wish to press in federal court,and district courts are clearly barred from resolving any grievances which have not be
