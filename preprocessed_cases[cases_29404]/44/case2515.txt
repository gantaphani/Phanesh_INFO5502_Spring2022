the death of calvin champion champion shortly after being detained,restrained,and subdued by nashville police officers presents us with a difficult issue of whether the officers are entitled to qualified immunity such that we should reverse a jury verdict rendered against them.on april,champion overwhelmed the facilities of his caregiver,promoting a response by the nashville police.three nashville police officers,debbie miller miller,richard woodside woodside,and craig dickhaus dickhaus collectively defendants or officers,subdued champion with pepper spray and physical restraints.at trial,five different witnesses testified that after champion was handcuffed and his feet were bound,the officers continued to pepper spray champion and to apply pressure to champion back as he lay on his stomach.champion died en route to the hospital shortly after this incident.champion father,calvin champion,and champion sister,jetonne,together plaintiffs brought an action against the officers pursuant to.a jury awarded the plaintiffs in damages for champion physical and mental pain and suffering.following the return of the verdict,the district court denied the officers motion for a judgment as a matter of law or a new trial or remittitur,in which they argued that they were entitled to qualified immunity and that the verdict was excessive.
while the officers undoubtedly faced unenviable choices in their interactions with champion,they are not entitled to qualified immunity.based upon the testimony presented at trial,the officers actions in this particular situation violated champion clearly established rights.consequently,we affirm the judgment of the district court,which upheld the jury verdict.
facts and procedure 
factual background 
the parties mostly agree on the anguishing series of events that culminated in champion death,but they differ with regards to the most crucial moments of the incident.champion,who was years old at the time of his death,completely lacked the ability to care for himself on account of his autism.he was nonresponsive and unable to speak.outlook nashville,outlook,which provided care for developmentally disabled individuals,was responsible for his.on april,jolene delelys delelys,an outlook employee,watched over champion.upon departing from a nashville babies r us store,where delelys had taken champion and her son devin,champion began to have a behavior.delelys had neglected to seatbelt champion,and champion began to move around delelys minivan,hitting himself in the face and biting his hand,which was a type of behavior champion frequently exhibited.delelys stated that champion was very agitated,slapping his own head harder than usual,biting his own hand harder than usual,slapping the top of devin head,shaking devin hand.joint appendix at.
delelys stopped the van,fearing that champion behavior would further escalate.delelys and champion both exited the van.champion grabbed delelys right hand and started to rub her hand all over his head,a response which,unbeknownst to delelys,had helped champion to calm down in the past.delelys became frightened.she broke away from champion and locked herself in the van,realizing she had lost control.delelys tried to get help.she failed in her repeated attempts to call the outlook emergency number.finally,delelys called.right after she finished her phone call,officer debbie miller appeared at the window,having been alerted to the developing problem by other babies r us customers who had phoned.delelys informed miller that champion was mentally ill,but delelys did not tell miller that champion was nonverbal and nonresponsive.
miller approached champion,asking him for his name and to explain the reason for his agitation.champion was hitting and biting himself as he began to approach miller.miller told champion to stop,but champion kept advancing towards miller.miller had walked backwards about fifty feet through the parking lot,retreating from champion,when champion grabbed miller shirt.miller pushed champion hand away and delivered a short burst of pepper spray to champion face.
champion walked dazedly into the babies r us.miller followed him into the store,and after a few minutes she touched him on the arm and ordered him to leave.champion responded to this command,giving miller the false impression that champion actually understood her.just as the two exited the store,officer richard woodside arrived.miller informed woodside that champion was police code for mentally ill individual and that she had previously sprayed champion with pepper spray.miller and woodside attempted to arrest champion outside the store,but the officers struggled with champion until officer craig dickhaus arrived.the officers decided to take champion to the ground in the entrance foyer of the store,an area with carpeting.as miller described it,woodside bends or squats down to where he has his arms wrapped around,a bear hug position if you will,of champion lower legs.and as officer dickhaus and myself step forward,we bring champion down to his knees,and then from his knees we gently lay him from his knees,his knees to his stomach,and down on his chest to the ground.at.
once on the ground champion struggled.the officers handcuffed champion using two sets of handcuffs so as to allow champion more movement.champion continued to squirm and move around.because woodside had difficulty controlling champion feet,which were kicking high into the air,miller and dickhaus decided to restrain champion further through the use of a hobble device,which essentially binds an individual ankles together.the officers had difficulty putting on the hobble device because champion was still kicking violently,but they eventually hobbled him.
the parties divergent recounting of what occurred in the seventeen minutes between the application of the hobbling device and the arrival of the emergency medical technicians emt was one of the most significant factual issues at trial and is the axis around which this appeal revolves.the plaintiffs have not suggested that the officers acted improperly before champion was handcuffed and hobbled.indeed,the plaintiffs entire claim is premised on the officers alleged use of pepper spray and application of asphyxiating pressure after champion incapacitation.the parties disagreed during trial,and continue to diverge,in their respective understandings of how much force the officers used after champion was incapacitated on the ground.
after several minutes of being on the ground,champion began to vomit.woodside immediately called for an ambulance.between champion first regurgitation and the arrival of the emts,champion vomited two more times.each time,according to the officers,dickhaus and miller pulled champion back by the arms so that he would not be lying in his own vomit.they also checked champion mouth and nose to ensure that he was still breathing.the officers reported that after vomiting,champion was alert,blinking,breathing,and moving his head from.
the emts entered the store shortly after champion vomited for a third time.the first emt to view champion was douglas baggett baggett.baggett testified that as he stepped over champion,he noticed that champion legs moved a couple of inches,which gave baggett the impression that champion was alive.then,champion belly rose,his back rose up,and then he vomited,at baggett test,such that baggett thought he was watching champion take his last breath.at.baggett failed to find a pulse on champion and asked the officers to remove the handcuffs,which they promptly did.champion went into cardiac arrest despite effort to resuscitate him,he was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.
all three officers claim that none of them put pressure on champion back or pressed champion face into the floor such that he could not breathe during this entire time period.see at,dickhaus test.at miller test.not only did i not lie across champion back,lie across his legs,or kick him,i took extra care myself to make sure that champion did not receive any injuries from the ground w e knew he had a mental problem.at woodside test.additionally,the officers claimed that champion was not sprayed again with chemicals after he was on the ground.at dickhaus test.at woodside test.paramedic douglas sleighter,who is extremely sensitive to pepper spray such that he feels its effects if it is sprayed near him or on another individual near him,testified that he did not detect any pepper spray on champion during the course of the ambulance ride.
however,five different lay witnesses testified that the officers continued to sit or otherwise put pressure on champion back while he was prone on the ground with his face towards the carpet.at ballenger test.recalling that the officers were lying on top of champion at buford test.they were laying on him,like how wrestlers do in the ring,they were just body was on him,all their strength was on him.at jamerson test.i saw three officers on top of him.at martinez test.they were holding him down,laying on top of him after he was already down t hey are on top of him and with their elbows,and basically laying on top of him.at simpson test.i believe there was another officer with his knee in the middle of his back.additionally,these witnesses testified that the officers continued to use pepper spray on champion after he was subdued on the ground and had stopped resisting.at ballenger test.champion turned his head to move and breathe and the female officer maced him.at jamerson test.testifying that miller sprayed champion twice and that champion subsequently turned white at martinez test.well,he was on the ground already and miller maced him again after he was already handcuffed.at simpson test.he turned his face to breathe and then he got sprayed again.all of these witnesses stated that they did not see champion struggle during this time.there were some inconsistencies,however,in the witnesses stories,particularly with regard to the length of time that various activities regarding champion went on and the number of officers who were lying on him after they brought him to the ground.
procedural history 
plaintiffs filed their action on june.the complaint featured several different claims against an array of defendants,but most of the claims were dismissed,leaving only negligence claims against outlook and delelys and claims against the three officers premised upon violations of champion rights under the fourth amendment excessive force and fourteenth amendment failure to render medical assistance.following discovery,the government defendants filed a motion for summary judgment,alleging for the first time that qualified immunity insulated the officers from liability.the district court ruled that the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity and denied the officers motion for summary judgment.the officers did not appeal this ruling.
the parties prepared for trial.on july,the officers filed a motion in limine objecting to the inclusion of the testimony of the plaintiffs three experts,michael dorsey dorsey,kris sperry sperry,and geoffrey alpert alpert.the district court denied the motion in part,permitting sperry and alpert to testify.
the trial began on august.the jury heard contradictory testimony from the officers,the witnesses,and several experts regarding the amount of force exerted against champion,champion cause of death,and the level of pain and suffering champion might have endured.before the jury retired,the officers filed a motion for a judgment as a matter of law,which was denied.the jury returned a verdict on august.it found outlook and delelys liable in the amount of million for their negligence.the jury also found each police officer liable to the plaintiffs in the amount of each.
the officers filed a combined motion,renewing their motion for a judgment as a matter of law,or in the alternative,seeking a new trial or remittitur.the officers based their renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law on qualified immunity.at.the district court denied the officers motion on november,ruling that b ased on the facts at trial,taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,the officers conduct violated the plaintiff constitutional right not to be subjected to excessive force and that right was clearly established at the time of the officers conduct.at.the district court also ruled that the verdicts against the officers were not excessive.
the officers timely appealed several of the district court rulings,including the order denying in part the motion for summary judgment the district court ruling on alpert testimony and the denial of the officers motion for judgment as a matter of law,or in the alternative a new trial remittitur.
ii.analysis 
standards of review 
we evaluate the decisions of the district court through several different lenses.the officers ask us to review both the denial of their motion for summary judgment and the denial of their motion for a judgment as a matter of law,which was initially filed before the jury retired pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a and was renewed after the return of the jury verdict pursuant to rule b.see.a b.all of these motions concerned the officers alleged qualified immunity from liability.i n cases where an appellant made a rule motion for summary judgment that was denied,makes those same arguments in a rule a motion at the close of evidence that was also denied,lost in front of a jury,then renewed its arguments in a rejected rule b motion after the entry of judgment,we will review only the denial of the rule b motion.k t,zurich ins,cir.r eviewing a rule determination is preferable to reviewing a summary judgment decision because the rule decision is based on the complete trial record and not the incomplete pretrial record available at summary judgment.id.quotation omitted.
thus,we review de novo the denial of the rule b motion,but our de novo review is narrowed by the test for evaluating a renewed rule b motion.garrison cassens transp,cir monday oullette,cir.the supreme court has held,
i n entertaining a motion for judgment as a matter of law,the court should review all of the evidence in the record.
in doing so,however,the court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence a lthough the court should review the record as a whole,it must disregard all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe.that is,the court should give credence to the evidence favoring the nonmovant as well as that evidence supporting the moving party that is uncontradicted and unimpeached,at least to the extent that that evidence comes from disinterested witnesses.
reeves sanderson plumbing,d citations and quotations omitted.the motion should be granted,and the district court reversed,only if reasonable minds could not come to a conclusion other than one favoring the movant.garrison,at quotation omitted.
our review is further complicated by the underlying qualified immunity question.the issue of whether qualified immunity is applicable to an official actions is a question of law.dickerson mcclellan,cir.however,where the legal question of qualified immunity turns upon which version of the facts one accepts,the jury,not the judge,must determine liability.pouillon city of owosso,cir quotation and ellipses omitted.thus,to the extent that there is disagreement about the facts,such as whether the officers put their body weight on champion and him after he was handcuffed and hobbled,we must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,taking all inferences in their favor.we can not weigh the evidence or make credibility assessments,and we are acutely aware that a jury,faced directly with the tasks we can not undertake,believed the evidence presented by the plaintiffs.
we employ a different method of review for the two other issues raised on appeal by the officers.we review for an abuse of discretion the district court denial of the officers motion for a new trial remittitur filed pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.gregory shelby county,cir.we also review for an abuse of discretion the district court decision to allow geoffrey alpert expert testimony.pride bic,cir.
qualified immunity 
in actions involving the alleged abuse of government power,the defense of qualified immunity accommodates the tension between permitting litigants to recover damages,which is often the only realistic avenue for vindication of constitutional guarantees,harlow fitzgerald,d,and the social costs of such suits,including the expenses of litigation,the diversion of official energy from pressing public issues,and the deterrence of able citizens from acceptance of public office.id.qualified immunity provides that government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.id.at.we employ a inquiry for determining whether qualified immunity is proper 
first,we determine whether,based upon the applicable law,the facts viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs show that a constitutional violation has occurred.second,we consider whether the violation involved a clearly established constitutional right of which a reasonable person would have known.third,we determine whether the plaintiff has offered sufficient evidence to indicate that what the official allegedly did was objectively unreasonable in light of the clearly established constitutional rights.
feathers aey,cir emphasis added quotation omitted.if the answer to all three questions is yes,qualified immunity is not proper.
the occurrence of a constitutional violation 
first,we consider whether the facts,when taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,demonstrate the occurrence of a constitutional violation.see saucier katz,d taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,do the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right this must be the initial inquiry.this is a threshold question that often requires the setting forth of legal principles which will become the basis for a holding that a right is clearly established.id.a ll claims that law enforcement officers have used excessive or the course of an arrest,investigatory stop,or other seizure of a free citizen should be analyzed under the fourth amendment and its reasonableness standard.graham connor,d.the test proper application requires careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case,including the severity of the crime at issue,whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others,and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.id.at.to take the facts in a light most favorable to plaintiffs is to assume that the officers lay on top of champion,a mentally retarded individual who had stopped resisting arrest and posed no flight risk,and sprayed him with pepper spray even after he was immobilized by handcuffs and a hobbling device.the use of such force is not objectively reasonable,as the officers conceded at oral argument for the purposes of focusing on the question of whether champion right to be free from this particular type of force was clearly established.
a clearly established right 
the first feathers inquiry bleeds into the second question of whether the constitutional right was clearly established,which is the focus of the parties on appeal.if the law at that time was not clearly established,an official could not fairly be said to know that the law forbade conduct not previously identified as unlawful.harlow,at.t he right the official is alleged to have violated must have been clearly established in a more particularized,and hence more relevant,sense the contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.anderson creighton,d.officials do not enjoy qualified immunity simply because the exact action in question has not previously been held unlawful by a court,but in the light of law the unlawfulness must be apparent.id.in the context,it is not enough for a plaintiff to demonstrate that an officer use of force exceeded the objective standard of reasonableness articulated in graham.saucier,at.rather,qualified immunity is proper unless it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his use of excessive force was unlawful in the situation he confronted.id.at.
the supreme court has refused to require that a plaintiff demonstrate the existence of a fundamentally similar or materially similar case.hope pelzer,d.there can be notable factual distinctions between the precedents relied on so long as the prior decisions g i ve reasonable warning that the conduct then at issue violated constitutional rights.id.at.quotation omitted.o fficials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances.id.at.moreover,the fact that various courts have not agreed on one verbal formulation of the controlling standard does not by itself entitle an officer to qualified immunity.saucier,at.
to demonstrate that the officers unreasonably violated a clearly established right,the plaintiffs must therefore show the prior articulation of a prohibition against the type of excess force exerted here.in inquiring whether a constitutional right is clearly established,we must look first to decisions of the supreme court,then to decisions of this court and other courts within our circuit,and finally to decisions of other circuits.higgason stephens,cir.a n action unlawfulness can be apparent from direct holdings,from specific examples described as prohibited,or from the general reasoning that a court employs.feathers,at.other sources can also demonstrate the existence of a clearly established constitutional right in hope,the supreme court considered alabama state regulations and communications between the department of justice and the alabama department of corrections as evidence that the corporal punishment at issue in hope was clearly proscribed.hope,at.
our caselaw and the evidence presented at trial about the training that the officers received demonstrate that the force exerted against champion violated his clearly established fourth amendment rights.we have repeatedly stated that the right to be free from excessive force is a clearly established fourth amendment right.neague cynkar,cir decided after saucier.for example,we have articulated a clearly established right to be free from specific types of excessive force,such as handcuffing an individual too tightly.see walton city of southfield,cir.we have also consistently held that various types of force applied after the subduing of a suspect are unreasonable and a violation of a clearly established right.see,phelps coy,cir t here was simply no governmental interest in continuing to beat phelps after he had been neutralized,nor could a reasonable officer have thought there was.mcdowell rogers,cir a totally gratuitous blow with a policeman nightstick may cross the constitutional line.lewis downs,cir the unprovoked and unnecessary striking of a handcuffed citizen in the mouth with a nightstick is clearly excessive.
the particular type of physical force exerted against champion was unreasonable,and the officers should have been aware that they were violating champion rights.first,it is clearly established that the officers use of pepper spray against champion after he was handcuffed and hobbled was excessive.in adams metiva,cir,a plaintiff was sprayed with mace by authorities.id.at.the police then handcuffed the plaintiff,placed him in his car,and according to the plaintiff and two witnesses,continued to spray mace in the plaintiff face even though he was already blinded and incapacitated.id.we held that this use of force was excessive,and we denied the officers qualified immunity because a reasonable person would know that spraying mace on a blinded and incapacitated person would violate the right to be free from excessive force.id.at see also vinyard wilson,cir courts have consistently concluded that using pepper spray is excessive force in cases where the arrestee surrenders,is secured,and is not acting violently,and there is no threat to the officers or anyone else.
in addition to prior precedent,the officers training demonstrates that they were aware of champion clearly established right to be free from this type of excessive force.the officers were taught that pepper spraying a suspect after the individual was incapacitated constitutes excessive force.sergeant robert allen,who testified about the training the nashville police officers received,agreed that if champion were handcuffed and hobbled,spraying him with pepper spray would be excessive.
second,it also clearly established that putting substantial or significant pressure on a suspect back while that suspect is in a prone position after being subdued incapacitated constitutes excessive force.this appeal gives us no cause to consider whether leaving a bound suspect on his or her stomach without more constitutes excessive force that violates a suspect clearly established fourth amendment rights.this is neither a positional asphyxia case nor a case in which the officers lightly touched or placed incidental pressure on champion back while he was face down.the asphyxia was caused by the combination of the officers placing their weight upon champion body by lying across his back and simultaneously pepper spraying him creating asphyxiating conditions by putting substantial or significant pressure,such as body weight,on the back of an incapacitated and bound suspect constitutes objectively unreasonable excessive force.for example,in simpson hines,cir,several police officers entered an inmate cell,placed the inmate in a neckhold,and put strong pressure upon his chest.id.at.the inmate died as a result,and a physician report suggested that the inmate may have died as a result of the pressure placed upon his chest.id.the fifth circuit denied qualified immunity to the officers,ruling that any reasonable officer would have known that the force exerted was excessive and thus constitutionally deficient.id.other district courts in our circuit have highlighted the dangers of putting pressure on a prone,bound,and agitated detainee.swans city of lansing,d,jury awarded verdict to a mentally ill arrestee who was johnson city of cincinnati,d,finding that information existed in the law enforcement community,which put officers on notice of the dangers of positional asphyxiation.
additionally,the officers training outlined the boundaries of excessive force and made clear that lying on a suspect can cause asphyxiation.all three officers admitted that they were aware of the potential danger of putting pressure on an individual back or diaphragm.at dickhaus test.i believe our training was once he is under control we are to sit him up physically at miller test.at woodside test.additionally,sergeant allen testified that he taught his officers that lying across an individual back when that person is on his or her stomach increases the possibility of asphyxia.just as the supreme court determined that the alabama department of corrections regulations and the communications between the department of justice and the state of alabama put the state on notice about what constituted cruel and unusual punishment,so too here the training these officers received alerted them to the potential danger of this particular type of excessive force.see hope,at.
it can not be forgotten that the police were confronting an individual whom they knew to be mentally ill or retarded,even though the officers may not have known the full extent of champion autism and his unresponsiveness.the diminished capacity of an unarmed detainee must be taken into account when assessing the amount of force exerted.see deorle rutherford,cir w here it is or should be apparent to the officers that the individual involved is emotionally disturbed,that is a factor that must be considered in determining the reasonableness of the force employed.for example,in drummond city of anaheim,cir,officers handcuffed a mentally ill individual and leaned their body weight onto his upper torso.id.at.the officers then applied a hobble device.drummond fell into respiratory distress and eventually a coma.id.at.the court held that the district court grant of summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity was not proper because the officers had violated drummond clearly established rights.id.at.it stated,any reasonable officer should have known that such conduct constituted the use of excessive force.id.at.drummond postdated the events that led to champion death,but it relies on cases decided before april,including the swans case and notes that when officers receive training explaining the dangers of asphyxia,they are on notice that applying pressure to an arrestee back is objectively unreasonable.
consequently,the right to be free from the two types of excessive force exerted against champion was clearly established by the law of this circuit and by the training of the officers.either action by itself violated a clearly established right,and the combination of the actions bolsters the conclusion that no reasonable officer could believe that excessive force was not being used.we recognize that the officers perhaps did not intend to harm champion indeed,they may have believed they were helping him.such a consideration is immaterial,however,because the qualified immunity doctrine is an objective one motive is irrelevant.the evidence presented in the light most favorable to champion,and in the light accepted by the jury,demonstrates that the officers unreasonably applied excessive force to champion after he had been incapacitated in violation of champion clearly established rights.no reasonable officer would have continued to spray a chemical agent in the face of a handcuffed and hobbled mentally retarded arrestee,who was moving his or her head from side to side in an attempt to breathe,after the arrestee vomited several times.no reasonable officer would continue to put pressure on that arrestee back after the arrestee was subdued by handcuffs,an ankle restraint,and a police officer holding the arrestee legs.
the officers concentrate their efforts on the evidence presented at trial that champion may have died from a preexisting medical condition unrelated to his treatment by the police and that the pepper spray was unlikely to contribute to champion vomiting or his death.in particular,the defendants medical expert,wetli,testified that champion injuries were inconsistent with a death caused by officers lying across champion back.at wetli test.this evidence is unavailing for two reasons.first,the plaintiffs presented contradictory evidence,and the jury believed the plaintiffs experts and the witnesses who viewed the officers lying on champion back more than the defendants witnesses.second,the officers argument sidesteps the point even if champion had not died,but had only been injured,his clearly established rights were no less violated.
sufficiency of evidence 
finally,the panel must determine whether the plaintiff offered sufficient evidence to indicate that what the official allegedly did was objectively unreasonable in light of the clearly established constitutional rights.feathers,at.as described in detail above,the plaintiffs presented such evidence at trial.the fact that a jury found in his favor further underscores the sufficiency of the evidence.
conclusion 
in sum,all three feathers inquiries have been answered in the affirmative.we therefore affirm the district court denial of qualified immunity to the officers.
c.the verdict amount 
the officers contend that they are entitled to a new trial,or at least a remittitur,because the jury award of per officer,which only compensates for champion physical and mental pain and suffering,is excessive.in essence,the officers suggest that a cumulative verdict of against the officers for at most a period of physical and mental pain and suffering is excessive.def.br.at.because the officers ask us to undertake a sissiphyean task of comparing champion pain and suffering to other forms of pain and suffering and because the award does not shock the conscience,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the officers motion.
we undertake a highly deferential review of the district
