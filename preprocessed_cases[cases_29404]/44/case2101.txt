qualified immunity is an entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of litigation.mitchell forsyth,d.the initial question is whether,taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right.saucier katz,d.we can not pretermit whether a constitutional violation is properly alleged.siegert gilley,d.
second,even where the officer violated constitutional rights,we ask whether the contours of the constitutional right in question were sufficiently clear that a reasonable officer would understand that what he is doing violates that right.estep dallas county,texas,cir citation omitted.although there does not have to be a case directly on point,petta rivera,cir,the plaintiff should seek to identify cases of controlling authority in the jurisdiction at the time of the incident which clearly establish the rule on which they seek to rely,or a consensus of cases of persuasive authority such that a reasonable officer could not have believed that his actions were lawful.wilson layne,d.qualified immunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.wooley city of baton rouge,cir.an official conduct is therefore objectively reasonable unless all reasonable officials would have realized the particular challenged conduct violated the constitutional provisions sued on.id.
