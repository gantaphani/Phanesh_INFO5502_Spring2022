sandra humenny began her employment with genex,genex in july of as an area sales manager asm for the midwest region.in her position as asm,appellant sold genex services directly to genex customers and reported to a regional sales manager rsm.in november of,genex hired tom sebold sebold as an rsm in the midwest region.the following december,appellant was promoted to an rsm position with significantly increased compensation.in her new position,appellant supervisor was appellee carol valentic valentic,regional vice president of genex.valentic reported directly to the vice president of genex,delphia frisch frisch.
appellees allege that,as early as the fall of,frisch and valentic began discussing plans for the reorganization of the midwest region of genex and the elimination of one of the rsm positions.frisch and valentic claim that,by august and september of,they decided to eliminate one of the rsm positions and replace it with a regional account executive rae position.appellees allege that they compared the performances of sebold and appellant and decided to retain sebold in the rsm position and to transfer appellant to the rae position.appellant,however,alleges that she had always performed better than sebold in the rsm position.
october to of,genex held its annual regional meeting in chicago,illinois.appellant was unable to attend the meeting because of a personal emergency regarding her ailing mother.following the meeting,valentic contacted appellant to express concerns about the performances of two of appellant asms.during that conversation,valentic asked appellant to develop a plan for each of appellant asms.appellant alleges that valentic told her to either take a unprotected leave or perform her job at including overnight travel,or she would be fired.appellees contend that valentic stated only that appellant should consider taking a leave of absence to care for her ill mother and that marie beppel beppel,senior vice president of human resources,could discuss with appellant the available leave options.appellees further allege that travel had always been a requirement for the job,which appellant denies.
appellant alleges that,on november,she overheard a conversation between valentic and frisch in which valentic stated that she could not stand to see appellant anymore and that appellant could not continue to disparage the company because of valentic response to appellant requests for leave.appellant further states that she heard valentic ask frisch whether frisch was all right with valentic plan.the next day,valentic called appellant to her office and informed appellant that she was being transferred to the rae position.on november,appellant asked valentic for a job description of the rae position.appellant alleges that valentic refused the request and told appellant that valentic had serious doubts about working with appellant.

iii.discussion 
a.the fmla eligible employee requirement 
the fmla excludes from coverage any employee of an employer who is employed at a worksite at which such employer employs less than employees if the total number of employees employed by that employer within miles of that worksite is less than.b ii.where a plaintiff does not qualify as an eligible employee,the court lacks jurisdiction to decide the fmla case.douglas baldwin,cir.argues that the eligible employee requirement should not be applied where an employee brings a retaliation claim under the fmla rather than merely alleging entitlement to fmla leave.appellant concedes that she was not entitled to rights under the fmla because genex employed fewer than employees within miles of appellant worksite.rather,appellant claims that appellees demoted and eventually dismissed her for attempting to assert rights to which she,in good faith,believed she was entitled under the fmla.accordingly,appellant argues that she should be able to assert a retaliation claim against appellees.
appellant notes that both the first and eleventh circuits have held that an employee who is not eligible for leave under the fmla nonetheless may state a claim for fmla retaliation.however,as the district court correctly concluded,the cases to which appellant cites for this proposition are not on point.the first and eleventh circuit cases held only that a former employee may state a claim for retaliation where the former employer refuses to the employee for exercising fmla leave rights while employed.smith bellsouth telecommunications,cir duckworth pratt whitney,cir.in both cases,the plaintiffs qualified as eligible employees at the time they took fmla leave.smith,at duckworth,at.appellant in this case never qualified for fmla leave.
appellant further argues that the language of the fmla retaliation provisions and the regulations passed in accordance with the fmla lend support to her argument.the fmla retaliation provisions state 
exercise of rights 
it shall be unlawful for any employer to interfere with,restrain,or deny the exercise of or the attempt to exercise,any right provided under this subchapter.
discrimination 
it shall be unlawful for any employer to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any individual for opposing any practice made unlawful by this subchapter.
a.appellant argues that the statute use of the words employee and individual indicates that these retaliation provisions apply regardless of whether an employee is eligible for leave under the statute.however,a close reading of the statute reveals that the retaliation provisions prohibit employers from retaliating based on the exercise of a right under the statute.the regulations provide similar protection by prohibiting retaliation based on the exercise of any rights provided by the act.a.because appellant is not an eligible employee,appellant has never exercised or attempted to exercise any rights provided to her by the fmla.
this court has already held that in an fmla retaliation case,even
