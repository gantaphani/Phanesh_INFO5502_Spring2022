robbin frost,a licensed podiatrist,was driving alone in her husband pontiac bonneville when she was severely injured in a collision caused by an underinsured motorist.so far,she has collected in insurance proceeds she seeks further payment from peerless indemnity insurance and peerless insurance together,peerless,who issued business owner and policies to frost podiatric practice,lake region family foot and ankle center,lake region.peerless sued in federal district court for a declaratory judgment that it had no duty to pay for any of frost injuries or damages.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of peerless.frost appeals.
we affirm the district court decision on the ground that maine motorist statute.tit.a,does not apply to the peerless policies issued to lake region.
on appeal from the district court summary judgment order,we review the relevant facts in the light most favorable to the party against whom judgment was granted here,frost and draw all reasonable inferences in her favor.kelley corr.med,cir.the facts here are drawn from the pleadings and statements submitted by frost to the district court,as well as the undisputed documentary evidence.
a.the accident 
frost is the sole stockholder and executive officer of lake region,a maine professional association with a surgical practice office in windham,maine.on may,frost set out from lake region office in windham to the mercy hospital in portland,where she was scheduled to perform several podiatric surgical procedures.the car she was driving,a pontiac bonneville,was titled to her husband,but frost was the primary user of the automobile and the vehicle registration showed both frost and her husband as.
while traveling east along route,frost brought the pontiac to a stop at a traffic light in the town of gray,maine.the driver of a second vehicle stopped behind her.as frost and the second driver waited at the traffic light,the driver of a third vehicle came from behind at an unsafe speed and failed to bring his vehicle to a halt,colliding with the second car and pushing it violently into the rear of the pontiac bonneville.
frost suffered severe injuries as a result of the collision,including permanent disfigurement and loss of her eyesight.the injuries have forced frost to discontinue her podiatric practice.frost has stated in her pleadings that her injuries and damages as a result of the collision are well in excess of million.peerless concedes that frost injuries and damages are at least in excess of million.
b.the insurance policies 
frost and the driver of the second vehicle both sought to recover damages from the driver of the third vehicle,whose negligence appears to have been the sole proximate cause of the collision.the driver of the third vehicle was covered under an automobile insurance policy issued by aiu insurance aiu.that policy provided coverage for bodily injury and property damage of up to a maximum of per accident.frost herself was covered under an automobile insurance policy issued by progressive northwestern insurance progressive,which provided motorist coverage of up to a maximum of per person.
aiu agreed to pay to frost in connection with the accident this sum represented the full amount of coverage remaining under the negligent driver liability policy after the second driver was compensated for his injuries.meanwhile,progressive agreed to pay frost,which represented the maximum underinsured motorist coverage under the policy minus the amount frost already had received from aiu.
frost podiatric practice,lake region,also had two insurance policies in effect at the time of the accident a business owner policy issued by peerless indemnity insurance and a commercial umbrella policy issued by peerless insurance.the business owner policy provided coverage to lake region for liability and medical expenses of up to million per occurrence the umbrella policy provided additional coverage for up to million.
business owner policy.the business owner policy explicitly excluded liability coverage for bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership,maintenance,use or entrustment to others of any auto owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured.an exception to that exclusion,however,effectively provided liability coverage for bodily injury or property damage arising out of valet parking on the business premises.
despite this explicit exclusion of automobile liability coverage,the business owner policy was subject to an endorsement for hired auto and non owned auto liability,which applied to bodily injury and property damage arising out of the use of a hired auto or auto by an employee of lake region in the course of business.the endorsement explicitly deleted the exclusion of automobile liability coverage f or insurance provided by this endorsement only.
the endorsement included a section entitled who is an insured,which read,in relevant part 
each of the following is an insured under this endorsement to the extent set forth below 
any other person using a hired auto with your permission 
for a auto,any partner or executive officer of yours,but only while such auto is being used in your business 
none of the following is an insured 
any partner or executive officer for any auto owned by such partner or officer or a member of his or her household 
the terms hired auto and auto were defined by the policy as follows 
hired auto means any auto you lease,hire,or borrow.this does not include any auto you lease,hire,or borrow from any of your employees or members of their households,or from any partners or executive officers of yours.
non owned auto means any auto you do not own,lease,hire,or borrow which is used in connection with your business 
umbrella policy.the umbrella policy likewise addressed automobile coverage.according to the policy terms 
w ith respect to the auto hazard 
a.you are an insured 
anyone else while using with your permission an auto you own,hire or borrow is also an insured except 
the owner or anyone else from whom you hire or borrow an auto 
your employee if the auto is owned by that employee or a member of his or her household 
the umbrella policy defined auto hazard to mean liability arising out of the ownership,maintenance,use or loading or unloading of any auto.the policy also stated that 
this insurance does not apply to 
motor vehicle laws and coverages 
motor vehicle law,first party physical damage coverage,personal injury protection coverage,uninsured motorists or underinsured motorists law or other laws or coverages similar to any of the foregoing.
when frost demanded payment from peerless under the business owner and umbrella policies for injuries and damages that resulted from the may,collision,peerless refused on the ground that it had no obligation under either policy to pay motorist benefits to frost with respect to the accident.peerless then filed a declaratory judgment complaint in federal district court in maine,invoking the court diversity jurisdiction under a frost counterclaimed for judgment in the amount of million against peerless indemnity insurance pursuant to the business owner policy and another million against peerless insurance pursuant to the umbrella policy.after peerless and frost filed for summary judgment,the district court concluded that the unambiguous language of both peerless policies excluded coverage for frost injuries and damages in the collision.the court entered judgment in favor of peerless on all claims,and this timely appeal followed.
we review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo.cruz bristol myers squibb,cir.peerless argues that the terms of lake region business owner and umbrella policies explicitly exclude coverage for automobiles owned by frost family members.frost concedes that the business owner and umbrella policies exclude liability coverage with respect to automobiles owned by her family members,but she argues that under maine law the peerless policies must be deemed to provide motorist coverage to frost.frost argument is based on a maine statute.tit.a,and the maine case law construing that statute.
maine motorist statute 
in,the maine legislature first enacted a statute requiring automobile liability insurers to provide coverage in their policies for injuries caused by uninsured tortfeasors.see connolly royal globe ins,me citing,ch,effective.in,the legislature extended the mandatory coverage provision so that it would apply to victims injured by underinsured as well as uninsured drivers.see id.since then,the legislature has amended the statute several more times,most recently in.in its present form,the statute provides that 
a policy insuring against liability arising out of the ownership,maintenance or use of any motor vehicle may not be delivered or issued for delivery in this state with respect to any such vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state,unless coverage is provided in the policy or supplemental to the policy for the protection of persons insured under the policy who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured,underinsured or motor vehicles,for bodily injury,sickness or disease,including death,sustained by an insured person resulting from the ownership,maintenance or use of such uninsured,underinsured or motor vehicle.
the statute reflects a strong public policy in favor of the just compensation of accident victims.beal allstate ins,me quoting wescott allstate,me internal quotation marks omitted.the obvious design of the statute is to protect a responsible insured motorist against the hazards presented by the operation of motor vehicles where injuries are inflicted in an accident with an irresponsible operator who is financially unable to furnish adequate compensation for the injuries caused in the accident.wescott,at see also beal,at t he legislative purpose of section was to allow an injured insured the same recovery which would have been available had the tortfeasor been insured to the same extent as the injured party.second alteration in original emphasis omitted quoting jipson liberty mut.fire ins,me.
under the statute,every automobile insurance policy in maine must provide motorist coverage of at least for injury to or death of one person and per accident for injury to or death of more than one person.see.tit.a,id.tit.a,c see also dairyland ins.christensen,me.stricter rules apply to automobile insurance policies insuring a single individual or one or more related individuals resident in the same household,as named insured.tit.a.these individual and household policies generally must provide motorist coverage at least equal to the amount of coverage for liability for bodily injury or death.id.a purchaser of an individual or household automobile insurance policy with liability coverage limits above the statutory minimum may choose to carry motorist coverage with lower only if she signs a statutorily prescribed form and only if her resulting motorist coverage is still at least for injury or death of one person and for injury or death of multiple persons.see id 
maine courts construe the protections of section liberally in favor of insureds and strictly against insurers.beal,at.the provisions of the motorist statute control even when not included in the insurance contract,and,to the extent that policy terms are repugnant to the express or implied requirements of the statute,they are void and unenforceable.wescott,at.moreover,when an insured victim settles with an underinsured tortfeasor for the limits of the tortfeasor liability insurance,the victim may still claim underinsured motorist benefits under her own insurance policy if her damages exceed the tortfeasor policy limits,provided that her insurance carrier has consented to the settlement or there is no prejudice to her carrier resulting from its lack of consent.beal,at.here,peerless consented to frost settlement with aiu and her settlement with progressive.
application to the peerless policies 
at issue in this case is whether lake region peerless policies count as polic ies insuring against liability arising out of the ownership,maintenance or use of any motor vehicle with respect to any such vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state for the purposes of maine motorist statute.tit.a.since the umbrella policy is parasitic on the underlying business owner policy,whether the umbrella policy is covered by the statute depends on whether the business owner policy is.for the following reasons,we conclude that the business owner policy is not covered by the statute 
the issue in this case is one of maine law.the maine law court has never definitively ruled on whether maine motorist statute applies to policies such as those peerless issued to lake region.when a state highest court has yet to rule definitively on a question of state law,our task is to predict how that court likely would decide the issue.rosciti ins.of,cir.
in carrying out that task,our first step is to consult pertinent statutory language gonzález figueroa penney,cir.on its face,maine motorist statute applies to polic ies insuring against liability arising out of the ownership,maintenance or use of any motor vehicle with respect to any such vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state.tit.a.given that the business owner policy includes the hired auto and non owned auto liability endorsement,that policy might theoretically be read as a policy insuring against liability arising out of the ownership,maintenance or use of any motor vehicle.but the statute goes on to limit its applicability to policies issued with respect to any such vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state.id.the statute,in other words,applies to insurance policies issued for specific motor vehicles.the business owner policy,however,was not issued with respect to any vehicle whatsoever it was issued with respect to the business of lake region.
frost argues that the phrase with respect to any such vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state is intended simply to describe the limits of state authority to regulate insurance policies not to confine the reach of the statute to particular types of policies.frost offers no support for that assertion,but even if she is correct,her reading does not alter the meaning of the limiting phrase.the statute is worded as a conditional prohibition on the delivery and issuance of insurance policies.tit.a,a policy may not be delivered or issued,unless certain conditions are met.the phrase with respect to circumscribes that conditional prohibition,limiting it to a policy insuring against liability arising out of the ownership,maintenance or use of any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state.id.whatever the purpose of the with respect to language and it seems likely that it is intended,in part,to delimit the state authority,that language still describes an insurance policy issued for specific vehicles.
that the motorist statute applies to insurance policies issued for specific motor vehicles is further supported by the next subsection of the statute,which establishes the amount of motorist coverage that must be provided.see id.in setting out the requirements,this section divides the universe of policies covered by the motorist statute between motor vehicle insurance policies subject to other sections of the maine insurance code and motor vehicle insurance policies not subject to those other sections.id.emphases added.in other words,the statute itself contemplates that it will apply only to motor vehicle insurance policies.even if the business owner policy might theoretically be characterized as a policy insuring against liability arising out of the ownership,maintenance or use of any motor vehicle,it is difficult to characterize the business owner policy as a motor vehicle insurance policy.
in predicting how the maine law court would decide this issue,we also look to analogous decisions of that court.see barton clancy,cir.though the law court has never explicitly deemed the motorist statute inapplicable outside the context of motor vehicle insurance policies,the court has repeatedly employed language to that effect,molleur dairyland ins,me the legislature requires that any motor vehicle policy written in maine provide coverage.emphasis added connolly,at in,the legislature originally enacted the uninsured vehicle coverage to require automobile liability insurers to provide uninsured vehicle coverage in the policies.emphasis added dufour metro.prop.liab.ins,me a m.provides that any automobile liability insurance policy delivered in maine and covering an automobile registered or principally garaged in maine must include uninsured motorist coverage emphasis added langley home indem,me stating that um statute applies to automobile liability insurance contract s.
furthermore,we may consult decisions of the state lower courts,even those that express considered dicta.rosciti,at see also dibella hopkins,cir statements by state lower courts,even if dicta,can be helpful indicators of state law.a maine trial court has suggested in dicta that an umbrella policy would not constitute a policy with respect to a vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state within the meaning of section.outram onebeacon ins.grp.llc,no.cv.lexis,at,first alteration in original.
moreover,we may consider any other reliable data tending convincingly to show how the highest court in the state would decide the issue at hand.michelin tires can.first nat.bank of,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.several pieces of legislative history reinforce the understanding that the statute applies only to motor vehicle policies.see,letter from alessandro iuppa,superintendent,state of me.dep t of prof l fin,bureau of,to lloyd lafountain,jane saxl joint standing comm.on banking ins,current law requires every motor vehicle policy issued in this state to include uninsured and underinsured motor vehicle coverage.emphasis added,at h me statement of lisa marraché the intent of the motorist law when it was first passed was for car insurance for the person who was driving or those who were in the car and not necessarily other people to make claims against their own car insurance emphasis added.
additionally,we consider how other state courts have resolved the question.see rosciti,at.courts in other states have held that motorist statutes with language similar to maine do not apply to commercial general liability policies such as those at issue here.see,trinity universal ins.metzger,so d,similarly worded alabama statute applies only to policies that insure against the risk of loss through the operation of specific automobiles.one useful example is hodge raab.hodge,an employee at an auto garage,was working on a customer truck when,through the customer fault,the truck lurched forward,injuring hodge.id.at.the customer had no liability insurance.id.hodge employer maintained a commercial general liability policy for injury caused by garage operations,incidentally including injury caused by unspecified customer vehicles.id.at.hodge argued that this liability coverage for customers cars brought the policy within the ambit of washington motorist statute.id.at.the court rejected that argument,explaining 
the liability section in the policy was not issued with respect to a vehicle known to be registered or garaged in washington.rather,it was issued with respect to garage operations.it provided liability coverage for garage accidents,specifically excluding those caused by autos.
the policy does incidentally cover an accident caused by any customer vehicle,wherever registered or garaged,that was left at the garage for service or repair.but at the time the policy was issued,neither the service station owner nor the insurance company had any information about the vehicles that potentially would be covered.there is no reference in the liability coverage to covered autos.there is no schedule of covered autos and no premium attributable to the limited liability coverage for customers cars.the absence of such features reinforces the conclusion that the policy was not issued with respect to a vehicle.
because the policy was not issued with respect to a vehicle registered or principally garaged in washington,the statutory mandate for underinsured motorist coverage does not apply and it makes no difference that the particular vehicle that caused this particular accident was,in fact,registered and principally garaged in washington.
while the uim statute is to be read broadly,it does not mandate uim coverage in connection with every type of liability policy that will,under limited circumstances,cover damage resulting from the use of automobiles.
frost attempts to distinguish hodge.she argues that the policy in hodge which provided liability coverage for garage accidents,specifically excluding those caused by autos,subject to an exception for accidents caused by any customer vehicle,id.at obviously provides significantly narrower coverage for autos than the business owner policy with the hired auto and non owned auto liability endorsement.it is far from obvious to us,however,that the sliver of auto insurance in hodge was narrower than the sliver of auto insurance in the business owner policy here.indeed,frost overstates the amount of auto insurance bound up in lake region business owner policy.she argues,erroneously,that the policy initial explicit exclusion of auto liability coverage is completely removed and replaced by the hired auto and non owned auto liability endorsement.in fact,by its own terms,as already noted,the endorsement deletes that exclusion f or insurance provided by this endorsement only emphasis added.outside of the narrow context of hired and autos,the exclusion of auto liability coverage retains full force,reinforcing the notion that the business owner policy is not the type of auto policy to which the maine statute applies.
there are cases from other states,however,in which commercial general liability policies similar to the business owner policy,containing similar auto liability endorsements,were held subject to those states motorist statutes.for instance,illinois intermediate appellate court has held that the state motorist is worded similarly to maine applies to commercial general liability policies that,like the business owner policy issued to lake region,include hired and auto liability endorsements.harrington am.family mut.ins,d,sole proprietor of landscaping business who was injured by underinsured motorist while riding his bicycle can claim underinsured motorist benefits from his commercial general liability insurer see also bend mut.keaton,selander erie ins,ohio,ohio 
the courts that decided these cases were willing to interpret broadly language similar to a policy insuring against liability arising out of the ownership,maintenance or use of any motor vehicle with respect to any such vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state.but in our opinion,such interpretations do violence to the plain meaning of the text.and we find it notable that,after the ohio supreme court decided selander,the ohio legislature amended its motorist statute to preclude its application to commercial general liability policies such as those at issue in selander and here.see bowling paul fire marine ins,ohio app d,ohio stating that selander was superseded by statute.this amendment suggests that the ohio legislature appreciated the negative policy consequences of interpreting an motorist statute unduly broadly.indeed,i t should be recognized that the generosity of the courts confers no favor upon the insuring public.such decisions result either in such coverage being withdrawn from potential insureds or in premium rates being raised so substantially that they will become priced out of the range of most buyers.hodge,at quoting appleman,insurance law and practice,at.
frost argues that not applying the motorist statute to the peerless policies is at odds with maine clearly articulated public policy of providing broad motorist coverage.see,greenvall me.mut.fire ins,me to effectuate its intent,we construe section liberally in favor of the insured victim and strictly against the insurer.any ambiguity in the phrase legally entitled to recover must be construed in favor of the insured.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,maine adheres to the rule that u ninsured and underinsured insurance is personal and portable,follo
