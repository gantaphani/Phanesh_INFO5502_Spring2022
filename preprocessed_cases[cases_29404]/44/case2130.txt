sandra fay phillips,the plaintiff,appeals the district court judgment as a matter of law in favor of monroe county,mississippi,charles farmer,and john bearry collectively the defendants,in this wrongful death suit brought under.phillips son,jonathan phillips the decedent,died from testicular cancer while serving a sentence for aggravated assault in the mississippi prison system.phillips claims the defendants wrongfully caused the decedent death in violation of the eighth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution by refusing to provide the decedent with necessary medical care.additionally,phillips brought a state law negligence claim against monroe county.using the standard announced in reeves sanderson plumbing products,d,we affirm,because the plaintiff failed to prove the necessary causal link between the decedent death and the acts or omissions of the defendants.additionally,the state law claim against monroe county is barred by m of the mississippi code.
most of the relevant facts surrounding this case are undisputed.the decedent was diagnosed with widespread testicular cancer,including disease in the lymph nodes,abdominal cavity and lungs,in september.he underwent surgery and chemotherapy,and was pronounced in remission within six months.in,the decedent cancer returned,he completed three more rounds of chemotherapy,and was again found to be in remission.before he was diagnosed with cancer,the decedent was involved in a fight,for which he was later arrested and charged with aggravated assault.he pled guilty and was sentenced to years imprisonment,with years suspended.the decedent began serving his sentence on may,when he was taken into custody by the monroe county sheriff department the sheriff department.soon thereafter,he began complaining of chest pains,shortness of breath,headaches,and spitting up blood.upon learning of his symptoms,the decedent family immediately contacted his oncologist,julian hill.hill was located in tupelo,mississippi.due to the distance between the jail and hill office,hill instructed the sheriff department to take the decedent to a local physician for blood work.after reviewing the results of the blood tests,hill insisted the decedent be brought to him for further tests.the sheriff department complied,and the decedent had more extensive tests,including ct scans,on june.hill found that the decedent cancer had reappeared in his lungs and spread to his spleen,and hill advised the decedent family and the sheriff department that the decedent needed to receive salvage chemotherapy immediately and that it should begin no later than june.
for reasons that are disputed and not relevant to our analysis,the sheriff department sought to have the decedent transferred to the state prison system to receive his chemotherapy treatments.it first attempted to have the sentencing court modify the decedent sentence so that he could be under house arrest during his treatment,but the judge found he was without jurisdiction to do so.monroe county chief deputy next contacted john bearry,the medical director at the mississippi state penitentiary at parchman,to determine what steps should be taken to transfer the decedent given his medical needs.bearry office advised the sheriff department to immediately transfer the decedent from the monroe county jail to the central mississippi correctional facility in rankin county.the decedent was transferred on june,and charles farmer,a staff physician,gave the decedent a standard intake physical exam and referred the decedent to the university medical center in jackson for cancer treatment.the prisoner referral process is,but farmer managed to schedule an appointment for the decedent for july.
on july,the decedent suffered abdominal pain and began vomiting.he was sent to the emergency room at the university medical center,diagnosed with pneumonia,given antibiotics,and returned to the prison.eight days later,the decedent began having seizures and fell unconscious in his cell.he was immediately transported to the university medical center,where he was diagnosed with a brain tumor.the decedent treating physicians at the center,including james thigpen,concluded that the testicular cancer had metastasized to the decedent brain,and they prescribed immediate aggressive radiation therapy.the treating physicians felt that chemotherapy would not have been an effective therapy for the brain tumor.despite the radiation treatments,the decedent died on july,and his death certificate lists the cause of death as herniation of the brain due to cancer.
phillips subsequently brought this action on behalf of the wrongful death beneficiaries of the decedent,alleging that his death was due to monroe county refusal to provide necessary medical care and failure to have policies providing for medical treatment for those prisoners in need of medical care.the complaint was later amended to include bearry and farmer,individually,for gross negligence and willful indifference to the decedent rights,alleging that they were deliberately indifferent to the decedent medical needs because they failed to provide him with the immediate course of chemotherapy prescribed by hill.after phillips presented her case,the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law.the district court granted the motion on all grounds,finding that the defendants were not deliberately indifferent to the decedent medical needs,and thus did not violate his constitutional rights,and that the state law claim against monroe county was barred because mississippi had not waived its sovereign immunity in this circumstance.

section provides a cause of action for persons who are subjected to the deprivation of any constitutional right by a person acting under the color of state or federal law.although phillips brings this suit in federal court under,she is not alleging that her constitutional rights were violated.likewise,she does not seek relief as the personal representative of the decedent estate in other words,phillips is not suing to redress her own claims or any constitutional claims the decedent might have had prior to his death.instead,phillips sues on behalf of the wrongful death beneficiaries of the decedent.she seeks to recover for the injuries the phillips family suffered as a result of the decedent death,which,in turn,was allegedly caused by the defendants violation of the decedent constitutional rights.
