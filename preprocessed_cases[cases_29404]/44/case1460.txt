defendant christine boczar,a deputy sheriff of powhatan county,virginia,appeals the judgment of damages plus attorney fees entered against her in the eastern district of virginia in this u.proceeding.boczar presents two appellate issues first,she contends that she is entitled to qualified immunity such that a trial should not have been conducted and,second,she maintains that,even should the jury verdict stand,the district court award of in attorney fees to plaintiff eileen mcafee is contrary to law.as explained below,we reject boczar qualified immunity contention and affirm the verdict of damages totalling.we vacate the attorney fee award,however,and remand for an award of,exclusive of costs.
on december,eileen mcafee accompanied a friend to a residence in powhatan county,virginia,to inspect a dog that appeared to be in distress after securing permission from the owner,mcafee examined the dog and concluded that it lacked appropriate shelter but was otherwise in good condition.mcafee then bought the animal a new doghouse and,on january,delivered it to the dog and its owner.while setting up the doghouse,mcafee sought to feed the pet a treat.unfortunately,in its eagerness to eat the treat,the dog accidentally bit mcafee hand,causing mcafee to seek medical treatment at a local hospital.the hospital reported mcafee dog bite to the animal control authorities in powhatan county.
deputy boczar,an animal control officer with the powhatan county sheriff office,received notification of mcafee dog bite and began an investigation.on january,she inquired by telephone about the incident,asking mcafee where the dog was housed.mcafee,who was unfamiliar with powhatan county,replied that she did not know the owner address but could lead boczar to the dog location.boczar declined mcafee offer and ended the conversation,which was apparently the only exchange boczar ever had with mcafee.boczar thereafter contacted two other persons,further seeking to locate the dog.both of those persons had spoken to mcafee about the dog bite incident,but neither had sought to ascertain from mcafee the location of the dog.
predicated on these conversations,boczar determined that mcafee had refused to disclose to the authorities the location of the dog,in violation of virginia code,which prohibits the withholding of information about possibly rabid animals.as a result,on january,boczar secured an arrest warrant for mcafee from a state court magistrate.boczar then arrested mcafee on the warrant and transported her to the county sheriff office.the magistrate thereafter released mcafee on bond,and a jury trial was conducted in magistrate court on may.at its conclusion,mcafee was acquitted.
on september,the underlying complaint was filed in the eastern district of virginia,alleging that boczar had arrested mcafee without probable cause.the complaint made three separate claims first,a claim under for violation of mcafee fourth amendment rights count i second,a claim for malicious prosecution under state law count ii and,third,a false imprisonment claim under state law count iii.in responding to mcafee complaint,boczar moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity,which the court promptly denied.boczar also sought the dismissal of count iii under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,which the court granted.a jury trial was thereafter conducted in richmond on the allegations in the first two counts of the complaint.
at the trial conclusion on july,the jury returned a verdict for mcafee on the claim and in favor of boczar on count ii.at trial,mcafee requested both compensatory and punitive damages as determined by the evidence.mcafee boczar,d,the opinion.in closing argument to the jury,counsel for mcafee summed up her claims thusly m oney can never really compensate for what has been done here,but money is the only remedy the law has to offer.so what is the right number to compensate mcafee is it is it something else is it something more you decide.the jury verdict found that mcafee was entitled to recover in stipulated expenses relating to her state court defense,which the jury awarded on her claim.the jury declined to otherwise award mcafee additional compensatory or any punitive damages.
after the jury returned its verdict,boczar made a renewed motion for qualified immunity on the claim.the district court again denied the motion,explaining that boczar conduct in arresting mcafee lacked probable cause and fails to meet the test of objective reasonableness required for the protection of qualified immunity.mcafee boczar,cv,wl,at.in so ruling,the court focused on boczar having secured mcafee arrest warrant on the basis of false statements.indeed,boczar represented to the magistrate that mcafee refuse d to give any information about the dog whereabouts.id.at.at trial,however,it was established that this statement was untrue.boczar testified that,in her only conversation with mcafee,boczar had explained that she could locate the dog,though she did not have the address where it lived.neither of the other two persons boczar interviewed about the dog bite incident told boczar that mcafee had refused to give the location of the dog.as a result,the court concluded that boczar lied to the magistrate to secure the arrest warrant,and that such conduct does not give rise to qualified immunity.id.
after the court accepted the verdict and entered judgment thereon,mcafee filed a petition pursuant to,seeking a total of in attorney fees,plus in costs the fee petition.though acceding to the full amount of the documented costs,boczar complained that the requested fees were unreasonable and countered with a fee proposal awarding.the district court then referred the fee petition to a federal magistrate judge for settlement negotiations.a settlement conference was conducted on september,but the parties were unable to reach an accord.the magistrate judge reported to the district court that the state division of risk management,which was responsible for the damages award,had refused to negotiate in good faith.
because the settlement negotiations failed,the district court independently evaluated the fee petition to determine whether the request was reasonable under,which provides that the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee with respect to a claim,inter alia,made pursuant to.applying the familiar lodestar method,the court granted the fee petition in part.by its opinion,the court determined that the hourly rates of mcafee lawyers were reasonable and that,applying a ten percent reduction in the hours logged to account for block billing,the amount of time devoted to the case by counsel was also reasonable.as a result,the court awarded mcafee in attorney fees,plus the in agreed costs.see mcafee,d at.
boczar has timely appealed,challenging the district court denial of qualified immunity and its related decision to conduct a trial,and also seeking to vacate the attorney fee award.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to 
mcafee alleged that boczar violated her fourth amendment rights by subjecting her to arrest without probable cause.in seeking relief from mcafee allegations of liability pursuant to,boczar unsuccessfully asserted qualified immunity.we review de novo a district court denial of qualified immunity.merchant bauer,cir 
in this case,boczar invoked qualified immunity in the district court prior to trial by way of a summary judgment request.in some circuits,a defendant failure to follow the procedures set forth in rule beginning with a rule a motion and then renewing the contention under rule b constitutes a waiver of the qualified immunity claim.see,parker gerrish,cir w e have held that even if a defendant raises qualified immunity at summary judgment,the issue is waived on appeal if not pressed in a rule a motion.sykes anderson,cir the defendants failure to make a motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule a on the grounds of qualified immunity precluded them from making a motion under rule b on that ground.here,however,we need not decide whether boczar unusual approach has worked a waiver of qualified immunity,because we are amply satisfied that no such immunity was warranted.
qualified immunity serves to protect a government official from liability for civil damages unless the facts alleged show a violation of a clearly established constitutional right.merchant,at.here,mcafee asserts her right under the fourth amendment to be free from arrest absent probable cause to believe that she had committed a crime.we have consistently explained that probable cause has been shown when the facts and circumstances within an officer knowledge or of which he possesses reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to convince a person of reasonable caution that an offense has been or is being committed.wadkins arnold,cir.
in this situation,it is clear that boczar lacked sufficient knowledge about mcafee dog bite to reasonably believe that mcafee contravened virginia law.boczar had interviewed only three persons,and none had suggested that mcafee was refusing to disclose the dog location.with such limited knowledge,a law officer of reasonable caution would not believe that mcafee had violated.indeed,that boczar made false statements to the state magistrate in seeking mcafee arrest suggests that boczar understood that the evidence failed the probable cause standard.
by securing a warrant that lacked adequate evidentiary support,boczar infringed mcafee fourth amendment right to be free from capricious arrest.and this constitutional right is clearly established.see miller prince george,cir unquestionably,t he fourth amendment prohibits law enforcement officers from making unreasonable seizures,and seizure of an individual effected without probable cause is unreasonable.internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,boczar can not shield herself from damages liability by invoking qualified immunity.
the more difficult issue in this appeal is whether the district court attorney fee award is reasonable.the threshold requirement for such an award is,of course,that the plaintiff be a prevailing party.hensley eckerhart,d.the designation of a party as prevailing is a legal question that we review de novo.see grissom v.the mills,cir.for purposes of,a party in whose favor a judgment is rendered,regardless of the amount of damages awarded,is the prevailing party.id.more specifically,a party has prevailed if there has been a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties,and there is a judicial imprimatur on the change.id.
neither party disputes the proposition that mcafee was the prevailing party on the claim.the jury verdict of created a material alteration of the legal relationship between mcafee and boczar,and the district court power to enforce that award provides the requisite judicial imprimatur.because mcafee is a prevailing party under,we must determine whether the attorney fee award is a reasonable one.
we review for abuse of discretion a district court award of attorney fees,but,we will only reverse such an award if the district court is clearly wrong or has committed an error of law.brodziak runyon,cir.the proper calculation of an attorney fee award involves a process.first,the court must determine the lodestar figure by multiplying the number of reasonable hours expended times a reasonable rate.robinson equifax info,llc,cir.to ascertain what is reasonable in terms of hours expended and the rate charged,the court is bound to apply the factors set forth in johnson georgia highway express,cir id.at.next,the court must subtract fees for hours spent on unsuccessful claims unrelated to successful ones.id.at.finally,the court should award some percentage of the remaining amount,depending on the degree of success enjoyed by the plaintiff.id.although the district court in this case adequately performed the first two steps,it erred on the third.that is,it overstated mcafee success 
the supreme court has indulged a strong presumption that the lodestar number represents a reasonable attorney fee.the court recently explained that this presumption can only be overcome in those rare circumstances where the lodestar does not adequately take into account a factor that may properly be considered in determining a reasonable fee.see perdue kenny ex rel.winn,d.consistent with the prescribed methodology,the district court addressed the attorney fee issue by calculating the lodestar number.in so doing,the court relied on the johnson factors to determine the applicable multipliers.
the opinion application of the johnson factors warrants a brief discussion.as the district court recognized,we have reviewed attorney fee awards primarily by use of the lodestar method,with substantial reliance on the johnson factors,sometimes to inform the calculation of the lodestar,sometimes to make upward or downward adjustments to it,and sometimes for both purposes.d at.the opinion explained,however,that unquestioning reliance on johnson is not justified in the world because that supreme court decision teaches so clearly that departures from the lodestar figure are to occur rarely and only in extraordinary cases.id.at.moreover,as the opinion relates,the perdue court emphasized that an enhancement may not be awarded based on a factor that is subsumed in the lodestar calculation.id.quoting perdue.at.accordingly,the court determined that its consideration of certain of the johnson factors was foreclosed by the lodestar calculation.see id.at.
at the outset,the district court decided that the number of hours reasonably expended by mcafee lawyers the first multiplier in the lodestar calculation encompasses at least three johnson factors factor time and labor expended,factor novelty and difficulty of question raised,and factor time limitations imposed by the client or circumstances.see id.at.as such,those three factors did not warrant further consideration in calculating the attorney fee award.the court then explained that the reasonable hourly rate the second multiplier in the lodestar calculation subsumes five additional johnson factors factor skill required to properly perform legal services factor attorney opportunity cost factor customary fee factor attorney expectations at outset of litigation and factor experience,reputation,and ability of attorney.see id.as a result,according to the court,those five factors also collapse into the lodestar calculation.ultimately,pursuant to the court lodestar analysis,perdue reserved four johnson factors for use in adjusting the lodestar fee amount factor amount in controversy and results obtained factor undesirability of case within legal community factor nature and length of professional relationship between attorney and client and factor attorneys fee awards in similar cases.see id.
we have indeed recognized that,consistent with the district court analysis,to the extent that any of the johnson factors has already been incorporated into the lodestar analysis,we do not consider those factors a second time.associated coal,owcp,cir citing perdue.at.we have never ruled,however,that when certain johnson factors have merged into the lodestar calculation,they are not to be otherwise considered to adjust the lodestar amount.although some of our sister circuits agree that any johnson factor subsumed in the lodestar calculation should in no other way affect the determination of an attorney fee award,few have explicitly identified specific factors to which such a principle might apply for example,the fifth circuit has held that a bankruptcy court abused its discretion in using four of the johnson factors to justify its substantial upward departure from the lodestar because the lodestar amount already accounted for those factors.see matter of fender,cir.and the second circuit recently held that a district court erred in adjusting the initial lodestar figure on the basis of johnson factors already included.see millea metro,cir.
in any event,we need not further assess or identify which of the johnson factors might be subsumed by the lodestar calculations.in its perdue decision,the supreme court was addressing the enhancement of a lodestar attorney fee.at.in this case,however,the district court did not enhance the lodestar fee calculation it simply reduced that calculation by.predicated on these distinctions,we limit our analysis to ensuring that the court application of the johnson factors was a reasonable one and that it did not inappropriately weigh any particular factor.
returning to step one calculation of the lodestar fee amount we will not disturb the district court determination of the lodestar multipliers.we explain further below.
in her fee petition,mcafee requested an award for hours of legal work by her lawyers.mcafee,d at.the district court reduced the hours of her two lead attorneys by ten percent each,because they had used a block billing system lumping tasks together in time entries rather than making such entries.id.at.the court also eliminated the hours recorded by the client originator because his time overlapped that of the lead attorneys.id.at.neither of the parties disputes these calculations,and they are not further addressed.
in determining whether the time expended by mcafee lawyers was reasonable,the opinion referred to boczar unwillingness to entertain settlement on the attorney fee issues.see mcafee,d at.the court observed that failure to contemplate a settlement strategy makes for expensive litigation,and the defendant must bear the consequences.id.at.boczar asserts that the court,by taking her settlement position into account,abused its discretion and punished boczar for her recalcitrance.boczar argument falls short in two respects.first,a district court has discretion to consider settlement negotiations in determining the reasonableness of fees but it is not required to do so.thomas football league players ass n,see also sands runyon,cir concluding that a district court can consider settlement offers in making a fee award.second,although the court expressed disapproval of boczar apparent failure to seriously engage in settlement negotiations,the court did not alter its lodestar calculations to reflect that disapproval.the court simply observed that any prolonged litigation caused by a failure to settle would be subsumed in the time component of the lodestar calculation.mcafee,d at.in other words,the court assessment of the settlement negotiations could not have had a measurable impact on the lodestar calculation.in these circumstances,the court did not abuse its discretion in calculating the hours expended by mcafee lawyers.
mcafee lead counsel charged an hourly rate of,and his senior associate charged per hour.mcafee,d at.as the fee applicant,mcafee bore the burden of establishing the reasonableness of those hourly rates.see plyler evatt,cir.a fee applicant is obliged to show that the requested hourly rates are consistent with the prevailing market rates in the relevant community for the type of work for which s he seeks an award.id.the evidence we have deemed competent to show prevailing market rates includes affidavits of other local lawyers who are familiar both with the skills of the fee applicants and more generally with the type of work in the relevant community.robinson,at.
boczar contends that mcafee failed to provide the essential evidence on the hourly rate issue.the opinion,however,concluded that the affidavits of two experts were sufficient to substantiate the hourly rates of mcafee lawyers,and so mcafee has more than met her burden of establishing the reasonable hourly rate for her counsel.mcafee,d at.although those rates would appear excessive to almost any lay observer,and some members of the judiciary would deem them exorbitant,the district court findings to the contrary are entitled to our deference.as a result,we are unable to disturb its finding that the requested hourly rates are reasonable 
after determining that the hours expended and the attendant rates requested by a lawyer for a prevailing party are reasonable,a court is obliged to subtract fees for hours spent on unsuccessful claims unrelated to the successful ones.grissom,at.of the three counts alleged,mcafee prevailed on solely her claim,and then only with respect to a single category of damages,that is,general damages reimbursing mcafee for her expenses.the other two categories of damages mcafee sought in connection with her claim special damages plus punitive damages were wholly rejected 
by its opinion,the district court agreed with mcafee lawyers that a six percent reduction for prevailing on one of three counts in the complaint was a reasonable reduction because mcafee counsel identified the work that was performed in furtherance of the unsuccessful counts and deducted those hours,on a basis,from the work performed.mcafee,d at.moreover,the opinion explained that the three counts in the complaint involved a common core of facts,and therefore m uch of counsel time was devoted generally to the litigation as a whole.id.at quoting hensley,at.reducing the number of hours expended by six percent and multiplying it by the hourly rate,the court calculated mcafee lodestar fee as.
we will not dispute the district court six percent reduction to account for the commonality of effort expended on unsuccessful counts ii and iii.we are concerned,however,that the court failed to properly consider mcafee failure to receive an award on her claim,except for her undisputed expenses.we will further explain those concerns.
in the final step before making an attorney fee award under,a district court must consider the relationship between the extent of success and the amount of the fee award.the court will reduce the award if the relief,however significant,is limited in comparison to the scope of the litigation as a whole.hensley,at.indeed,the supreme court has recognized that the extent of a plaintiff success is the most critical factor in determining a reasonable attorney fee under.id.at.what the court must ask is whether the plaintiff achieve d a level of success that makes the hours reasonably expended a satisfactory basis for making a fee award.id.at.
although mcafee success in recovering her general expenses must be accorded respect,it does not justify a fee award of over approximately times the verdict when mcafee failure to recover any special compensatory damages,or any punitive damages at all,is taken into account.though congress intended fee awards to be adequate to attract competent counsel,it also wanted to avoid produc ing windfalls to attorneys.city of riverside rivera,d.the district court erroneous view of mcafee success best illustrated by comparing mcafee lofty expectations with the jury paltry damages award produced an excessive fee award that would,in our view,constitute a windfall.
we have recognized that,w hen considering the extent of the relief obtained,we must compare the amount of damages sought to the amount awarded.mercer duke,cir.if a plaintiff achieves only part of the success she sought,the lodestar amount may be excessive.see farrar hobby,d.for example,in farrar,the plaintiffs sought million in compensatory damages,but the jury awarded only the meager sum of one dollar.id.because the district court failed to compare the plaintiff damages request with the nominal jury verdict,the court reversed a fee award of.id.at.in her concurrence,justice elaborated a substantial difference between the judgment recovered and the recovery sought suggests that the victory is in fact purely technical.id.at,concurring emphasis added.in farrar,the plaintiff asked for a bundle million and got a pittance.id.at.as such,the court ruled that any award of attorney fees was unjustified.id.at.
to accurately gauge mcafee success,the district court,in accordance with mercer and farrar,should have compared what she sought with what was awarded.although mcafee downplays her attempts to recover anything beyond her expenses,the record below suggests her pursuit of a bigger payday was sincere,even pointed.indeed,mcafee conceded at trial that t here are expenses,b ut that not what this case is really about.in particular,mcafee requested special compensatory damages for deprivation of liberty,great inconvenience,great insult and humiliation,and mental anguish.id.at.counsel for mcafee rhetorically inquired of the jury,what is the right number to compensate mcafee is it is it something else is
