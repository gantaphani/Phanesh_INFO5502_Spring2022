background 
factual circumstances 
the magistrate judge report and recommendation aptly summarizes the background facts,identifying the parties and the alleged tortious acts that gave rise to this diversity case 
plaintiffs paul and karen brunner are residents of missoula,montana.plaintiff douglas otte is a resident of paul,nebraska.defendant pamela hampson is a resident of fairfield county,ohio and is the executrix of the estate of jerry jay hampson.defendant canada north is an international booking agent and outfitter providing sport hunting excursions in the province of nunavut,canada.canada north is incorporated under the laws of the province of ontario,canada.defendant knap is the owner and sole shareholder of canada north and is a resident of almonte,ontario,canada.
in february,thomas moore,a resident of ohio,was contacted by brent sinclair,a booking agent located in pincher creek,alberta regarding a muskox hunt to be offered by canada north in.moore contacted jerry hampson to advise him about the hunt.moore then booked the hunt for himself,brunner and hampson and sent his check and one from hampson to sinclair.
canada north used a cabin in the ellice river in the province of nunavut,canada,for the muskox hunting trip booked by thomas moore,paul brunner and jerry hampson.on august,jerry hampson,while in the cabin,placed a pot on a coleman stove and it caught on fire.hampson then grabbed a container with clear liquid which he threw on the flames.the liquid,however,was naphtha,a highly flammable substance,which caused an explosion.the cabin caught fire.as a result of this fire,hampson died,and plaintiffs paul brunner and otte suffered severe burns.
a fire investigation concluded that the hunting party was accommodated in an inadequate hunting camp that was neither inspected nor licensed for commercial operation camp safety orientation was not provided portable fire extinguishers were not provided and the coleman camp stove was operated contrary to manufacturer instructions.additionally,plaintiffs allege that jerry hampson knew or should have known that pouring liquid on a fire is contrary to notions of basic safety.
in their complaint against the estate of jerry jay hampson,canada north,and jerome knap,plaintiffs paul brunner and douglas otte alleged that they suffered physical and psychological injuries as a result of the defendants negligence.karen brunner,the wife of paul brunner,sued for loss of consortium.the hampson estate filed a against canada north and knap,asserting claims of negligence and wrongful death.for the sake of simplicity,all of the citizens with claims and against the canadian defendants will be referred to collectively as the appellants.the men who were in the cabin during the fire and explosion will be referred to as the hunters.
canada north and knap filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.the motion was referred to a magistrate judge,who issued a recommendation that the canadian defendants be dismissed.despite objections by the appellants,the district court adopted the recommendation and dismissed the canadian defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction.the hampson estate then moved under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure for the district court order to be certified as a final appealable judgment.there was no opposition,and the district court granted the motion.this timely appeal followed,but only as to canada north and not as to knap.
jurisdictional contacts 
four categories of canada north and knap contacts with ohio are arguably relevant to the question of whether the district court had personal jurisdiction over them contacts by brent sinclair,the alleged agent of canada north,with the state of ohio involving the hunters,contacts by canada north itself with the state of ohio involving the hunters,canada north contacts with ohio not involving the hunters,and canada north other contacts with the united states not involving the hunters.
contacts of brent sinclair,the alleged agent of canada north,with the state of ohio involving the hunters 
the first contact with ohio relating to the hunt at issue came from brent sinclair in the form of a fax to thomas moore.moore is not a party to this case,but was in the cabin when the fire took place.the fax suggested that moore call sinclair to talk about the details of the hunt.moore did in fact call sinclair and later sent deposit checks for himself,paul brunner,and hampson to sinclair in canada to reserve spots for the hunt.sinclair confirmed receipt via fax.several other telephone calls,faxes,and an email went back and forth between sinclair and moore to work out the details of the hunt.
contacts by canada north itself with the state of ohio involving the hunters 
canada north had several contacts with ohio other than through sinclair.one was in the form of a letter sent to hampson from canada north containing information about a polar bear hunt and enclosing a brochure about all of canada north hunts,which presumably included the hunt at issue.another contact was through global expedition,a wholly owned subsidiary of canada north that provided travel services for to of canada north customers.global expedition and canada north operate out of the same location and use the same telephone number,fax number,and email address.moore and hampson contacted global expedition at sinclair suggestion to make their travel arrangements.
there were then a series of faxes between canada north and moore to work out the details of the travel,hotel arrangements,costs,and itinerary.moore spoke with employees of canada north in several telephone conversations concerning the subject hunt.jody gleeson,who was a canada north employee,actually made the travel arrangements for moore and hampson and mailed the airline tickets and itinerary to the hunters in ohio.moore used his credit card to charge the travel costs.
canada north also maintained a mailing list that included moore.this mailing list was used to send advertisements.moore received several direct mailings from canada north,including a brochure advertising the subject hunt.
canada north contacts with ohio not involving the hunters 
in addition to the contacts with ohio that directly related to the subject hunt,canada north had other contacts with the state.it placed advertisements in two periodic publications of safari club international sci,an american organization for hunters.the frequency of the ads was generally two per year.these periodicals were sent to all sci members,including moore and hampson.moore saw canada north ads in safari magazine before the subject hunt.the district court,however,determined that the advertisements and the direct mailings did not induce the hunters to participate in the hunt at issue.
the company also offered discounted hunts to two ohio chapters of sci in an effort to improve business.of sci total membership,the brunner brief claims that are located in ohio.canada north advertisements in the periodicals of sci were thus sent to hundreds of ohioans each year.furthermore,the annual direct mailings sent out by canada north went to at least ohio residents on its mailing list that at one time contained approximately individuals.there were more ohioans named on the list prior to some being purged in a periodic updating.
information about canada north is located on the website of a texas booking agency at.the website contains a description of canada north,its telephone numbers,and pictures from prior hunts.this information was provided by canada north.canada north is also listed as an international booking agent from canada on,along with a short description of the company.this website does not appear to offer any contact information for canada north.
the hampson estate brief also calls attention to the fact that canada north maintained an insurance policy that provided liability coverage for the coverage territory of canada and the united states of america including its territories and possessions.but canada north argues that the language in the insurance policy was boilerplate and is not evidence that the company could foresee any liability in ohio.
canada north other contacts with the united states not involving the hunters 
the appellants briefs extensively discuss contacts of canada north with states other than ohio.for example,the briefs note that canada north has attended sci exhibitions in nevada every year for years,has offered discounted hunts to sci chapters in california,michigan,montana,texas,and wyoming,and was in attendance at a meeting of the foundation for north american wild sheep held in nevada.as set forth below,however,the and constitutional tests are worded exclusively in terms of contacts with the forum state.the appellants cite no authority for the proposition that canada north contacts with other states should be considered.as such,this category of contacts is not relevant and will not be further discussed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
there is no dispute in this case about the applicable standard of review.on the basis of pleadings and affidavits,the district court dismissed canada north for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.we review its decision de novo.neogen neo gen screening,cir we review de novo a dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.
the appellants in this case bear the burden of making out a prima facie case to show that personal jurisdiction exists 
t he party seeking assertion of in personam jurisdiction bears the burden of showing that such jurisdiction exists.when,however,a district court rules on a jurisdictional motion to dismiss made pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b without conducting an evidentiary hearing,the court must consider the pleadings and affidavits in a light most favorable to the plaintiff to defeat such a motion,the party seeking to assert jurisdiction need only make a prima facie showing of jurisdiction.

alleged agency relationship between brent sinclair and canada north 
a preliminary matter needs to be addressed before analyzing the personal jurisdiction issue.the appellants rely on a litany of theories to impute sinclair contacts with ohio to canada north,including express agency,agency by estoppel,implied agency,and agency by apparent authority.in response,canada north cites cases like gelfand action travel center,ohio app d,for the proposition that o rdinarily,a travel agency is the customer agent to make requested travel arrangements.id.at emphasis added see also barton wonderful world of travel,ohio misc d,ohio holding that a travel agent was a special agent for his customer,the traveler.canada north argues on the basis of holdings like these that sinclair was the agent for the hunters rather than canada north,so that sinclair contacts with ohio should not be imputed to canada north.
the agency rules established in the cases discussed by the parties,however,did not arise in the context of establishing personal jurisdiction,but instead are a basis for establishing the duty of the travel agent to act in a reasonable manner.in gelfand,for example,the sentence immediately following the quotation above reads any agent has a duty to accomplish assigned tasks with reasonable care,and is followed by a discussion of whether the travel agency exercised such care in performing its tasks.gelfand,at.
the question of whether a travel agent contacts should be imputed to the company,thus making the travel agent the agent of the company for purposes,has apparently not yet been answered by ohio courts.ohio courts have already decided that travel agents are the agents of the traveler for purposes.see gelfand,at.although the ohio courts might come to the same conclusion both in the context of establishing the duty of the travel agent to act with reasonable care and for the purposes of establishing personal jurisdiction,that result does not necessarily follow.we have no need to resolve the issue,however,because the disposition of this case does not hinge on whether sinclair was the agent of one party or the other.solely for sake of argument,therefore,we will assume that he was the agent of canada north and will consider his contacts with ohio in deciding whether there was personal jurisdiction over canada north.
ohio law of personal jurisdiction 
this court has articulated a inquiry to determine whether a federal district court sitting in a case can exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant whether the law of the state in which the district court sits authorizes jurisdiction,and whether the exercise of jurisdiction comports with the due process clause.compuserve,at to determine whether personal jurisdiction exists over a defendant,federal courts apply the law of the forum state,subject to the limits of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.t he defendant must be amenable to suit under the forum state statute and the due process requirements of the constitution must be met.citations omitted alteration in original.
this court has explained that there are two kinds of jurisdiction that can be exercised under ohio law 
jurisdiction may be found to exist either generally,in cases in which a defendant continuous and systematic conduct within the forum state renders that defendant amenable to suit in any lawsuit brought against it in the forum state,or specifically,in cases in which the subject matter of the lawsuit arises out of or is related to the defendant contacts with the forum.
nationwide mut.ins.tryg int l ins,cir citation omitted.
the appellants do not explicitly state whether they are asserting general or specific jurisdiction,but based on the arguments made in their briefs,we have no doubt that the issue is whether the district court had specific jurisdiction over canada north.in particular,the appellants argue that their claims satisfy the arising from requirement of the ohio statute,which is a requirement in cases but not cases.see nationwide mut,at.moreover,the facts do not support and the appellants do not argue the proposition that canada north engaged in continuous and systematic conduct within the forum state.id.we will therefore address only whether the district court had specific jurisdiction over canada north.
the ohio statute provides that a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person who acts directly or by an agent,as to a cause of action arising from the person transacting any business in this state or contracting to supply services or goods in this state ohio a.furthermore,specific jurisdiction under the statute requires that the injury arise out of the contacts with ohio.ohio c when jurisdiction over a person is based solely upon this section,only a cause of action arising from acts enumerated in this section may be asserted against him.
whether canada north transact ed any business or contract ed to supply services or goods in ohio 
only the hampson estate argues that canada north contracted to supply services or goods in ohio,which would subject it to jurisdiction under ohio revised code a.this argument is easily dismissed.the hampson estate brief does not provide any factual basis to show that canada north supplied any goods in ohio.moreover,it does not explain what services canada north allegedly provided there.canada north services consisted of arranging travel to the location of t
