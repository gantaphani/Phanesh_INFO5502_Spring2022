appellant angela maritime shipping,angela,claimant of the in rem defendant,angela,appeals a judgment in a b action by sylvia moore,the surviving spouse of longshoreman horace moore moore.the district court held for the plaintiff,finding vessel negligence and finding the decedent five percent at fault.we hold the award of nonpecuniary damages to be excessive and hold that the court exceeded its authority in increasing the security posted in lieu of the vessel.accordingly,we remand for a reduction in the total damage award.
sylvia moore sued under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca,b,the angela in rem for the wrongful death of her husband,who was struck by falling cargo while working for stevedores,in the angela.section b provides a negligence remedy to a longshoreman or his family against the vessel plaintiff had the vessel arrested,and angela filed a claim of owner,reserving all rights and defenses and requesting the court to set security for release of the vessel.the court set security at,and ordered the vessel released upon posting of a letter of undertaking in that amount.the vessel then departed the jurisdiction.
the angela is a bulk carrier equipped with four cranes.the district court found that moore death was caused in part by vessel negligence relating to the vessel crane,which was being used to offload ingots of aluminum from the vessel hold.moore was operating a forklift in the hold when a fell from a load carried by the ship crane approximately feet above the floor of the hold,striking moore on his forklift.the district court found vessel liability under section b and scindia steam navigation de los santos,d.
scindia outlined three duties shipowners owe to longshoremen the turnover duty,relating to the condition of the ship upon the commencement of stevedoring operations the duty to prevent injuries to longshoremen in areas remaining under the active control of the vessel and the duty to intervene.howlett birkdale shipping,d citing scindia,at.due largely to problems with the crane,the district court found a violation of all three duties.first,the district court found that the vessel owner failed to warn on turnover of hidden defects of the crane.second,the court found that the injury was caused by a hazard under control of the ship.third,the court found that the vessel violated its duty to intervene when it clearly knew of the crane problems.the court concluded that the defective crane caused moore death,assessing comparative fault to angela,to stevedores,and to moore himself.
the total damage award was,including in damages for loss of society.the court entered a judgment for and granted plaintiff a increase in security sufficient to cover the judgment.
angela requested mandamus review of the district court ruling on the increase of security,which this court denied without opinion.angela timely noticed this appeal.
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction because this is an admiralty action against the vessel,supp.admiralty maritime claims rule jurisdiction is in rem only.
we must first determine whether the district court clearly erred in finding angela breached a scindia duty owed to the longshoreman.we review factual findings only for clear error.mcallister united states.see also theriot united states,cir.
the turnover duty relates to the condition of the ship upon the commencement of stevedoring operations.scindia,at.this duty requires a vessel to exercise 
ordinary care under the circumstances to turn over the ship and its equipment in such condition that an expert and experienced stevedoring contractor,mindful of the dangers he should reasonably expect to encounter will be able by the exercise of ordinary care to carry on cargo operations with reasonable safety to persons and property.
howlett,at.quoting federal marine terminals,burnside shipping,d.the duty extends to warning the stevedore of hazards with respect to its equipment known to the vessel that would likely be encountered by the stevedore and would not be obvious to him.scindia,at.
the court finding that the turnover duty was breached is supported by the evidence.the court found that angela was aware that there were serious problems with the crane as a result of complaints made to it by coastal cargo a stevedoring company that had used the crane for a few days just before stevedores.after multiple breakdowns and repairs,the crane had weight limitations and restrictions on movement,and it moved erratically,jerking and surging at times.the court found that the problems with the crane were hydraulic,and that the crane had a poor maintenance record the district court found that,had stevedores known the problems coastal encountered with crane,this would have affected their operations.this finding is supported by the evidence 
angela argues that a vessel has no duty to warn of dangers that would be obvious to a longshoreman of reasonable competence,such as a jerking crane.this exception to the turnover duty applies if the defect causing the injury is open and obvious and one that the longshoreman should have seen.scindia,at.pimental ltd canadian pacific bul,cir.the exception does not apply,however,if the longshoreman only alternatives to facing the hazard are unduly impracticable or or would force him to leave the job.pimental,at treadaway societe anonyme,cir teply mobil oil,cir.
the district court found both that the condition was not open and obvious and that the longshoremen only alternatives to facing the hazards were unduly impractical,time consuming,and costly.these findings,too,have support in the evidence.no one told stevedores crane operator,for example,of the problems coastal experienced,even after he complained of similar problems.rather,a vessel representative told him to slam the control stick when he had problems with the crane one might conclude that the vessel owner was suggesting mistakenly that any problem was operational,hiding the real problem that was hydraulic.see,scindia,at.recognizing ship owner duty to warn of hidden danger known to him 
to the finding that alternatives to facing the hazard were unduly impractical or time consuming,angela contends that switching cranes would have involved no additional time or expense.support for the court contrary finding lies in evidence that the other crane that could reach this hold was already in use and had problems of its own that the vessel owner had in the past refused to accept responsibility for standby time of stevedores refusing to unload cargo due to repairs and that longshoremen refusing to work might lose business because the trade is competitive.
the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the entire record.where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.anderson city of bessemer,d.after reviewing the record,we are not left with a firm and definite conviction that a mistake has been made.henderson belknap in re henderson,cir,cert.denied,d.accordingly,we find no clear error in the findings that the vessel owner violated the turnover duty and that the open and obvious exception did not exempt the vessel from the turnover duty 
appellant next questions whether vessel negligence was a legal cause of the accident.angela argues that the accident was caused not by the malfunctioning crane but by stevedore assembling the into loads of,a configuration it asserts is inherently dangerous.the district court found vessel fault clearly contributed to the accident,citing the vessel failure to revisit the hydraulic pressure issues with the crane and the failure to inform stevedores about the crane problems experienced by coastal.
the evidence supports the district court finding that erratic motions such as jerking of the crane caused the to fall from the load.trial testimony also supports the inference that,had stevedores been duly warned about problems with the crane,it would have conducted its operations differently.to be a legal cause of a plaintiff injury,breach of a scindia duty must be a substantial factor in the injury.donaghey odeco,cir.the evidence at trial amply supports the finding that the vessel breach of the turnover duty was a substantial factor in causing the accident and moore death,so that the district court did not clearly err in its finding.
we must next determine whether the district court erred in assessing only five percent of the fault to the decedent.the district court determined that although moore was under the when it landed,he was not improperly driving the forklift under the path of the load.a flagman and hatch workers saw the load clear the hatch cover.when the flagman waved the load clear,moore and other workers resumed their duties in the hold.the testimony of the longshoremen uniformly supports these findings.the court also found that erratic motions of the crane probably launched the toward the middle of the hatch where moore had just moved his forklift.the district court found that any fault on the part of moore derives from the fact that he should have seen the jerking of the crane and anticipated the worst from such erratic crane movement.we will not disturb the district court choice to credit the foregoing testimony and assess very limited fault to moore for not anticipat ing the worst.
we are next asked to reverse the award of damages because they are not available in b cases.whether damages for loss of consortium are recoverable is a legal question,subject to de novo review.michel total,cir.
the loss of consortium award is permissible in this b case.services,gaudet,d,and nichols petroleum helicopters,cir,each allowed damages for longshoremen injured in territorial waters.despite illogical discrepancies between the law governing injuries to longshoremen in territorial waters and persons governed by the death on the high seas act or the jones act,we must apply the law as it is.nichols,at united states,cir.cert.denied,d.
angela also contends that for loss of consortium is nevertheless subject to remittitur because it is excessive.indeed,the district court determined that the evidence warranted the highest award possible for damages,and fixed the amount based on awards for death in air crash cases.the determination of the extent of damages is for the trier of fact,and in this area the appellate court should step lightly or not at all.in re air crash disaster,cir.
we review a trial judge assessment of damages for clear error.sosa lago izabal,cir a.an award is excessive only if it is greater than the maximum amount the trier of fact could properly have awarded.sosa,at.an appellate court may not determine excessiveness by comparing verdicts in similar cases,but rather must review each case on its own facts.winbourne eastern airlines,cir,cert.denied,d sosa,at.
damage awards in analogous cases provide an objective frame of reference,but they do not control our assessment of individual circumstances.wheat united states,cir we measure the award under the maximum recovery rule,which provides that we will decline to reduce damages where the amount awarded is not disproportionate to at least one factually similar case from the relevant jurisdiction.lebron united states,cir internal citations and quotations omitted,emphasis in original.to avoid substituting our opinion for that of the fact finder,we apply a multiplier or percentage enhancement to past similar awards,which is for bench trials.see salinas,cir noting enhancement has been applied only in jury trials and multiplier has applied in both bench trials and jury trials.
here the plaintiff and decedent had been married months,after having been together for seven years and,as the district court found,had a truly loving relationship.they married when they were approximately years old and had no children together.the award for loss of love and affection in this case is excessive and constitutes an abuse of the trier of fact discretion.
we agree with defendants that the air crash cases relied upon by the district court are not factually similar,as in each case the court relied on the fact that other family members perished along with the spouse one relied on the additional fact that the surviving spouse was left to raise a child without the decedent.in re air crash disaster,at maximum for wife lost along with three minor children caldarera eastern airlines,cir maximum for plaintiff having lost his wife of more than years as well as their and plaintiffs mother,and being left to raise his by himself winbourne eastern airlines,cir approving for a loss of wife,when plaintiff also lost two children,cert.denied,d.

the highest award in a factually similar louisiana case we have found is.see fannin louisiana power light,so d.cir.for loss of consortium not abuse of discretion for romeo and juliette scenario and true love affair wherein couple courted for years and were married approximately months,no children,when death occurred,leaving spouse devastated and lost and in a daze,writ denied,so d see also easton chevron,so d.cir.award of to was within the discretion of the trier of fact for death after years marriage,very solid and loving,no children,writ denied,so d,and writ denied,so d.
we reach our conclusion primarily on the evidence in this record,and secondarily on the rough guidance provided by awards approved for similar injuries by the louisiana appellate courts and the decisions of this court applying louisiana law.see air crash disaster,at.applying the maximum recovery rule to the award in this case requires remittitur of the award to of,or for damages.on the facts of this case,is the maximum award that could be made,subject to the discussion in the next section.
angela next asks us to hold that the court exceeded its jurisdiction by awarding damages in excess of the security posted to release the arrested vessel.the district court in rem jurisdiction was based on the letter of undertaking posted to release the arrest of the angela.the district court rendered judgment in an amount exceeding the security,and plaintiff filed a post trial motion to increase security to cover the judgment.
the district court granted plaintiff motion to increase security.the court noted that the security originally ordered did represent an amount sufficient to cover the amount of the plaintiff claim fairly stated,because the plaintiff counsel stated on the record that he could live with.increasing the security,the district court remarked,
the court also recognizes that the vast majority of the award is for damages,which may well be unavailable to the plaintiff after the issue of its recoverability is considered by the fifth circuit.under these circumstances,the court finds that the defendant shall increase the amount of security to equal the amount of the judgment,plus accrued interest and costs 
we find no legal support for a increase in security.while it is true a district court may require further security at any time,b supp.e b,we interpret the phrase to mean substitute or replacement security,when a surety has become insolvent rather than additional security,except where the vessel was released by fraud,misrepresentation,or mistake of the court plaintiff does allege that the district court mistakenly calculated moore claim,but the fixing of security was based in part on plaintiff counsel own declaration to the court.it was therefore not based on a mistake of the court as discussed in the jurisprudence 
we find no authority for the court to have required additional security.see united states ames.t he remedy of the libelants was transferred from the property to the bond or stipulation accepted by the court as the substitute for the property seized.the webb,wall.n othing but the amount of the security is within the control of the court.incas monterey printing packaging,sang jin,cir release of vessel in exchange for posting of security transfers lien from vessel to fund representing security,cert.denied,d welding gotham marine corporation,t he court can exercise as much authority over the bond that is a substitute for the res as if the vessel itself were in the custody of the court,but no more,cited with approval in incas,at.
the security and amount of damage award are therefore limited to the sum in the original letter of undertaking.see the wanata.where value of property held is insufficient to pay the loss,it is not competent for the court to award damages against the sureties in the stipulation beyond the proceeds or value.cooper reynolds,wall.one essential requisite to jurisdiction in rem is seizure or attachment of property w ithout this the court can proceed no further with it the court can proceed to subject that property to the demand of plaintiff.emphasis added the ann caroline,wall.stipulator who has filed a bond or stipulation for definite sum in place of vessel can not be compelled to pay more than expressed amount overstreet water vessel norkong,cir bond that stands in the place of the vessel is the sole property that is within the court jurisdiction.welding,at a stipulation for value represents a new security of unfluctuating value in the place of the vessel.the mutual,if,by giving of bond or stipulation for value,vessel is released and freed forever,court has no power to order additional security.but see central hudson gas empresa naviera santa,cir upholding admiralty jurisdiction to enter judgment exceeding value of arrested res,which was a letter of undertaking,even though the owner filed a restricted appearance in the in rem action,for use in a later in personam action,limited only by res estoppel principles.
the damage award in this case,to the extent that it exceeds the amount of security,must be modified.
conclusion 
we find no clear error in the findings that angela violated its duty under scindia in a manner that caused moore death,that moore was five percent at fault,or that damages are recoverable.the quantum of damages is not sustainable on these facts,as discussed above.because of the amount of security posted,the total damage award may not exceed.the matter is therefore 
remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
the majority opinion is improperly deferential to the district court determination that angela maritime angela was aware of latent defects that were the cause of the accident and longshoremen moore death,and to its determination that the defects were not open and obvious to moore employer stevedores,stevedores.although the majority opinion is correct that we review the district court findings of fact for clear error,we review the application of those facts to law de novo.thus,applying the less deferential standard,i believe the district court improperly applied its own factual determinations to controlling legal precedent in sustaining liability against angela under the turnover duty.however,as i believe the district court properly found angela liable under the duty to intervene,i would affirm the judgment,vacate the district court allocation of liability,and remand the case for a calculation of fault under the duty to intervene.therefore,i respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.
the amendments to the harbor workers compensation act fundamentally changed both the duties shipowners owe to longshoremen and consequently the scope of the liability to which they are subject.two supreme court cases,scindia steam navigation de los santos,d,and howlett birkdale shipping,d,have together outlined the relative duties of shipowners and stevedores to longshoremen,and the circumstances where liability against a shipowner can be sustained under b.the scindia court explained that a s a general matter,the shipowner may rely on the stevedore to avoid exposing the longshoremen to unreasonable hazards the ship is not the common employer of the longshoremen and owes no such statutory duty to them.at.at.the howlett court emphasized the point explaining that t he design of these changes was to shift more of the responsibility for compensating injured longshoremen to the party best able to prevent injuries the stevedore employer.at.at.
nevertheless,a ship owes three duties to longshoremen the turnover duty the active control duty and the duty to intervene.howlett,at.at.the majority opinion relies solely on the turnover duty to establish liability.the turnover duty requires the vessel to warn the stevedore of any hazards on the ship or with respect to its equipment,so long as the hazards are known to the vessel or should be known to it in the exercise of reasonable care,and would not be obvious to or anticipated by the stevedore if reasonably competent in the performance of his work.id.at.at.therefore the duty attaches only to latent defects of which the vessel has or should have had knowledge.that duty is extinguished,and in essence shifted to the stevedore,if the stevedore either gains actual knowledge of the defect,or if the stevedore should have anticipated its existence.see id.at.at.that duty does not shift if the longshoremen only alternatives when facing an open and obvious hazard are unduly impracticable or time consuming pimental ltd canadian pacific bulk,cir.
in addition to establishing a duty owed by the vessel to the deceased,the plaintiff must establish that the latent defect in the crane was the legal cause of the accident such that it was a substantial factor in the injury.donaghey odeco,cir.therefore,to sustain liability,moore must show that angela had or should have had knowledge of a latent defect in the crane which was not,and could not have been,discovered by stevedores and was a substantial factor in the accident.
we review the district court factual findings for clear error however,we review both questions of law and mixed questions of fact and law de novo.theriot united states,cir.the clearly erroneous standard of review does not apply to decisions made by district court judges when they apply legal principles to essentially undisputed facts.walker braus,cir.
the district court determined that erratic motions such as the jerking of the crane caused the to fall from the load.it additionally concluded the jerking was due to a latent hydraulics problem of which angela was aware,and of which stevedores was oblivious.it relied on the expert testimony of edward webster to establish,as a general matter,that a hydraulics problem worsens as the hydraulics heat up,which can be caused by the excessive weight of the loads lifted,and on the testimony of coastal cargo coastal employee rene falgoust to establish that the crane was experiencing hydraulics problems.while webster testimony is hypothetical and does not establish that the crane was suffering from a hydraulics problem at the time of the accident,falgoust testimony only refers to hydraulics problems the crane was experiencing while under coastal control,days before turnover,and not while it was under stevedores employ when the accident occurred 
strangely,the district court also adopted the testimony of marine surveyor ben haveman who testified that his inspection of the crane revealed evidence of hydraulic oil leakage that did not affect the operation of the crane,but that old cranes leak hydraulic fuel.it also adopted the testimony of edward roy,an expert in crane operations and inspections,who concluded,after his inspection,that the crane had no structural deficiencies,only cosmetic problems.finally,it concluded that time was spent on repairs on april,days before turnover to stevedores,by angela in an effort to fix whatever problems the crane was experiencing while under coastal control.
cumulatively,these findings of fact suggest that the crane had no latent hydraulics defect at the time of turnover,and that its jerking at the time of the accident must have had an alternate cause.it also establishes that,even if there were latent defects,angela had no knowledge of them,as it believed that it had repaired whatever problems the crane was experiencing by the time of turnover.vessel liability can not be sustained if either there were no latent defects or the vessel did not have knowledge of the defects.see howlett,at.at.thus the district court finding that angela had knowledge of a latent hydraulics defect at the time of turnover is insupportable by its own factual conclusions.
even if there was a hydraulics problem,the real cause of the accident,as established by the district court,was the jerking of the crane.the district court merely assumes the jerking was caused by a hydraulics problem.this jerking,whatever its cause,by stevedores own admission,was quite apparent to them.the district court in its factual findings determined that the stevedores crane operator had a critical problem with the operation of the crane when he first used it.it also cited additional testimony from stevedores employees henry gaston,john dunham,and willie davis establishing that the crane was operating erratically and was clearly malfunctioning.thus,based on the district court factual findings,it was clear to stevedores that the crane was malfunctioning,and more importantly that it was jerking in a manner that eventually led to the accident.
the defect in the crane that is the stated cause of the accident was open and obvious to stevedores.even assuming the crane had a latent hydraulics defect,of which stevedores was unaware,it was certainly aware of the jerking and erratic movements that were a clear manifestation,if not of a hydraulics problem,of a malfunctioning crane.any longshoremen there,if reasonably competent in the performance of his work,should have realized what would have been obvious to any laymen,that the crane was malfunctioning and was a danger to everyone around it.see howlett,at.at.
the majority opinion affirms the district court conclusion that,even if the defects were open and obvious,there were no viable alternatives to using the malfunctioning crane because using a different crane would have been unduly time consuming in the past,angela had not accepted responsibility for time of stevedores refusing to unload cargo due to repair and,stevedores would lose future business.applying the incorrect standard of review,the majority opinion further concludes that when there are two permissible views of the evidence there can be no clear error.
the district court view of the evidence is impermissible under our precedent.in greenwood societe francaise de,cir,we did not apply the no viable alternative exception when a stevedore used a crane despite its open and obvious defects because the stevedore presented no evidence that the crane operator was instructed to continue to use the crane despite the defect or that he would face trouble for delaying the work.id.internal quotations omitted.we relied on the fact that the vessel was never informed of the problem,id.at,and that the crane operator knew immediately that the crane was not operating properly,id.at,to absolve the vessel of liability.
applying greenwood,i believe the no viable alternative exception should not be applied in this case.there is no evidence showing that stevedores requested the crane be fixed or that operations cease until repairs were made.according to the district court,the crane operator knew immediately that the crane was having problems.he complained to angela about the crane jerking and was advised to slam the stick to stop the jerking.either the crane operator found the advise satisfactory or he made the decision not to inform angela that the problem was more substantial and required more thoughtful attention.further,there is no evidence angela informed stevedores that it would not make needed repairs,or that there would be reprisals for requesting repairs.
the only evidence suggesting that a dispute as to payment for down time during repairs might ensue was coastal records evidencing its dispute with angela over such payment.there,however,is no evidence demonstrating stevedores had access to those documents or otherwise had knowledge of that dispute prior to discovery in this case.consequently,it could not have been deterred by knowledge of that dispute at the time it decided to not request repairs.
coastal,in contrast,was not deterred by the potential for dispute with angela.it twice requested that the crane be repaired,and both requests were honored by angela.the purpose of the no viable alternative exception is to sustain liability against the vessel when the shipowner creates conditions where the stevedore feels compelled to face an open and obvious hazard.this exception,however,should not be used to provide stevedores an excuse for not demanding repairs in the face of open and obvious dangers to their longshoremen.this would defeat the intent of the amendments to shift responsibility for the safety of the longshoremen from the vessel to the stevedore.see howlett,at.at.
these policy goals would similarly be defeated by excusing stevedores behavior due to the competitiveness of the industry.stevedores will be less likely to request repairs if they know they will not be held liable for their failure to do so.osha regulations have already recognized this concern and require cranes with a visible or known defect that affects safe operations shall not be used.defects shall be reported immediately to the officer in charge of the vessel.a shifting liability from the stevedore to the vessel would not only defeat the purposes of the amendments and osha regulations,it would increase the likelihood of tragic accidents such as this one by eliminating the stevedore incentive to demand repairs in the face of apparent danger to its employees.
nothing in the record suggests,and the district court did not find,that angela communicated to stevedores that it would either not make repairs,or not compensate the longshoremen if repairs were requested.nor does the record,or the district court findings,suggest that stevedores requested repairs and was refused.the district court conclusion that stevedores alternatives to facing the hazard were unduly impracticable is inconsistent with its own factual findings,the precedent of this court,and with the policies behind the amendments of the harbor workers compensation act as annunciated by the supreme court in scindia and howlett.
although sustaining liability under the turnover duty is inappropriate,the supreme court has recognized two other duties shipowners owe to longshoremen the active control duty and the duty to intervene.howlett,at.at.the district court properly sustained liability under the duty to intervene.
the shipowner has a duty to intervene and repair if it knows of the defect and knows the stevedore continued use of the machine present s an unreasonable risk of harm to the longshoremen scindia,at.at.this means that a vessel has a duty to intervene when it has actual knowledge of a dangerous condition and actual knowledge that the stevedore,in the exercise of obviously improvident judgment,has failed to remedy it.greenwood,at.additionally,the longshoreman must show that the shipowner had actual knowledge that the defect posed unreasonable risk of harm and actual knowledge that it could not rely on the stevedore to protect its employees.id.as the shipowner defers to the expertise of the stevedore in the operation of the equipment,t he shipowner obligation to intervene is narrow and requires something more than mere shipowner knowledge of a dangerous condition.id.at internal quotations omitted.thus,for the expert stevedore judgment to appear obviously improvident,that expert stevedore must use an object with a defective condition that is so hazardous that anyone can tell that its continued use creates an unreasonable risk of harm even when the stevedore expertise is taken into account.id.
the district court found that the crane erratic motions were clearly observable by ship personnel,who alone did or should have recognized the mechanical problems reflected.angela argues we should follow our holding in greenwood where we did not apply the duty to intervene in a similar situation where a longshoremen was injured due to a crane erratic jerking,and where the shipowner knew of the crane problems and allowed the stevedore to continue to use the crane despite
