when a dangerous condition is present on commercial premises and injury results to a business invitee,tort liability often turns on whether the owner or occupier knew or reasonably should have known of the existence of the hazard.see,garcía catalán united states,cir gomez stop shop supermkt,cir.this is such a case and,in the wake of a bench trial,the district court concluded that the evidence failed to show that the defendant had the requisite knowledge actual or constructive.accordingly,the court entered judgment for the defendant.after careful consideration,we affirm.
we start by rehearsing the origin and travel of the case.our task is simplified because the parties have stipulated to many of the facts.
on january,blanca calderón ortega visited the fort buchanan post exchange store px in san juan,puerto rico.the px is located on the grounds of the military base and is operated by the army and air force exchange service.after the plaintiff had shopped for a while,she proceeded toward the area to pay for her purchases.en route,she slipped on liquid that was present on the floor in front of one of the cash registers.
the shift manager was summoned and responded promptly.he offered to call an ambulance,but the plaintiff declined and left the premises.the next morning,she sought medical treatment.following a series of doctors visits,she was diagnosed as having a impairment stemming from the fall.
the plaintiff filed an administrative claim against the united states,and the statutory period allowed for consideration of her claim expired without a disposition.see a.she then repaired to the federal district court and sued under the federal tort claims act ftca,id.b.her complaint averred that px personnel had been negligent both in preventing the spill and in failing to clean up the liquid.
the parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge.see id.c.following some preliminary skirmishing not relevant here,the district court in the person of the magistrate judge conducted a bench trial.at the close of all the evidence,the court reserved decision and solicited briefs.several weeks later,the court handed down an opinion in which it found the defendant not liable for the plaintiff injuries.see calderón ortega united states,wl.the court determined that the plaintiff failure to establish the defendant actual or constructive knowledge of the spill was dispositive.see id.at.this timely appeal ensued.
we previously have explained that an appellate court will displace factual findings made in the aftermath of a bench trial only if those findings are clearly erroneous.united states.bosworth,cir.even so,we review the trier conclusions of law de novo.see wojciechowicz united states,cir.
as a sovereign nation,the united states is open to tort liability only insofar as it consents to be sued.see nieves romero united states,cir.to this end,t he ftca comprises a limited waiver of federal sovereign immunity,which allows the government to be held liable for certain tortious acts and omissions.id.the ftca mandates that an inquiring court must look to the law of the place where the act or omission occurred when making a liability determination.b.in this case,then,we must extract the substantive rules of decision from puerto rico law.
under article of the puerto rico civil code,a person who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence may be held liable for the damage.laws ann.tit.to establish liability,the plaintiff must show that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff,that the duty was breached,that damages resulted,and that those damages were caused by the breach of duty.see nieves romero,at citing sociedad de gananciales gonzález padín,offic.trans.
in the case at hand,the first element of the claim is apparent one who operates a business for profit undeniably owes a duty of reasonable care to business invitees.see cotto consol.mut.ins,offic.trans.our inquiry,however,stops with the second element breach of duty.
a business invitee who alleges a breach of the duty owed by the owner or occupier of commercial premises normally must show that the injury was reasonably foreseeable and,thus,could have been avoided had the defendant acted with due care.woods leber hyatt hotels of,cir see coyne taber partners i,cir.it follows,therefore,that i n a premises liability case,fault ordinarily depends on knowledge.nieves romero,at see woods leber,at noting that puerto rico law ordinarily requires a demonstration of the owner or occupier actual or constructive knowledge of the condition.
there is no showing of actual knowledge of the dangerous condition the spilled liquid here.the district court found that neither the cashier stationed near the aisle where the liquid had spilled nor any other employee of the px knew of the spill at any time prior to the plaintiff fall.see calderón ortega,wl,at.this finding is consistent with the record and we can not say that it is clearly erroneous.thus,the case turns on the evidence or lack of evidence that the defendant had constructive knowledge of the liquid on the floor.
in an effort to substantiate her claim of constructive knowledge,the plaintiff labors to convince us that the spill could have been discovered by reasonable inspection.her argument has two facets.
first,the plaintiff contends that the px staff neglected to adhere to the px established inspection policies.this contention leans heavily on the cashier testimony that she was trained to inspect her surroundings a s often as possible,but that on the day of the accident she did not perform any such inspections because she was kept busy by a steady stream of customers.
the district court met this facet of the plaintiff argument.it supportably found that the cashier primary responsibility was to deal with customers and that it was n ot protocol for a cashier to step out from behind the cash register to check for hazards.calderón ortega,wl,at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.the court also found as a fact that the primary responsibility for detecting spills lay with the shift manager,see and the record discloses,without contradiction,that the shift manager performed his routine inspections in a diligent and timely fashion on the day of the incident,see id.at.those inspections revealed nothing amiss.
second,the plaintiff maintains that the px protocol for preventing and detecting spills was inadequate.here,too,the plaintiff position is at odds with the record.
the district court found that the px had a number of relevant policies in place.pertinently,the shift manager was responsible for checking the premises every twenty to thirty minutes in order to ensure that the floors were clear.if the shift manager or any other employee,for that matter spotted a spill,the person who made the discovery was enjoined to block off the area immediately and either clean up the spill or call for someone else to do so.the district court finding that these protocols were fully observed on the day of the incident is supported by the record and is not clearly erroneous.see cumpiano banco santander,cir explaining that a finding is not clearly erroneous unless it gives rise to an unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.
relatedly,the plaintiff asserts that the cashier,not the shift manager,should have inspected the area in front of the cash register.this bald assertion is insufficient to establish liability speculation that different policies could have been put into place,untethered to any proof of differing levels of efficacy,is insufficient by itself to ground an inference of negligence see,nieves romero,at.
as a fallback,the plaintiff suggests that the spill may have been caused by leakage from bags of ice that were on sale in the px.even if this is so and there is no real proof of it the px had in place protocols,including signage,to prevent spills from leaking bags of ice.the record contains nothing beyond conjecture that suggests that these protocols were violated.
in all events,it was the plaintiff burden to place the court in a position to make a clear and specific determination on negligence.cotto,offic.trans.at.the
