the outcome of this appeal is controlled by important questions of rhode island law and public policy as to which we have found no dispositive precedent.because the rhode island supreme court is the ultimate arbiter of matters of rhode island law,we certify these unsettled questions to that court for guidance.see.
background 
joseph caramadre believed that he had found the holy grail of investment strategies a way to speculate in securities while shielding himself from the adverse effects of losses.to implement this scheme,he exploited a perceived loophole in certain annuities issued by,inter alia,western reserve life assurance company of ohio.because certain features of western reserve annuities are integral both to caramadre contrivance and to the issues on appeal,we start by outlining those features.
the classic annuity offers a person a stream of periodic payments during his life that are actuarially calculated and fixed in amount.in exchange,the person makes an,premium payment to the issuing insurance company.for example,an investor might pay an insurance company a premium in exchange for a promise to pay him per month for the rest of his life.
over the years,annuity products have evolved,and the wrl freedom premier iii annuity issued by the appellant is a far cry from the classic model.we sketch some of the salient differences.
to begin,the appellant product is a variable annuity,not a fixed annuity.instead of ceding control of his premium dollars to the insurance company,the investor retains the right to direct that those dollars be invested in certain securities.moreover,the annuity does not necessarily entail fixed periodic payments to the beneficiary rather,it presents a diverse menu of payment options,including payouts that are determined by the value,from time to time,of the acquired securities.consequently,the amounts paid to the beneficiary may ebb and flow with the performance of the investment portfolio.
in addition,the investor in a wrl freedom premier iii annuity can use the lifetime of someone other than himself the annuitant as a measuring device to determine how long the annuity payments will last.the investor the owner provides the premium dollars,directs the investment strategy,and selects the recipient of the periodic payouts called for by the annuity the beneficiary.the beneficiary,who may or may not be the owner,will receive those payouts as long as the annuitant remains alive.significantly,a wrl freedom premier iii annuity contains no requirement that the owner and the annuitant be one and the same person in fact,the annuity contract does not require any extrinsic tie between the two.
unlike a classic annuity,the wrl freedom premier iii annuity allows the owner to infuse more than a single premium payment into the annuity.up until a specified date not relevant here,the appellant will accept premium payments,as long as the total investment does not exceed.
last but far from least the owner can elect a double enhanced death benefit by agreeing to pay an additional daily charge.an owner who elects this benefit designates a beneficiary,who,upon the annuitant death,will be entitled to receive the greater of the total premiums invested in the policy,plus interest accrued at per annum,or the highest value of the policy that is,the highest value of its investment portfolio,adjusted for certain deposits and withdrawals on any annual anniversary of the policy.the owner and the beneficiary may be one and the same person.
caramadre figured out that if an individual named himself or an entity he controlled as both the owner and the beneficiary of a wrl freedom premier iii annuity and elected the death benefit,that individual could engage in market speculation without any downside exposure.caramadre decided that this scheme could best be perpetrated by applying for an annuity with a relatively low initial premium,invested conservatively so as to avoid red flags.the whether caramadre himself or his nominee would subsequently deposit a substantially more munificent incremental premium and steer the investment of the aggregate premium dollars into speculative securities.the upshot was a heads i win,tails you lose scenario if the investment gamble paid off,he would reap the fruits of his speculation when the annuitant died and if the speculation backfired,the death benefit guaranteed that he would fare no worse than a full return of premiums paid plus interest.in the latter event,the insurance company would be left holding a collection of nearly worthless securities.
despite the cleverness of caramadre scheme,there was a rub one had to be sure that the death benefit would be triggered within a relatively short time after the risky investments were made that timing would ensure that the of the annuity caramadre or his nominee would receive either the benefit of a investment gamble or,at worst,the return of his bet.thus,the linchpin of the scheme was locating and recruiting potential annuitants whose lifespans were predictably short the terminally ill.
caramadre rose to this challenge.among other recruitment tools,he circulated flyers promising cash payments to patients for agreeing to let their names be used.
charles buckman,a rhode island resident suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,received one of caramadre flyers from a visiting nurse.his interest piqued,buckman followed up on the flyer and contacted estate planning resources,a company.
to make a tawdry tale tolerably terse,buckman accepted a cash payment to identify himself as the annuitant on an application for a wrl freedom premier iii variable annuity.the application designated a caramadre nominee,adm associates,llc adm,as the prospective owner and beneficiary of the annuity.the application specifically requested inclusion in the annuity contract of the double enhanced death benefit.buckman and adm were wholly unrelated parties indeed,up to that point buckman had never heard of 
the appellant received the application on or about september.four days later,it approved the application and issued a wrl freedom premier iii annuity the policy.pertinently,the policy provided that it would be incontestable from the policy date.
the application had been accompanied by an initial premium payment.roughly four months after the policy went into effect,adm made an additional premium payment of.
at some point,the appellant apparently learned of caramadre scheme and came to believe that the policy was an iteration of it it developed an acute case of seller remorse and,approximately a year after the policy inception date,notified both buckman and adm that it intended to rescind the policy.
acting on this stated intention,the appellant sued adm in the united states district court for the district of rhode island,seeking rescission of the policy and a declaration that the policy was either void ab initio or had been properly rescinded.it also asserted claims for fraud,civil liability for crimes,and civil conspiracy 
adm moved to dismiss the complaint.the district court heard this motion along with motions in similar cases.after careful consideration,the court dismissed the claims brought against see reserve life assurance conreal llc,d.with respect to the appellant prayers for rescission and declaratory relief,it held that the presence of the death benefit did not transform the policy into a life insurance contract under rhode island law.see id.at.hence,the absence of an insurable interest neither rendered the policy void nor justified its rescission.see id.although the court acknowledged that the whole point of the scheme was to capitalize on the death benefits,it concluded that the d efendants had figured out how to game a flaw in the product.id.at.
the district court based its dismissal of the tort claims on the incontestability clause.see id.at.in holding that this provision did not offend public policy,the court reasoned that rhode island default incontestability period can be supplanted by any shorter period more favorable to the insured.see id.at citing laws a.
the appellant filed an amended complaint.the district court dismissed this complaint on substantially the same grounds.see reserve life assurance caramadre,d.with no claims remaining against adm,the court certified the judgment as final as between adm and the appellant.see.b nystedt nigro,cir.this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
this case implicates two important issues of state law,either or both of which may determine the outcome of this litigation.we describe these issues and,for what assistance it may provide,limn the considerations that have prompted us to certify them to rhode island highest court.
a.the insurable interest question.
we begin with the question of whether adm status as a stranger to its annuitant invalidates the policy.over a century ago,the rhode island supreme court declared that a purely speculative contract on the life of another procured by one without an insurable interest is contrary to public policy and may properly be held to be void.cronin.life ins.the rhode island general assembly subsequently endorsed the insurable interest concept,requiring relatives named as beneficiaries to have a substantial interest in an insured life engendered by love and affection,and other beneficiaries to have a lawful and substantial economic interest in having the life,health,or bodily safety of the individual insured continue.laws c.adm concedes that it did not have an insurable interest in the life of its annuitant.the question,then,reduces to whether the policy is the kind of contract that rhode island insurable interest requirement renders infirm.
the answer may depend on taxonomy that is,on whether the policy should be classified either as an insurance contract or as an annuity.if the former rubric applies,the statutory iteration of the insurable interest requirement,which prohibits the procurement of any insurance contract upon the life or body of another individual if the benefits under the contract are payable to someone other than the insured,his personal representatives,or a person having an insurable interest in the individual insured,id.a,may resolve the question.in other words,if the death benefit makes the policy an insurance contract upon the life of the annuitant,the want of an insurable interest would defeat the policy.
were an inquiring court to look solely at the label that the appellant affixed to the policy,the premise of that proposition would be easily refuted the document designates itself as a variable annuity,not an insurance contract.but labels can be misleading,and the rhode island courts have sometimes looked beyond the title of a document to deem its substance to be insurance.for example,in sisson ex rel.nardolillo prata undertaking,the rhode island supreme court went beyond the burial contract designation attached to certain agreements and held that those agreements actually comprised burial insurance.id.at.
there is some reason to believe that such might be appropriate here.the common understanding of life insurance encompasses a n agreement between an insurance company and the policyholder to pay a specified amount to a designated beneficiary on the insured death.black law dictionary ed.the general assembly seems to have embraced that understanding,declaring that life insurance is simply every insurance upon the lives of human beings and every insurance appertaining to that life.laws c.
in this instance,an insurance company the appellant issued the policy,which obligated it to pay at least the aggregate premiums invested in the annuity plus interest upon the annuitant death.to this extent,the policy is,at least in part,the functional equivalent of a life insurance policy.see kendall burr et,stranger initiated annuity transactions and the case for insurable interest.ins.
here,however,there is more to the story.unlike a traditional life insurance policy,the death benefit did not promise a defined sum upon death but,rather,promised either the market value of the policy or the aggregate premiums paid into it whichever was greater.moreover,the appellant did not treat the policy as if it were life insurance though cognizant of the insurable interest requirement for life insurance,it made no effort to verify that the owner of the policy had any relationship with the annuitant.by the same token,it did not engage in the sort of medical underwriting that might have enabled it to calculate the annuitant mortality risk.
last,the appellant chose to structure and market the transaction as an annuity and venerable precedent indicates that annuities unlike life insurance contracts are not normally deemed violative of public policy for want of an insurable interest.see cronin,at.this distinction between life insurance and annuities is firmly entrenched in positive law.the general assembly definition of annuities explicitly excludes payments made in connection with a life insurance policy.laws a.
as the appellant reminds us,though,the policy is not a annuity.in that era,the annuities to which courts referred had traditionally and customarily been fixed annuities,offering the annuitant specified and definite amounts beginning with a certain year of his or her life.sec var.annuity life ins.of.variable annuities particularly those carrying death benefit riders are a fairly recent innovation.see id.noting that the first variable annuity appeared in or about.thus,the policy is twice removed from its ancestors once by reason of its variable nature and once again by reason of its death benefit.it is not clear to us whether these innovations are sufficient to bring the policy outside the boundaries of rhode island historic exclusion of annuities from the insurable interest requirement.
we are equally uncertain as to how the relatively recent life settlements act,see laws to,affects this inquiry.through that legislation,the general assembly made pellucid that s life insurance that is,a practice or plan to initiate a life insurance policy for the benefit of a investor who,at the time of policy origination,has no insurable interest in the insured is forbidden under rhode island law.id.see id.i a x,a.this proscription expresses hostility to certain classes of transactions that are different than,but obviously similar to,the transaction in this case 
there is one further complication.the appellant attack on the policy focuses on the unseemly nature of the scheme that caramadre devised.nevertheless,an insurable interest requirement for contracts like the policy would not only affect arrangements in which the payoff is geared toward the annuitant quick demise but also contracts in which the payoff is geared to the annuitant longevity.for instance,an owner who purchases a variable annuity measured by the life of a year old healthy man might do so with a income stream in mind and without any thought of capitalizing on the opportunity for speculation associated with the annuity death benefit.this type of hypothetical owner would come much closer than an owner in the caramadre model to being a counterpart of the owner of a conventional fixed annuity.and that would be so even though both the hypothetical owner and the owner had purchased essentially the same variable annuity.
the short of it is that the policy does not seem to fit neatly into either the category of life insurance contracts or the conception of annuities.and to muddy the waters further,we think that it might be plausible to treat the policy as a hybrid.if so,the analysis would likely turn to whether requiring an insurable interest would comport with the broader purpose undergirding the insurable interest requirement.
this possibility prompts us to take a step back in time.historically,the insurable interest requirement prevented a contract from becoming a vehicle for gambling.in cronin,for example,the court traced the insurable interest requirement for life insurance to the english parliament life assurance act of,geo,eng,which prohibited insurance on the life of a person in which the beneficiary shall have no interest,or by way of gaming or wagering.at.that rule was followed in the united states as declaratory of the common law.id.by requiring owners of life insurance policies to have an interest of some sort in the insured life,courts could ensure that these co
