objecting to his portrayal in jonathan harr book a civil action,an account of toxic tort litigation over contaminated well water in woburn,massachusetts,that allegedly caused the death of several children,john riley,sued harr and his publisher for defamation and related torts.he was joined in that lawsuit by his wife,diane riley.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on most of the rileys claims on first amendment grounds.the rileys appeal the district court disposition of their claims.we affirm.
background 
we begin with a brief overview of the events described in a civil action the book that pertain to this case the specific statements to which riley objects are discussed in turn infra,and are also set forth in an appendix to this opinion the book,first published in,was on the new york times bestseller list for over two years and has been made into a motion picture.the book received much critical acclaim and has been required reading in law school courses.it purports to be a nonfictional account of a toxic tort lawsuit the anderson litigation brought by some residents of woburn,massachusetts,alleging that defendants beatrice foods company beatrice,grace company grace,and others were responsible for the contamination of two municipal water wells wells g and h in the aberjona river valley with toxic solvents,including trichloroethylene tce the anderson plaintiffs claimed that contaminated well water had caused them and their children to contract various ailments,including several fatal cases of leukemia,and that some of the tce found in wells g and h had come from a tannery operated by riley the tannery.beatrice had assumed the tannery environmental liabilities when it purchased the tannery in the plaintiffs theory was that riley or his subordinates had dumped tce on a fifteen acre parcel of undeveloped land between the tannery and the contaminated wells the fifteen acres,and that the tce had migrated into wells g and 
the book tells the story of the anderson litigation primarily from the perspective of the plaintiffs attorney,jan schlichtmann,recounting his struggle to prove that riley tannery and defendant grace were responsible for the contamination of wells g and the book describes evidence which,in schlichtmann view,tended to show that the tannery had dumped waste laced with tce on the fifteen acres,and repeatedly suggests that riley denials that such dumping had occurred were false.although schlichtmann is the book protagonist,and granted harr extensive access to his law firm during the litigation,harr account of his efforts is by no means uncritical.as schlichtmann builds his case,harr points out both its strengths and its weaknesses.harr also conducted extensive interviews with attorneys for the anderson defendants,and the book recounts the grounds for their rejection of schlichtmann theories.the book also notes schlichtmann failure to find direct proof of dumping by the tannery,riley steadfast denials of schlichtmann allegations,the conflicting views of experts on each side of the case,and the jury verdict in federal district court which rejected the plaintiffs claims against the tannery 
after the trial was over,schlichtmann discovered a report which yankee environmental engineering and research services,yankee had completed for riley in.the report stated that tannery waste had been dumped on a hillside leading to the fifteen acres,and that groundwater under the tannery flowed toward wells g and schlichtmann moved to set aside the verdict on the basis of this newly discovered evidence,which he argued should have been produced during discovery,and tracked down new witnesses who described the removal from the fifteen acres of what schlichtmann believed to have been tannery waste.the district court conducted a hearing and found that riley had engaged in concealment of the yankee report that was deliberate,a determination which the book reports as follows the judge found that riley had committed perjury and that his attorney was guilty of deliberate misconduct in failing to give schlichtmann the yankee report.the court concluded,however,that a new trial was not warranted because there was no available competent evidence tending to establish the disposal of complaint chemicals by the defendant either at the tannery site or on the acres.anderson beatrice foods,
riley took exception to a number of statements about him in the book.in he commenced this action against harr and his publishers,random house,and vintage books a division of random house,in new hampshire superior court.defendants removed the case to federal district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship riley amended complaint challenged twelve statements in the book in seven counts i intentional infliction of emotional distress ii slander against harr only iii defamation iv invasion of disclosure of private facts v invasion of the plaintiff in a false light vi loss of consortium and vii a demand for enhanced compensatory damages.reduced to its essence,riley action seeks to hold harr liable for wrongly describing him as a liar see statements c,d,e,f,h,i,j,and k infra,a perjurer see statement a infra,a kille r see statement g infra,a depressive see statement l infra or,in the alternative,for disclosing the private fact of his depression,and a bully see statement b infra.
the defendants moved to dismiss riley complaint,or in the alternative for summary judgment.the district court treated their motion as one for summary judgment,and in a lengthy,thoughtful order dated march,granted the motion with respect to most of riley claims.the order denied harr motion for summary judgment as to two of the twelve statements,and denied his motion to dismiss riley slander claim following limited discovery,the parties stipulated on march,to the dismissal of those claims that had survived the district court order of march.on april,riley filed a notice of appeal of the district court order.
ii.defamation 
we first set out the general principles which guide our inquiry,and then turn to the challenged statements.
general principles 
t he first amendment to the united states constitution place s limits on the application of the state law of defamation.milkovich lorain journal,d.in the wake of new york times sullivan,d,the supreme court has developed an elaborate body of law that defines those limits.in the case of a plaintiff the first amendment requires clear and convincing proof of actual malice on the part of the defendant gertz robert welch,d.a plaintiff such as riley need not demonstrate actual malice,but must bear the burden of showing that the speech at issue is false before recovering damages for defamation from a media defendant.philadelphia newspapers,hepps,d.
the supreme court has also recognized constitutional limits on the type of speech which may be the subject of state defamation actions.milkovich,at.emphasis in original.in milkovich,a case involving a media defendant,the court held that a statement on matters of public concern must be provable as false before there can be liability under state defamation law.at.milkovich also rejected the proposition that the first amendment creates a blanket exception to state defamation law for statements which are categorized as opinion as opposed to fact.id.at.the court pointed out that expressions of opinion may often imply an assertion of objective fact,id.at,and it would be destructive of the law of libel if a writer could escape liability for accusations of defamatory conduct simply by using,explicitly or implicitly,the words,i think.id.at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.as we observed in a subsequent decision,a statement couched as an opinion that presents or implies the existence of facts which are capable of being proven true or false can be actionable.levinsky,stores,cir.
however,and of central importance in this case,even a provably false statement is not actionable if it is plain that the speaker is expressing a subjective view,an interpretation,a theory,conjecture,or surmise,rather than claiming to be in possession of objectively verifiable facts gray martin press,cir quoting haynes alfred knopf,cir.as the ninth circuit has explained,when an author outlines the facts available to him,thus making it clear that the challenged statements represent his own interpretation of those facts and leaving the reader free to draw his own conclusions,those statements are generally protected by the first amendment.partington bugliosi,cir.
we applied these principles in phantom touring,affiliated publications,cir.the plaintiff,producer of a version of the phantom of the opera that was not the successful and acclaimed broadway show created by andrew lloyd webber,sued the boston globe for defamation,claiming that certain globe articles had falsely accused it of endeavoring to pass off its own production as the broadway version.id.at.we held that although the allegation of deliberate deception might be provable as true or false,t he sum effect of the format,tone and entire content of the articles is to make it unmistakably clear that the author was expressing a point of view only,rather than stating actual facts about the plaintiff honesty.id.at citation omitted.we explained 
of greatest importance is the breadth of the articles,which not only discussed all the facts underlying the author views but also gave information from which readers might draw contrary conclusions.in effect,the articles offered a,a kind of verbal debate because all sides of the issue,as well as the rationale for the author view,were exposed,the assertion of deceit reasonably could be understood only as the author personal conclusion about the information presented 
we then distinguished the facts in milkovich,where the author of a newspaper column charging that a high school wrestling coach had lied about his behavior at a meet informed his readers that he was in a unique position to know that the coach had lied because he had personally observed the relevant events.at.we wrote 
the article in milkovich,unlike the phantom columns,was not based on facts accessible to everyone.indeed,a reader reasonably could have understood the reporter in milkovich to be suggesting that he was singularly capable of evaluating the plaintiffs conduct.in contrast,neither of the globe columns indicated that the author,or anyone else,had more information about phantom touring marketing practices than was reported in the articles.while the globe readers implicitly were invited to draw their own conclusions from the mixed information provided,the milkovich readers implicitly were told that only one conclusion was possible.
id.at.see moldea new york times,because the reader understands that the challenged statement represent s the writer interpretation of the facts presented,and because the reader is free to draw his or her own conclusions based upon those facts,this type of statement is not actionable in defamation.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
in sum,the basic issue before us is whether the challenged statements in a civil action implicitly signal to readers that only one conclusion about riley was possible,and therefore do not qualify as protected opinion under milkovich and phantom touring,or whether readers implicitly were invited to draw their own conclusions from the mixed information provided,in which case the first amendment bars riley defamation action.phantom touring,at.in making this determination,we look not just at the specific statements complained of,but also at the general tenor of the book and the context in which the challenged statements are set.milkovich,at.we are mindful that the subject of a civil controversial lawsuit and the disputed events underlying it is one about which there could easily be a number of varying rational interpretations,and that in writing about such inherently ambiguous subjects,an author who fairly describes the general events involved and offers his personal perspective about some of the ambiguities and disputed facts should not be subject to a defamation action.partington,at.otherwise,authors would hesitate to venture beyond dry,colorless descriptions of facts,bereft of analysis or insight,and the threat of defamation lawsuits would discourage expressions of opinion by commentators,experts in a field,figures closely involved in a public controversy,or others whose perspectives might be of interest to the public id.
standard of review 
we have observed that when defamation issues implicate free speech concerns appellate judges must conduct a review and examine for themselves the statements in issue and the circumstances under which they were made to see whether they are of a character which the principles of the first amendment protect.levinsky,at quoting new york times sullivan,d.therefore,the courts treat the issue of labeling a statement as verifiable fact or as protected opinion as one ordinarily decided by judges as a matter of law.gray,at,citing bose consumers union of united states,d.
c.the challenged statements 
to put the challenged statements in context,we follow the district court helpful practice of quoting some of the text surrounding the specific language cited in riley complaint.the specific language riley complains of is indicated in bold.we adopt the letters used by riley to designate the statements at issue.we depart somewhat from the usual letter sequencing,however,to discuss the statements in a more logical order.we address in turn statements suggesting that riley is a liar in the order of our discussion,statements c,e,f,h,j,i,k and d a perjurer statement a and a killer statement g.
statement c 
statement c describes schlichtmann reaction to the discovery of a document indicating that tannery waste had been deposited on the fifteen acres in 
this document was thirty years old and it dealt only with tannery waste,which might or might not have contained tce.but even so,schlichtmann thought it had great value.riley had sworn at his deposition that he had never dumped anything on the fifteen acres.riley had lied then,and did need much that riley was also lying about using tce.
the assertion in statement c that riley had lied in the course of the anderson litigation is,in principle,provable as false.milkovich,at.a statement is not actionable,however,if it is plain that the speaker is expressing a subjective view,an interpretation,a theory,conjecture,or surmise.gray,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court found that statement c is clearly written in schlichtmann voice,reporting his inner musings about the evidence he was gathering,and therefore could not be construed by a reasonable reader as an assertion of fact.riley concedes that the assertion about riley that follows the words schlichtmann believed represents schlichtmann view of riley testimony,but asserts that the phrase riley had lied then constitutes harr own factual claim.we agree with the district court that the phrase riley had lied then coming almost immediately after and elaborating upon the sentence but even so,schlichtmann thought it had great value,and situated in a section of the book that recounts schlichtmann efforts to build a case against the schlichtmann conclusion,not harr.as harr points out,t he law does not force writers to clumsily begin each and every sentence with schlichtmann felt in order to indicate that a statement is being attributed to schlichtmann.as statement c is cast as schlichtmann assessment of riley testimony,and follows a summary of the evidence upon which it is based the document reporting the discovery of tannery waste on the fifteen acres,it amounts to a subjective view,an interpretation,a theory,conjecture,or surmise,not an assertion of objective fact based on undisclosed evidence.gray,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
moreover,even if we accepted riley premise that the statement riley had lied then constitutes harr own declaration that riley had uttered a falsehood,the statement would still be protected under the first amendment.like the allegedly defamatory newspaper articles in phantom touring,the book not only discussed the facts underlying harr views but also gave information from which readers might draw contrary conclusions.phantom touring,at.for example,one page before statement c,harr writes that one after another,interviews with a dozen former tannery employees led schlichtmann nowhere.none could recall using tce,or dumping tannery waste on the fifteen acres.a civil action at.immediately after statement c,the book reports schlichtmann discovery of a witness who seemed at first to offer compelling testimony that tannery waste had been dumped on the fifteen acres,but who the book acknowledges turned out to lack credibility.id.at.later in the book,harr again states that schlichtmann did not have eyewitnesses who could implicate john riley in the contamination of the fifteen acres.id.at.as we noted at the outset,the book makes plain both the strengths and the weaknesses of the case against riley.because both sides of the issue,as well as the rationale for harr view,were exposed,the assertion of deceit reasonably could be understood only as harr personal conclusion about the information presented,not as a statement of objective fact based on undisclosed evidence.phantom touring,at.
we reject riley claim that harr explanatory to the reader and note on sources sections,detailing his extensive access to schlichtmann during the anderson trial and the voluminous research he conducted in writing the book,signal to the reader that every conclusion the book attributes to schlichtmann amounts to an assertion by harr of verifiable,objective fact.harr purpose in notifying the reader of his extensive access to schlichtmann is plainly not to establish that schlichtmann is an omniscient figure whose inferences are all correct.rather,his point is simply that he was well positioned to tell the story of the anderson litigation from schlichtmann vantage point,and to describe the attorney subjective experience of the chronicled events.
statement e 
like statement c,statement e appears in the section of the book which describes schlichtmann efforts to build a case against riley tannery 
it seemed that everyone but riley recognized the fifteen acres as a toxic waste dump.riley must have known about the condition of the property.perhaps,thought schlichtmann,the tanner really had been running an unauthorized waste dump.perhaps he had charged his neighbor,whitney barrel,a fee for the use of the land.
as with statement c,riley argues that the district court erred in finding that the first two sentences of statement e were written in schlichtmann voice,rather than in harr.but the context in which statement e is set makes clear that it describes schlichtmann thinking as he worked to assemble a case against the tannery.moreover,as with statement c,statement e would be even if it were deemed to recount harr own evaluation of riley state of mind,as it is based on pointing in one direction,some in the the book describes in substantial detail.phantom touring,at.
riley asserts that phantom touring is inapposite because harr failed to report that some of schlichtmann own investigators had concluded that the tannery was not responsible for the contamination of the fifteen acres.although the book does not mention this specific fact,it does report evidence some of which we describe in connection with statement c supra tending to negate schlichtmann theory of the case.harr was not required to report every single fact about the anderson litigation,but was free to make his own editorial choices,so long as he fairly describe d the general events involved.partington,at.
statement f 
statement f refers to a substance which schlichtmann investigators discovered on the fifteen acres having the characteristics of tannery waste and containing tce 
if this material was indeed tannery waste,then how had it become contaminated with tce,which riley claimed he had never used it was,of course,possible that someone,dumped tce on top of it.that was possible,but to schlichtmann the most logical explanation was that it had all come from the same place.and if that was true,it meant that riley had lied about tce.
riley acknowledges that statement f recounts schlichtmann thinking,but asserts that the passage is defamatory because harr failed to disclose to the reader that tce simply was used by the riley tannery.we reject riley contention that harr was required to include in the book a declaration that the tannery had not used tce.the book reports riley repeated denials of tce use,and notes schlichtmann failure to discover conclusive evidence to the contrary.having set out the evidence for the reader to weigh,harr can not be subject to defamation liability for failing to endorse riley version of events.partington,at.
riley is simply wrong to assert that the book fails to disclose the facts upon which statement f is based,and that statement f implies the existence of undisclosed facts.on the contrary,harr reports in great detail the factual basis for schlichtmann conclusion,including facts that create problems for schlichtmann theory of the case.
statements h and j 
statement h reports a comment schlichtmann made in reaction to riley performance on the witness stand 
riley surprised me today,schlichtmann partner conway said.he came off looking better than he should have.he was so arrogant and combative in his deposition.
he a liar but he not stupid,said schlichtmann.
statement j recounts schlichtmann reaction to riley testimony 
when riley had sat on the witness stand,schlichtmann had wanted to turn to the jurors and say,see this man is lying now.
as we have explained,harr was entitled to report schlichtmann opinion that riley had given false testimony,having disclosed the facts upon which the opinion was based,including some facts that are in tension with schlichtmann conclusion.phantom touring,at.
statement i 
statement i is schlichtmann account of what he believed was a successful moment in his examination of riley 
it was great,was it,charlie why would riley immediately make the connection between tce and destroying records because he was covering up the jury understood that,did they 
riley had testified earlier about the destruction of records indicating what chemicals the tannery had used.returning to the subject at the end of his examination,schlichtmann inquired riley,when did you destroy those records harr writes 
the tanner was instantly enraged.the question worked just as schlichtmann had hoped.in a loud,angry voice,riley said,i do know when those records were destroyed,but i will repeat to you,sir,again and again,we never used trichloroethylene 
no,no,no,interrupted the judge.you not being asked that.you being asked when the records were destroyed.you say you do know.next question,schlichtmann.
that all,said schlichtmann smiling.
statement i is schlichtmann reaction to riley outburst.as we have explained,the factual basis for the opinion that riley was covering up is laid out in the book,as are certain facts tending to discredit it.we agree with the district court that a reasonable reader would fully understand that the statement does not convey that schlichtmann knew as a fact that riley was covering up,but merely that in schlichtmann opinion that had to be the reason for his answer.
statement k 
statement k reports schlichtmann excited reaction,in the phase of the book,to his discovery of a witness who had seen soil,which schlichtmann surmised contained contaminated tannery waste,being removed from the fifteen acres 
back in the car,schlichtmann told his law partner,we opened the box and the worms are starting to crawl out.this is just hiding evidence,this is destroying evidence.
riley contends that statement k is actionable as verifiable fact known to be false to the publisher,because judge skinner clearly ruled that any removal activities were legitimately connected to epa well monitoring operations and were performed in full view of epa personnel.
we reject riley untenable premise that judge skinner ruling precludes commentators outside of the judicial system from expressing a contrary view.moreover,harr does report that judge skinner found that the removal activity on the fifteen acres was legitimately connected to the drilling of test wells and other investigative procedures.a civil action at.
perhaps sensing the force of harr argument that the book does report views contrary to those riley deems defamatory,riley asserts that harr failed to fully and concomitantly reveal to the reader that judge skinner later ruled that schlichtmann surmise that tannery workers had been destroying evidence was incorrect.harr is right to observe that the implication of this argument would be that an author can not write a book describing in chronological order an attorney efforts to try a case,but instead must reveal the end result of every legal hunch immediately.a civil action is meant to be read as a whole we decline to impose on authors the nonsensical requirement that all points of view be set forth at the same time.
statement d 
in his quest for evidence that riley tannery had contaminated the fifteen acres with tce,schlichtmann private investigator interviewed ruth turner a pseudonym,an elderly woman who lived near the tannery 
her husband,paul who had died in,would often walk down behind the house,in the forest by the aberjona river,on the land owned by riley.he would return from his walks and tell her about the barrels and piles of debris he seen there,and how sludge waste from the tannery would flow down the hill and onto the land.in the years before paul death in,recalled ruth,he often awoke in the middle of the night.on several occasions,he told ruth about hearing the sounds of trucks at two or three in the morning.he had said that he could see the headlights of flatbed trucks full of barrels driving up the access dirt road onto the fifteen acres.they dumping stuff in the middle of the night,ruth recalled his saying.
riley contends that a reader could understand the passage as stating that riley did,in fact,dump illegal material on the acres.however,the book makes clear that despite his suspicions,schlichtmann never succeeded in proving that riley was responsible for illegal dumping.read in context,statement d describes a piece of evidence which suggested to schlichtmann that the tannery had contaminated the acres with tce,but did not prove that it had done so.it is this unmistakable theme of the inability to move from theory,conjecture,and surmise to actual riley complaint somehow overlooks.see gray,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
statement a 
after the anderson trial was over,schlichtmann discovered that riley,during the pendency of the anderson litigation,had commissioned yankee to conduct a hydrogeologic investigation of the tannery property.yankee had written a report describing its findings,which was never produced for the plaintiffs during discovery.nor was a subsequent report reevaluating yankee data.judge skinner ruled that riley had engaged in deliberate concealment of the reports.the judge explained 
in his testimony on deposition and at trial riley denied the existence of these reports.with respect to each question,taken separately,the answer might be justified because of hypertechnical interpretations of the questions posed by the interrogator.for instance,did you test the sludge answer no.fact he caused a test to be made by someone else.similarly one could quibble over the definition of the documents.there were enough such questions,however,so that any fair response should at one time or another have revealed the existence of these reports.in addition,riley denied the existence of laboratory reports and chemical formulas which were clearly called for.even allowing for riley apparent unsophistication and inarticulateness,i conclude that the pattern of evasive answers concerning these reports and the other documents by riley requires a finding that the concealment was deliberate.
anderson beatrice foods.
statement a is harr description of judge skinner finding 
the judge found that riley had committed perjury and that mary ryan was guilty of deliberate misconduct in failing to give schlichtmann the yankee report.
riley contends that deliberate concealment does not amount to the crime of perjury,and that statement a is therefore a false account of the judge ruling.
the supreme court has observed that t he common law of libel overlooks minor inaccuracies and concentrates upon substantial truth minor inaccuracies do not amount to falsity so long as the substance,the gist,the sting,of the libelous charge be justified.masson new yorker magazine,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.as the district court noted,under new hampshire law a statement is not actionable if it is substantially true.simpkins snow.
moreover,under the fair report privilege,the publication of defamatory matter concerning another in a report of an official proceeding that deals with a matter of public concern is privileged if the report is accurate and complete or a fair abridgement of the occurrence reported.hayes newspapers of new hampshire,quoting restatement second of torts.a fair report need not be a verbatim report it is enough that the report be a summary that is substantially correct.id.at,citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also lambert providence journal,cir noting courts reluctance to entertain libel suits dependent upon a precise construction of a newspaper use of technical legal terminology ricci venture magazine,a journalist report need not describe legal proceedings in technically precise language if it meets a common sense standard of expected lay interpretation.
judge skinner found that riley denial of the existence of the yankee report under oath amounted to deliberate concealment.we agree with the district court that the word perjury defined in the random house webster unabridged dictionary ed as the willful giving of false testimony under oath is a fair rendition of judge skinner characterization of riley conduct,and is therefore under new hampshire law.although judge skinner did not say that riley actions met the legal definition of perjury,harr account is a summary of the judge ruling that is substantially correct.hayes,at.
riley argues that because the book was published six years after judge skinner made his deliberate misconduct pronouncement,harr had ample time to review the official record and accurately report the court findings.riley declares that the nature of harr report somehow result s in the attenuation of the need for and purpose of the fair report privilege and rough and ready protection analysis.in a closer case we might deem a six year gap between the event reported and the publication of the report a factor to be weighed in evaluating the report fairness.this is not a close case,however,and riley offers no reason why we should reject the usual rule that a journalist substantially accurate report need not describe legal proceedings in technically precise language simply because harr had enough time,in principle,to master the precise legal meaning of the term perjury.ricci.at.
statement g 
after riley first day on the witness stand,schlichtmann colleagues critiqued his examination of riley.the book reports that tom neville suggested to schlichtmann that t he jury wants you to kick the shit out of riley.after thomas kiley had exhorted schlichtmann to crack riley,the following ensued 
neville jumped up,too,and hovered over schlichtmann from the other side.you got to manhandle him said neville.
yeah,great,said schlichtmann,his head bowed,his voice soft.that good showmanship,but i got to get evidence in.
my god,this is the guy who killed your kids yelled neville.you should be attacking him with a fucking baseball bat you should be asking him neville adopted a mincing tone and then what did you do next,riley 
schlichtmann colleagues continue to coach him.the scene concludes with kiley saying to schlichtmann in my eleven years of trial experience,you got more shit to use on this guy than i ever seen before.you can fucking destroy him.what does it take to get you mad 
riley argues that statement g would be understood by a reasonable reader as a statement of provable fact.harr responds that statement g is a hyperbolic expression that can not be understood as an assertion of objective fact.
reading statement g in context,it is unmistakable that neville purpose in describing riley as the guy who killed your kids is to inspire schlichtmann to conduct a more forceful examination of riley,and that harr purpose in reporting this episode is to capture the reaction of schlichtmann colleagues to his poor performance that day.in a sense,statement g is rhetorical hyperbole,a vigorous epithet used by neville to arouse schlichtmann fighting spirit.milkovich,at.quoting greenbelt cooperative publishing,bresler,d.t he first amendment protects the rhetorical hyperbole and imaginative expression that enlivens writers prose.partington,at quoting milkovich,at.
however,in contrast to greenbelt,where the court concluded that the defendant use of the word blackmail was not meant as a literal accusation that the plaintiff had committed the crime of blackmail,the anderson plaintiffs did contend that riley tannery,by causing tce to enter the woburn water supply,had killed their children.greenbelt,at.see also letter carriers austin,d description of plaintiff as a traitor was not a literal accusation that plaintiff had committed the crime of treason.even so,statement g is for the same reasons that the statements discussed supra,charging riley with giving false testimony,are.having disclosed the facts upon which statement g is based,harr is entitled to report neville view that riley actions had caused the death of the plaintiffs children.phantom touring,at.
iii.false light 
in opposition to the district court entry of summary judgment for harr on his false light invasion of privacy claims in connection with statements a,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j and k,riley simply refers us to his arguments against the dismissal of his defamation claims.we agree with the district court that it is unnecessary to decide whether the new hampshire supreme court would recognize the false light tort because riley false light claim is a mere restatement of his defamation claim,but under a different name.harr is therefore entitled to the same constitutional protections that compelled the district court to dismiss his defamation claims.see brown hearst,cir holding that where a false light claim is simply a restatement of a defamation claim under a different heading,it is not imaginable that it could escape the same constitutional constraint as the defamation claim.
iv.public disclosure of private fact 
statement l describes riley appearance at the hearing on the failure of the defendants to produce certain documents 
riley returned to the courtroom in early march,three years after first taking the witness stand during trial.back then,he been aggressive and antagonistic,but now he looked sickly,moody,and listless.he paced in the corridor,eyes narrowed and suspicious,mouth tightly compressed.he was in his,suffering from episodes of depression.
although the district court denied harr motion for summary judgment on riley defamation claim as to statement l,deeming it to be a assertion of the verifiable fact that riley had experienced episodes of depression,it granted summary judgment on riley public disclosure of private fact claim on the ground that his depression was substantially relevant to the anderson litigation,a matter of legitimate public concern in assessing riley public disclosure of private fact claim,we must assume that statement l is true otherwise it would not amount to the disclosure of a private fact.
the district court concluded that the new hampshire supreme court would recognize,if it had not already done so by implication,a cause of action for public disclosure of private fact.see hamberger eastman,declaring that a person who unreasonably and seriously interferes with another interest in not having his affairs known to others is liable to the other quoting restatement of torts.however,the district court declared that the first amendment protects the publication of private facts that are newsworthy,that is,of legitimate concern to the public.even if the private fact is not itself newsworthy,its publication is still protected if it has substantial relevance to,or any substantial nexus with a newsworthy topic citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
riley does not challenge the district court premise that statement l is if it is substantially relevant to the story told in the book.he argues instead that the court erred in finding the fact of his depression to be relevant to the anderson litigation.assuming with the district court that new hampshire would recognize a cause of action for public disclosure of private fact,and that this cause of action contemplates an exception for statements that are substantially relevant to a matter of legitimate public concern,we evaluate the relevance of riley depression to the story recounted in the book.
the relevance of statement l to the subject matter of the book is unmistakable.the book reports that beatrice attorney,concerned about riley performance on the witness stand during the hearing,would have liked to bring out the fact of riley depression in defense of the tanner mental confusion and failures of memory,but riley had told him,i do want to talk about that.a civil action at.we also agree with harr that one of the purposes of the book was to chronicle the devastating emotional toll of the litigation on many of the participants,including riley and schlichtmann,the book protagonist.under these circumstances,riley mental condition was relevant to the anderson litigation.
intentional infliction of emotional distress 
the district court dismissed riley intentional infliction of emotional distress claim on the ground that new hampshire law does not recognize a cause of action for wrongful infliction of emotional distress where the factual predicate sounds in defamation quoting demeo goodall.we do not reach this question of new hampshire law,however,because we are convinced that riley allegations,as a matter of law,do not rise to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct required to support an intentional infliction of emotional distress action.morancy morancy,quoting restatement second of torts.conduct is deemed to be extreme and outrageous only where it has been so outrageous in character,and so extreme in degree,as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency,and to be regarded as atrocious,and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.miller cbc,quoting restatement second of torts,comment d.such can not be said of statements a,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,and k,which express in various ways the view that riley had not given truthful testimony during the anderson litigation see supra.although we realize that riley would have preferred that harr not publish a critical evaluation of his testimony in the anderson case,we are also persuaded that harr portrayal of riley can not be said to have exceeded all possible bounds of decency,or to be atrocious,and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.
we take the same view of statement l see supra,which reports that riley had experienced episodes of depression relevant to the anderson litigation,and also of statement statement b reads
