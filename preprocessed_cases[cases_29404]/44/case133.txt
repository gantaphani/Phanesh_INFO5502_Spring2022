in june helen ge originally filed these two qui tam actions against her former employer,takeda pharmaceutical company and its subsidiary takeda pharmaceutical north america,collectively,takeda,under the federal false claims act fca,et,and various analogous state statutes.the two actions concern different drugs.she has since amended each of her complaints twice.the united states has declined to enter the case as a party.in a successful qui tam action,the relator collects a portion of the award to the government regardless of whether the government intervenes.see united states ex rel.duxbury ortho biotech,duxbury i,cir.
ge has alleged in her second amended complaints that takeda had failed to disclose adequately the risks associated with four of its drugs and generally that this failure resulted in the submission of false claims by various patients and physicians for government payment through,for example,medicare or medicaid reimbursement.
on takeda motions to dismiss,the district court dismissed both of ge actions under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to plead fraud with particularity and,in addition,under federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim.united states ex rel.ge takeda pharm,fds,fds,wl.ge proposed to amend the second amended complaint yet again,asserting still more theories of fca liability.the district court declined to allow further amendment.
ge now appeals,making three levels of arguments as to the rule b dismissal,that her complaints contain sufficient allegations concerning the who,what,where,and when of takeda misconduct to satisfy rule b particularity requirement,see duxbury i,at quoting rodi new eng.sch.of law,cir internal quotation mark omitted,the district court abused its discretion in rejecting without opinion two requests,one prejudgment and one,by ge to amend her complaints again,and as to rule b,that the district court analysis relies on an overly restrictive conception of fca liability.
this opinion concerns the first two arguments.we affirm the district court on its rule b and denial of amendment rulings,and do not reach the b issue.
in september,ge took a position with takeda as a contract physician,contracting to perform medical reviews of adverse event reports.ge was responsible for reports of adverse events,including those concerning four specific drugs for specific diseases actos type diabetes,uloric gout,gastroesophageal reflux disease,and prevacid same.takeda sells all four drugs and each required food and drug administration fda approval for these uses.ge tasks included ascertaining the seriousness of a reported event,determining whether the associated drug was causally responsible for that event,and determining whether that event constituted a safety signal,that is whether the reported event signaled the need for additional safety warnings.ge worked for takeda until january.she asserts that when she complained about improper reporting at takeda,her contract was summarily terminated.
on june,ge filed an fca complaint under seal against takeda pertaining to actos.united states ex rel.helen ge takeda pharmaceutical,et al,fds.on march,ge filed a second complaint under seal pertaining to uloric,and prevacid.united states ex rel.helen ge takeda pharmaceutical,et al,fds.in ge complaints,she alleged on behalf of the united that three fca sections were violated a a a,which imposes liability on any person who knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval,b a b,which imposes liability on any person who knowingly makes,uses,or causes to be made or used,a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim,and c a c,which imposes liability on any person who conspires to commit a violation of,among other things,a a or a b.
in late and early,ge filed amended complaints in both cases while both complaints were still under seal.between late march and early april,ge filed a second set of amended complaints after the complaints were unsealed.ge second amended complaints are the ones directly at issue on appeal.
ge alleged takeda had failed to report promptly and accurately to the fda a number of adverse events associated with the four subject drugs.the fda is responsible for the approval of drugs for commercial marketing.see.the fda is authorized after approval to continue to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the drug and,where appropriate,to withdraw approval or require a change in labeling.see id.k.fda regulations require prompt,accurate reports of adverse drug events by drug manufacturers.the receipt of an adverse report does not in and of itself show a causal relationship between a drug and the illness mentioned in a report.carpenters pension annuity funds biogen idec,cir.
it is undisputed that takeda did submit adverse event reports and there is no specific allegation that any of the events which are the subject of the complaint were not eventually reported in some form to the fda.as to the drug actos,ge alleged that she was asked by takeda to misreport adverse events including incidences of heart failure,renal failure,pancreatic cancer,and,most notably,bladder cancer.ge alleged that she complied with those directions on certain occasions after having made known her objections.in addition,ge alleged that she had discovered systematic by takeda of the incidence of bladder cancer in adverse event reports.
the fda did receive information on bladder cancer risk because in june,the fda issued an official warning that use of the diabetes medication actos pioglitazone for more than one year may be associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer.fda drug safety communication update to ongoing safety review of actos pioglitazone and increased risk of bladder cancer june.the fda also mandated a label change.fda drug safety communication updated drug labels for medicines.but it also issued a supplemental approval of actos after knowing of the bladder cancer risk.ge alleges that after the labeling change the sales of actos plummeted.
as to the drugs uloric,and prevacid,ge alleged that takeda pressured her to falsify her medical conclusions,asking her to classify events as or to change her causality assessment to unrelated so as to avoid reporting within days as required by fda regulation.see c i requiring report of serious and unexpected adverse event within days.specifically,ge alleged that she was directed to alter her analysis of reported adverse events involving the interactions between the three drugs and other medications likely to be taken by senior citizens.ge did not clearly allege that she complied with takeda directions.ge did allege,however,that on various occasions takeda officials altered her assessments directly.
as to uloric,at some point takeda submitted a supplemental new drug application to update the adverse reactions section of the uloric label.the fda approved this supplemental application on january,
as to all four drugs ge asserts that takeda should have reported adverse events earlier,and that takeda consistently took actions to resist label changes through.
on may,takeda filed its motion to dismiss.ge filed a memorandum in opposition on july.at the end of her memorandum but not as a separate motion,ge requested leave to amend her complaints a third time,if the court was inclined to dismiss,and supported it with a declaration from one of her attorneys that included an attachment providing the total expenditures by the federal government for actos.on august,takeda filed a motion to strike that declaration.
on november,the district court dismissed in a written order ge claims under rule b,reasoning that although relator has alleged facts that would demonstrate a with respect to intentional of adverse events,she has failed to allege the specific details of any claims that were allegedly rendered false as a result.takeda,wl,at.the district court noted that ge had attempted to cure this defect by referring to her attorney declaration,which attached the total aggregate expenditure data by the government for actos.id.the district court held,however,that even assuming it was permissible for the court to consider the actos data,such aggregate expenditure data did not satisfy rule b particularity requirement.id.the district court contrasted ge pleadings with the pleadings of the relator in duxbury i,which identified eight specific medical providers who allegedly submitted false claims,the rough time periods,locations,and amounts of the claims,and the specific government programs to which the claims were made.takeda,wl,at citing duxbury i,at.
from the absence of such specifics in ge complaints,the district court inferred that ge meant to assert that all claims for the subject drugs during the relevant time period were rendered false by takeda alleged misconduct.id.at.the district court held that ge had not provided the specific factual allegations necessary to support the inference that the fda would have withdrawn approval from all four drugs immediately upon receiving the withheld information.see also j,d if an applicant fails to establish and maintain records and make reports required under this section,fda may withdraw approval of the application and,thus,prohibit continued marketing of the drug product that is the subject of the application.emphasis added.the district court went beyond that to point out that even were it to accept the unsubstantiated premise that drugs would have been taken off the market,there were still no allegations about how the fraudulent reporting would render false those claims which were filed before the adverse events occurred.
in the same november,order,the district court also dismissed ge claims under rule b for failure to state a claim,holding that ge had not adequately established that compliance with reporting requirements was a material precondition to the payment of the claims at issue.takeda,wl,at see also united states ex rel.hutcheson blackstone,cir holding that fca liability exists where claims submitted misrepresented compliance with a precondition of payment so as to be false or fraudulent and where those misrepresentations were material.the district court observed that it is within the fda discretion to respond to violations of reporting requirements in a number of ways,only the harshest of which is the withdrawal of drug approval.takeda,wl,at.the district court noted in addition that the fda enforcement procedures provide the opportunity for citizens to petition the fda to bring action against specific violators.id.citing.the district court reasoned that i t is through that mechanism,rather than an fca lawsuit,that relator should have brought the reporting issues illuminated in the complaints to the attention of the fda.id.
finally,the district court dismissed in that same order ge various claims both because they failed to state a claim under state law and because they failed to plead with specificity the details of any claims for payment made to any of the states.id.the district court did not address ge request for leave to amend.judgment was entered for defendants on november.
on november,ge filed a formal motion for reconsideration pursuant to rule e along with a motion for leave to amend her complaint.ge motions were supported by a an economic model constructed by a pharmaceutical economics professor from the school of pharmacy at the university of southern california purporting to show the amount of claims for actos that would not have been submitted for government payment but for takeda alleged misconduct,and b the declarations of eight individuals attesting that an individual patient would not have submitted his or her claim if takeda had promptly and accurately disclosed the link between actos and bladder cancer.on december,the district court denied ge motions without opinion.on january,ge filed a timely notice of appeal 
we review de novo the district court dismissal order for failure to comply with rule b.united states ex rel.gagne city of worcester,cir.rule b provides in alleging fraud or mistake,a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.b.
the district court correctly cited the relevant pleading requirements relators are required to set forth with particularity the who,what,when,where,and how of the alleged fraud.united states ex.rel walsh eastman kodak,d,quoting united states ex rel.thompson healthcare,cir see also arruda sears,roebuck,cir.
as we noted a few months ago in united states ex rel.duxbury orthobiotech products,duxbury ii,cir 
although the fca financial incentive encourages relators to expose fraud,united states ex rel.poteet bahler,cir,it also attracts parasitic relators who bring fca damages claims based on information within the public domain or that the relator did not otherwise discover,united states ex rel.rost pfizer,cir.
for those reasons,there are a number of limitations on qui tam actions,including the particularity requirements of rule b.
as we explained in united states ex rel.karvelas melrose wakefield hospital,cir 
a relator must provide details that identify particular false claims for payment that were submitted to the government.in a case such as this,details concerning the dates of the claims,the content of the forms or bills submitted,their identification numbers,the amount of money charged to the government,the particular goods or services for which the government was billed,the individuals involved in the billing,and the length of time between the alleged fraudulent practices and the submission of claims based on those practices are the types of information that may help a relator to state his or her claims with particularity.these details do not constitute a checklist of mandatory requirements that must be satisfied by each allegation included in a complaint.however,we believe that some of this information for at least some of the claims must be pleaded in order to satisfy rule b.
id.at quoting united states ex rel.clausen lab.of,cir.karvelas also rejects the notion that the rule b pleading standard is relaxed for fca claims.see id.at.
in a qui tam action in which the defendant is alleged to have induced third parties to file false claims with the government,a relator can satisfy this requirement by providing factual or statistical evidence to strengthen the inference of fraud beyond possibility without necessarily providing details as to each false claim.duxbury i,at quoting rost,at.
because fca liability attaches only to false claims,karvelas,at,merely alleging facts related to a defendant alleged misconduct is not enough,rost,at.rather,a complaint based on a a must sufficiently establish that false claims were submitted for government payment as a result of the defendant alleged misconduct.rost,at.
we will assume that the district court was correct that,as to the allegations of fraud on the fda,the alleged misconduct suffices.ge has,however,alleged next to no facts in support of the proposition that takeda alleged misconduct resulted in the submission of false claims or false statements material to false claims for government payment.ge alleges a conclusion that numerous claims for the four subject drugs would not have been submitted for government payment but for takeda misconduct,but alleges no more than that.what is missing are any supporting allegations upon which her conclusion rests and any particulars.ge pleadings fall far short of what was found barely adequate in duxbury i,see at,and are far less particular than those there whose sufficiency was deemed a close call,id.at.
there,this court reversed the district court dismissal under rule b of some of the relator claims,reasoning that the relator identification of eight specific medical providers who allegedly submitted false claims,plus rough time periods,locations,and amounts of the claims,and the specific government programs to which the claims were made,were just enough to constitute a pleading of fraud with particularity.id.at here,by contrast,ge provided in response to the motions to dismiss,at most,aggregate expenditure data for one of the four subject drugs,with no effort to identify specific entities who submitted claims or government program payers,much less times,amounts,and circumstances.
ge thus made no attempt in her complaints to allege facts that would show that some subset of claims for government payment for the four subject drugs was rendered false as a result of takeda alleged misconduct.and any theory that all claims submitted during this period were false has even less basis to survive.ge attempts to satisfy the rule b requirements with a per se rule that if sufficient allegations of misconduct are made,it necessarily follows that false claims material false information were filed.we reject that approach,which violates the specificity requirements of rule b.
on appeal,ge articulates three new theories purporting to support the notion that all claims submitted during the relevant period for the four subject drugs must have been rendered false by takeda alleged misconduct and that allegations of falsity would per se suffice to constitute compliance with rule b.all three theories are waived,however,not having been raised properly before the district court.
we do not rule on whether,had they not been waived,any of these theories under any subsection would have added the needed specificity under rule b,and merely say it is doubtful see clausen,at commenting that rule b does not permit an fca plaintiff merely to describe a private scheme in detail but then to allege simply and without any stated reason for his belief that claims requesting illegal payments must have been submitted,were likely submitted or should have been submitted to the g overnment see also united states ex rel.nathan takeda pharm,cir we hold that when a defendant actions,as alleged and as reasonably inferred from the allegations,could have led,but need not necessarily have led,to the submission of false claims,a relator must allege with particularity that specific false claims actually were presented to the government for payment.emphasis added united states ex rel.atkins mcinteer,cir relator has described in detail what he believes is an elaborate scheme for defrauding the government by submitting false claims relator fails to provide the next link in the fca liability chain showing that the defendants actually submitted reimbursement claims for the services he describes.
implied warranty 
ge first additional theory of per se ineligibility for federal reimbursement of all claims for the four drugs rests on the assertion that the subject drugs were not as safe as takeda purported them to be.ge contends that through labels and participation in the adverse event reporting process,takeda represented to all patients,doctors,and the government that the subject drugs possessed certain risks and benefits.ge alleges,however,that the subject drugs did not possess the safety profile takeda claimed they would.and from this ge infers that she has adequately stated that all claims submitted to the government for those drugs were false.
ge first theory is waived,having been raised only in cursory fashion before the district court.see rodríguez municipality of san juan,cir it should go without saying that we deem waived claims not made or claims adverted to in a cursory fashion,unaccompanied by developed argument.ge asserted to the district court only that takeda alleged fraudulent conduct led to the submission of claims that would not have otherwise occurred,without providing any specificity,and alleging nothing more.but that is inadequate courts should not be asked to guess the contents of a theory of liability.i ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.united states zannino,cir.
ge did offer a bit more argumentation in her rule e motion for reconsideration.that was too late.to the extent that appellants reconsideration motion sought to raise an argument waived at the trial stage,it must necessarily fail.dimarco zappa cabanillas,cir.
reasonable and necessary 
ge on appeal invokes a a,which prohibits medicare payments for treatments that are not reasonable and necessary.according to ge,as a result of takeda alleged misconduct,certain reimbursement claims were rendered false under the fca because they impliedly and incorrectly certified that the subject drugs were reasonable and necessary.
no such theory was properly presented to the district court before dismissal.ge concedes that she did not cite or discuss a a before the district court in her memorandum in opposition to takeda motions to dismiss.ge did provide a bare citation of a a in her second amended complaints.however,ge did not allege in those complaints that takeda alleged misconduct rendered claims for the four subject drugs un reasonable or un necessary.nor did she make any effort to explain why that would be so.see pan gonzales,cir we long have held that legal theories advanced in skeletal form,unaccompanied by some developed argumentation,are deemed abandoned.
misbranded 
on appeal ge newly argues that false claims must have been submitted to the government for the four drugs on the theory that takeda failure to properly update the subject drugs labels caused those drugs to be misbranded for purposes of the federal food,drug,and cosmetics act fdca,a,and so they were ineligible to enter interstate commerce,id.a.consequently,she now says they were ineligible for reimbursement.at best,there was a gesture to ge misbranding theory before the trial court,and it is waived.
ge rejoins that she did adequately raise a misbranding argument before the district court.her second amended complaints alleged that takeda failed to update the label for actos to accurately reflect the drug risks,as required by the fdca.however,as to ineligibility,ge complaints state only the fdca forbids misbranding and provides a range of civil and criminal enforcement mechanisms against inaccurate product labeling.ge made no mention of ineligibility for interstate commerce,let alone of ineligibility for reimbursement on that basis.at most,a footnote in her memorandum opposing dismissal referred to misbranding but nothing more.the argument was waived.see city of bangor citizens commc ns,cir deeming waived argument presented only in a passing fashion in a footnote.the mention of misbranding in ge rule e motion was too little,too late.see cochran quest software,cir litigation is not a game of hopscotch.it is generally accepted that a party may not,on a motion for reconsideration,advance a new argument that could and should have been presented prior to the district court original ruling.
to sum up ge waived all of her new arguments to the effect that the four subject drugs were per se ineligible for government reimbursement during the relevant period on these varying theories.ge claims on all theories which were presented fail under rule b.
this court reviews the district court denial of an appellant motion to amend and for reconsideration for abuse of discretion.fábrica de muebles álvarez,incorporado inversiones mendoza,cir torres alamo puerto rico,cir.
ge argues that she could have cured any defects in her complaints had she been provided with leave to amend the two times she asked.she had already twice amended both of her complaints in the months after the filing of her initial complaint.the first request,after takeda filed its motion to dismiss in,was in her memorandum in opposition to takeda motion to dismiss and conditionally did state that if the court was inclined to dismiss,then she would like to amend the district court did not explicitly discuss the request,but did discuss the additional appended material on actos and said it did not cure the deficiencies in the pleading.
the second of her requests came in the form of a motion to amend,filed on november,in conjunction with her motion for reconsideration under rule e of the judgment of dismissal.the district court dismissed this late motion without opinion in its december,order.
when a motion to amend is properly made before entry of judgment,the district court is to evaluate that motion under the liberal standard of.a.palmer champion,cir.amendments may be permitted,even after a dismissal for failure to state a claim,and leave to amend is freely given when justice so requires.id.quoting.a.the request was not properly made.
