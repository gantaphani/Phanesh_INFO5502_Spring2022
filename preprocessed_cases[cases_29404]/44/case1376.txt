opinion of the court 
this federal torts claims act ftca claim against the food and drug administration fda for granting clearance to market certain types of pedicle screw fixation devices referred to generally as bone screws was dismissed by the district court pursuant to the discretionary function exception to the ftca appellants contend here that this jurisdictional exception should not apply because fda officials were guilty of misconduct in the process of granting the clearance,and because appellants should have been given more opportunity to discover proof of that misconduct.moreover,appellants argue that,even if the discretionary function exception does apply to the aspect of the bone screw clearance process challenged in their,the clearance of bone screws based on their substantial equivalence to devices already on the exception does not bar appellants claims because the fda substantial equivalence determination does not involve the requisite element of judgment and choice,and is not the type of decision that the exception is designed to protect.because the record establishes the court lack of jurisdiction,we will affirm.
background 
thousands of plaintiffs nationwide claim to have suffered injuries resulting from the surgical implantation of bone screws in their spines and have sued their doctors and the manufacturers of the screws and,as is relevant here,some two hundred have also sued the federal government.these actions have been consolidated by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation and transferred to the eastern district of pennsylvania as mdl 
regulatory process 
it is undisputed that marketing of the bone screws is regulated by the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act as amended by the medical device amendments of mda at the time the lawsuits were filed,the fda had classified the bone screws as class iii devices,a categorization reserved for devices presenting a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.before class iii devices can be marketed,they must receive premarket approval from the fda or,alternatively,they must qualify for fda clearance based on a substantial equivalence determination it is a criminal offense to introduce a class iii medical device into commerce without approval or clearance 
because premarket approval is a lengthy,formal,and thus costly process often involving clinical trials under fda supervision most new class iii devices enter the market through fda clearance new class iii devices qualify for clearance when the fda determines they are substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device usually a device that was marketed before the medical device amendments went into effect on may,the process by which this clearance is granted is known as the k process,in reference to the relevant mda section.the process requires submission of the following 
p roposed labels,labeling,and advertisements sufficient to describe the device,its intended use,and the directions for its use,
a statement indicating the device is similar to different from other products of comparable type in commercial distribution,accompanied by data to support the statement,
a statement that the submitter believes,to the best of his or her knowledge,that all data and information submitted in the premarket notification are truthful and accurate and that no material fact has been omitted,and 
a ny additional information regarding the device requested by the fda commissioner that is necessary for the commissioner to make a finding as to whether or not the device is substantially equivalent to a device in commercial distribution.
the fda grants clearance through the k process when the new device has the same intended use as the predicate device and the fda determines that it possesses the same technological characteristics or is as safe and effective as the predicate device 
appellants allegations 
in,zimmer applied for k clearance for the edwards sacral screw device.after two rejections and the submission of additional supporting information,zimmer was ultimately granted clearance.appellants allege that the reasons for the fda reversal of position are unknown,and that the clearance decision was erroneous because the evidence presented to the fda revealed no predicate device substantially equivalent to the edwards screw on the market.following this determination,the fda granted k clearance to other bone screws.appellants allege these applications were granted due to the erroneous clearance of the edwards screw.appellants also claim that the fda granted clearance to danek medical to market the device for use when it knew or should have known that the screw was intended solely for spinal use.they allege that danek first described the screw as the interpedicular segmental fixation system but changed its name to warsaw orthopedic bone plates and warsaw orthopedic cancellous bone screws after its initial k application was denied.along with the name change,danek removed all references to use of the device in the spine,describing its application as only for long or flat bones.the fda then granted clearance.appellants make similar complaints regarding the k process for some of the other screws.and furthermore,they allege that an fda official proposed the idea of changing the intended use of the screws in order to obtain clearance and provided advice on circumventing fda rules.
appellants claim that the fda conduct in granting clearance for each of the screws was negligent,intentionally erroneous and in violation of its own policy.they further contend that this misconduct resulted in the marketing and subsequent use of the bone screws that ultimately injured them.the government argues that the discretionary function exception to the ftca precludes appellants claims,regardless of their merit.
discussion 
appellants first seek to get around the discretionary function exception by arguing that,because they have alleged that the fda conduct in clearing bone screws for the market was intentionally erroneous,and possibly even criminal,the exception is not applicable at all.in the appellants submission,the discretionary function exception was never intended to shield a government agency from liability for such dishonest and criminal conduct,and thus appellants should be permitted to pursue their claims of intentional and criminal misconduct against the fda without having to overcome the discretionary function bar.we are constrained to disagree.
even prior to reaching the discretionary function exception issue,appellants bear the burden of demonstrating that their claims fall within the scope of the ftca waiver of government immunity under the ftca,the federal government only waives its immunity for injuries caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.as the quoted language makes clear,the ftca does not itself create a substantive cause of action against the united states rather,it provides a mechanism for bringing a state law tort action against the federal government in federal court.thus,the extent of the united states liability under the ftca is generally determined by reference to state law.
to state a viable ftca claim based on their allegations of intentional and possibly criminal misconduct on the part of the fda in the k clearance process,appellants need to demonstrate that such conduct amounted to a negligent or wrongful act or omission for which a private individual would be held liable under applicable state tort law.appellants,however,face several hurdles to making this showing.first,we have examined the face of appellants complaints,and note that the complaints do not appear to allege that the fda behavior amounted to intentional or possibly criminal misconduct.rather,in their complaints,appellants contend that the fda acted negligently and in violation of its own policies and procedures 
even if we were inclined to read appellants complaints liberally as stating claims based on the fda intentional and poten
