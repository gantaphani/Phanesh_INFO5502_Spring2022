opinion of the court 
vahan gureghian,danielle gureghian,and charter school management,collectively,the csmi parties appeal from the judgment of the district court affirming the bankruptcy court decision to deny the csmi parties requests for the allowance of administrative expense claims under b in the chapter bankruptcy proceedings of philadelphia newspapers,llc and certain of its affiliates collectively,the debtors in affirming the bankruptcy court decision,the district court held that the appeal was equitably moot,and alternatively that the csmi parties failed to establish their entitlement to administrative expense claims.though we hold that the appeal is not equitably moot,we affirm the district court judgment based on its conclusions regarding the administrative expense requests.
background 
bankruptcy court proceedings 
this appeal relates to a defamation action filed by the csmi parties against philadelphia media holdings,llc one of the debtors,the philadelphia inquirer,and several inquirer employees in the court of common pleas of delaware county,pennsylvania.the action concerns certain articles published in print and online by the inquirer discussing the csmi parties contract management of the chester community charter school the articles.after the filing of the action,the debtors filed for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code,et.the csmi parties assert that the debtors published an article that links to and endorses the articles.on august,they timely filed the administrative expense requests based on these allegations 
specifically,the csmi parties alleged that the debtors published a charter school webpage the charter page that contained links to various items published by the inquirer about charter schools,including the articles they claimed that these links endorsed the articles as accurate reporting and misled the public into believing that the csmi parties engaged in wrongdoing similar to the improper or illegal conduct alleged in other linked news items.they also highlighted that the articles were displayed beneath the charter page title bar as a marquee enclosed in a separate box containing photographs,thereby drawing attention to the articles.
they further alleged that the debtors published an editorial article titled not the lessons charters were supposed to teach by inquirer columnist monica yant kinney the kinney article.it contained a link to and a statement endorsing the charter page.the kinney article read some city charter schools think mastery,kipp,independence,young scholars are soaring.but if you follow the remarkable reporting of my colleague martha woodall,you see greedy pilfering public gold under the guise of enriching children lives.the csmi parties argue that this link and statement republished the articles 
each administrative expense request asserted an estimated claim of for the debtors alleged act of defamation.each also sought in alleged damages for the debtors conduct and prosecution of claims against the csmi parties 
three weeks after the csmi parties made the administrative expense requests,the debtors filed on august an objection to the requests along with a motion for an expedited hearing.the next day,the csmi parties objected to the debtors motion to expedite.the bankruptcy court held a hearing on the motion to expedite on august.at that hearing,the debtors stated that they requested an expedited hearing because the closing under the version of the debtors confirmed plan of was scheduled to take place on august,and reserving million for the requests would affect adversely their working capital the bankruptcy court granted the motion to expedite and scheduled an evidentiary hearing for august.
bankruptcy judge stephen raslavich also made preliminary statements regarding the administrative expense requests.he noted that he could 
detect virtually no merit to this assertion of an administrative expense claim i did want to mislead you as to what my preliminary sense of this is i t going to take an enormous amount of persuading to convince me that the allegations of damage provide some kind of ongoing recoverable damage in the nature of a bankruptcy estate administrative claim.
nonetheless,the judge worked with the csmi parties to establish an acceptable hearing date and time.
at the hearing on the debtors objection to the administrative expense requests,judge raslavich,after hearing testimony and oral argument,denied the requests.he held that the csmi parties had not sustained their burden of proof in establishing entitlement to an administrative expense claim.the csmi parties timely appealed to the district court on september.
the closing did not take place as anticipated because of failed negotiations with the debtors labor unions,the acceptable completion of which was a condition to closing.the debtors conducted another auction of substantially all of their assets on september,and the sale was consummated under the terms of the fifth amended joint chapter plan the fifth amended plan or plan for a purchase price of million in cash 
district court decision 
before the district court,the csmi parties argued that the bankruptcy court erred in denying the administrative claims requests because the kinney article link and reference to the charter page provided a tort claim.they also asserted that the bankruptcy court prejudged the merits of the requests and infringed on their due process rights by forcing them to proceed on an expedited basis.the debtors argued that the appeal should be dismissed as equitably moot 
the district court held that the appeal was equitably moot,as the plan has been substantially consummated and no stay was sought,but nonetheless considered the merits.after noting that courts often provide their preliminary impressions on matters to narrow issues and that expedited hearings are commonplace and often necessary in bankruptcy proceedings,it considered the claims underlying the administrative expense requests.it affirmed the bankruptcy court denial of the requests based on its holding that merely post ing a link to the charter school webpage that contained the original articles as the courts that have had occasion to consider this issue have uniformly held,is not distinct tortious conduct upon which a defamation claim can be grounded.
in addition to advancing the same arguments regarding the bankruptcy court actions and decisions as they did before the district court,the csmi parties argue to us that the district court erred in holding that the appeal is equitably moot.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction under b.the district court had jurisdiction under a and.we have jurisdiction under d and.
our precedent requires us to review for abuse of discretion a district court decision that an appeal is equitably moot.in re cont l airlines,cir en banc continental i because a district court sits as an appellate court to review a bankruptcy court,we review a bankruptcy court legal determinations de novo,its factual findings for clear error,and its exercises of discretion for abuse thereof.in re goody family clothing,cir.
iii.equitable mootness 
equitable mootness is a way for an appellate court to avoid deciding the merits of an appeal.in this uncommon act,a court dismisses an appeal even if it has jurisdiction and can grant relief if implementation of that relief would be inequitable.continental i,at quoting in re chateaugay,cir.the term mootness is a misnomer.unlike mootness in the constitutional sense,where it is impossible for a court to grant any relief,mootness here is used as a shortcut for a court decision that the fait accompli of a plan confirmation should preclude further judicial proceedings.id.
a court arrives at this decision through the application of prudential considerations that address concerns unique to bankruptcy proceedings.id.these concerns relate to the adverse effects of the unraveling of a confirmed plan that could result from allowing the appeal to proceed.the equitable mootness doctrine recognizes that if a successful appeal would be fatal to a plan,prudence may require the appeal be dismissed because granting relief to the appellant would lead to a perverse outcome.united states tr.official comm.of equity sec.holders in re zenith elecs,cir.a perverse outcome often involves injury to third parties,particularly investors,who have relied on the confirmed plan,see nordhoff invs.zenith elecs,cir one inequity,in particular,that is often at issue is the effect upon innocent third parties.when transactions following court orders are unraveled,third parties not before us who took actions in reliance on those orders will likely suffer adverse effects,or the potential for chaos in the bankruptcy court,see continental i,at citing in re robert farms,cir reversal of the plan confirmation would create an unmanageable,uncontrollable situation for the bankruptcy court.
the prudential factors we consider in evaluating equitable mootness are the following 
whether the reorganization plan has been substantially consummated,whether a stay has been obtained,whether the relief requested would affect the rights of parties not before the court,whether the relief requested would affect the success of the plan,and the public policy of affording finality to bankruptcy judgments.
continental i,at.these factors are given varying weight,depending on the particular circumstances.in re pws holding,cir.
the first factor,typically the foremost consideration,requires that a court consider whether allowing an appeal to go forward will undermine the plan,and not merely whether the plan has been substantially consummated under the bankruptcy code definition see,zenith,at holding that the district court abused its discretion in finding the appeal equitably moot because it merely determined that the plan had been substantially consummated in a definitional sense and did not provide a complete analysis of the first factor united artists theatre walton in re united artists theatre,cir holding that the substantial consummation factor weighed against equitable mootness,despite the plan satisfying the bankruptcy code definition,because the relief sought does not undermine the plan foundation pws holding,at declining to dismiss an appeal seeking alterations to a confirmed plan as equitably moot because a successful appeal would not knock the props out from under the authorization for every transaction that has taken place quoting in re chateaugay.
the second factor principally duplicates the first in the sense that a plan can not be substantially consummated if the appellant has successfully sought a stay.zenith,at.thus this factor should only weigh heavily against the appellant if,by a failure to secure a stay,a reorganization plan was confirmed,the existence of which is later threatened by the appellant appeal.id.see also united artists,at noting that failure to seek a stay weighed against appellant,but because the remedy appellant seeks does not undermine the plan foundation,this omission is not fatal nordhoff invs.zenith elecs,cir i t is obligatory upon appellant to pursue with diligence all available remedies to obtain a stay of execution of the objectionable order if the failure to do so creates a situation rendering it inequitable to reverse the orders appealed from.emphasis added quoting in re highway truck drivers helpers local union,cir.
the third factor asks to what extent the relief sought would adversely affect parties not before the court.stated differently,h igh on the list of prudential considerations is the reliance of third parties,in particular investors,on the finality of the transaction.continental i,at.the fourth factor largely replicates the analysis of the first in that it considers whether granting the appellant the requested relief would unravel the plan.see nordhoff,at.finally,the fifth factor supports the other four by encouraging investors and others to rely on confirmation orders,thereby facilitating successful reorganizations by fostering confidence in the finality of confirmed plans.see id.at continental i,at t he importance of allowing approved reorganizations to go forward in reliance on bankruptcy court confirmation orders may be the central animating force behind the equitable mootness doctrine.
taken together,these factors recognize that a court only should apply the equitable mootness doctrine if doing so will unscramble complex bankruptcy reorganizations when the appealing party should have acted before the plan became extremely difficult to retract.nordhoff,at.the doctrine is quite rightly limited in scope and cautiously applied.continental i,at.
in holding that the appeal is equitably moot,the district court seemingly relied on the plan substantial consummation under the bankruptcy code definition.we discern no analysis of whether a ruling favorable to the csmi parties would upset the plan.the court also faulted the csmi parties for not seeking a stay without explaining whether a stay was critical given the progression of the debtors bankruptcy proceedings.moreover,it did not include any analysis of the final three factors.
in our view,a balancing of the equitable mootness factors calls for allowing this appeal to proceed.though the plan was substantially consummated in a definitional sense after the bankruptcy court denied the administrative expense requests,a ruling in favor of the csmi parties will not upset the plan.it provides that administrative expense claims will be paid on the later of the plan effective date or the date on which the claims become allowed.it also establishes an account from which a designated entity is to distribute funds to holders of allowed administrative expense claims as provided by the plan.if the csmi parties administrative expense requests are allowed,they may be paid under the plan without upsetting it.
indeed,on appeal the debtors do not argue that allowance of the requests will undermine the plan.also,under the agreement for the purchase of substantially all of the debtors assets and the plan,the debtors are responsible for paying the requests if they are allowed.these facts make this appeal unlike continental i,in which the debtor entered into an agreement with investors premised on the limitation of the amount of administrative expense claims that the investors would assume.that agreement was incorporated explicitly into the confirmed plan.at.a holding in favor of the appellant would have provided for an additional and sizable administrative expense claim that the investor would be required to assume,and thus arguably would have upset the plan.here,the administrative expense requests were not part of the purchaser calculus at the time of the sale and their allowance,only of the monies million coming into the debtors estates from the purchase of their assets consummated under the terms of the fifth amended plan,will not unravel the sale or the plan.
in addition,at the time of the bankruptcy court ruling on the administrative expense requests,the plan the fourth amended plan already had been confirmed.the closing on that plan,scheduled for a day after the hearing on the requests,did not occur.instead the fourth amended plan became moot pun intended when the fifth amended plan was confirmed a month later.
though perhaps the csmi parties should have sought a stay of the order confirming the fifth amended plan,given the timing of their appeal during the progression of debtors bankruptcy proceedings,they need not be faulted unduly for failing to do so.moreover,the csmi parties appeal of the bankruptcy court disallowance of its requests categorized the requests as disputed administrative expense claims.under the plan,the debtors should have set aside sufficient funds in the distribution account to fulfill the requests if the csmi parties prevailed on appeal and the requests later became allowed claims.as such,the csmi parties posting of a bond was not critical to the debtors or the entities designated to administer the plan.
as concerns the rights of parties not before us the third factor,the bankruptcy code and the plan establish priority of payment among the debtors creditors.the latter provides a mechanism for payment of disputed administrative expense claims if they are deemed allowed claims.see plan,establishing the distribution account,and detailing powers and duties of the liquidating trustee and distribution agent.no doubt the appeal can proceed without causing substantial harm to other creditors.in this context,it is hard to say that the plan success,the fourth factor,will be affected.
accordingly,the first four factors weigh in favor of allowing the appeal to proceed.though the finality of the bankruptcy court decision necessarily will be disturbed,because a holding in favor of the csmi parties on appeal will not unscramble the plan or upset the rights of other parties,we honor the csmi parties statutory right to review of the court decision.we thus hold that the appeal is not equitably moot.
iv.the bankruptcy court handling of the administrative expense requests 
expedited hearing 
the csmi parties argue that the expedited hearing on august,violated their due process rights and that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in holding the hearing on such an expedited basis.we review due process claims de novo.fadiga att y,cir.
due process generally requires notice and an opportunity to be heard.see united states james daniel good real,d.the csmi parties received notice of the hearing on the debtors objection to the administrative expense requests a week before the hearing took place.they also were given the opportunity to be heard at the hearing on the motion to expedite.at that hearing,the bankruptcy court asked them to propose a schedule taking into account the scheduled closing.
under fed.c,for cause shown a bankruptcy court has the discretion to set an expedited schedule for the hearing of a substantive motion.in exercising that discretion,it should consider the prejudice to parties entitled to notice and weigh this against the reasons for hearing the motion on an expedited basis.see in re grant broad.of.the debtors stated that they needed to resolve the administrative expense requests before the closing under the fourth amended plan.the csmi parties requests were for million,small relative to the proposed purchase price under the agreement accompanying the fourth amended plan.however,the csmi parties had a week to prepare for the expedited hearing.this was sufficient time for them to ready witness testimony and draft a detailed brief in opposition to the debtors objection to the requests.at the hearing,they presented this testimony and expounded on their written arguments regarding the requests.
given the accelerated time frame of bankruptcy proceedings and the facts before us,we conclude that the csmi parties were given more than adequate time to prepare for the expedited hearing.see hester ncnb bank in re hester,cir m otions for material reductions in the notice period are routinely granted by bankruptcy courts.the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in hearing the debtors objection to the requests on an expedited basis and the expedited hearing did not violate the csmi parties due process rights.
preliminary statements at hearing on motion to expedite 
the csmi parties argue that judge raslavich made improper premature conclusions at the august,hearing on the debtors motion to expedite.as the district court noted,judges often inform parties of their preliminary impressions to narrow issues and assist the parties in focusing both themselves and the court.see,official comm.of asbestos pers.injury claimants sealed air in re grace,giving preliminary views as to the appointment of a chapter trustee before denying the motion to appoint a trustee at this time.the csmi parties elected to proceed,and judge raslavich held an evidentiary hearing during which they had an opportunity to present their full case.this included arguments regarding the kinney article that they raised for the first time in response to the debtors objection,which was filed after the hearing on the motion to expedite.indeed,the csmi parties focused on the kinney article during the august hearing and their arguments regarding the kinney article served as the primary basis of their appeal to the district court and to us.thus judge raslavich comments at the august hearing on the motion to expedite served their purpose.in giving the csmi parties a preview of what they needed to do to counteract his impressions,which certainly were not irrevocable,he encouraged the csmi parties to develop additional arguments.most counsel would prize such insights.
moreover,at the end of the august hearing,judge raslavich articulated his reasoning for sustaining the debtors objection,specifically noting case law cited in the csmi parties written response to the debtors objection.with this background,we can hardly conclude that his candid preliminary comments at the august hearing on the motion to expedite prejudiced the csmi parties.
administrative expense requests 
administrative expense claims under the bankruptcy code 
section of the bankruptcy code provides that,a fter notice and a hearing,there shall be allowed administrative expenses,including a the actual,necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate b.for a claim to be entitled to administrative expense status,it must arise from a transaction with the,and be beneficial to the in the operation of the business.calpine envtl energy,in re envtl.energy,cir.the party asserting an administrative expense claim bears the burden of demonstrating that it deserves administrative expense status.id.at.
the supreme court has held that fairness may call for the allowance of tort claims as administrative expenses if those claims arise from actions related to the preservation of a debtor estate despite having no discernable benefit to the estate.reading brown,d deeming costs from fire damage resulting from the negligent actions of the bankruptcy receiver acting in the scope of his authority an actual and necessary expense of reorganization.based on reading,courts in our circuit have granted requests for administrative expense claims arising from a variety of tort actions.see,in re cohen sons caterers,granting an administrative expense claim for injuries resulting from a slip and fall while on the debtor premises in re hayes lemmerz int l,granting an administrative expense claim to the lessor of machines that the returned damaged where the damage occurred in re women first healthcare,granting the stalking horse bidder an administrative expense claim as compensation for its reliance on the debtor negligent misrepresentations regarding the sale.also based on reading,courts in other jurisdictions have denied administrative expense requests where the alleged tort claims were speculative or too strained to be considered related to the preservation of a debtor estate.see,in re aspen limousine,holding that asserted antitrust damages were too speculative as to their amount and unrelated to the preservation of the debtor estate in re pacesetter designs,granting administrative expense status to certain medical expenses resulting from an injury to an employee of the,but disallowing other expenses as too strained and too disparate with the language and intent of the bankruptcy code to be considered costs of administration.
in.dep t of envtl.res.tri state clinical,cir,we discussed reading in the context of whether a criminal fine for waste management violations was an administrative expense under chapter.we observed that the supreme court concept of necessary costs as including expenses incident to the preservation of a debtor estate advances the language of b.r ead as a whole,it suggests a quid pro quo pursuant to which the estate accrues a debt in exchange for some consideration necessary to the operation or rehabilitation of the estate.id.at.with this case law context,we turn to the csmi parties alleged tort,and whether it is eligible for administrative expense status.
alleged tort 
for the csmi parties to be entitled to administrative expense claims,they must demonstrate that their allegations regarding the republishing of the articles support a cause of action.to state a cause of action for defamation under pennsylvania law,a plaintiff must establish the defamatory character of the communication its publication by the defendant a refe
