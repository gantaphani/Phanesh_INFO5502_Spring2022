opinion of the court 
despite the pendency of a case in state court on the same issues,the district court granted a declaratory judgment in favor of an insurance carrier on a coverage case based solely on state law.we conclude that in the circumstances,the district court should have declined to exercise jurisdiction.accordingly,we will vacate the judgment and direct that the complaint be dismissed.
underlying this controversy is a suit for damages brought on behalf of bryant dixon,a child who allegedly was poisoned by lead paint in his home,a structure owned and leased by e j rentals.dixon complaint against e j was filed in the court of common pleas of lancaster county,pennsylvania on march.after receiving notice of the impending suit,e j notified state auto insurance,its liability carrier,of the claim.state auto advised e j that the policy pollution exclusion applied to preclude coverage and,consequently,e j would have no insurance protection against the dixon claim.
on march,e j attorney sent a letter to state auto,disagreeing with its denial of coverage and advising that he intended to ask for a declaratory judgment in state court to resolve the matter.state auto responded by filing the present declaratory judgment action in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania on april.
on june,e j moved to dismiss or stay the federal action,arguing that the court should,in its discretion,decline to exercise jurisdiction over the matter.three days later,e j filed its own suit for declaratory judgment in state court.state auto moved to dismiss the state suit both parties filed motions for summary judgment in the two courts.after briefing that vigorously contested jurisdiction,the district court denied e j motion to dismiss or stay on august,without stating its reasons for doing so.
on january,the district court granted state auto motion for summary judgment e j has appealed,challenging the decision of the district court to adjudicate the declaratory judgment.e j also argues the merits of the coverage issue.
generally speaking,insurance companies include pollution exclusions in their liability policies to shield themselves from claims for injuries caused by exposure to harmful substances,irritants,contaminants,or chemicals as defined more precisely in the policies.the interpretation of these clauses,particularly in lead poisoning cases similar to dixon,has resulted in extensive litigation in state and federal courts throughout the country.no consensus on the interpretation and scope of the exclusionary clauses has emerged among courts nationally,nor in pennsylvania,whose law applies here.
at the time the district court denied e j motion to dismiss,only two pennsylvania trial courts had ruled on this issue.see fayette county hous.auth.housing redev.ins,wl,lititz mut.ins.steely,slip op.lancaster.both courts held that pollution exclusion clauses similar to the one at issue here were ambiguous,and therefore the insurers were required to defend and indemnify the insured property owners.
in the interim between the district court denial of e j motion to dismiss and the grant of summary judgment for state auto,the pennsylvania superior court,in a decision,reversed the order of the court of common pleas of lancaster county,and ruled in favor of the insurer.lititz mut.ins.steely.the policyholders in lititz have since petitioned the state supreme court for allocatur.
the other common pleas case,fayette county housing authority,also came before the superior court.rather than following lititz,the superior court sua sponte ordered rehearing en banc of the decision from the court of common pleas of fayette county.fayette county hous.auth.housing redev.ins,order.march.the case was argued in september.
united states district courts within this circuit also have examined the pollution exclusion application to lead poisoning cases,with varying results 
the declaratory judgment act,and,provides a remedy that may be used by the federal courts in appropriate circumstances.this statute provides that a court may declare the rights of any interested party,a emphasis added,and contemplates that district courts will exercise discretion in determining whether to entertain such actions.
the unique characteristics of the act were first made clear by the supreme court in brillhart excess insurance of america,a case involving a dispute between insurance carriers.the court emphasized that the jurisdiction conferred by the act was discretionary,and district courts were under no compulsion to exercise it.id.at.
ordinarily it would be uneconomical as well as vexatious for a federal court to proceed in a declaratory judgment suit where another suit is pending in a state court presenting the same issues,not governed by federal law,between the same parties.gratuitous interference with the orderly and comprehensive disposition of a state court litigation should be avoided.
after articulating the rationale,the court listed specific factors for district judges to consider in deciding whether to hear declaratory judgment actions.a critical question,according to the court,was whether the questions in controversy between the parties to the federal suit,and which were not foreclosed under the applicable substantive law,can better be settled in the proceeding pending in the state court.id.naturally,this requires some inquiry into the scope of the state court proceeding,the nature of defenses available there,and whether the claims of all parties in interest can satisfactorily be adjudicated in that proceeding.see also edwin borchard,discretion to refuse jurisdiction of actions for declaratory judgments.observing that district courts are not obliged to exercise jurisdiction in declaratory judgment actions and concluding that refusal to exercise jurisdiction is proper where issues before state and federal courts are substantially the same and entertaining action would only duplicate judicial effort.
the discretionary nature of the declaratory judgment remedy became somewhat clouded after colorado river water conservation district united states,d.there,the court proclaimed that federal courts have a virtually unflagging obligation to exercise the jurisdiction conferred on them by congress.id.at.
although colorado river was an abstention case involving federal claims,some courts applied its restrictive teachings to limit or abolish the discretion to deny declaratory judgments.see,terra nova ins,bar,cir listing cases in which colorado river test was applied in declaratory judgment context.notably,in terra nova,this court disagreed with that approach.id.at.after exploring the ramifications of colorado river and moses cone memorial hospital mercury construction,d holding that a district court may not grant a stay pending arbitration absent exceptional circumstances,we concluded that neither case diminished the jurisdictional discretion contained in the declaratory judgment act,and that brillhart retained its vitality.terra nova,at.
because of lingering confusion among the courts over whether colorado river eroded brillhart,the supreme court revisited the issue in wilton seven falls,d.reviewing the declaratory judgment remedy at some length,the court reaffirmed brillhart standard of broad discretion and rejected colorado river restrictive exceptional circumstances test as inappropriate for the declaratory judgment act.id.at.as wilton phrased it,i n the declaratory judgment context,the normal principle that federal courts should adjudicate claims within their jurisdiction yields to considerations of practicality and wise judicial administration.id.at.the statute confers a discretion on the courts rather than an absolute right upon the litigant.id.at.
wilton emphasis upon practicality and wise judicial administration echoes brillhart specific admonition it is not our function to find our way through a maze of local statutes and decisions on so technical and specialized a subject matter for one thing,it is too easy to lose our way.brillhart,at.the court concluded that district court decisions should be reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard in actions for declaratory relief wher
