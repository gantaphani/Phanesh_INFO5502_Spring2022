petitioner kevin messina appeals from a final judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,following a bench trial before viktor pohorelsky,magistrate judge,denying his petition under the limitation of liability act,for exoneration from,or limitation of,liability for any injuries to claimants john white and michael murray resulting from the allision of a water craft,owned by messina and operated by murray,with white.the district court denied messina petition,finding that the accident was the result of negligence and unseaworthiness,of which messina did not lack privity or knowledge,b.on appeal,messina contends that the district court erred in finding that the vessel was unseaworthy and in imputing privity and knowledge to him.finding no error in the district court findings of fact or conclusions of law,we affirm.
background 
the basic events are undisputed.messina is the owner of the sunset runner,a water craft of the type commonly referred to as a wave runner or jet ski.on february,murray and white,among others,were guests at messina beach house in florida,on the gulf of mexico.while the sunset runner was being operated by murray,towing messina on an inner tube attached to the sunset runner by a rope,and white was standing next to a beached wave runner,the pelican runner,also owned by messina,the inner tube carrying messina struck white and knocked him into the pelican runner.
messina suit for exoneration or limitation of liability 
in december,white commenced an action against messina and murray in new york supreme court,kings county,seeking an unspecified amount of damages for injuries resulting from the accident.the limitation of liability act or the act provides that,within six months after receiving a claim,a vessel owner may bring a civil action in federal court,seeking a judgment exonerating him or limiting his liability.see a.when the owner brings such a suit and posts security in accordance with b,the pursuit of all claims against the owner related to the matter in question ceases,pending determination of the petition for exoneration or limitation of liability.see id.c.
in march,messina commenced the present action in the district court.his amended complaint,in accordance with,petitioned for a judgment pursuant to,which provides,in pertinent part,that the liability of a vessel owner for injuries from a collision occasioned or incurred without the privity or knowledge of the owner shall not exceed the value of the vessel and pending freight,id.a and b.the complaint alleged that the february,allision was not the fault of the sunset runner or messina and requested judgment either exonerating messina from liability for any injuries that resulted from the accident or limiting his liability to the value of the sunset runner and the inner tube,which the complaint alleged totaled.
both white and murray filed answers disputing messina entitlement to exoneration or limitation of liability.white asserted that he had a claim for damages for his injuries and murray claimed entitlement to contribution from messina with respect to any judgment that might be entered against murray in favor of white.the parties agreed to have the trial as to messina entitlement under the act conducted by a magistrate judge.
b.the trial and the findings of the district court 
at the bench trial,the witnesses testified to the basic events described above.in addition,white testified that prior to the accident,messina had been towed by murray for some minutes,during which white heard messina yelling to murray to go faster.see trial transcript february,tr,at.at one point,murray had begun to bring messina back to shore,but messina wanted to continue.see id.according to deposition testimony from murray that was introduced at trial,it was at that point that messina instructed him to go faster.see id.at.when murray subsequently brought messina toward the shore,leading to the accident,white did not see them because he was facing the beached pelican runner and had his back to the gulf.messina,in the inner tube,crashed into white back,knocking white into the pelican runner.
messina testified that shortly after murray had begun towing him,he asked murray to go faster because murray was going extremely slow.he was being very cautious.tr.at some point,messina noticed some of his guests on the beach gesturing that they wanted to have a ride,and he instructed murray to take him ashore.see id.at.murray complied by executing a turn,designed to propel the inner tube carrying messina to the shore.messina said he did not know exactly how fast the tube approached the shore but,he testified,i was brought in at a little bit higher speed i think was good id.at murray did bring me in too fast id.at.
messina testified that he was heading toward white,who had his back turned.see tr.messina testified that he yelled a warning see id.at white testified that he heard no such warning see id.at.
messina testified that he had had no reason to believe that murray had ever before operated a wave runner in an unsafe manner.messina said he was aware that operating a water craft requires more skill if it is towing a tube than if it is not see tr,and he testified as follows 
p rior to giving michael murray permission to ride the sunset runner,you never asked him whether he towed anybody on an inner tube before,did you 
and you asked him whether he had towed someone of your size on an inner tube before 
id.at see also id.at messina was about or tall and weighed close to pounds.
murray,in his deposition testimony,stated that he had operated wave runners for many years,since his earliest memory tr.internal quotation marks omitted.he testified that he had no conversations with messina about wave runner safety.see id.at.
in a decision announced on the record on february,decision tr,the district court concluded that messina was not entitled to exoneration or limitation of liability,finding that the sunset runner was unseaworthy and was operated negligently,and that these conditions were within the privity and knowledge of messina.the court noted that t he burden of proving negligence or unseaworthiness rests with the claimant but t he burden of proving lack of knowledge or privity rests with the petitioner.decision tr.the court found,inter alia,that 
p rior to the incident,murray had been towing messina aboard the inner tube for about minutes.during that time messina directed murray operation of the wave runner by instructing him to increase the speed at which it was moving.
id.at.the court noted that at one point,murray approached the shore to allow messina to disembark,but retreated because messina wanted to continue after more towing,messina instructed murray to take him to the shore.see id.at.the court found that 
a s he approached the shore the second time,murray guided the inner tube toward the shore at a speed greater than prudent given the presence of other people at the shore.
as he approached the shore for the purpose of guiding messina ashore the second time,murray failed to see john white and two other persons standing at or near the shoreline.murray also failed to see the other wave runner which had been beached at the shoreline and alongside of which john white was then standing.
as a result of his failure to see white and the wave runner at the shoreline,and as a result of the greater than prudent speed at which he was guiding the inner tube ashore,murray operation of the sunset runner caused the inner tube to strike white at or very near the shoreline causing the injuries suffered by white.
the court noted as a matter of law that a vessel is unseaworthy if it is being operated by an incompetent crew id.at citing matter of guglielmo,cir guglielmo.finding that murray was not sufficiently competent to operate the sunset runner while towing an inner tube and while attempting to guide an inner tube to the shore,the court concluded that murray lack of competence to operate the sunset runner while towing an inner tube and attempting to guide the inner tube to the shore rendered the sunset runner unseaworthy.decision tr.the court concluded that t he claimants hav
