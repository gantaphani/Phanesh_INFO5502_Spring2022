plaintiffs,all of whom are natives of somalia,brought this action under the torture victim protection act of,see,stat,and the alien tort statute,see,seeking to impose liability against and recover damages from defendant mohamed ali samantar for alleged acts of torture and human rights violations committed against them by government agents commanded by samantar during the regime of mohamed siad barre.the district court concluded that samantar enjoys immunity under the foreign sovereign immunities act fsia,see,and dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that the fsia does not apply to individuals and,as a result,samantar is not entitled to immunity under the fsia.because the fsia does not apply in this case,it consequently does not deprive the district court of jurisdiction.accordingly,we reverse the ruling of the district court dismissing for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under the fsia and remand this action for further proceedings.
plaintiffs all claim to have suffered torture or other abuses in violation of international law at the hands of somali soldiers or other government agents under the general command of samantar.samantar became a government official in somalia as a result of his participation in a socialist coup staged by general mohamed barre in.according to plaintiffs,p ower was assumed by the supreme revolutionary council src,which consisted primarily of the army officers who had supported and participated in the coup,including defendant samantar.in order to squelch potential opposition to its seizure of power,the src outlawed political parties and any organization not sanctioned by the government,and the src systematically favored its own clans and oppressed other clans.in particular,plaintiffs allege that the military government brutally oppressed the generally prosperous and isaaq clan,which the government viewed as a threat,and imposed measures intended to harm the clan politically and economically.
beginning in the late,opposition to the barre regime developed within the disfavored clans and grew among the general citizenry following somalia unsuccessful war against ethiopia over the ogaden territory.the military leadership reacted by imposing harsh control measures against government opponents,including the alleged commission of numerous atrocities against ordinary citizens in order to terrorize the civilian population and to deter it from supporting the growing opposition movements.plaintiffs allege that government intelligence agencies,including the national security service nss and the military police,engaged in the widespread and systematic use of torture,arbitrary detention and extrajudicial killing against the civilian population of somalia.
three of the plaintiffs allege that they were personally subjected to this brutality.plaintiff bashe abdi yousuf,a member of the isaaq clan,claims that nss agents,suspecting him of activities,abducted him and tortured him by various methods,including electric shock and the mig,a means of torture whereby yousuf hands and feet were bound together in the air behind his back and a heavy rock was placed on his back.plaintiff jane doe,also an isaaq clan member,alleges that in,she was abducted from her family home in hargeisa by nss agents,repeatedly tortured and raped,beaten to the point that she could not walk,and placed in solitary confinement for three and a half years.finally,plaintiff john doe ii,also born into the isaaq clan,alleges that,although he was a officer in the somali national army,he was arrested in with other somali soldiers who were isaaq clansmen and then shot during a mass execution.doe survived his wound by hiding under a pile of bodies.
the remaining plaintiffs are pursuing claims as personal representatives of the estates of family members allegedly killed by government agents.plaintiff aziz mohamed deria alleges that his father and brother were tortured and killed by soldiers based on his family affiliation with the isaaq clan.plaintiff john doe i,an isaaq clansman,asserts that his two brothers were abducted by government forces while tending the family livestock and then executed.
plaintiffs do not allege that samantar personally committed these atrocities or that he was directly involved,but they claim that the responsible government agents operated against them and other civilians with the tacit approval and permission of the armed forces and their commander,defendant samantar,who served as somalia minister of defense from january to december,and as prime minister from january to september.regardless of whether the alleged acts occurred during samantar tenure as prime minister or his stint as minister of defense,plaintiffs claim samantar is subject to liability because,in either capacity,he knew or should have known about this conduct and,essentially,gave tacit approval for it.
ultimately,any oppression of somali civilians ended in january,when the barre regime collapsed and high ranking officials,including samantar,fled somalia.samantar ended up in virginia,where the plaintiffs,some of whom apparently are naturalized american citizens,found him.
plaintiffs brought this action for damages under the auspices of two statutes.first,plaintiffs seek to impose liability against samantar under the alien tort statute ats.the ats grants district courts original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only,committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the united states.the ats was enacted as part of the judiciary act of and has been on the books,in essentially its current form,ever since.see sosa,d.fundamentally,the ats is a jurisdictional statute that creat ed no new causes of action rather,it was enacted on the understanding that the common law would provide a cause of action for the modest number of international law violations with a potential for personal liability at the time.id.at.
plaintiffs claim that the torture they suffered and the extrajudicial killings of their family members constituted violations of international law.plaintiffs contend that samantar is liable for these acts,both in his capacity as minister of defense and as prime minister of somalia,because he possessed and exercised command and effective control over the armed forces of somalia and that he knew or should have known that his subordinates had committed,were committing,or were about to commit extrajudicial killings,torture,crimes against humanity,war crimes,cruel,inhuman,or degrading treatment.
plaintiffs also contend that samantar is liable under the torture victim protection act of tvpa.the tvpa provides that a n individual who,under actual or apparent authority,or color of law,of any foreign nation subjects an individual to torture or subjects an individual to extrajudicial killing,is liable in a civil action for damages to the victim or the victim legal representative.a,stat.though the torture victim act creates a cause of action for official torture,this statute,unlike the alien tort act,is not itself a jurisdictional statute.kadic karadzic,cir concluding that the tvpa permits the appellants to pursue their claims of official torture under the jurisdiction conferred by the alien tort act and also under the general federal question jurisdiction of section see arce garcia,cir assuming that,not the ats,provides the jurisdictional basis for the tvpa.
samantar moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,arguing that he is entitled to immunity under the fsia.the fsia provides that,subject to certain exceptions not relevant here,a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states.emphasis added.
plaintiffs,of course,did not bring this action against somalia or any other foreign brought it against samantar individually.under the fsia,however,the term foreign state encompasses more than merely the foreign sovereign itself foreign state includes a political subdivision of a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state as defined in b.a a majority of the courts considering the scope of agency or instrumentality have concluded that an individual foreign official acting within the scope of his official duties qualifies as an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state.see,chuidian philippine bank,cir.
the district court followed the majority view that individuals are covered under the fsia and granted samantar motion to dismiss because t he allegations in the complaint clearly describe samantar,at all relevant times,as acting upon the directives of the government in an official capacity,and not for personal reasons or motivation.additionally,the district court found it important that the current government in somalia has expressly adopted the position that samantar alleged actions were taken in his official capacity.
the district court relied heavily upon two district court decisions.in belhas,d,a decision later affirmed by the district of columbia circuit court of appeals,see,the court held that former israeli general moshe was entitled to sovereign immunity under the fsia against claims by civilian bombing victims pursuant to the ats and the tvpa based on attacks conducted by the israeli military in a skirmish with hezbollah.submitted a letter from the state of israel officially affirming that his alleged acts were within the scope and course of his official duties and were approved by the government of israel in defense of its citizens against terrorist attacks.d at internal quotation marks omitted.the court concluded that because plaintiffs attempted to impose liability based on command responsibility for attacks rather than acts of a personal or private nature,was acting as an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state and was therefore immune from suit under the fsia.id.at.similarly,in matar dichter,d,the district court concluded that the fsia immunized a former director of an israeli intelligence agency from claims asserted under the ats and the tvpa based on the director involvement in the planning and execution of the bombing of a residential neighborhood in gaza city.the district court in matar based its conclusion on the absence of allegations suggesting that the director conduct was of a personal nature and on a letter from the israeli state department asserting that anything the director did in connection to the bombing incident was done in furtherance of his official duties.
in light of these decisions,the district court below reasoned that,a s in the belhas and matar complaints,the complaint at issue does not allege that samantar was acting on behalf of a personal motive or for private reasons.the court further accorded great weight to the letters submitted by the current somali government,concluding that the government opinion reaffirmed that samantar involvement in the alleged atrocities was in his official capacit y and in furtherance of government efforts to quell the insurgencies from to.accordingly,the district court concluded that samantar was entitled to sovereign immunity under the fsia and dismissed the plaintiffs claims for lack of jurisdiction.see argentine republic amerada hess shipping,d t he text and structure of the fsia demonstrate congress intention that the fsia be the sole basis for obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign state in our courts.
plaintiffs challenge the district court application of the fsia on numerous grounds.plaintiffs most fundamental assertion is that congress did not intend for individual foreign officials to claim sovereign immunity under the fsia,that the fsia applies only to foreign states,not to individuals.alternatively,plaintiffs contend that,even if the fsia does apply to individual foreign officials,such persons are immune only if they are agents or officials of a foreign state at the time of suit.the fsia,plaintiffs argue,does not shield former officials like samantar from suit.we address each of these issues below 
when congress enacted the fsia in,it did so against a backdrop of foreign sovereign immunity jurisprudence spanning more than years.see amerada hess,at.beginning with the schooner exchange,cranch,the supreme court essentially granted absolute immunity from suit to all foreign states.since foreign sovereign immunity is a matter of comity rather than constitutional law,the court routinely deferred to the decisions of the political branches on whether to take jurisdiction over actions against foreign sovereigns and their instrumentalities.verlinden central bank of nigeria,d.and,u ntil,the state department ordinarily requested immunity in all actions against friendly foreign sovereigns.id.in,however,the state department changed its policy of suggesting immunity in every case involving a foreign sovereign and instead adopted a restrictive theory of sovereign immunity which permitted foreign states to be sued in united states courts for their commercial acts,but not for their public acts.amerada hess,at.one consequence of the restrictive theory,however,was that foreign nations often placed diplomatic pressure on the state department,which still bore the primary responsibility for deciding questions of sovereign immunity.verlinden,at.
in,congress enacted the fsia,shifting responsibility for deciding questions of foreign sovereign immunity from the executive branch to the judicial branch in order to free the government from the diplomatic pressures,and to clarify the governing standards.id.at.see.the fsia essentially codifies the restrictive theory of foreign sovereign immunity under which a foreign state is immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states except as provided in sections to.congress did not define the term foreign state except to say that it includes a political subdivision of a foreign state or an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state as defined in subsection b.a.in turn,subsection b defines agency or instrumentality of a foreign state as 
any entity 
which is a separate legal person,corporate or otherwise,and 
which is an organ of a foreign state or political subdivision thereof,or a majority of whose shares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof,and 
which is neither a citizen of a state of the united states as defined in section c and e of this title,nor created under the laws of any third country.
because there is no explicit mention of individuals or natural persons,it is not readily apparent that congress intended the fsia to apply to individuals.before we address the merits of this issue,however,we must make sure that we are not foreclosed from doing so by circuit precedent.
samantar takes the position that we settled the question of whether the fsia applies to individual foreign government officials in velasco v.the government of indonesia,cir,siding with the majority of the federal appellate courts that have directly addressed the issue.
as noted previously,the majority view clearly is that the fsia applies to individual officials of a foreign state,as explained in the ninth circuit seminal chuidian decision.see at.most of the decisions embracing the view that individuals are covered by the fsia either expressly adopt chuidian reasoning or incorporate substantially similar reasoning.see,in re terrorist attacks on september,cir explaining that agency or instrumentality is broad enough to encompass senior members of a foreign state government keller central bank of nigeria,cir concluding individual defendants were within agency or instrumentality provision byrd corporacion forestal y industrial de olancho,cir adopting majority position as articulated in chuidian central bank of jordan,same.chuidian holds the definition of an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state under b encompasses individual officials acting in their official capacity.at.by contrast,the seventh circuit stands alone in concluding that the fsia does not apply to individuals.see enahoro abubakar,cir rejecting the chuidian approach as inconsistent with the statutory text.
for the reasons that follow,we believe this is still an open question in the fourth circuit.in fairness to samantar,however,he is not alone in his reading of velasco,as a number of courts and commentators believe velasco adopted the majority position.see,kensington int l itoua,cir reading velasco as conclud ing that the fsia applies to individuals acting in their official capacity in reliance on chuidian stewart,david,the un convention on jurisdictional immunities of states and their property,am.int l,including velasco in a list of decisions by a growing number of courts that have held that the fsia applies to individual officials of foreign governments to the extent their actions were performed in their official capacities.we do not read our decision in velasco in this manner.
it is true that velasco cited chuidian and noted that numerous courts have construed the fsia to cover individual foreign officials acting within the scope of their authority.velasco,however,was ultimately focused on the wholly separate question of whether,and under what circumstances,the acts of an individual operate to bind a foreign sovereign claiming immunity under the fsia.see velasco,at.
the plaintiff in velasco brought an action to collect on an indonesian promissory note issued by staff members of indonesia national defense security council ndsc.indonesia claimed sovereign immunity under the fsia,and the parties agreed the only possible basis for jurisdiction was the fsia commercial activity exception under which there is no immunity against claims based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states by the foreign state.a.as it turned out,the promissory notes were fraudulent instruments that the ndsc staff members had no authority to issue.indonesia argued that the lawsuit was not based on commercial activity by a foreign state,that the unauthorized conduct of the ndsc staffers could not be attributed to indonesia.see velasco,at.applying the tenet that an act of an agent beyond what he is legally empowered to do is not binding on the government,id.at,we concluded that 
b y issuing the notes,the individual defendants acted ultra vires and in violation of indonesian law.as a consequence,the issuance of the notes can not be characterized as the commercial activity of a foreign state which divests the ndsc or the government of indonesia of their sovereign immunity.
id.at.thus,despite the reference to chuidian and other decisions addressing the scope of b,velasco was not about whether an individual government official was entitled to sovereign immunity as an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state.rather,it was about whether the indonesian government was bound,through agency principles,by the unauthorized acts of individual government officials 
accordingly,velasco did not settle the question of whether congress intended to confer sovereign immunity under the fsia on an individual acting within the scope of his authority.
in determining congressional intent,we focus of course on the language of the provision at issue,but we also consider the overall structure and purpose of the statute.see morales trans world airlines,d.under the fsia,an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state is defined as an entity that is a separate legal person,corporate or otherwise.b.the phrase separate legal person is laden with corporate connotations.generally,courts use this phrase as a convenient way to capture the essence of the principal of limited liability that flows from t he fiction of corporate personhood.beiser weyler,cir.a basic tenet of american corporate law is that the corporation and its shareholders are distinct entities.dole food patrickson,d.the idea of a s eparate legal personality has been described as an almost indispensible aspect of the public corporation.first city bank banco para el comercio exterior de cuba,d internal quotation marks omitted.we find the seventh circuit view of this passage especially persuasive 
i f it was a natural person congress intended to refer to,it is hard to see why the phrase separate legal person would be used,having as it does the ring of the familiar legal concept that corporations are persons,which are subject to suit.given that the phrase corporate or otherwise follows on the heels of separate legal person,we are convinced that the latter phrase refers to a legal business entity which is a legal person.if congress meant to include individuals acting in the official capacity in the scope of the fsia,it would have done so in clear and unmistakable terms.
enahoro,at.thus,the fsia use of the phrase separate legal person suggests that corporations or other business entities,but not natural persons,may qualify as agencies or instrumentalities.
moreover,in order to ensure that an agency or instrumentality seeking the benefits of sovereign immunity is actually connected to a foreign state,the fsia requires that the entity be neither a citizen of a state of the united states as defined in section c and e of title,nor created under the laws of any third country.b emphasis added.sections c and e,which govern the citizenship of corporations and legal representatives of estates,are inapplicable to individuals,and it is nonsensical to speak of an individual,rather than a corporate entity,being created under the laws of a country.
construing agency or instrumentality to refer to a political body or corporate entity,but not an individual,is also consistent with the overall statutory scheme of the fsia.section,for example,establishes the exclusive means for service of process on a foreign state or its agencies or instrumentalities.see a,b.j.section b,which addresses service upon an agency or instrumentality,does not contemplate service on an individual,but instead provides that absent a special arrangement for service between the plaintiff and the agency or instrumentality,service must be perfected by delivery of a copy of the summons and complaint either to an officer,a managing or general agent,or to any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process in the united states or in accordance with an applicable international convention on service of judicial documents.b emphasis added.this language is strikingly similar to the general procedural rule for service on a corporation or other business entity.see.h b.the requirements for serving an individual,by contrast,can be found back in rule e serving an individual within a judicial district of the united states,or even rule f serving an individual in a foreign country.the fact that section uses language virtually identical to that found in rule h for service upon corporate entities and fails to prescribe or refer to service provisions for individual defendants strongly supports our interpretation that an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state can not be an individual.
we also find confirmation for our understanding of the fsia in the house committee report on the fsia.the house report explained that separate legal person was intended to include a corporation,association,foundation,or any other entity which,under the law of the foreign state where it was created,can sue or be sued in its own name,contract in its own name or hold property in its own name,at,as reprinted in.the house committee report provided some examples of entities that would satisfy the prerequisites for an agency or instrumentality under section b,including a state trading corporation,a mining enterprise,a transport organization such as a shipping line or airline,a steel company,a central bank,an export association,a governmental procurement agency or a department or ministry which acts and is suable in its own name,at,as reprinted in at.
accordingly,we conclude,based on the language and structure of the statute,that the fsia does not apply to individual foreign government agents like samantar.accordingly,the district court erred by concluding that samantar is shielded from suit by the fsia.
plaintiffs also present the closely related argument that the fsia requires the court to assess whether an entity qualifies as an agency or instrumentality of a foreign state under section b based on that entity status at the time that the action is filed rather than the time of the underlying conduct.more simply,plaintiffs believe that even if the fsia applies to individual defendants,congress
