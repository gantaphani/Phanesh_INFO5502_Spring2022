this case arises from a class action lawsuit brought by richard richard richard,on behalf of himself and a putative class consisting of parties who allegedly suffered damages from inherently defective polybutylene pb plumbing systems installed in their homes.richard alleges that hoechst celanese chemical group,hoechst celanese corporation collectively hoechst,shell oil company shell,and dupont nemours dupont caused the putative class injuries through their manufacture,promotion,and sale of pb for use in residential and commercial plumbing systems.richard appeals the district court dismissal of his class action lawsuit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction with regard to his due process claim,and dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted with regard to his rico claims.
facts and proceedings 
richard owns and lives in a mobile home with a pb plumbing system.over time,the leaks from the pb plumbing system have caused substantial damage to richard mobile home.richard contends that the pb plumbing system is inherently defective.
pb is a of oil refining.shell,the exclusive seller of pb resin in the late,developed flexible pb pipes,which other companies like dupont and hoechst manufactured.dupont and hoechst also used pb resin to develop raw materials for joint fittings in pb plumbing systems.
richard allegations 
richard alleges that shell,dupont,and hoechst collectively the appellees administered a complex scheme to mislead buyers into believing that pb plumbing systems were suitable for use as potable water distribution systems.to this end,the appellees allegedly claimed that pb plumbing systems were superior to copper plumbing systems based on their representations that pb systems were lightweight,inexpensive,better able to withstand freezing temperatures,easier to install and purportedly enjoyed a lifetime of years.according to richard,the appellees knew that these representations were untrue because their scientists allegedly reported that the pb plumbing systems would degrade even when exposed to low concentrations of chlorine typically found in municipal water systems.richard claims that in spite of this knowledge,the appellees concealed the information and continued to market these products until approximately.
richard further claims that before purchasing his mobile home in,he inquired about its plumbing system.the seller informed him that the mobile home was equipped with an exceptionally reliable pb plumbing system that would likely outlast the mobile home itself.according to richard,the seller unwittingly made this misrepresentation in reliance on the promotional materials that the appellees promulgated.taking these misrepresentations into consideration,richard purchased the home.
b.the cox and spencer class action settlements 
the defective pb plumbing systems caused considerable litigation.in,a group of plaintiffs reached a class action settlement in a texas state court with the appellees,but the texas court rejected the settlement.beeman shell oil,dist,harris county.in the meantime,other plaintiffs filed separate pb class actions in alabama state court and tennessee state court.spencer shell oil,no.cir,greene county,cox shell oil,wl,obion county.in,the appellees entered into a class action settlement in cox.the tennessee state court approved a national settlement,which required shell and hoechst to contribute million to replace eligible consumers leaking pb plumbing systems and to reimburse them for the property damage which the leaks had caused.in spencer,the alabama state court approved a class action settlement that required dupont to contribute further sums toward the repair and replacement of pb plumbing systems.
proceedings in the present action 
richard filed his original class action complaint in the eastern district of texas on january,on behalf of himself and a class of similarly situated persons pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure rule.in his second amended complaint,he defined the class as follows 
all texas citizens,residents and entities authorised sic to do business in texas that own plumbing systems in structures in texas and elsewhere,in which there is polybutylene plumbing and over which tennessee and alabama courts lacked subject matter jurisdiction.
all citizens and entities that were excluded from the settlement classes of cox shell oil,wl.chanc,obion city and spencer shell oil,no.greene,because defects in their polybutylene plumbing systems were defined as.
all citizens and entities that own structures containing polybutylene plumbing systems and have never participated in a polybutylene class action in a court of competent personal and subject matter jurisdiction.
richard claimed that the appellees were liable for the damages that he and the class members sustained as a result of the leaks in their pb plumbing systems.the complaint cited theories of conspiracy,strict liability,negligence,and breach of implied warranties.richard also asserted that the appellees violated his due process rights,giving rise to a cause of action under.he based this assertion on his allegation that the appellees and class counsel in cox colluded in setting up procedural safeguards for class member certification.richard also alleged that as an absent class member of the cox and spencer suits,he did not receive adequate notice,had no opportunity to,and did not receive adequate representation.finally,richard amended his complaint to include claims under a of the rico act.
on may,richard and dupont reached an agreement and jointly moved for preliminary class certification as to dupont only,and for preliminary approval of a settlement agreement.shell and hoechst opposed the motion.on march,the district court issued its memorandum and opinion,holding that the court did not have jurisdiction over richard claim because of the doctrine the court had subject matter jurisdiction over the federal rico claims,but those claims failed to state a claim upon which the court could grant relief under federal rule of civil procedure b and richard did not satisfy requirements for class certification.
richard timely appeals the district court dismissal of his claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim under rule b.

iii.discussion 
richard raises two issues on appeal.first,richard argues that the district court erred in finding that the doctrine bars consideration of his due process claim.he claims that because is consistent with principles of full faith and credit,this court can not apply to bar a claim challenging a judgment allegedly reached without constitutionally sufficient procedural safeguards.second,he contends that the district court erred in dismissing his rico claim because it erroneously construed to preclude equitable remedies for private plaintiffs.we address these arguments in turn.
richard claim 
in rooker fidelity trust,and district of columbia court of appeals feldman,d,the supreme court held that state courts must resolve constitutional questions that arise during their proceedings.if the state trial court errs in deciding the constitutional issues,the judgment is not void,but the appropriate state appellate court must correct it.rooker,at.any subsequent recourse to federal court is limited to an application for a writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court.id.consequently,lower federal courts lack jurisdiction to review state court judgments when the constitutional claims are inextricably intertwined with the challenged state court judgment.feldman,at.
our sister circuits have applied the doctrine to hold that a federal court does not have jurisdiction over a class action suit that a state court has already adjudicated,even where an absent class member alleges procedural due process violations.kamilewicz bank of boston,cir snider city of excelsior springs,cir.in kamilewicz,the plaintiffs argued that should not apply to an alabama state court judgment because the alabama court did not comply with the procedural safeguards necessary for exercising personal jurisdiction over absent class members.kamilewicz,at.despite alleging these deficiencies,the plaintiffs also claimed that they did not seek to overturn the alabama judgment.id.the seventh circuit found these positions to be in conflict,and reasoned that the plaintiffs merely sought to set aside a state court judgment.id.at.because the plaintiffs did not present an independent claim,the court applied.id.
in snider,absent class members of a state court class action suit alleged that they never received proper notice,and that as a result,they were never parties to the litigation.at.because they did not receive notice,the absent class members argued that should not apply.id.the court,however,did not agree.id.according to the eighth circuit,if the federal court found that the absent class members were not parties,then the federal court would have to find that the state court wrongly certified the class and wrongly ordered a final judgment.id.such a holding would create a procedural due process exception to the doctrine,but no such exception exists.accord liedtke state bar of texas,cir refusing to find a due process exception to.
while we find this reasoning persuasive,we also recognize that the doctrine only applies insofar as a state court judgment merits full faith and credit.matsushita indus,epstein,d stating that a federal court must give preclusive effect to a state court judgment only to the extent that the law of the state would give preclusive effect to the judgment in re lease oil antitrust litigation,cir noting that the doctrine is consistent with the full faith and credit act,gauthier continental diving services,cir declining to apply the doctrine because doing so would require the federal court to give greater deference to a state court judgment than that state courts would give the judgment kamilewicz bank of boston,cir easterbrook,dissenting on request for rehearing en banc.federal jurisdiction is therefore proper under if the state law does not provide preclusive effect to the state court judgment.
in a class action lawsuit,a court may exercise jurisdiction over absent class members only if the court follows certain due process procedures.phillips petroleum shutts,d.a court must ensure that class members have received adequate notice,representation,and an opportunity to.id.at.the settlement judgment has no preclusive effect if the court does not comply with these procedures.id.at.thus,to merit full faith and credit,a state must adhere to the due process guidelines of shutts.
in light of shutts,it would seem that does not apply where a state court has not followed the due process requirements for class certification.in the instant case,richard attempts to escape the reach of by alleging such procedural infirmities.he argues that as a result of the due process deficiencies,the cox state court did not properly exercise jurisdiction over him.
given the class action nature of this case,it is necessary to resolve the following tension in applying.on the one hand,federal courts can examine jurisdictional matters brought before them.if the absent class members were not subject to the state court jurisdiction or bound by its judgment,then federal courts would have jurisdiction over the absent class members federal claims.richard jurisdictional allegations would thus seem to require a federal court to review whether federal jurisdiction exists,which would necessitate reviewing the disputed findings in cox.
on the other hand,prohibits federal review of substantive state court findings.rooker,at.in class action suits,the findings related to procedural due process determine class size,which ultimately affects the final judgment.the findings directly affect the substantive outcome,so challenging them would seem to conflict with the doctrine.here,richard allegations indisputably denounce the express findings of the cox state court.because his challenge would result in setting aside a state court judgment,seems to bar federal review of these findings.
reconciling these seemingly conflicting positions requires further analysis of.as noted previously,the supreme court held in feldman that i f the constitutional claims presented to a united states district court are inextricably intertwined with the state court judgment,then the federal district court has no jurisdiction.at.this court has determined that issues are inextricably intertwined when a plaintiff casts a complaint in the form of a civil rights action simply to circumvent the rule.liedtke,at.
the feldman holding appears to squarely fit richard situation.the cox court findings that allow for certification are inextricably intertwined with richard constitutional challenge to the state compliance with due process requirements.a federal court can not examine the due process deficiencies in cox without disturbing the underlying judgment.
moreover,the liedtke holding is also applicable here.in order to comply with liedtke,a plaintiff can not assert a claim to circumvent the doctrine.at.however,as discussed below,richard claim is clearly untenable.his blatant nonconformity with the requirements of thus suggests that he has merely cast his complaint in the form of a civil rights action in an attempt to circumvent.given that his underlying argument fails,the class action procedural issues that richard raises are irrelevant.because richard claim merely serves as an instrument for evading,that doctrine bars his claim.
to state a claim under,a plaintiff must allege facts tending to show that the defendant has acted under color of state law.american mfrs.mut.ins.sullivan,d lugar edmondson oil,d blum yaretsky,d flagg brooks,d.t he element of excludes from its reach merely private conduct,no matter how discriminatory or wrongful.sullivan,at.internal quotations omitted.a plaintiff must show that the party charged with depriving the plaintiff of her federal right is an entity that can be fairly described as a state actor.lugar,at.
this court has previously outlined the various tests that the supreme court employs to determine whether a private party has acted under color of state law.bass parkwood,cir applying the tests to hold that a private mental institution did not act under color of state law by committing the plaintiff.according to the public function test,a private entity acts under color of state law when the entity performs a function which is exclusively reserved to the state.flagg,at.internal quotations omitted wong stripling,cir.the state compulsion or coercion test holds the state responsible for a private decision only when the state has exercised coercive power or has provided such significant encouragement,either overt or covert,that the choice must in law be deemed to be that of the state.blum yaretsky,d internal quotations omitted.similarly,the nexus or state action test finds state action where the state has so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with the private actor that it was a joint participant in the enterprise.jackson metropolitan edison,d see also lugar,at.
richard argues that appellees acted under color of state law based on the state action test.he relies on lugar,in which the supreme court found joint participation between a private actor and the state.at.in lugar,a creditor allegedly failed to meet the statutory requirements for enforcing attachment of the debtor property,yet state officials seized the property without allowing the debtor to defend the action.id.at.the court found joint participation because the state officials committed an ex parte action at the request of a private party.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court stated that to find state action under,the plaintiff must satisfy two criteria.id.at.first,the deprivation at issue must be caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the s tate or by a rule of conduct imposed by the state or by a person for whom the s tate is responsible.id.second,the private party charged wi
