in november,danielle harlow of turner,maine,sued children hospital of boston,massachusetts,in the maine superior court for medical malpractice during a procedure performed at the hospital on may.danielle was six years old at the time of the procedure.the issues addressed here would never have arisen had she filed suit in massachusetts courts,which had jurisdiction over the hospital,before the expiration of the massachusetts statute of limitations.see.laws ch.she did not file such a suit.
rather,harlow instituted proceedings in maine after the massachusetts statute had expired.maine allows minors to commence an action within years after the cause of action accrues or within years after the minor reaches the age of majority,whichever first occurs.ann.tit.the november suit was timely filed under maine law because harlow had filed a notice of claim before the six years had expired,thereby tolling the statute of limitations.see id.the question is whether an exercise of personal jurisdiction over the hospital in maine would comport with maine statute and the due process clause.
the hospital removed the maine case to federal court,invoking diversity jurisdiction.the hospital then moved to dismiss the case for lack of personal jurisdiction.the court granted that motion,and harlow appeals.we affirm.in doing so,we clarify the time frame of the evidence to which a court may look in deciding whether a defendant contacts with a state are sufficient to justify personal jurisdiction,both specific and general.
in,danielle harlow under went a radio frequency cardiac ablation procedure at the hospital in boston.the procedure was performed to treat harlow supraventricular tachyarrhythmia,a condition secondary to harlow syndrome.allegedly as a result of the hospital negligence,harlow suffered a stroke during the procedure.harlow alleges that the stroke caused brain damage,with the result that she suffers serious permanent injury in the form of severe left hemiparesis as well as cognitive and behavioral impairments,including cognitive deficits,personality changes,attention and concentration deficits,impulsivity,and an inability to modulate her behavior.
in may,harlow filed a notice of medical malpractice claim against the hospital and four affiliated doctors,initiating mandatory prelitigation screening panel proceedings,as required by maine law.see.ann.tit.the defendants asserted lack of personal jurisdiction over them in maine the panel chair,acting on a joint motion of the parties,referred the issue of jurisdiction to the maine superior court pursuant to.ann.tit.in february,after briefing,the superior court granted the defendant doctors motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction,but denied the hospital motion,ruling that there was personal jurisdiction over the hospital the court did not specify whether it was relying on general or specific jurisdiction,and it cited factors pertinent to both.
in october,the screening panel unanimously decided that the hospital treatment of harlow had deviated from the applicable standard of care and had caused her injury.in november,harlow filed her medical malpractice complaint in maine superior court.the hospital removed the case to federal court and moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction under.b.harlow filed an objection on the merits and under the law of the case doctrine,and the hospital filed a reply.
in march,the district court granted the hospital motion to dismiss.the court observed that to the extent the law of the case doctrine applied at all,it is a matter of discretion,and that it was preferable to resolve the issue.the court,sitting in diversity,held that it lacked personal jurisdiction,both specific and general,over the hospital.
on appeal,harlow argues that the district court erred in two ways first,the law of the case doctrine precluded the hospital from relitigating the issue of personal jurisdiction,and second,on the merits,harlow had established personal jurisdiction over the hospital.
law of the case 
l aw of the case is an amorphous concept.as most commonly defined,the doctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law,that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.law of the case directs a court discretion,it does not limit the tribunal power.arizona california,d citation and footnote omitted.under law of the case doctrine,as now most commonly understood,it is not improper for a court to depart from a prior holding if convinced that it is clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.id.at.
whether the law of the case doctrine applies at all is a question of law,which we review de novo.see tang dep t of elderly affairs,cir.strictly speaking,the law of the case as a bar to subsequent not implicated in this case,because i nterlocutory orders,including denials of motions to dismiss,remain open to trial court reconsideration,and do not constitute the law of the case,cir.thus,the district court was free to reconsider the earlier interlocutory order.
we have sometimes of an outright statement that law of the case is not applicable to interlocutory orders at law of the case permits a lower court to review prior interlocutory orders as long as that review is not an abuse of discretion.were the law of the case doctrine even to apply,then,we would review only for abuse of discretion.see geffon micrion,cir reviewing a district court reconsideration of its own prior ruling on summary judgment motion for abuse of discretion see also in re cabletron,cir the law of the case is a discretionary doctrine,especially as applied to interlocutory orders such as this one.as justice holmes expressed it,t he phrase,law of the case,as applied to the effect of previous orders on the later action of the court rendering them in the same case,merely expresses the practice of courts generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided,not a limit to their power.citation omitted alteration in original quoting messenger anderson.as one commentator has said,the law of the case doctrine involves an effusion of applications,some of which are more discretionary than others.wright,miller,cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed regardless of phrasing,the result here is clear.the district court was not barred from reconsidering the prior decision at most we review the decision to reconsider only for a particularly egregious abuse of discretion.there was no abuse of discretion here.
the district court could have reconsidered this matter even if the prior decision had been its own,rather than the state court.see,at cabletron,at geffon,at.as the district court noted,there had been no final decision in the state court on personal jurisdiction.the state court d enial of the hospital motion to dismiss was not an appealable order.in fact,the hospital tried to appeal,but the maine law court dismissed the appeal as interlocutory the district court put the point well although it is late in the case to the question,it will be later still on appeal,an avenue open to the hospital because the personal jurisdiction ruling has never yet been appealable.
one might think there could be a federalism objection to a federal court reconsidering a state court interlocutory order entered before removal of the case.harlow absolutist argument against allowing the hospital to reargue the matter suggests such a consideration.but the argument proves too much federalism does not require more deferential treatment of a interlocutory order in a case removed to federal court than it would have required had the order originated in federal court.
the hospital,for its part,argues that the law of the case doctrine does not apply at all in this case,because the doctrine applies only to those situations in which a court is considering a matter that has already been the subject of a ruling by a coordinate court,and a state court is not coordinate with a federal court on matters of federal law.in effect,the citing any decisions of this court the hospital cites only district court decisions for this proposition is arguing for a per se rule that when the prior ruling on an issue of federal law comes from a state court,considerations in a removed case are never applicable.since state courts are also obligated to apply federal law,the premise of the argument is fatally flawed.
in any case,it would hardly do to reverse a correct ruling on the simplistic ground that it departed from the law of the case established by an earlier ruling,especially where the order challenged on appeal is subject to de novo review in any event.wright,miller,cooper,supra,at.
personal jurisdiction 
harlow argues that both specific and general personal jurisdiction exist over the hospital.
the district court analyzed harlow claim of personal jurisdiction under the prima facie standard of boit products,cir under that standard,the properly supported proffers of evidence by the plaintiff are taken as true,without the need for an evidentiary hearing.id.at see also jet wine spirits,bacardi,cir where district court applied prima facie standard as described in boit,facts for purpose of appeal from dismissal are plaintiff allegations so far as evidence supports them after preliminary jurisdictional discovery,supplemented by defendant uncontested allegations.
this court reviews de novo a district court decision to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction when the court held no evidentiary hearing but instead conducted only a prima facie review of the jurisdictional facts.jet wine spirits,at citing boit,at.
an exercise of jurisdiction must be authorized by state statute and must comply with the constitution.see noonan winston,cir.the maine long arm statute extends to the fullest extent permitted by the due process clause of the united states constitution.ann.tit.this leaves us with the constitutional inquiry.two types of personal jurisdiction,general and specific,are at issue here.see united,radio and mach.workers of am.pleasant pleasant street i,cir distinguishing the two types.the plaintiff need not prove the existence of both types of jurisdiction either one,standing alone,is sufficient.see.sch.of law at andover,am.bar ass n,cir.
the due process clause imposes several requirements on the exercise of personal jurisdiction over defendants.first,the defendant must have sufficient minimum contacts with the state.for specific jurisdiction,the plaintiff claim must be related to the defendant contacts.for general jurisdiction,in which the cause of action may be unrelated to the defendant contacts,the defendant must have continuous and systematic contacts with the state.second,for either type of jurisdiction,the defendant contacts with the state must be purposeful.and third,the exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable under the circumstances.see cambridge literary,goebel porzellanfabrik,cir noonan,at pleasant street i,at see also donatelli hockey league,cir examining historical development of personal jurisdiction jurisprudence.
minimum contacts 
the minimum contacts standard requires that a court asserting personal jurisdiction determine that the nonresident defendant possesses sufficient contacts with the forum state so that subjecting him,her,or it to the forum jurisdiction does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.pleasant street i,at quoting int l shoe washington.plaintiffs can not create jurisdiction by their unilateral activity 
the unilateral activity of those who claim some relationship with a nonresident defendant can not satisfy the requirement of contact with the forum state.the application of that rule will vary with the quality and nature of the defendant activity,but it is essential in each case that there be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state,thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.
hanson denckla,d.
contacts as alleged by harlow 
we review the facts in two different categories first,the evidence before and around the alleged tort,and second,the evidence after and unrelated to the alleged tort.
evidence from before and during the period of the alleged tort 
harlow pediatrician in maine was the person who recommended that harlow be examined at the hospital the referral was made in the spring of.after recommending an examination at the hospital and before harlow first appointment there,harlow pediatrician sent harlow medical records from maine to the hospital.harlow had her first appointment at the hospital on april,and she underwent the contested procedure there on may.it appears that the hospital discharged harlow on may or.it is unclear whether harlow visited the hospital again after being discharged.the district court believed that there were some visits,but harlow did not so allege 
at harlow april,appointment,her mother explained to the doctor that she was concerned about the family ability to pay for the recommended procedure,and the doctor stated that his office would take care of making the necessary arrangements.before harlow underwent the procedure,the hospital obtained authorization from the maine medical assistance program maine medicaid,which approved and agreed to pay for the procedure ultimately,maine medicaid paid over to the hospital for harlow procedure and immediate care at the hospital.it appears that the hospital,before discharging harlow,performed various tests,including a cerebral ct scan,an mri,and an ultrasound study of the carotid artery,and that it administered phenobarbital treatment for an unspecified length of time,but at least on may for simple partial seizures.
if the state of maine had not paid for the procedure at the hospital,the harlows would not have been able to afford it,and they would have sought other treatment.after harlow was discharged from the hospital,she received most of her follow up care from maine health care practitioners.harlow was discharged from the hospital to the maine medical center for an extensive course of rehabilitation.since then,she has been in a special education program and requires a aide at school.according to a physician who evaluated harlow and reviewed her records,harlow needs individual psychological counseling as well as a group social training program,and she will have difficulty living independently,maintaining family and social relationships,and earning a living.harlow alleged that the cost of her future care will be over.
harlow alleged a number of communications between the hospital and various individuals in maine.there is a letter,dated april,from a hospital doctor to harlow pediatrician,which refers to a prior phone call that the writer made to the pediatrician,and which thanks the pediatrician for referring harlow to the hospital.the evidence as to communications is sparse.after the procedure,hospital staff had further communications with harlow pediatrician,another pediatrician in maine,harlow mother,and maine medicaid.harlow states that the hospital sent multiple correspondence to these individuals regarding danielle,and that when a hospital doctor spoke with harlow mother on the telephone in january,he also sent correspondence,including various medical articles.
ii.evidence from after the alleged tort 
much of harlow evidence concerned the second category for periods after and unrelated to the alleged malpractice on may.we detail the evidence before we address whether the evidence can be considered for either the specific jurisdiction analysis or the general jurisdiction analysis.
harlow presented evidence that in and,roughly inpatients per year were referred to the hospital from maine.in,the hospital charged million to maine medicaid.in,the hospital charged million to maine medicaid for inpatient services plus another for outpatient services.
the hospital was not incorporated in maine and is not registered to do business there.harlow alleged that,nevertheless,the hospital actively markets and promotes its business and services within maine borders.her proffered evidentiary materials are largely undated and,to the extent they are dated,they her may procedure.
in particular,harlow alleged,the hospital marketing department specifically targets physicians located in maine.harlow alleged that the hospital has initiated a campaign to mail every single pediatrician located in the state of maine an informational packet.harlow alleged no time frame here her only record citation reveals that copies of a pediatric specialist guide were mailed to maine pediatricians in,and the hospital representative testified that he was unaware of any other referral guides being sent.the hospital also publishes a monthly newsletter on pediatrics that,since,has been mailed to pediatricians who practice in maine.the hospital has also mailed a number of brochures to maine pediatricians.harlow did not allege any specific dates on which brochures were mailed at the hospital deposition,the hospital representative testified that some brochures were mailed on one occasion in the spring of to pediatricians in maine,and that none of these items that have been marked as exhibits go to patients or consumers.the hospital has advertised in the journal of pediatrics.the exhibit harlow cited for this allegation does not indicate when or,for that matter,whether the advertisement was published.the hospital representative testified at the hospital july deposition that this advertisement is the first i ever heard of in a national magazine,and the advertisement had only been created around two or three weeks ago.
the hospital has run advertisements in the boston globe,which is widely circulated in maine.harlow alleged that this was in the.at the hospital deposition,the representative testified that he was only aware of one paid advertising campaign in the boston globe,and it ran for a period in.harlow also alleged that the hospital has run an advertisement in a maine newspaper on at least one occasion in october.she also alleged that the hospital has advertised on maine television and radio stations.she gives no dates,and the exhibit she cites is a webpage that was apparently last updated in august and printed in february the webpage describes and planned broadcast promotions.harlow also pointed to other parts of the hospital website that provide information for maine physicians to refer patients to children hospital,as well as driving directions from maine to massachusetts.
specific jurisdiction 
the hospital initially argues that harlow claim of specific jurisdiction is raised for the first time on appeal,and that she therefore waived any specific jurisdiction argument she might have.the hospital overstates the record,and,in any event,its own argument on waiver is perfunctory,and so has been waived united states zannino,cir.the district court addressed both claims.we follow suit.
ii.standards for specific jurisdiction 
the evidence produced to support specific jurisdiction must show that the cause of action either arises directly out of,or is related to,the defendant contacts.pleasant street i,at.the relatedness requirement is not an open door it is closely read,and it requires a showing of a material connection.this court steadfastly reject s the exercise of personal jurisdiction whenever the connection between the cause of action and the defendant contacts seems attenuated and indirect.id.at citing donatelli,at.instead,the defendant conduct must form an important,or at least material,element of proof in the plaintiff case.id.alteration in original quoting marino hyatt,cir.a broad argument is generally insufficient.because but for events can be very remote,due process demands something like a proximate cause nexus.cambridge literary,at.and although strict adherence to a proximate cause standard in all circumstances is unnecessarily restrictive,in most cases the proximate cause standard better comports with the relatedness inquiry because it so easily correlates to foreseeability,a significant component of the jurisdictional inquiry.nowak tak how,cir.a but for requirement has in itself no limiting principle it literally embraces every event that hindsight can logically identify in the causative chain.id.in sum,although proximate causation is not a per se requirement of specific jurisdiction,its presence or absence is still important.id.at.
iii.timing of jurisdiction 
there is a preliminary question regarding the universe of facts pertinent to the specific jurisdiction analysis.three key themes of specific jurisdiction analysis require that the proper focus be on those contacts leading up to and surrounding the claimed injury which are related to the alleged malpractice.those three concepts are that there be fair notice to the defendant,that the defendant must have purposefully availed itself of the forum state,and that the activity be truly related to the cause of action.the bulk of harlow evidence of the hospital activity in maine is simply not related at all to the alleged malpractice.
as to the time frame for evidence,we have rejected an argument from a defendant that specific jurisdiction should be measured by contacts after the alleged wrongdoing,where those contacts were more limited than those at the time of the event.see cambridge literary,at f or purposes of specific jurisdiction,contacts should be judged when the cause of action arose,regardless of a later lessening or withdrawal.a defendant can not avoid jurisdiction by shrinking its contacts with the forum after the tort.
this case presents the question.the district court understood harlow,the plaintiff,to be asking that specific jurisdiction be measured in part by contacts after the cause of action arose,when those later contacts with the forum state increased.this presents a slightly different set of as to fair notice to the defendant,purposeful availment,and relatedness.
these three concepts are all related,and they mean that in analyzing specific jurisdiction,contacts must generally be limited to those before and surrounding the accrual of the cause of action.this court has noted,for instance,that foreseeability and purposeful availment bear a family resemblance the former defining the latter to a considerable extent,donatelli,at,and that foreseeability is critical in analyzing the relatedness requirement,pleasant street i,at.at heart,these concepts are all designed to ensure that exercises of jurisdiction comport with due process.the due process clause requires fair warning as to where individuals conduct will subject them to suit,and for purposes of specific jurisdiction,this fair warning requirement is satisfied if the defendant has purposefully directed his activities at residents of the forum,and the litigation results from alleged injuries that arise out of or relate to those activities.burger king rudzewicz,d citations omitted see also pleasant street i,at citing hanson purposeful availment requirement id.citing concepts of reasonableness and foreseeability and requirement that a defendant conduct and connection with the forum state be such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there alteration in original quoting volkswagen woodson,d.the relatedness requirement,in particular,ensures that the element of causation remains in the forefront of the due process investigation.york,alioto,cir.because causation is central to the relatedness inquiry,see,nowak,at pleasant street i,at,in most cases,contacts coming into existence after the cause of action arose will not be relevant.
iv.analysis 
harlow argument in support of specific jurisdiction is that s imply stated,but for children hospital contacts with the state of maine,danielle harlow never would have undergone the surgical procedure that she did,and she never would have suffered her injuries.harlow points to the following facts the hospital staff communicated by telephone and by written correspondence with harlow doctor in maine before and after the procedure the hospital scheduled the surgery in advance and knew that harlow was coming from maine harlow pediatrician,who referred her to the hospital,was a target of the hospital outreach program before the procedure,and during her first visit,harlow mother informed the hospital staff that the family was of modest means,and the hospital responded by contacting maine medicaid to obtain prior approval for the procedure after the procedure,the hospital arranged for harlow to receive inpatient rehabilitation at the maine medical center and a doctor at the hospital communicated with harlow physicians in maine on repeated occasions and contacted the maine government to obtain approval for care.harlow stresses the hospital contacts with maine medicaid,arguing that those contacts were financially beneficial to the hospital and constituted purposeful availment of the benefits and protections of maine law.
when the evidence unrelated to the alleged malpractice is excluded,harlow has not made out an adequate case for specific jurisdiction.harlow but for the referral from a maine pediatrician,the harm would never have insufficient to give maine specific jurisdiction over the hospital.the place of the alleged tort was not maine but massachusetts.there is no evidence that the hospital purposefully induced harlow to leave maine to come to massachusetts.there is not even any evidence that the hospital induced the pediatrician to refer the patient to maine.that the reputation and expertise of an institution lead to referrals from out of state can not be enough to establish specific jurisdiction.
harlow makes much of the uncontested fact that the hospital was well aware that she was coming from maine and would likely return there.if that plaintiff availing herself of services in sufficient,then the hospital would be subject to suit for merely taking a patient from elsewhere.that the consequences of medical care remain with a patient throughout her lifetime provides even less of a basis to assert jurisdiction.jurisdiction can not be created by and does not travel with the plaintiff patient wherever she goes.
the nature of the activity in which the defendant is engaged is important.the hospital is not engaged in the interstate sale of tangible goods,capable of doing harm elsewhere.even if it were,mere awareness that a product may end up in the forum state does not constitute purposeful availment.boit,at id.at discussing asahi metal indus.superior court of,d.compare int l shoe,at.personal jurisdiction proper where defendant salesmen resided in state,they displayed samples and engaged in regular and systematic solicitation of orders in the state,a substantial volume of merchandise was regularly shipped by defendant to purchasers within the state,and cause of action arose out of defendant activities,with rodriguez fullerton tires,cir stating that even if defendant had specific knowledge that the stream of commerce would move its product into the forum state,this awareness alone would not be enough to constitute the purposeful availment which is necessary for a showing of minimum contacts emphasis added.
rather than putting goods into the stream of commerce,the hospital rendered medical care,a professional and highly personal service,and it did so entirely in massachusetts.as the ninth circuit has explained 
in the case of personal services focus must be on the place where the services are rendered,since this is the place of the receiver here the patient need.the need is personal and the services rendered are in response to the dimensions of that personal need.they are directed to no place but to the needy person herself.it is in the very nature of such services that their consequences will be felt wherever the person may choose to go.however,the idea that tortious rendition of such services is a portable tort which can be deemed to have been committed wherever the consequences foreseeably were felt is wholly inconsistent with the public interest in having services of this sort generally available.
wright yackley,cir.we reject harlow portable tort theory.
harlow also relies on other contacts,such as the hospital dealings with maine medicaid and a handful of personal communications about harlow treatment between the hospital and various individuals in maine.the fact that maine,through the maine medicaid program,paid for the surgery is not a great deal different for specific jurisdiction purposes than if harlow parents had written in maine and mailed to the hospital a check on their maine bank account.a maine patient will presumably pay,either through insurance or otherwise,for services at the hospital.in helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d,the supreme court said that the defendant acceptance of checks drawn on a bank was of negligible significance for purposes of determining whether the defendant had sufficient contacts in the forum.id.at.the court observed that c ommon sense and everyday experience suggest that,absent unusual circumstances,the bank on which a check is drawn is generally of little consequence to the payee and is a matter left to the discretion of the drawer.id.at.footnote omitted.while the utilization of medicaid from the patient state may cause extra communication and paperwork,it does not by itself rise to the level of importance necessary to establish specific jurisdiction.
we affirm the finding of lack of specific jurisdiction.
general jurisdiction 
general jurisdiction may exist when the litigation is not directly founded on the defendant contacts,but the defendant has nevertheless engaged in continuous and systematic activity,unrelated to the suit,in the forum state.pleasant street i,at citing helicopteros,at.see also helicopteros,at.focusing on question of whether defendant contacts with forum state constitute the kind of continuous and systematic general business contacts the court found to exist in perkins benguet consolidated mining.the standard for evaluating whether contacts satisfy the constitutional general jurisdiction test is considerably more stringent than that applied to specific jurisdiction questions.noonan,at quoting glater eli lilly,cir.
timing of jurisdiction 
we first resolve a preliminary matter.at oral argument,the parties disputed which time frame of evidence was relevant in deciding whether the hospital contacts with maine are sufficient to justify general jurisdiction.harlow argued that for purposes of general jurisdiction,we should look at the hospital contacts up to the time of the filing of the complaint,well beyond the time of the alleged tort.the hospital relied by analogy on cambridge literary properties for the proposition that,even when general jurisdiction is alleged,contacts should be judged when the cause of action arose.at.we disagree with the hospital.it is settled law that unrelated contacts which occurred after the cause of action arose,but before the suit was filed,may be considered for purposes of the general jurisdiction inquiry.
in noonan,we expressly rejected the argument now made by the hospital.see at the parties clash over which contacts should be considered in the general jurisdiction analysis t hey dispute whether a foreign corporation contacts with the forum should be measured up to the time of the alleged tort,up to the time the complaint is filed,or at any time.we have considered all contacts established up to the time the plaintiff filed his complaint.in helicopteros,where the helicopter crash at the center of the lawsuit had occurred in january,the supreme court considered contacts through the year.see at.on the other hand,contacts after the filing of the complaint are not considered.see,united states swiss am.bank,cir w e consider only contacts established before the government filed its complaint in december.
the reason for this approach stems from the basic distinction between specific and general jurisdiction.wright and miller,in discussing this distinction,state 
as a practical matter,a general jurisdiction inquiry is very different from a specific jurisdiction inquiry.as one court of appeals put it,
unlike the specific jurisdiction analysis,which focuses on the cause of action,the defendant and the forum,a general jurisdiction inquiry is dispute blind,the sole focus being on whether there are continuous and systematic contacts between the defendant and the forum.
accordingly,a court should consider all of a defendant contacts with the forum state prior to the filing of the lawsuit,rather than just those contacts that are related to the particular cause of action the plaintiff asserts.
wright miller,federal practice and procedure,at ed footnote omitted quoting dickson marine,panalpina,cir see also metro.life ins,cir in general jurisdiction cases,district courts should examine a defendant contacts with the forum state over a period that is reasonable under the to and including the date the suit was assess whether they satisfy the continuous and systematic standard.
ii.analysis 
in support of general jurisdiction,harlow points to the hospital ongoing relationship with maine medicaid,the fact that the hospital derives substantial and consistent revenue from maine,the hospital active marketing and advertising to physicians and the general public in maine,and the fact that the hospital holds itself out as the regional pediatric trauma center.harlow argues that all of this amounts to engag ing in the continuous and systematic pursuit of general business activities in maine.glater,at quoting perkins,at.
the hospital,for its part,points to other facts which have not been disputed the hospital is organized under massachusetts law and has its principal place of business in boston,massachusetts the hospital does not own or use real estate or maintain branch offices or other places of business in maine it provides no medical services in maine and it participates in no arrangements to provide consultation,advice,services,or use of its equipment or facilities to maine health care providers.although it has on occasion sent mailings to pediatricians in maine and it maintains a website accessible in maine,the hospital does not actually do business through its website,and maine residents account for only about out of annual patient admissions in massachusetts.the hospital argues that its contacts fall well below the levels of contacts that have previously been found insufficient to support general jurisdiction.we agree.
as we have held in other cases,where defendant only activities consist of advertising and employing salesmen to solicit orders,we think that fairness will not permit a state to assume jurisdiction.glater,at quoting seymour parke,davis,cir.we repeat glater summary of seymour,because we are facing an essentially similar fact pattern 
in seymour,a manufacturer and distributor of a drug was sued in new hampshire for injuries occurring in massachusetts.the defendant maintained no office and engaged in no manufacturing in new hampshire it held no property there it was not registered to do business there.its only contacts with new hampshire consisted of advertising and the activities of a half dozen salesmen,mostly new hampshire residents,who accepted orders and disseminated product information to new hampshire physicians,hospitals and retail pharmacies.
harlow argues that a nontrivial number of the hospital patients come from maine and have their treatment paid for by maine medicaid.the hospital points out that using harlow alleges that maine medicaid pays the hospital roughly million annually,and that the hospital total annual revenue is almost medicaid payments account for only of the hospital revenues.
treating patients from maine in massachusetts,even on a regular basis,is not the same as engaging in continuous and systematic activity in maine.a hospital that treats maine residents in massachusetts is,quite simply,in a different position from a hospital that treats maine residents in maine,or a firm that sells products to maine residents in maine.that the hospital derives revenue from treating maine patients,sometimes in the form of payments from maine medicaid,does not alter the basic fact that the hospital is not engaged in continuous and systematic activity,unrelated to the suit,in maine.pleasant street i,at see also wolf richmond county hosp,cir no general jurisdiction even though,among other things,defendant hospital treats residents and receives payments either from state or local governmental bodies or from the residents themselves for services rendered,some of the payments included reimbursements,and approximately of defendant income came from residents wright miller,supra,at t he defendant must be engaged in longstanding business in the forum state,such as marketing or shipping products,or performing services or maintaining one or more offices there activities that are less extensive than that will not qualify for general in personam jurisdiction.
reasonableness of exercise of jurisdiction 
even if the hospital contacts with maine were minimally sufficient for either specific or general jurisdiction,we would still conclude that the exercise of jurisdiction here would be unreasonable.e ven where purposefully generated contacts exist,courts must consider a panoply of other factors which bear upon the fairness of subjecting a nonresident to the authority of a foreign tribunal.pleasant street i,at.g auging fairness requires an assessment of reasonableness for,in certain circumstances,unreasonableness can trump a minimally sufficient showing of relatedness and purposefulness.york,at.the factors to be considered,known as the gestalt factors,pleasant street i,at quoting donatelli,at,include 
the defendant burden of appearing,the forum state interest in adjudicating the dispute,the plaintiff interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief,the judicial system interest in obtaining the most effective resolution of the controversy,and the common interests of all sovereigns in promoting substantive social policies.
id.citing burger king,at.
t he reasonableness prong of the due process inquiry evokes a sliding scale.york,at.in other words,the weaker the plaintiff showing on the first two prongs relatedness and purposeful availment,the less a defendant need show in terms of unreasonableness to defeat jurisdiction.the reverse is equally true an especially strong showing of reasonableness may serve to fortify a borderline showing of relatedness and purposefulness.id.
it is true that harlow has an interest in litigating conveniently in her home state,which in turn has an interest in affording its citizens a convenient forum.cambridge literary,at.but even though maine has an interest in protecting its residents,massachusetts has a like interest,one made stronger by the fact that it has an interest as a sovereign in a case arising from the,medical occurs within its borders.of course,t he purpose of the inquiry is not to compare the forum interest to that of some other jurisdiction,but to determine the extent to which the forum has an interest,babcock wilcox,cir,but here maine has only a slight interest.although a forum state has a significant interest in obtaining jurisdiction over a defendant who causes tortious injury within its borders,that interest is diminished where the injury occurred outside the forum state.nowak,at citations omitted.
further,massachusetts law,not maine law,would govern this dispute.see daynard ness,motley,loadholt,richardson poole,cir citing the fact that forum state law governs the dispute as one factor in favor of exercising personal jurisdiction there estate of johnson,me,maine has adopted the most significant contacts and relationships test for choice of law,providing that i n an action for a personal injury,the local law of the state where the injury occurred determines the rights and liabilities of the parties,unless,with respect to the particular issue,some other state has a more significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties quoting restatement second of conflict of laws.as in donatelli,maine sovereignty is not threatened apart from a generalized concern for the rights of its own domiciliaries,the state has no real interest in adjudicating the controversy.in point of fact,the opposite seems true at.
harlow argues that recognizing jurisdiction in maine would be fair,because her family is of limited means,whereas the hospital has annual revenues of million.harlow also argues whereas litigating this case in maine will cause little,if any,inconvenience to the children hospital,danielle harlow has no other forum for her case to be heard.the argument is exactly backwards.harlow did have an obvious and readily available forum in massachusetts.the fact that she missed the statute of limitations in massachusetts does not add to her argument at all.to hold otherwise would encourage plaintiffs
