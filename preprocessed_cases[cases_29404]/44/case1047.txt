opinion of the court 
steven papp filed this product liability suit against the boeing company in the superior court of new jersey,alleging that his late wife,mary was made ill by exposure to asbestos from a boeing aircraft.boeing removed papp suit to the united states district court for the district of new jersey on the basis of the federal officer removal statute,a.according to boeing,it was acting as a government contractor when it engaged in the allegedly tortious conduct.after removal,papp filed a motion to remand the case to state court,which the district court granted.the district court ruled that boeing had failed to meet a special burden of establishing that a federal officer or agency affirmatively prohibited boeing from warning third parties of the dangers of asbestos found in planes manufactured in the century.because we conclude that the federal officer removal statute extends to contractors who possess a colorable federal defense,and that boeing made a sufficient showing of such a defense at the time of removal,we will reverse.
background 
papp,individually and on behalf of mary estate,alleges that mary suffered secondary take home asbestos exposure while washing the work clothes of her first husband,robert keck.keck had several jobs that exposed him to asbestos,including one for the new brunswick plating new brunswick in the late.while working for new brunswick,keck sandblasted the landing gear of world war ii military cargo planes to prepare the gear for repairs.papp contends that that process resulted in keck having airborne asbestos fibers adhere to his clothing so that mary,who handled the clothes,inhaled the asbestos.
on august,papp sued a host of companies in new jersey,alleging injuries to mary from exposure to asbestos.he filed his first amended complaint the complaint on august,adding boeing as a defendant,both individually and as to the mcdonnell douglas corporation.the complaint did not indicate which boeing or douglas aircraft was claimed to have been the source of mary asbestos exposure.at her deposition taken on september,however,mary specified that the landing gear keck sandblasted was for a military cargo plane called the.the was built by the douglas aircraft company,a predecessor company to boeing for the united states navy and air force during world war ii.once boeing learned the identity of the aircraft,it promptly removed the case to federal court pursuant to the federal officer removal statute,a.that statute permits a defendant to remove a case to federal court from the state court where suit was originally filed,provided the allegedly culpable behavior took place while the defendant was acting under the direction of a federal officer or agency.a.
the federal officer removal statute requires that the defendant possess a colorable federal defense.in re commonwealth motion to appoint counsel against or directed to def.ass of,cir.defender ass n,cert.denied.boeing asserted that it was entitled to the federal defense of government contractor immunity because the was produced for,and under the specific supervision of,the united states military.more specifically,boeing argued that the government oversight extended to labels and warnings for all parts of the aircraft,including those parts laden with the asbestos to which keck,and in turn mary,would later be exposed.boeing also states that,to the extent that the dangers of asbestos were known at the time,the government knowledge of those dangers was superior to that of boeing.as part of its notice of removal,boeing included the declaration of larry fogg the fogg declaration.fogg was a longtime employee of douglas,who attested,based on his experience and review of the company contracts and records,to the factual underpinnings of boeing legal position.
papp moved to remand the case back to state court,and,of course,boeing opposed remand.the district court granted the motion.it held that,because boeing was a contractor and not a federal officer,it had a special burden to demonstrate that it was acting under the control of the federal government.app.at.the court said that,to prove removal jurisdiction,boeing was required to show that it performed the activity at the direction of official federal authority.app.at quotation marks and citation omitted.because the allegedly wrongful behavior was the failure to warn third parties of asbestos,the court concluded that boeing must show that a federal officer or agency directly prohibited boeing from issuing,or otherwise providing,warnings as to the risks associated with exposure to asbestos contained in products on which worked or otherwise provided services.app.at.using that standard,the court decided that boeing did not meet its special burden and that remand to state court was proper.
boeing timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
a.the federal officer removal statute 
we review de novo whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction,including a court decision to remand for a lack of jurisdiction.defender ass n,at.at the heart of the present jurisdictional dispute is the federal officer removal statute,a.as with any removal from state court,removal under a begins with the filing of a notice containing a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal.a.because a motion to remand shares an essentially identical procedural posture with a challenge to subject matter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b,it is properly evaluated using the same analytical approach.leite crane,cir,cert.denied,see also defender ass n,at applying same b framework to challenge of jurisdiction after removal.
a challenge to subject matter jurisdiction under rule b may be either a facial or a factual attack.davis wells fargo,cir.a facial attack challenges subject matter jurisdiction without disputing the facts alleged in the notice of removal,and it requires the court to consider the allegations as true.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.a factual attack,in contrast,disputes the factual allegations underlying the assertion of jurisdiction,and involves the presentation of competing facts.id.because papp challenges jurisdiction facially,we construe the facts in the removal notice in the light most favorable to boeing.defender ass n,at.
the federal officer removal statute has existed in varying forms for some years.its central aim is protecting officers of the federal government from interference by litigation in state court while those officers are trying to carry out their duties.willingham morgan.the statute has been amended over the years to permit removal in a broader set of circumstances.as currently framed and codified at a,it provides,in relevant part 
a civil action commenced in a state court and that is against any of the following may be removed by them to the district court of the united states for the district and division embracing the place wherein it is pending the united states or any agency thereof or any officer or any person acting under that officer of the united states or of any agency thereof,in an official or individual capacity,for or relating to any act under color of such office 
the or any person acting under that officer language effects an expansion of coverage that is relevant here.but the statute itself constitutes a break with tradition.section a is an exception to the complaint rule,under which absent diversity a defendant may not remove a case to federal court unless the plaintiff complaint establishes that the case arises under federal law.kircher putnam funds trust,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.unlike the general removal statute,the federal officer removal statute is to be broadly construed in favor of a federal forum.defender ass n,at quoting sun buick,saab cars usa,cir.see also willingham,at noting that the scope of the federal officer removal statute is not narrow or limited.
we have held that,in order to properly remove a case under a,a defendant must meet four requirements 
the defendant is a person within the meaning of the statute the plaintiff claims are based upon the defendant conduct acting under the united states,its agencies,or its officers the plaintiff claims against the defendant are for,or relating to an act under color of federal office and the defendant raises a colorable federal defense to the plaintiff claims.
defender ass n,at citation omitted we address each requirement in turn.
boeing is a person within the meaning of the statute 
boeing status as a person within the meaning of the statute is undisputed.because a does not itself define the term person,we look to of title i of the united states code,which defines person to include corporations,companies,associations,firms,partnerships,societies,and joint stock companies,as well as individuals.under this definition,boeing,a corporation,is in legal fact a person.
boeing was acting under a federal officer or agency 
the district court decision to remand this case was based on its conclusion that boeing had failed to demonstrate that it was acting under a federal officer or agency when it did not warn of the dangers associated with asbestos.that conclusion was predicated on two errors.first,the court wrongly believed that,because boeing was a federal contractor and not a federal officer,it faced a special burden to demonstrate that it was acting under the control of the federal government.app.at.second,the court mistakenly posited that the only way boeing could show it acted under a federal officer was to show that a federal officer or agency directly prohibited boeing from warning of asbestos risks.app.at.
the acting under requirement,like the federal removal statute overall,is to be liberally construe d to cover actions that involve an effort to assist,or to help carry out,the federal supervisor duties or tasks.ruppel cbs,cir.quoting watson philip morris,see also defender ass n,at construing acting under liberally.the classic case of such assistance as it relates to government contractors is when the private contractor acted under a federal officer or agency because the contractors help ed the government to produce an item that it need ed.defender ass n,at quoting watson,at.when,as occurred in this instance,the federal government uses a private corporation to achieve an end it would have otherwise used its own agents to complete,that contractor is acting under the authority of a federal officer.ruppel,at see also defender ass n,at discussing different ways in which an entity might act under a federal officer.thus,the proposition that contractors bear some additional special burden is inconsistent with both precedent and the underlying objectives of the removal statute.
further,we have explicitly rejected the notion that a defendant could only be acting under a federal officer if the conduct was done at the specific behest of the federal officer or agency.see defender ass n,at w e disagree that the defendant is required to allege that the conduct itself was at the behest of a federal agency.instead,we have held that i t is sufficient for the acting under inquiry that the allegations are directed at the relationship between the defendant and the federal officer or agency.id.
considered under the proper standard,it is plain that the allegations against boeing all involve conduct that occurred when it was acting under the direction of a federal officer or agency.in fact,we are presented here with an archetypal case.papp allegations are directed at actions boeing took while working under a federal contract to produce an item the government needed,to wit,a military aircraft,and that the government otherwise would have been forced to produce on its own.that being so,boeing easily satisfies the acting under requirement of the a inquiry.
the complaint rests on acts done for or relating to a federal officer or agency 
the next requirement,often referred to as the nexus or causation requirement,demands that the alleged conduct have been undertaken for or relating to a federal office.under the prior version of the statute,which required a showing that a defendant had been sued for any act under color of federal office,a,a defendant had to show a nexus,a causal connection between the charged conduct and asserted official authority.jefferson,acker,quoting willingham,at internal quotation marks omitted.but given the addition of the words or relating to in the revision of the statute a change that was intended to broaden the universe of acts that enable federal officers to remove suits to federal court,pt,at we have taken a more permissive view of this requirement.specifically,we have held that,in order to meet the for or relating to requirement,it is sufficient for there to be a connection or association between the act in question and the federal office.defender ass n,at internal quotation marks omitted.
here,there is indeed a connection or association between the acts complained of by papp and the federal government.at the heart of papp claim against boeing is the failure to provide sufficient warning about the dangers of asbestos in the landing gear of the aircraft.in its notice of removal,boeing asserts that the was manufactured for the united states armed forces under the direct supervision,control,order,and directive of federal government officers acting under the color of federal office,app.at,and that that control extended to the content of written materials and warnings associated with such aircraft,id.at.those alleged facts alone satisfy the for or relating to requirement,as they demonstrate a direct connection or association between the federal government and the failure to warn described by papp.as a result,boeing has satisfied the third requirement of a.
boeing raises a colorable federal defense 
the fourth and final requirement to demonstrate removal jurisdiction under a is that the defendant raise a colorable federal defense.defender ass n,at.boeing asserted in its notice of removal that it was entitled to the military contractor defense announced in boyle united techs.under boyle,a federal contractor can not be held liable for a state tort if,in the context of the work at issue,the united states approved reasonably precise specifications the equipment conformed to those specifications and the supplier warned the united states about the dangers in the use of the equipment that were known to the supplier but not to the united states.id.at.because papp claim against boeing is predicated on a theory,the boyle test could be rephrased to cover boeing actions as follows the government approved specifications for the,including certain warnings for the plane boeing provided the warnings required by the government and boeing told the government about any asbestos hazards that were then known to it but not to the government.see leite,at noting that the government contractor defense is established by the defendant showing that the government exercised its discretion and approved certain warnings for the defendant products,the defendant provided the warnings required by the government,and the defendant warned the government about any asbestos hazards that were known to the defendant but not to the government 
taking the undisputed facts from the notice of removal,including the fogg declaration,as true,boeing has stated sufficient facts to make out a colorable defense.as to the first element of the boyle test,boeing asserted that the government exercised complete control over any markings or labels on boeing aircraft or aircraft components,that meetings occurred between boeing and government personnel where warnings were discussed,and that t he contents,including any warnings,of any technical manuals were directed,reviewed,and approved by the government.opening br.at.
as to the second element,boeing notice of removal and the attached fogg declaration are explicit that boeing followed every specification set forth by the government when building the aircraft.
finally,as to the third element,the fogg declaration states that,at the time the aircraft was being built,boeing was not aware of the health hazards of asbestos.furthermore,some of the documents produced by boeing suggest that the government had a superior understanding of the risks of asbestos because we are bound to accept boeing assertion that the risks were not known to it,boei
