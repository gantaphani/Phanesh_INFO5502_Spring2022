plaintiff allen john appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants david hickey,the sheriff of vinton county,ohio,and two of his deputies,corporal charles boyer and officer greg wolfe with respect to john excessive force and wrongful arrest claims,which he brought under against defendants in their individual and official capacities.we conclude that john,who suffers from muscular dystrophy and is,has produced evidence sufficient to create genuine issues of material fact as to whether defendants had probable cause to arrest him and as to whether they used excessive force in attempting to place him in the back seat of a police cruiser after he explained that his legs could not bend.we further conclude that the facts as alleged by john suggest the violation of a clearly established right such that defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity.finally,we conclude that,as to his official capacity claim,john has failed to produce any evidence tending to show that sheriff hickey and vinton county failed to train their officers in a manner that constitutes deliberate indifference to citizens constitutional rights.accordingly,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
this case arises out of an acrimonious dispute between neighbors in the small town of hamden,ohio,which is located in vinton county.because the case comes to this court following entry of summary judgment in favor of defendants,we consider the facts in the light most favorable to john.between the spring and fall of,john,confined to a wheelchair by his muscular dystrophy,frequently complained to the vinton county sheriff department that members of the mcmanus family were parking on his grass and hitting his trash cans with their cars.the mcmanuses,who lived across the street from john and his family,had refused john requests to cease these practices.john alleges that members of the mcmanus family,including six adult children,had begun to threaten him.these threats peaked when john took his grievance to the city council,who ruled that the mcmanuses were to park only on their side of the street and john only on his.when jesse mcmanus died in june,several of his sons and relatives surrounded john car,preventing him from exiting.keith mcmanus,jesse son,threatened to put a bullet between john eyes.
in the wake of these threats,john became concerned for his safety and decided to install security lights on his garage.during june,the mcmanuses complained about the lights to sheriff david hickey,a defendant herein.hickey came to john house,informed him of the complaints and,at john suggestion,adjusted the lights.on october,john was charged by corporal boyer of the sheriff department,also a defendant herein,with disorderly conduct on the grounds that the lights were bothering several neighbors,including the mcmanuses.on november,john was again charged with disorderly conduct,this time for blocking dale mcmanus car while in his wheelchair.
on november,mcmanus complained to sheriff hickey that john lights were again shining on her house.hickey instructed boyer to assess whether the lights were pointed in the same direction as when boyer had cited john for disorderly conduct on october,boyer confirmed that they were.in addition,hickey spoke with mcmanus who alleged that john had added another light on his garage such that two lights were now focused at the mcmanus residence.at his deposition,hickey testified that t he front of the mcmanus house was brightly lit due to the lights.i asked mcmanus to turn her inside lights in the living room off.the flood lights from john garage illuminated the living room.
hickey and boyer then proceeded to john house,knocked on the door,and were permitted to enter by john wife.john insisted that he had not adjusted the lights in any way since the day in june when hickey adjusted them.according to hickey,john used profanities and refused to shut off the lights without written assurance from the sheriff that he and his family would be safe.hickey said he could not make such a promise and threatened to arrest john if he refused to shut off the lights.hickey then prepared to issue a citation to john but john refused to provide the necessary information however,john wife offered the information and john himself cooperated after hickey explained that he could be charged with obstruction of justice.john instructed his wife to turn the lights off but when another officer arrived,officer greg wolfe,john instructed his wife to turn them back on.the officers then arrested john.hickey asked john wife for john medication,which she provided.boyer and officer wolfe carried john,while in his wheelchair,out of the house through the front door.because there was a step to negotiate on the way out,the officers turned the wheelchair around and proceeded backwards.as they did this,john fell out of the wheelchair.the officers picked john up,placed him back in his wheelchair,and proceeded to a waiting police cruiser.
when they arrived at the cruiser,john explained that he could not fit in the back seat because he was unable to bend his legs.officer wolfe replied that he had successfully placed much bigger men in the back seat of the cruiser.the officers then attempted to put john into the back seat but were not able to do so because john leg became caught between the rear door and the body of the cruiser.this caused injury to john leg.as the officers attempted to remove john from the cruiser and return him to the wheelchair they twice dropped him.by now john was having difficulty breathing and the officers called paramedics to transport him to a hospital.
at his deposition,sheriff hickey admitted that he knew there was a wheelchair ramp attached to the back of john house but did not explain why the officers nevertheless elected to exit through the front door.in addition,hickey acknowledged that as of november,john october disorderly conduct charge relating to his lights was still pending before a county court.further,hickey acknowledged that with the assistance of john wife,he had been provided all the necessary information to issue a citation for disorderly conduct.consequently,hickey admitted that an arrest was not strictly necessary the matter could have been left to the county court.however,each of the officers confirmed that the conversation between hickey and john that preceded john arrest quickly escalated into a loud and argumentative confrontation,with john using obscenities.hickey testified that john conduct justified an elevated charge of disorderly conduct in the fourth degree and that it was clear to him that john was intent on disobeying hickey request to turn the lights off.hickey,therefore,determined that an arrest was justified.the parties agree that when john was taken to the hospital,he was no longer under arrest.finally,on march,the state of ohio dismissed hickey disorderly conduct charges from october,and november.
john brought this action under in the southern district of ohio,naming sheriff hickey,corporal boyer,and officer wolfe as defendants in their official and individual capacities.in his first amended complaint,dated january,john alleged the officers recklessly disregarded his rights under the fourth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution.john also generally alleged violations of state law.john alleged that defendants conduct caused him humiliation,indignity,pain and suffering,incurred medical bills,attorney fees as well as severe emotional distress and emotional trauma.after discovery,defendants moved for summary judgment,which the district court granted.the district court construed john claim as alleging lack of probable cause and excessive force.the court held that john had failed to establish either the existence of a vinton county custom or policy that resulted in his allegedly unreasonable arrest or that the county failed to adequately train the sheriff department officers and consequently was deliberately indifferent to john fourth amendment rights.the district court accordingly granted summary judgment to defendants in their official capacities.
as for the individual capacity claims,the district court held that defendants did not use excessive force in their arrest of john.the court observed that none of the defendants decisions as they removed john from his house and attempted to place him in the cruiser were objectively unreasonable.nor were the mishaps that occurred the result of excessive force rather,the district court reasoned,a t best,the plaintiff has demonstrated negligence,but not excessive use of force.finally,the district court held that hickey and his colleagues had probable cause to arrest john because his persistent lack of cooperation elevated the initial disorderly conduct offense to fourth degree disorderly conduct,an arrestable offense under ohio law.accordingly,the district court granted summary judgment to defendants in their individual capacities and dismissed john state law claims without prejudice.
on appeal,john again asserts that hickey and his colleagues lacked probable cause to arrest him the officers used excessive force during the arrest and vinton county failure to train its sheriff department regarding how to properly arrest handicapped suspects constitutes deliberate indifference to those suspects constitutional rights.
ii.standard of review 
john appeals the grant of summary judgment to defendants.this court reviews a district court decision to grant summary judgment de novo,cockrel shelby county sch,cir.summary judgment shall be granted when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.the district court,and this court in its review of the district court,must view the facts and any inferences reasonably drawn from them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.accordingly,this court must review the facts in the light most favorable to john.finally,in conducting a review of the facts,t he proper inquiry is whether the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.burchett kiefer,cir citing anderson liberty lobby,d.
iii.discussion 
qualified immunity 
section authorizes anyone deprived of her federal constitutional or statutory rights by state officials to bring a civil action for damages against such officials.however a defendant in a action may raise the affirmative defense of qualified immunity,which shields government officials performing discretionary functions from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.gardenhire schubert,cir quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.
but as a precursor to the harlow qualified immunity analysis,a court must first determine whether any constitutional violation occurred,let alone the violation of a clearly established right,saucier katz,d jackson leighton,cir.if the court finds no violation,then the case must be dismissed at this threshold stage because is inapplicable on its face.katz,at.see also every person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states to the deprivation of any rights secured by the constitution shall be liable.emphasis added.
thus,in the present case,which comes to the court in the summary judgment posture,we must permit the case to go to a jury if,first,there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether defendants violated john fourth amendment rights in an objectively unreasonable way and,second,those rights were clearly established at the time of john arrest such that a reasonable officer would have known that his conduct violated them.champion outlook nashville,cir feathers aey,cir burchett,at risbridger connelly,cir citing williams mehra,cir en banc.
probable cause 
the violation of a constitutional right 
john contends the defendants lacked probable cause when they arrested him for disorderly conduct on november.the defendants had probable cause if at the moment they arrested john,the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that john had committed or was committing an offense.beck ohio,d citations omitted.
defendants do not indicate in their brief precisely which section of the disorderly conduct statute they had probable cause to believe john had violated,but there are at least two sections arguably implicated by the facts.first,as articulated by the complaint hickey filed six days after the arrest,the officers might have had probable cause to believe that o n or about november,john did recklessly cause inconvenience,annoyance,or alarm to another by insulting,taunting,or challenging another,under circumstances in which that conduct is likely to provoke a violent response in violation of ohio revised code a.quoting statute.second,the officers additionally or alternatively might have had probable cause to believe john recklessly caused inconvenience,annoyance,or alarm to another by c reating a condition that is physically offensive to persons by an act that serves no lawful and reasonable purpose of the offender.a.under,an offender may be arrested for a violation of either section where the offender persists in the conduct after a reasonable warning or request to desist or engages in the conduct in the presence of any law enforcement officer.e a and c.
both theories of probable cause involve material factual disputes.according to the allegation that john probably violated a,it appears that defendants theory when they arrested john was that his reckless,insults and taunts were directed at the mcmanuses and came in the form of the floodlights he had aimed at the mcmanus residence.because of the particular factual context of this.e,a and vicious dispute between john and the mcmanuses,in which john floodlights had already played a have no reason to think these allegations are insufficient to make out a case of disorderly conduct under a.in any event,john does not give us any reason to believe the allegations are insufficient for beyond the cursory statement that offensive floodlights are subject only to civil law,he offers no authority for the proposition that their use in the context of this case falls short of violating a as the plaintiff,john bears the burden of proving the absence of probable cause,fridley horrighs,cir,and he has not convinced us that probable cause was lacking as a matter of law.
nevertheless,fact questions preclude us from holding as a matter of law that the officers had probable cause to make the arrest the most we can say is that the allegations of hickey and his colleagues might amount to probable cause to arrest john for disorderly conduct.the critical fact questions are whether john lights were in fact targeted at the mcmanus residence john maintains they were in the same position hickey had put them in earlier that summer,boyer contends otherwise and whether the lights did in fact cause inconvenience or annoyance inside the mcmanus residence hickey maintains he observed the effect of the lights inside the house but testimony from mcmanus contradicts this,making hickey version subject to questions of credibility.a final question is whether,assuming there was probable cause to conclude the use of the floodlights met the other criteria for a violation of a,the officers had probable cause to believe their use under these circumstances was likely to provoke a violent response from any of the mcmanuses.in light of these fact questions,we can not say the only reasonable determination is that the officers had probable cause to arrest the question of probable cause must therefore be submitted to the jury.radvansky city of olmsted falls,cir crockett cumberland college,cir fridley,at klein long,cir pyles raisor,cir.
the same is true with respect to the second possible theory of probable cause,namely,that john had probably violated a by creating a light emanating from the was physically offensive to the mcmanuses and served no lawful purpose the critical questions here are whether defendants had probable cause to believe the lights were in fact physically offensive and annoying or alarming to the mcmanuses and in fact served no lawful purpose.on the first question,the factual disputes just discussed preclude us from holding that probable cause existed as a matter of law.on the second question,john maintains he installed the lights for his own protection and did not target them at the mcmanus residence.there is more than one reasonable determination on these facts,so the question must be left to the jury,radvansky,at.
the right was clearly established 
it is clearly established that officers must have probable cause to make an arrest,radvansky,at klein,at donovan,at.here,the question is whether the officers allegations are true if they are,then probable cause arguably existed and the officers are entitled to qualified immunity.but if the allegations are not true,the officers had no basis for concluding john had committed disorderly conduct.an arrest under these circumstances would have been objectively unreasonable and in violation of a clearly established fourth amendment right.consequently,this claim must survive summary judgment.see,radvansky,at crockett,at.
excessive force 
the violation of a constitutional right 
the fourth amendment to the constitution guarantees that t he right of the people to be secure in their persons against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated const.amend iv.under the fourth amendment,the reasonableness of a particular seizure depends not only on when it is made,but also on how it is carried out.graham connor,d citing tennessee garner,d.thus there is a cause of action under for excessive force used to effectuate an arrest.see see also kostrzewa city of troy,cir.but as the text of the fourth amendment and the supreme court cases indicate,an arrest need not be an assault for it to be actionable under.see burchett,at observing that an allegation of assault is not necessary to sustain an excessive force claim citing cornwell dahlberg,cir.the touchstone,as with all fourth amendment questions,is the reasonableness of the arresting officers actions.as the supreme court put it in graham,a s in other fourth amendment contexts the reasonableness inquiry in an excessive force case is an objective one the question is whether the officers actions are objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them,without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.graham,at.
in graham,the supreme court instructed reviewing courts to consider various factors in evaluating excessive force and unreasonable arrest claims.accordingly,the proper application of the reasonableness inquiry requires careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case,including the severity of the crime at issue,whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others,and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.id.at.citing garner,at.these factors do not constitute an exhaustive list the ultimate question is whether the totality of the circumstances justifies a particular sort of seizure.id.resolving this question in a particular case inherently requires the court to carefully balance the nature of the intrusion on the arrestee fourth amendment rights against the countervailing governmental interests at stake.garner,at.finally,as this court has observed,t his standard contains a measure of deference to the officer judgment about the level of force necessary in light of the circumstances of the particular case.burchett,at.
applying these principles to the circumstances of this case,we conclude there are genuine issues of material fact regarding whether sheriff hickey and his colleagues,corporal boyer and officer wolfe,acted reasonably when they attempted to place john in the cruiser even though he complained that his legs would not bend.even assuming defendants had probable cause to arrest john for disorderly conduct,john was not engaging in violent behavior nor does it appear from the record that he was physically resisting the officers attempts to remove him from the house.hickey testified that,at most,john was passively resisting arrest by sitting prone.even if there was evidence of resistance,it would be improper to determine whether the resistance justified the officers actions because such a determination is for a jury in the first instance.in addition,john crime was neither violent nor severe and defendants do not contend that he presented a risk to anyone safety.that john was cursing and yelling is relevant to whether the officers actions were reasonable but surely not determinative of the issue.finally,john clearly presented no risk of flight whatsoever.thus,under the totality of the circumstances only a minimum of force was required to effectuate john arrest.see graham,at.see also burchett,at we have long recognized,for instance,that the fourth amendment permits detention using only the least intrusive means reasonably available.quoting united states sanders,cir.additionally,the record does not suggest that exigent circumstances demanded a very speedy arrest of john as might be the case where officers needed to proceed quickly to another location or to tend to an injured party.moreover,there is no question that the arresting officers knew john had muscular dystrophy and was confined to a wheelchair.see graham,at.instructing courts to consider the circumstances confronting the arresting officers.it is against this backdrop that we consider the officers attempt to seat john in the back of the cruiser.
after boyer and wolfe carried john out of the house they wheeled him to a cruiser.at this point,it is undisputed that john explained to the officers that he would not be able to fit in the back seat due to his muscular dystrophy.specifically,in his affidavit,john states i told the officers that i would not fit in the back seat.because of my disability,my legs would not bend.they paid no attention.moreover,officer wolfe said that he had bigger men transported in the back seat.so the two officers continued to push with force to have me and my legs inside the cruiser.as they pushed,moved,turned,and twisted me and my legs,maneuvering me partially into the back seat,my leg got caught between the police cruiser and its back door,causing injury.in addition,it is undisputed that after the officers ceased trying to situate john in the back seat,they attempted to return him to his wheelchair and dropped him twice in the process.
defendants contend that their actions were reasonable because john did not assist in their attempts to place him into the back seat.defendants further claim that it was reasonable to place john in the back seat because they had transported men larger than john in the back of cruisers before.in addition,defendants assert that they were aware that john had been transported in a police cruiser in the past and therefore it was reasonable for him to be transported in a cruiser on this occasion.regarding the first contention,we note that the record offers no support for the conclusion that john actively resisted arrest or placement in the cruiser.the fourth amendment does not require john to assist in his own arrest but it may require deference to officers election to use force when attempting to subdue and transport a violent or suspect.yet evidence of such circumstances is lacking here.
defendants second contention is plainly not responsive to john objection to being placed in the back seat.john informed the officers that he could not fit because his legs would not bend in light of his disability.the officers responded that they had successfully transported bigger men in the back of police cruisers.indeed,wolfe testified at his deposition that because of prior experiences with bigger men in the back seat,i knew it was not physically impossible to get him in the back of the cruiser.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to john,we can not hold that the officers response was reasonable as a matter of law.john
