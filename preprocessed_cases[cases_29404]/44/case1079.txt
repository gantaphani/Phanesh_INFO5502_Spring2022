opinion of the court 
lawrence thomas brought this suit under and the new jersey civil rights act,stat.ann,after he sustained an attack at the hands of other inmates at the cumberland county correctional facility the cccf.the attack occurred after a long verbal argument between thomas and a group of inmates in the presence of corrections officers.thomas brought suit against cumberland county and policymakers at the prison together,the county for,among other things,their failure to properly train corrections officers in conflict and intervention techniques.the district court granted summary judgment in the county favor on thomas claim.for the reasons that follow,we will vacate the district court order.
lawrence thomas entered cumberland county custody on june,he was confined in the cccf pending trial for shoplifting and failing to pay fines that he had incurred.he was assigned to the d pod,a group of holding cells in the cccf.the d pod is relatively small,housing only around detainees.it has two levels,and the upper level is open to the lower level with stairs that connect the two.it houses minimum and medium security detainees.thomas was a minimum security detainee.
the cccf is considered a tough prison,due in large part to gang activity.at least four or five fights are seen and reported every day,and up to twenty or thirty are estimated to be unseen and unreported.the county knew of these conditions by way of incident reports filed for the fights that are seen and reported.
during his detention,thomas developed a reputation as a bully.he was known for stealing others food.this suit concerns thomas conflict with a group of inmates in the d pod,which occurred on july.two corrections officers were on duty in the d pod that day corrections officer fernando martinez officer martinez and corrections officer james wilde officer wilde.thomas claims he was bartering for food and after acquiring rice and soup,he left his cell to microwave the food.when he exited,he found that a crowd of about twelve inmates had gathered outside of his cell.officer martinez was also among the crowd.the inmates were angry with thomas,believing that he had stolen food.
the argument,which began outside of thomas cell on the upper level of the d pod,grew into a heated verbal dispute that lasted for several minutes.throughout the argument,officer martinez was with the crowd while officer wilde was at his desk on the lower level of the d pod.at some point,officer martinez said something along the lines of,if you guys do fight or break it up,i going to lock everybody down.pa.in response to this statement,the crowd of inmates laughed.the statement did not cause the crowd to disperse.
while thomas,officer martinez,and the crowd were on the upper level,another inmate,leonardo santiago,yelled from the lower level,if you want to take stuff from people,come down here and take stuff from me.pa.at this time,thomas began to make his way downstairs to the lower level,allegedly to seek the protection of officer wilde as he headed down,other inmates started yelling explicit threats of violence at thomas,both from the lower level and from the crowd behind him on the stairs and on the upper level.
thomas stated that when he reached the lower level,the crowd was blocking his path to officer wilde desk.he moved towards santiago cell.within fifteen or twenty seconds after thomas reached the lower level,santiago struck thomas.santiago stated that he struck thomas partially in,because thomas was approaching him in a threatening manner.officer martinez attempted to restrain santiago,but at this time,another inmate,michael cruz,struck thomas twice.when thomas was injured,officer martinez was immediately next to him.officer martinez yelled for everyone to lock down,and the inmates reluctantly complied.the total time that elapsed between the beginning of the argument on the upper level and the violence that erupted on the lower level was three or four minutes.
neither officer martinez nor officer wilde took any action to quell the unrest as the argument progressed.one inmate testified that he could tell that a fight was imminent and wanted to see a fight happen.other inmates stated that the officers could and should have stopped the argument before the violence occurred.officer martinez acknowledged that he saw the entire incident.thomas suffered a serious eye injury and a concussion.he was left with no sight in one eye.
in new jersey,new corrections officers must complete training and academy training.the cccf provides a training program with materials from the state.new corrections officers are required to complete this program prior to assuming their duties.a corrections officer must then complete academy training within the first twelve to eighteen months of employment.the cccf does not,as a part of its training,include training on or intervening in conflicts before violence occurs.the officers do not receive specific training on calling for instead,they must use their discretion based on the training that they do receive.both officer martinez and officer wilde had completed training,but because they had been working at the cccf for less than one year,they had not yet completed academy training.
thomas obtained an expert report from richard kiekbusch regarding the need for and intervention training and the failure to intervene in this situation.kiekbusch,a professor of criminology,has over twenty years of experience in correctional administration.kiekbusch reviewed materials in the summary judgment record and also relied on materials on national standards for prison training,with which he was familiar.he observed that the cccf does not have any training on defusing a volatile situation with an inmate,inmate tension,intervening in situations of inmate unrest,or calling for when control requires additional personnel.he explained that prison training programs across the country proactively address the use of intervention and skills and calling for to defuse inmate tension and unrest.
kiekbusch observed that the cccf administration failed to provide training to its correctional officers regarding the of inmate tension and unrest and calling for in situations in which maintaining control of the inmates under their supervision has exceeded,or is likely to exceed,the capabilities of those officers.pa.he concluded that officer martinez failed to intervene in the rising inmate tension or call for to help quell the argument and that officer martinez failure to intervene contributed to the injuries that thomas sustained.based upon his education,training,and experience in jail management,kiekbusch found that the cccf failure to provide training on,intervention,and when to call for to be a careless and dangerous practice,and one which reflects a deliberate indifference to inmate health and safety.pa.
thomas filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of new jersey.he later filed a second amended complaint that included claims under and the new jersey civil rights act,stat.ann.the complaint named cumberland county and policymakers at the prison along with officers martinez and wilde as defendants.
on april,all defendants filed a motion for summary judgment and a motion to exclude the expert testimony of kiekbusch.the district court granted summary judgment on all claims against the county and officer wilde.it denied summary judgment with respect to thomas claims against officer martinez for failure to protect,failure to intervene,and incitement.it also denied the motion to exclude kiekbusch expert testimony.
thomas claims against officer martinez proceeded to trial.the jury found in favor of officer martinez,concluding that he was aware of the danger that thomas faced,but was not willfully indifferent.the district court entered final judgment and thomas filed a timely notice of appeal.thomas appeals only the district court grant of summary judgment in the county favor on the section claim.
the district court had jurisdiction under.this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review the district court disposition of a summary judgment motion de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.doe luzerne,cir.summary judgment is proper if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.an issue is genuine only if there is a sufficient evidentiary basis on which a reasonable jury could find for the party,and a factual dispute is material only if it might affect the outcome of the suit under governing law.kaucher cnty.of bucks,cir citing anderson liberty lobby.in conducting our review,we view the record in the light most favorable to the party and draw all reasonable inferences in that party favor.bowers collegiate athletic ass n,cir.a motion for summary judgment is properly denied if a jury could return a verdict for the plaintiff on the evidence presented.anderson,at.
the sole issue on appeal is the county municipal liability under section for its failure to provide training on conflict and intervention techniques.a municipality can not be held liable for the unconstitutional acts of its employees on a theory of respondeat superior.monell dep t of soc.a plaintiff seeking to hold a municipality liable under section must demonstrate that the violation of rights was caused by the municipality policy or custom.id.at.liability is imposed when the policy or custom itself violates the constitution or when the policy or custom,while not unconstitutional itself,is the moving force behind the constitutional tort of one of its employees.colburn upper darby,cir quoting polk cnty.dodson.
where the policy concerns a failure to train or supervise municipal employees,liability under section requires a showing that the failure amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom those employees will come into contact.carter city of,cir quoting city of canton,ohio harris,canton.additionally,the identified deficiency in a city training program must be closely related to the ultimate injury or in other words,the deficiency in training must have actually caused the constitutional violation.canton,at.
the parties do not challenge the existence of a policy or of a constitutional violation on appeal.the relevant policy for the purposes of municipal liability is the county decision not to provide conflict and intervention training as a part of training for corrections officers.the alleged constitutional violation stems from the officers failure to take reasonable measures to protect prisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners.hamilton leavy,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we will focus on whether the failure to provide training on conflict and intervention amounts to deliberate indifference,and whether this deficiency in training caused thomas injury.
d eliberate indifference is a stringent standard of fault,requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his action.bd.of cnty.comm rs of bryan,okl.brown,bryan cnty.ordinarily,a pattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained employees is necessary to demonstrate deliberate indifference for purposes of failure to train.connick thompson.without notice that a course of training is deficient in a particular respect,decisionmakers can hardly be said to have deliberately chosen a training program that will cause violations of constitutional rights.id.a pattern of violations puts municipal decisionmakers on notice that a new program is necessary,and t heir continued adherence to an approach that they know or should know has failed to prevent tortious conduct by employees may establish the conscious disregard for the consequences of their action the deliberate indifference necessary to trigger municipal liability.bryan,at.
nevertheless,the supreme court posited in canton that in certain situations,the need for training can be said to be so obvious,that failure to do so could properly be characterized as deliberate indifference to constitutional rights even without a pattern of constitutional violations.at.the court offered a hypothetical example of this liability.because city policymakers know to a moral certainty that their police officers will be required to arrest fleeing felons,if the city arms the officers with firearms,the need to train officers in the constitutional limitations on the use of deadly force is so obvious that a failure to provide such training could provide a basis for municipal liability.id.liability in cases depends on t he likelihood that the situation will recur and the predictability that an officer lacking specific tools to handle that situation will violate citizens rights.bryan,at.
the supreme court recently examined the applicability of liability in connick thompson,where an exonerated convict sought to hold the new orleans district attorney liable for failing to train prosecutors on discovery disclosure obligations under brady maryland,with respect to the specific types of evidence in his case.connick.at.in finding that the failure to train did not fall within the narrow range of canton hypothesized liability,connick.at,the court highlighted prosecutors legal training and professional obligations,which differentiate them from other public employees.id.at.unlike armed police officers who must sometimes make decisions with consequences and have no reason to be familiar with the constitutional constraints on the use of deadly force,id.at,p rosecutors are not only equipped but are also ethically bound to know what brady entails and to perform legal research when they are uncertain,id.at.in light of this regime of legal training and professional responsibility,recurring constitutional violations are not the obvious consequence of failing to provide prosecutors with formal training about how to obey the law.id.quoting bryan,at.the court also differentiated the situation from the example in canton due to the nuance of the allegedly necessary training.id.because prosecutors were familiar with the general brady rule,thompson claim relied on a failure to train about particular brady evidence or the specific scenario related to the violation in his case,and t hat sort of nuance simply can not support an inference of deliberate indifference.id.
we have previously found that a constitutional violation was sufficient to preclude summary judgment on a claim against a municipality.in berg county of allegheny,the plaintiff was wrongly arrested pursuant to a warrant that was erroneously issued when a clerk transposed two numbers,cir.the plaintiff sought to hold the county liable for its poor training procedures on the process.id.at.we held that summary judgment was not appropriate,because h aving employed a design where the slip of a finger could result in wrongful arrest and imprisonment,there remains an issue of fact whether the county was deliberately indifferent to an obvious risk.id.at.the failure to provide protective measures and training to prevent the mistake was comparable to a failure to equip law enforcement officers with specific tools to handle recurring situations.id.quoting bryan,at.
we have also previously addressed a case involving the need for conflict training.in ex rel.luzerne county juvenile detention center,a child confined in a juvenile facility who was physically assaulted by other residents sought to hold the facility liable for its lack of training on conflict and management of youth behavior,cir.the facility had offered no training on conflicts or identifying children who could be victimized by others.id.the plaintiff presented expert opinion evidence that the training program was not adequate and did not meet nationally recognized standards.id.at.we observed that the evidence supports an inference that the potential for conflict between residents of the center was high and concluded that the evidence concerning the center failure to train its workers in areas that would reduce the risk of a resident being deprived of his constitutional right to security and was sufficient to prevent the grant of summary judgment.id.at.
thomas advances a theory of liability,arguing that a jury could find that the cccf was deliberately indifferent when patently obvious standards,national standard s and
