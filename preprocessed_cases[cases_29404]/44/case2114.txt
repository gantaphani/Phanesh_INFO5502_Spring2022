before the court is the appeal of dupont de nemours dupont from a jury verdict finding the defendants liable for trespass on the property.the in this case are stevenson,dianna stevenson,and sharon harper referred to collectively as plaintiffs.carried with dupont appeal is the plaintiffs motion for recovery of damages and costs under.the plaintiffs brought suit against dupont alleging that its victoria,texas,plant emits heavy metal particulates,which contaminated the plaintiffs properties located nearby and affected their health as well as the health of their animals.their theories of recovery included negligence,nuisance,and trespass.following a jury trial,the jury found for the plaintiffs only on the trespass theory and awarded the stevensons and harper in damages for the diminished value of their property.
dupont appeals challenging the sufficiency of the evidence of the jury verdict.it contends first that,as a matter of law,the plaintiffs can not recover for trespass based on contamination by airborne particulates.second,appellant asserts that the plaintiffs evidence of causation was insufficient to show that dupont factory emissions actually contaminated the plaintiffs properties.finally,it alleges that the plaintiffs presented insufficient evidence regarding damages for the diminution of property values.
plaintiffs,in response,have moved for damages and costs as a result of a frivolous appeal.specifically,the plaintiffs contend that dupont challenges regarding the causation evidence are actually daubert challenges regarding the admissibility of the evidence,and,because the defendant waived its daubert challenge during a hearing on the matter,this court can not now review these findings.second,plaintiffs argue that dupont point of error on evidence of a temporary trespass as opposed to permanent trespass was waived when dupont failed to request that the court submit such an issue to the jury.
for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court denial of dupont motion for judgment as a matter of law.we reverse the jury award for damages,and remand for a new trial on damages.
background procedural history 
and dianna stevenson purchased acres of land in victoria,texas in or.stevenson built a house on the property,and the family moved into that house in.stevenson used the property primarily to raise race horses.sharon harper purchased acres of land approximately a block to from the stevensons property in.she resides in a house on the property,along with her daughter,who lives in a separate house on the property.during her time on the property,she raised cows,horses,goats,chickens,and various other animals.
dupont opened a petrochemical plant in victoria,texas,in.the plant is approximately one and miles from the plaintiffs properties,which are the closest lands to the plant.the plant produces intermediate products for shipping to offsite customers.throughout its operation,the plant has emitted heavy metals as a result of burning hazardous waste.the emissions from the factory contain barium,cerium,chromium,copper,lead,manganese,and zinc.
in january,the plaintiffs filed suit against dupont for contamination of their person,property,and livestock.their theories of recovery were negligence,nuisance,and trespass.during the trial james miller,dupont environmental consultant,testified as the employee most knowledgeable about the air emissions from the stacks.he admitted that all air dispersion reports,including dupont,showed that the plaintiffs properties were within the maximum level of impact for emissions from dupont factory.this dispersion modeling showed that the emissions were most heavily concentrated in the air over the plaintiffs properties.
michael stringer was offered as the plaintiff expert on soil sampling.he collected samples from the stevensons property,including a sample of dirt from their roof,and he also collected soil samples from dupont plant and from a background source about to miles from the plant.he testified that concentrations of heavy metallic particles were higher on the stevensons property than on the dupont property and much higher than on the background property.further,the types of metals found on the ground matched those emitted by dupont.edwin smith also testified for the plaintiffs regarding soil and roof samples taken from the stevensons property.he opined that the metallic concentrations on the roof were higher than the concentrations on the ground,indicating that the cause of the contamination was airborne in nature.no soil samples were taken from harper property,and stringer testified that he did not analyze the samples collected on her roof because it was metallic and would contain metallic particles anyway.
stevenson testified that he had continuous upkeep problems at his house because the paint would keep peeling off,and his window screens continually corroded.sharon harper testified that she had continuous rust problems on her roof and pipe fence,with the worst corrosion being on the side facing the dupont factory.
to prove damages,the plaintiffs offered the testimony of john fox,a real estate appraiser.fox based his opinion solely on a letter provided by the executive director of the port of victoria industrial park regarding the range of prices available for land in the same area as the plaintiffs.the letter stated that property in the area sold for approximately to per acre.fox then placed that same range on the stevenson property,which would be to per acre.he then applied the same range to value harper property.the defendant expert conducted an appraisal of the properties in this case and concluded that the fox appraisal should be discounted approximately percent.
at the conclusion of the trial,the jury returned a partial verdict in the plaintiffs favor.the jury found that dupont was not negligent,and that its actions did not constitute a nuisance.the jury did find that a trespass had occurred on the plaintiffs lands,but did not find that the trespass was willful or wanton.the jury further denied recovery for the plaintiffs physical pain and mental anguish as well as for injury to their animals,but the jury did award the stevensons and harper for the difference in the market value of the property immediately before and after the damage proximately caused by dupont operation of the victoria plant.
the district court entered judgment in favor of the stevensons and harper in these amounts.dupont promptly moved for a new trial and judgment as a matter of law,and the district court denied the motions.dupont then timely appealed to this court to review the sufficiency of the evidence.
discussion 
whether the district court erred in denying dupont motion for judgment as a matter of law.
this circuit reviews de novo the district court ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law.see cozzo tangipahoa parish government,cir.however,when an action is tried by a jury,such a motion is a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury verdict.brown bryan county,ok,cir.accordingly,the court should consider the evidence drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all credibility determinations in the light most favorable to the party.id.furthermore,the court standard of review with respect to a jury verdict is especially deferential.id.thus,reversal is proper only if no reasonable jury could have arrived at the verdict.snyder trepagnier,cir.
dupont argues that a trespass traditionally requires a direct and physical invasion by tangible matter onto another person property,while a cause of action for nuisance requires a showing of indirect invasion and intangible intrusion.dupont relies on adams iron,to support its claims that the intrusion of airborne particles onto plaintiff land does not constitute a trespass.adams,a michigan case,declined to follow recent michigan case law expanding the tort of trespass and held that the invasion of dust particles was not sufficient evidence of trespass because these particles do not present a significant physical intrusion.id.at.defendant contends that this traditional view of trespass law would preclude plaintiffs recovery.
the current case law that adams rejected in reaching its decision does hold that a trespass occurs when particulate matter is present on another property however,those cases also modify traditional trespass law by requiring substantial damage to the res.borland sanders lead,so d.see also bradley american smelting refining,adopting the holding of borland requiring substantial damage for trespass caused by airborne particulates.dupont relies on borland,an alabama case,and bradley,a washington state case,to suggest the modern view of trespass law would support the cases of the stevensons and harper,but would require a showing of substantial damage.
dupont admits that texas courts have not decided this particular issue.however,it contends that under either theory,the plaintiffs can not recover in this case.under the old theory,the injury must be direct and tangible,which precludes recovery because the airborne particles are neither direct nor tangible.further,under the new theory,the plaintiffs have failed to establish the substantial damage requirement.significantly,however,the defendant can not point to any texas case specifically adopting these requirements.dupont argues that texas courts have adopted the substantial damage requirement,but the cases it relies on in support of that contention involved situations in which the state had set the minimum levels of damage necessary to maintain a cause of action in trespass.see,taco cabana,exxon.antonio,writ denied holding that because the plaintiff did not prove contamination above state action levels,recovery for trespass was not possible,yarbrough drive center joint venture.paso,no writ same.in this case,there is no assertion that texas law sets the required levels of contamination necessary for recovery by the plaintiffs.thus,the plaintiffs were not required to show substantial damage to their property.
dupont arguments also fail because this court is required to apply the law of texas as it currently stands.the texas supreme court set forth the following definition of trespass with its decision in railroad comm of texas manziel,to constitute trespass there must be some physical entry upon the land by some thing.id.at.research shows no texas cases adopting a direct and tangible requirement to prove trespass.because the only showing necessary is entry over land by some thing,texas law would permit recovery for airborne particulates.
ii.whether sufficient evidence was presented to the jury to prove that the emissions from dupont deposited heavy metal particulates on the plaintiffs properties.
dupont first attacks the methodology used by plaintiffs air modeling expert,johnny sanders.it contends that his methods were not sufficiently reliable to determine that the concentrations of metals would move from dupont property to the plaintiffs properties.dupont cites several examples of his testimony to show that it is unreliable.first,it points out that sanders did not do any depositional modeling,which would have confirmed whether the particles actually landed on the plaintiffs properties.second,dupont asserts that sanders used improper data in reaching his calculations and that he disregarded the actual data he was given by dupont.third,sanders testimony had mathematical errors,which skewed his analysis.
dupont also contends that plaintiffs experts stringer and smith were not reliable when they testified regarding the presence of heavy metals on the plaintiffs properties.first,dupont points out that smith analysis of the soil sample was improper because it was delivered to him by the stevensons,who did not create a chain of custody document for the sample.second,dupont argues that smith failed to inquire or determine whether the metals could have come from any alternative sources.finally,dupont points out that stringer only tested two soil samples from the stevensons property.
plaintiffs contend first that dupont lost its right to challenge the reliability of its expert testimony when it waived its daubert challenges during a hearing on the admissibility of expert testimony.plaintiffs characterize defendant arguments as challenges to the admissibility of the evidence disguised as challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence.its arguments,however,on this point are not persuasive.although dupont lost the right to challenge the admissibility of the evidence,it did not lose the right to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence.
in in re joint eastern southern district asbestos litigation,cir,the second circuit thoroughly examined the interaction between the standards enunciated in daubert merrell dow,d,and the sufficiency of the evidence.plaintiffs in the asbestos litigation sought damages for colon cancer allegedly caused by asbestos products manufactured by the defendants.the jury found in favor of the plaintiff,and the defendant promptly moved for judgment as a matter of law.the district court granted the motion and set aside the jury verdict finding that the plaintiff epidemiological evidence was insufficient to support a causal connection between asbestos and colon cancer.
the second circuit reversed finding that the district court had improperly taken the case away from the jury and overstepped its role as contemplated by daubert.id.at.the court noted that a sufficiency inquiry asks whether the collective weight of a litigant evidence is adequate to present a jury question.id.at.further,the court found that daubert did not change the traditional role of a sufficiency inquiry,but only expanded the trial court role regarding the admissibility of expert evidence.id.the court quoted the following passage from daubert to illustrate the proper method of attacking expert evidence v igorous,presentation of contrary evidence,and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.id.at quoting daubert,at.
following these guidelines,this court may review the record to determine the sufficiency of the evidence the defendant waiver of any challenges to the admissibility of the expert testimony does not preclude such a sufficiency review by this court.defendant properly preserved its rights to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence when it moved for a judgment as a matter of law in the trial court.however,as we noted above,this court must draw all inferences from the evidence in favor of the plaintiffs.brown,at.
as noted above,the testimony of all air modeling experts in this case,including dupont expert,james miller,showed that the plaintiffs properties were in the area showing the heaviest concentration of dupont emissions.thus,the defendant arguments regarding discrepancies or improper modeling techniques in sanders opinions and testimony is not persuasive.his testimony is supported by that of the other experts in the case.
dupont correctly points out that the air modeling testimony only showed that the airborne particulates were in the air over plaintiffs properties,not that it actually landed on the ground.however,the testimony of smith and stringer established that point.their testimony showed levels of metallic particulates on the plaintiffs property the metals found on plaintiffs land also matched the metals known to be emitted by dupont factory.further,smith opined that because the concentrations on the stevensons roof were higher than the concentrations on the ground,the contamination was airborne in origin.a jury could reasonably infer that the particles on the ground were from dupont factory because the stevensons property was in the area most heavily covered by the airborne particulates.
dupont argues that smith testimony was improper because he analyzed only a single sample,and no chain of custody was created.dupont never objected to the admission of this testimony,and the record shows that dupont counsel adequately smith on his techniques.dupont challenges go to the weight of the evidence,and this court should defer to the jury findings that this testimony indicated the particular result.
dupont also asserts that the plaintiffs failed to present any evidence showing the background levels of heavy metal particulates in the ai
