background 
plaintiffs,recently married,traveled to puerto rico for their honeymoon.on september,plaintiffs went to charlie auto to rent a car.driving their rental car,plaintiffs exited charlie auto and proceeded eastbound on magdalena avenue.
meanwhile,defendant fuente was departing from an engagement arranged by tupperware corporation.fuente drove southbound on condado one way street for northbound traffic only.
when plaintiffs reached the intersection of magdalena avenue and condado avenue,they proceeded through the intersection because they had a green light.fuente,still driving the wrong way down a one way street,drove her car into the left side of plaintiffs car.both plaintiffs were injured in the crash and were taken by ambulance to a nearby emergency clinic.
as a result of the crash,diana ramírez suffered whiplash,chest trauma,cuts on her leg,and bruising on many parts of her body.these injuries have allegedly resulted in continuing chest and neck pain which has inhibited ramírez life.for example,she claims that the chest pain was too severe to allow her to breast feed her newborn child or have sexual relations with her husband.further,ramírez injuries limited the amount of work she could perform at her job.
a medical examination conducted a little less than two years after the crash reported that ramírez suffers from a permanent incapacity of of her bodily functions.a psychological examination conducted one year after the crash estimated that ramírez requires intensive psychotherapy and medication for one year.
keith stewart suffered whiplash as a result of the crash.a medical examination conducted a little less than two years after the crash reported that stewart suffered from cervical paravertebral muscle strain and that the crash caused stewart to have permanent impairment of his total bodily functions.stewart alleges that the injuries hinder his ability to work as a new york policeman and prevented him from having intimate contact with his wife for about two to three months.a psychological examination conducted a year after the crash reported that stewart suffered intense emotional trauma.the psychologist recommended intensive psychotherapy and medication for approximately one year.
ii.analysis 
we review the district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.spielman genzyme,cir.according to,federal district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of,exclusive of interest and costs,and there is diversity of citizenship.a.where there are multiple plaintiffs,each must allege a claim that is in excess of.see clark paul gray.in this case,there is no question that diversity of citizenship exists.rather,the dispute turns on whether the damages exceed.
since plaintiffs seek to invoke federal diversity jurisdiction,they have the burden of showing that their claims meet the requirement.spielman,at.the longstanding test for determining whether a party has met the states that 
the rule governing dismissal for want of jurisdiction in cases brought in the federal court is that,unless the law gives a different rule,the sum claimed by the plaintiff controls if the claim is apparently made in good faith.it must appear to a legal certainty that the claim is really for less than the jurisdictional amount to justify dismissal.

if,from the face of the pleadings,it is apparent,to a legal certainty,that the plaintiff can not recover the amount claimed,or if,from the proofs,the court is satisfied to a like certainty that the plaintiff never was entitled to recover that amount,the suit will be dismissed.

plaintiffs brought their suit under the diversity jurisdiction of the federal court alleging puerto rican law causes of action.see erie tompkins.plaintiffs brought claims for past and future physical,mental,and emotional anguish,pain and suffering mental and emotional anguish and distress resulting from witnessing their spouse suffer loss of enjoyment of life and loss of consortium permanent impairment to total bodily functions and future medical costs.
defendants questioned plaintiffs allegation that the damages for each plaintiff exceeded.thus,plaintiffs had the burden of alleging facts indicating that it is not a legal certainty that their individual claims involve less than.to meet this burden,diana ramírez produced written interrogatories documenting her injuries and pain,a medical report concluding that ramírez suffered a permanent impairment and was at risk of developing cervical spondylosis as a result of the accident,and a psychological evaluation documenting her emotional trauma and recommending intensive psychotherapy and medication for approximately one year.
keith stewart produced written interrogatories documenting his injuries,pain,and difficulty performing his job as a new york policeman,a medical report concluding that stewart suffered a permanent impairment,and a psychological evaluation documenting his emotional trauma and recommending intensive psychotherapy and medication for approximately one year.
the district court,after considering the interrogatories,medical reports,and psychological evaluations,concluded that the plaintiffs failed to submit facts indicating that it was not a legal certainty that their individual claims involved less than.we disagree.
in reaching its conclusions,the district court examined personal injury cases from the puerto rico supreme court,most of which were over forty years old,which awarded damages,adjusted for inflation,far below for injuries similar to those suffered by the plaintiffs.relying on the amount of damages awarded by commonwealth courts constituted error.contra thomas travelers ins.although federal courts must,of course,look to state law to determine the nature and extent of the right to be enforced in a diversity case,the determination of the value of the matter in controversy for purposes of federal jurisdiction is a federal question to be decided under federal standards.horton liberty mut.ins,d.in our view,the district court decision constituted error.
using puerto rico supreme court cases to analyze the for diversity purposes is the equivalent of comparing apples and oranges.damages in a puerto rico civil case are determined by a judge,not a jury.in contrast,in the federal courts,t he task of estimating money damages,especially intangible,noneconomic loss,constitutes a core jury function.davignon clemmey,cir.thus,puerto rico supreme court cases are not an accurate indicator of the possible damages that a federal jury would award for a claim brought under puerto rico law.
we have previously held that a federal district court,in determining whether a damage award is excessive,should not compare damages awarded in a federal diversity case with damages awarded by the supreme court of puerto rico.see american airlines,cir quotin
