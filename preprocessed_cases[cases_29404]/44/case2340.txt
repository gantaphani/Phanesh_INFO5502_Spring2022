alan taylor seeks review of the district court grant of summary judgment for the defendants,asserting that the trial court erred in concluding that the conservation officer conduct did not constitute a search or an invasion of privacy,in finding that the conservation officer was entitled to qualified immunity,and in determining that plaintiff lacked standing to seek prospective injunctive relief against the director of the department of natural resources in her official capacity.we find that the property check at issue was not a warrantless search in violation of the fourth amendment and,for the reasons that follow,affirm the district court.
background 
on february,longtime conservation officer paul rose approached plaintiff fenced property,located in a rural area,newaygo county,michigan,to investigate a complaint regarding fencing.under state law,it is a misdemeanor to unlawfully erect a barrier denying ingress or egress to an area where the lawful taking of animals may occur.officer rose found no violation but,after seeing tire tracks up to the open driveway and footprints continuing,proceeded onto the property,passing two no trespassing signs,toward the log and stone house.his affidavit states that he called out to determine if anyone was home.officer rose peered into the windows of the home and garage,shielding his eyes from the daytime sun with cupped hands,and he rattled the doorknobs of the home and garage.at the end of his rounds,officer rose came to the front door and left his business card in the door.the property check lasted approximately five minutes.
officer rose claims that he conducted the check because he thought a trespasser or intruder might be on the property,a concern he asserts was prompted by his observation of the footprints and tire tracks in the snow the tire tracks stopped at the entrance to the property,but the footprints appeared to lead in the direction of the residence,gradually dissipating due to limited snow cover.plaintiff claims that the gate and the location from which the observation was made are approximately a quarter mile from the home.officer rose recounts that he interpreted the house open curtains to be suspicious because,based on over twenty years of experience as a conservation officer,most absentee owners of rural homes close their curtains when not present,and intruders open them in order to observe approaching vehicles upon returning home,plaintiff found the business card the officer had left behind and,per the request noted on the card,called the officer.officer rose explained the fence complaint and offered assistance in the event of future trespassing problems but did not discuss the property check he had conducted.
after reviewing his home security tape,plaintiff contacted the director of the michigan department of natural resources dnr to report the allegedly illegal conduct of officer rose.the director replied by stating that the officer conduct was proper and that law enforcement officers customarily conduct property checks.unsatisfied with the department response,plaintiff filed a complaint in federal court,ultimately seeking nominal damages against the conservation officer and injunctive relief against the director of the dnr,bringing a claim alleging violation of his fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and invasion of privacy,similar claims of violation of the michigan constitution,a negligence claim for failure to train conservation officers,and state law claims of trespass.the trial court granted defendants for summary judgment on the federal claims,concluding that the officer conduct was not a search and,even assuming a constitutional violation,that the officer was entitled to qualified immunity.the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims.plaintiff appeals the district court grant of summary judgment for the defendants.
plaintiff asserts three issues on appeal,arguing that officer rose conduct did constitute a search,that his conduct was not protected by qualified immunity,and that plaintiff has standing to seek injunctive relief.this court review of a grant of summary judgment is de novo.summar bennett,cir.we find that officer rose conduct does not rise to the level of a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment and thus no constitutional violation occurred,and therefore affirm the district court denial of plaintiff claim under.
plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in concluding that officer rose conduct did not constitute a search.the occurrence of a search is defined in terms of whether a person had a constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy.katz united states,d harlan,concurring.when interpreting the katz definition,a reasonable expectation of privacy exists when the individual has manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search and society is willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable.california ciraolo,d.
applying katz,the district court found,and defendants concede on appeal,that plaintiff had manifested a subjective expectation of privacy.nevertheless,the district court concluded that officer rose conduct did not satisfy the second prong of katz because the methods used and the purpose for the observations indicate a low level of intrusion.the court noted that officer rose merely conducted observations sans technological enhancements,and he did so under the auspices of performing a property check.the court also found persuasive that officer rose was present on the property during the daytime,his check lasted only about five minutes,and he left a business card behind to notify the owner of his presence.
we agree with the district court determination that officer rose conduct does not constitute a search within the meaning of the fourth amendment based on its failure to satisfy the second element of the katz analysis.less than one year before we heard argument on this appeal,another panel of this court clarified the elements we are to consider when determining whether society is willing to recognize an expectation of privacy as reasonable in a case pertaining to officials conduct on another piece of rural michigan property.the panel unanimous opinion in widgren maple grove township explains 
the second prong of the katz test generally addresses two considerations.the first focuses on what a person had an expectation of privacy in,for example,a home,office,phone booth or airplane.the second consideration examines what the person wanted to protect his privacy from,for example,members,of a firm,strangers passing by on the street or flying overhead in airplanes other relevant factors in applying katz second prong include the intention of the framers of the fourth amendment 
cir emphases in original internal citations omitted.our katz prong two inquiry follows this framework,beginning with consideration of the individual sense of security and then moving to the government intrusion at issue.id.at internal citation omitted.
the nature of the property in which plaintiff claims an expectation of privacy weighs in favor of finding that society is willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable.after all,officer rose property check entailed observation of the interior of the home,the prototypical and hence most commonly litigated area of protected privacy.kyllo united states,d.however,it is important to note that officer rose did not enter the plaintiff home.rather,he checked the doors and windows to assure that they were secure,and he engaged in a relatively unintrusive view into the building interior,per departmental custom.his survey of the premises lasted only around five minutes.t he fourth amendment has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the house,requiring exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless search.payton new york,d emphasis added.
there is even an exception to this rule based on suspicion of burglary.past cases reveal an established precedent that the police may enter a residence if they believe that there is a burglary in progress.united states mcclain,cir,citing united states reed,cir.while such cases have indicated that probable cause and exigency are both required to justify warrantless entry,it makes sense for the law to impose a greater burden on officers entering a home to ensure its safety than it demands to justify looking inside through open windows.officer rose did not enter plaintiff home.he observed the interior of the house and its exterior from the outside only.the supreme court has stated that even the fact that an area is within the curtilage does not itself bar all police observation.ciraolo,at.thus it becomes critical to examine the extent of the government intrusion,which widgren has prescribed should include an inquiry into the methods used and purpose for the conduct at issue.widgren,at.
considering officer rose limited methods of observation and the purpose of his conduct,we conclude that this property check is not a fourth amendment search.in terms of methods,existing fourth amendment jurisprudence distinguishes between cases in which officers engaged in ordinary visual surveillance and those in which the officers employ technological enhancement of ordinary perception.kyllo,at.like the officials in widgren,officer rose used observations unaided by technological enhancements to survey the property.widgren,at.admittedly,the present case differs from widgren in that officer rose quickly surveyed the interior of the house,visible through open drapes,while the officers in widgren only examined exterior features of the home.officer rose,however,engaged in only a brief,minimally intrusive visual inspection.appellant accurately cites cases from other courts that interpret observation of the interior of a home through windows to constitute a search.see brock united states,cir,people camacho,cal th,d,lorenzana superior court of los angeles,cal d,people haddad.however,all of these cases are distinguishable from the matter at hand because they involve the conduct of law enforcement officers attempting to investigate suspected wrongdoing by the home without any professed protective element.that is,the purpose of the officers observations,a factor that we are to consider in such cases,differed from that of officer rose.
when considering whether the officials had conducted a search in widgren,this court plainly stated that a criminal investigation is generally more intrusive than an administrative or regulatory investigation.widgren,at.this analysis comports with our past interpretation that a search implies an examination of one premises or person with a view to the discovery of contraband or evidence of guilt to be used in prosecution of a criminal action.united states blackburn,cir.of course,not all investigations are permissible.as the supreme court stated in camara municipal court,it is surely anomalous to say that the individual and his private property are fully protected by the fourth amendment only when the individual is suspected of criminal behavior.camara municipal court,d.also,consideration of the purpose of the search should be distinguished from the law enforcement officer subjective intent,the former being subject to deduction and of legal importance,the latter being difficult or impossible to discern and irrelevant.see bond united states,d.here,no evidence indicates that officer rose would have any purpose for looking inside plaintiff property other than the protective one that he supplies.the record does not indicate that officer rose had reports of criminal activity occurring within the house,nor does it suggest that the officer harbored any personal for the plaintiff.there is no evidence that officer rose was engaged in the dirty business that often accompanies an unjustifiable government intrusion.widgren,at citing olmstead united states.holmes,dissenting.
we accept that,informed by his years of experience as a conservation officer and dnr custom,officer rose felt that conditions consistent with a wintertime break in of a home warranted a brief protective check.upon arriving on the property,officer rose announced his presence.in broad daylight,he spent approximately five minutes looking in open windows and jiggling door knobs to ensure the safety of the home.after engaging in minimally intrusive observations to quell his suspicions,he left his card in the front door.in this context,we can not find such an inspection constitutionally infirm.
consideration of the underlying purposes of the fourth amendment solidifies our conclusion.the supreme court advised in kyllo that we should construe the fourth amendment in a manner which will conserve public interests as well as the interests and rights of individual citizens.kyllo,at.citation omitted.here,without physically intruding upon the home or employing any technology to substitute for a physical intrusion,officer rose observed the home in an effort to ensure the integrity of the property for the homeowner.t his was a situation where a common sense assessment would be that a legitimate owner,could that person have been contacted,would want the officers to investigate the possible break in,which tips us in the direction of finding the officer actions reasonable.mcclain,at boggs,concurring.
plaintiff also argues that the trial court erred in finding that officer rose was entitled to qualified immunity.an officer is protected by qualified immunity provided his conduct did not run afoul of a right that is clearly established.to determine whether the officer conduct violated a clearly established right,t he relevant,dispositive inquiry is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.saucier katz,d.in this case,the district court ultimately determined that a reasonable conservation officer who had legally entered the premises and remained to conduct a brief,minimally invasive property check,like the one officer rose performed,for the purpose of ensuring the security of the home would not understand such conduct to violate the constitution.
because we determine that officer rose conduct did not violate the constitution,the officer need not rely on qualified immunity to avoid liability.by definition,if officer rose did not violate a constitutional right,he did not violate a constitutional right that is clearly established.this portion of the district court opinion requires no further appellate attention to affirm.
plaintiff additionally argues that the trial court erred in finding he lacked standing to seek prospective injunctive relief against the director of the department of natural resources in her official capacity.we need not address whether or not plaintiff would have had standing to request an injunction because,as determined above,there was no constitutional violation and therefore there is no ongoing unconstitutional conduct to enjoin.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the district court judgment.
i write separately to disagree with the panel analysis of the fourth amendment issues.therefore,i believe that the district court should be reversed in part and affirmed in part.
constitutionality of search 
katz united states framework 
the fourth amendment states in relevant part,the right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures,shall not be violated,and no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause.const.amend.iv.katz united states,d,provides the standard test governing fourth amendment search violations.specifically,whether the individual has manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search and whether society is willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable.widgren maple grove township,cir.the sixth circuit in widgren further delineates the second prong of the katz test.the second prong consists of two considerations.the first consideration is what a person had an expectation of privacy in.id.the second consideration examines what the person wanted to protect his privacy from.id.at.this requires an examination of the degree of government intrusion in i the methods used in the search,and ii the purpose for the search.id.at.based on the facts of this case,there was an unconstitutional search of taylor home.
here,there is no disagreement as to whether taylor manifested a subjective expectation of privacy.he most certainly did.it is with respect to the second prong of the katz test,however,that i disagree with the panel.
first,taylor expectation of privacy in his home and the curtilage surrounding it satisfies the initial element of the second prong of the katz test.part one of the second prong of the katz test looks at what taylor had an expectation of privacy in.widgren,at.principally,t his inquiry centers on whether the human relationships that normally exist at the place inspected are based on intimacy,confidentiality,trust or solitude and hence give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy.id.at citations omitted.
taylor expectation of privacy in his home and the curtilage surrounding his home satisfies this standard.taylor home is a place where such intimate relationships exist and take place.indeed,the supreme court accords special status to the sanctity of the home 
the fourth amendment protection of the home has never been tied to measurement of the quality or quantity of information obtained.in silverman,for example,we made clear that any physical invasion of the structure of the home,by even a fraction of an inch,was too much,at,and there is certainly no exception to the warrant requirement for the officer who barely cracks open the front door and sees nothing but the rug on the vestibule floor.in the home,our cases show,all details are intimate details,because the entire area is held safe from prying government eyes.
kyllo united states,d emphasis in original.therefore,rose peering into the home,garage,and bedroom window,was peering into a place that the court recognizes intimate relationships occur.taylor expectation of privacy was accordingly valid,thus satisfying the first element of the second prong of the katz test.
likewise,the second element of the second prong of the katz test is also satisfied.in evaluating this element,our inquiry focuses on the government intrusion at issue.widgren,at.this requires assessing the degree of the government intrusion by addressing both the methods used and the purpose for the intrusion.id.at.
the methods used in this case were sufficiently intrusive to categorize the search as unconstitutional.this was more than a mere inspection of the exterior of the house,as was the case in widgren.here,rose did in fact touch and look into the house.see id.at noting that the property assessor did not touch enter or look into the house.furthermore,rose obtained neither consent nor a warrant before breaching the curtilage of taylor property.id.stating that tax appraisers would be well advised to obtain consent or a warrant as a matter of course before breaching the curtilage because,in many instances,such an intrusion may be a fourth amendment search see also id.at stating breaching the curtilage and other trespass,though not necessarily determinative,are also relevant to the degree of government intrusion.while it may be true that a passing policeman need not avert his eyes,here rose walked up to various windows in taylor garage and home,pressed his face and hands against these windows and peered inward what this method lacks in subterfuge and advanced technology it makes up for in sheer flagrancy.
like the methods used,the purpose for the interference bears upon the intrusiveness of government action.id.neither party disputes the fact that rose initial purpose was a lawful one.rose was on the land investigating a complaint about the fencing on taylor property.and while one might applaud rose for his concern about a potential intruder on taylor property,this purpose does not sanction rose search.noting that the property check was brief,involved a low degree of intrusion,and was conducted in the middle of the afternoon,the district court opines that rose was not carrying out a criminal investigation,which would carry with it the imprimatur of suspicion of crime.taylor humphries,d,citations omitted.i disagree.
rose states that his concern was that an intruder might be on the premises,a concern that was heightened when he saw the curtains drawn,which led him to believe that a burglar might be present.the purpose of this search then became a criminal investigation.rose was searching for evidence of a burglar to wit,he checked all the doors to see if they were open,and he checked all the windows to see if anyone had broken in.the fact that rose was searching for someone other than taylor does not make it any less a search of taylor home.indeed,rose might just as easily have come across a marijuana plant growing in taylor bedroom notably,at oral argument,counsel for was unable to offer an answer as to how such an encounter and subsequent arrest would not be an unconstitutional search given that,rose argument amounts to no harm done.while the harm in terms of damages may in fact be small,it is no less an unconstitutional search.see,people haddad,affirming the trial court determination that an officer had no right to peer through the defendant bedroom window when the officer only had a suspicion of an assault and battery and a mere suspicion as to the safety of a person who might have been present.
in addition to protecting taylor home,the fourth amendment also extends its scope of protection to the immediately surrounding property,or curtilage.specifically,the protection afforded the curtilage is essentially a protection of families and personal privacy in an area intimately linked to the home,both physically and psychologically,where privacy expectations are most heightened.california ciraolo,d.this protection,however,is not limitless.id.noting that police need not cover their eyes on public thoroughfares,nor to activities knowingly exposed to the public,nor when they observe from a public place.
the property immediately surrounding taylor home qualifies as curtilage under the supreme court four factor test,and is therefore entitled to fourth amendment protection.claim that rose did not intrude upon protected curtilage.the four factors used to determine whether an area is a home curtilage are 
the proximity of the area claimed to be curtilage to the home,whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home,the nature of the uses to which the area is put,and the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by.
widgren,at citations omitted.first,the property at issue immediately surrounds taylor home.indeed,the do not contest the satisfaction of the first factor.second,the property is also within an enclosure surrounding the home.while there might not be physical enclosures of this land,taylor claims,that like the defendant in united states depew,cir,he chose the property because it was remote,in a secluded area,not visible from any highway due to a long driveway,and had thick trees blocking any public view of the residence.additionally,taylor property is entirely on two sides with six foot chain link fencing,including the gate entrance with the no trespassing signs.collectively,this satisfies the notion of an enclosed property.third,the nature of the use of the land was for taylor enjoyment,as well as his entrance and exit from the land.this,too,satisfies the standards for curtilage.lastly,we have already mentioned some of steps taken by taylor to protect the area from observation,including his choice of a secluded locale away from the highway,the fencing placed on the property,as well as the no trespassing signs.all four factors are satisfied,thus qualifying that area as curtilage and requiring fourth amendment protection.nb the district court acknowledged that rose likely breached the curtilage of the home.taylor,d at.
exceptions to warrant requirement 
given that taylor had an expectation of privacy in his home and the surrounding curtilage,the next issue is whether a basis for the police action existed.first we consider the exigent circumstances exceptions to getting a warrant.the sixth circuit has held that 
in general,exigent circumstances exist when real immediate and serious consequences would certainly occur if a poli
