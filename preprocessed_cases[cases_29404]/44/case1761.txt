merlin campo appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of allstate insurance company allstate.campo held a standard flood insurance policy sfip issued by allstate as a wyo carrier participating in the national flood insurance program the program.this policy expired just before hurricane katrina destroyed campo home.he asserts that allstate negligent misrepresentations in violation of louisiana law caused him not to reinstate the expired policy.campo contends that the district court erred in holding that federal law preempted his claims because they were related to claims handling.concluding that campo claims are instead related to policy procurement and not preempted by federal law,we reverse the district court grant of allstate motion for summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.
facts and proceedings 
on august,hurricane katrina destroyed appellant merlin campo home located in bernard parish,louisiana.prior to august,and for over twenty years,campo held a sfip through allstate,which issued the policy as a wyo carrier.campo coverage period ended,however,on august,the date when campo premium to reinstate coverage for was due.the policy included a grace period for payments,so that if campo paid the premium by september,he would have avoided a gap in coverage because of hurricane katrina,however,the federal emergency management agency fema extended this deadline for an additional ninety december,for purposes of campo policy.campo had received a renewal notice before august,and knew that his policy would expire on that date,but he did not pay the premium by then.
campo filed a claim under the expired policy shortly after katrina struck on august.on october,allstate sent campo a letter indicating that it had evaluated his claim and requested the program to issue a check payable to campo for the policy limit of,and allstate sent campo an advance check of for additional living expenses under the policy allstate did not inform campo that these payments were conditional on allstate eventual timely receipt of the renewal premium.although campo phoned allstate representatives multiple times during this period,the representatives never mentioned anything to campo about the delinquent premium payment.
on december,the extended grace period expired without campo ever having submitted his premium.then,on december,allstate sent campo a letter stating that coverage can not be extended for this claim and instructing campo to repay the it had advanced.allstate sent another letter on january,confirming that the claim was denied because its records indicate that this policy lapsed august,sic.as no policy was in force at the time of this loss,we are unable to extend coverage or payment consideration.
campo filed this diversity suit in federal district court,alleging that allstate and its representatives made negligent misrepresentations that prevented campo from renewing his policy campo and allstate filed for summary judgment.although the district court opinion admonished allstate for setting an example of bungling by the defendant of a degree that this court has previously not witnessed in the multitude of katrina cases on its docket,it held that campo claims were,and thus preempted by federal law.accordingly,the court granted allstate motion and denied campo.this timely appeal followed 
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue of material fact in determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists,courts view all facts and draw all inferences therefrom in favor of the party the court role at the summary judgment stage is not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.
statutory and regulatory framework 
by enacting the national flood insurance act of,et,congress established the program to make flood insurance available on reasonable terms and to reduce fiscal pressure on federal flood relief efforts.fema administers the program within the program,the wyo program allows private insurers to issue flood insurance policies in their own names.under this framework,the federal government underwrites the policies and private wyo carriers perform significant administrative functions including arrang ing for the adjustment,settlement,payment and defense of all claims arising from the policies.wyo carriers must issue policies containing the exact terms and conditions of the sfip set forth in fema regulations additionally,fema regulations govern the methods by which wyo carriers adjust and pay claims although wyo carriers play a large role,the government ultimately pays a wyo carrier claims when claimants sue their wyo carriers for payment of a claim,carriers bear the defense costs,which are considered part of the claim expense allowance fema reimburses these costs yet,if litigation is grounded in actions by the wyo company that are significantly outside the scope of this arrangement,involves issues of agent negligence,then such costs will not be reimbursable to the wyo carrier 
campo claims are 
federal law preempts state law tort claims arising from claims handling by a we thus must first determine whether the district court was correct in holding that campo suit is related to claims handling.if we conclude that it is,we must affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.campo contends that his claims instead relate to insurance procurement and are not preempted by federal law.if we conclude that his claims do relate to procurement,we must then determine whether preemption of claims extends to procurement.
allstate contends that campo suit addresses policy renewal,or reinstatement,which in its view is akin to claims handling.at least three district judges in this circuit have reached a contrary conclusion.first,in landry state farm fire casualty,the plaintiffs renewed their state sfip each year and alleged that they requested,and were assured by their state farm agent,that they would have full coverage the best coverage available.after hurricane katrina,the plaintiffs learned they did not have contents coverage and subsequently sued for negligent failure to provide coverage the plaintiffs asserted that the case involved procurement and state farm contended that it was a handling issue because policy renewal is heavily regulated by fema the district court rejected state farm argument,ruling that even though many aspects of the program are heavily regulated by fema,the obtaining of coverage does not involve the interpretation or management of an active sfip the court held that the case present ed a question of policy procurement,in that it involve d the initial obtaining of coverage.
next,in meza all state insurance,the plaintiffs mortgage company paid their insurance premiums out of an escrow account maintained for that purpose when the plaintiffs paid off their mortgage in full,they advised their allstate agent of this fact and apparently expected that future policy documents would be sent directly to them neither the agent nor anyone else made arrangements to reflect this change as a result,allstate sent renewal information to the mortgage company,which did not forward it to the plaintiffs after hurricane katrina,allstate advised the plaintiffs that they did not have flood insurance the plaintiffs sued,claiming that allstate failure to notify and advise them of their policy termination caused them to have no insurance in august.the district court held that the plaintiffs presented a procurement case upon cancellation of the mortgage,the policy had to be renewed or otherwise for plaintiffs.the court was un willing to create a new subcategory of administration of an existing program policy cases.
third,in jackson state fire casualty insurance,the plaintiffs continuously renewed their flood insurance for several years,allegedly thought that they had flood insurance,but,after hurricane katrina,learned that their sfip had not been renewed the plaintiffs sued state farm and their state farm agent under louisiana law for errors and omissions and for breach of their fiduciary duties in procuring flood insurance coverage the district court,relying on landry,determined that a cause of action as to a failure to procure flood insurance renewal was not a handling claim 
we approve of the approach taken by the district courts in these and hold that campo claims are related to procurement rather than handling.to the extent that this case involves handling of a claim,it is merely a fictitious claim in the sense that the act of filing a claim on an expired policy,a dormant policy,is equivalent to filing no claim at all.at the relevant time,campo policy had expired subject to restoration only in the event that he paid the premium within the extended grace period.allstate was thus by definition incapable of handling any new claims based on occurrences.contrary to the dissent principal fallacy,campo could not have continued his coverage by paying his renewal premium at any time between august and december.campo coverage had expired there was thus nothing to continue.instead,as a former policyholder,campo would have had to procure flood insurance.one way for him to do this was to pay his renewal premium to allstate by december,which would have caused his expired policy to be reinstated.the mere fact that allstate,for a time,mistakenly acted as though a claim existed does not make it so.it is thus impossible for campo claims to fall within the category of handling.to hold otherwise would permit insurers like allstate to ensure unilaterally that disputes would be classified as preempted suits by simply acting as though they were handling claims when in fact none existed as a matter of law.
even though this is not a matter of initial procurement,the discrete facts of this case nevertheless demonstrate that it is allstate alleged misrepresentations occurred when campo only relationship with allstate was that of both a former and a potential future policyholder.further,allstate representations were allegedly of a kind that could lull parties like campo into believing that they would receive indemnity without having to submit any additional payment,thus affirmatively dissuading them from paying their delinquent premiums to reinstate expired coverage,to procure insurance,while the shot clock of the grace period ticked away.in light of the peculiar and unusual circumstances of this case,we hold that campo claims are not related to the handling of an insurance claim,but rather concern a species of insurance procurement 
federal law does not preempt claims 
having concluded that campo claims relate to procurement rather than handling,we next must determine whether federal law preempts procurement claims.federal law may preempt state law in any of three ways,to wit when congress explicitly define s the extent to which it intends to state law congress indicates an intent to occupy an entire field of regulation or state law conflicts with federal law such that either a there is an actual conflict and compliance with both laws is impossible,or b state law is an obstacle to the full purposes and objectives of congress.
we have not definitively addressed the issue whether federal law preempts tort claims against wyo carriers arising from policy procurement.in wright,we simply noted,without approval or disapproval,that district courts have read our precedent as holding that state law claims based on claims procurement were not preempted while state law claims based on claims adjustment were.in fact,district courts of this circuit that have addressed the issue have consistently reached the conclusion that federal law does not preempt procurement claims 
now that the procurement issue is squarely before us,we conclude that two factors convincingly demonstrate that federal law does not preempt claims.first,congress,via its delegation of regulatory power to fema,has expressly preempted state law only as to claims and,congress enactment of a provision defining the reach of a statute implies that matters beyond that reach are not.we thus consider fema limited statement of preemption through the canon of statutory construction inclusio unius est exclusio alterius,indicating congress lack of interest in more broadly limiting state power.fema has expertise in drafting regulations that explicitly preempt state law,and yet in this instance it chose to confine the plain language of its preemption to handling.
second,unlike in cases,permitting prosecution of tort suits does not impede the full purposes and objectives of congress.clearly,the principal purpose in enacting the program was to reduce the massive burden on the federal fisc of the federal flood disaster assistance.suits related to handling,or claims adjustment,generally seek money that will ultimately be disbursed from federal funds thereby directly conflicting with congress objective to reduce pressure on the federal fisc in contrast,fema does not reimburse carriers for judgments additionally,fema extensively regulates the management of existing coverage while demonstrating no such interest in procurement a wyo carrier has significant independence and utilize s its own customary standards,staff,and independent contractor resources,as it would in ordinary and necessary conduct of its own business affairs,subject to the act and regulations.for these reasons,tort claims related to procurement do not interfere with congress objectives federal law thus does not preclude campo from pursuing his suit that asserts a cause of action for allstate allegedly negligent misrepresentations 
iii.conclusion 
we reverse the district court grant of allstate motion for summary judgment,and we remand for further proceedings consistent with our holding that federal law does not preempt campo suit.
reversed and remanded.
i disagree with the majority characterization of campo claim as,as his case is clearly one of claims handling and thus preempted by federal law.for this reason,i respectfully dissent from the majority opinion.
it is undisputed by the parties that campo received notice that his policy was about to expire,and that he was required to pay a renewal premium in order to renew his policy.it is also undisputed that campo failed to pay the premium by designated date,august.campo knew he had a grace that ended on september,and testified in his deposition that he intended to pay the premium before that date.hurricane katrina struck before september,and fema mandated an additional extension to meet the deadline,thus giving campo until december to pay the premium.at any time until december,campo could have paid his renewal premium and continued his coverage with no only requirement necessary for campo to have received payment on his claim was that he pay his premium,which he failed to do.campo filed a claim under the policy soon after katrina hit,and now argues that his own failure to pay his renewal premium renders this case one of procuring a new policy rather than the handling of an existing claim.
the majority opinion posits that because the policy had expired,the claim filed by campo was merely a fictitious one.this mis characterization ignores the grace period that was in effect.as campo himself admitted in his deposition,he often utilized the grace period in order to make late payments.though campo never paid the renewal premium,he testified that he assumed that the insurance was in place until the end of the grace period and thus that damage due to katrina was covered by the policy.clearly,then,his later dealings with allstate were with respect to what he regarded and what allstate as an existing quintessential situation of claims handling.
the grace period given to campo,which effectively kept his policy live as at any point he could have paid the premium and obtained coverage for damage caused by katrina until december,militates strongly in favor of finding this claim to be rather than.there is no indication from the record that campo intended to procure a policy.indeed,campo could not have been attempting to do so,as there is a day waiting period for the effective date of a new policy meaning that a new policy would have not have retroactively affected cam
