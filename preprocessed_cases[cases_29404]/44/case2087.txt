plaintiffs isaiah russell jones jones,robert sparks sparks,and herman parks parks filed this lawsuit october,against defendant alcoa,alcoa,a pennsylvania corporation,alleging that alcoa discriminated against them on the basis of race,in violation of,by assigning them to work in areas of alcoa milam county,texas,plant where they were exposed to dangerous amounts of asbestos dust.the district court granted alcoa rule b motion to dismiss,finding that the plaintiffs claims were time barred.we agree with the district court,and for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
background 
the plaintiffs,all and citizens of texas,began working at alcoa rockdale plant in milam county,texas,between and.according to the plaintiffs,beginning in the early and continuing until alcoa intentionally discriminated against them and other employees by assigning them to work exclusively in the potlining department,the rod room,and the carbon plant,areas of alcoa rockdale plant where employees were regularly exposed to large quantities of asbestos dust.in addition,the plaintiffs alleged that alcoa engaged in other racially discriminatory acts,including denying them access to dining and restroom facilities reserved for white employees,denying them transfers out of the three departments of the plant,and refusing to promote them to or supervisory positions.
recently,all three of the plaintiffs have begun to develop lung disorders,disorders that they attribute to exposure to asbestos dust while assigned to the rod room,carbon plant,and potlining department at the rockdale plant.the plaintiffs suit was filed in state court in milam county,texas,to recover for their injuries,and alcoa removed the suit to the district court below on the basis of diversity and federal question jurisdiction thereupon,alcoa moved to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing that the plaintiffs section claim was barred by the statute of limitations provided under texas law for personal injury actions.see.civ.prac.ann.vernon.the district court,applying the discovery rule and concluding that the plaintiffs cause of action did not arise until they became aware of their lung disorders,initially disagreed and denied the defendant motion.upon reconsideration,however,the district court found that the plaintiffs claim was governed by the supreme court decision in delaware state college ricks,d,that the discovery rule,therefore,did not operate to toll the statute of limitations,and that the plaintiffs section claim was,in fact.the court granted the defendant motion to dismiss and the plaintiffs now appeal.
we review de novo a district court grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,see copeland wasserstein,perella,cir,taking the actual allegations of the complaint as true,and resolving any ambiguities or doubts regarding the sufficiency of the claim in favor of the plaintiff.allied pilots ass n.however,conclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss.id.see also taylor books a million,cir.
as a threshold matter,we note that the discriminatory acts complained of long antedate the amendments to section.it is therefore highly doubtful that the plaintiffs even present a claim cognizable under the then extant version of section.the plaintiffs allegations appear to challenge discriminatory terms and conditions of their employment with alcoa.under patterson mclean credit union,d,however,the version of section relevant to the plaintiffs complaint covers only conduct at the initial formation of the contract and conduct which impairs the right to enforce contract obligations through legal process,not conduct that occurs after contract formation and that affects only the benefits,privileges,terms,and conditions of employment.see felton polles,cir.although section has since been amended to legislatively reverse patterson,we have repeatedly held that that amendment is not to be given retroactive effect.id.at quoting ass of gov t employees city public service bd.of san antonio,cir 
the plaintiffs do allege in their complaint that their assignment to the pot lining department,the carbon plant,and the rod room was a term required in the formation of their contract with alcoa,and therefore actionable under section.and,it is true that this court,for purposes of a motion to dismiss,will generally accept the pleader description of what happened to him along with any conclusions that can reasonably be drawn therefrom.charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.the plaintiffs allegation,however,is devoid of detail,let alone any factual basis to support the conclusion that assignment to the three areas in question was,in fact,a term implied in the plaintiffs initial employment contract and not a subsequent term or condition of employment at the rockdale plant.even for purposes of a motion to dismiss however we need not accept such conclusory statements particularly where they concern the legal effect of an allegation or involve a question of law normally reserved for the court,such as the interpretation of an implied term in an employment contract moreover,the plaintiffs efforts,discussed below,to define their injury as the discriminatory exposure to asbestos and the denial of promotions out of certain departments tends to undermine the claim that the challenged discrimination occurred only in connection with the formation of their employment contracts as required by patterson.there is a substantial question,therefore,whether,even apart from the limitations issue,the plaintiffs allege a claim cognizable under section see,felton,at holding that a claim of racial harassment,based on conduct occurring prior to the november amendments,is not actionable under section.nevertheless,because we hold that the plaintiffs claim is,we need not resolve whether alcoa discriminatory assignment of the plaintiffs to the areas of the plant in question was a term implicit in the formation of their contracts and therefore actionable under section,or whether that discriminatory assignment and subsequent asbestos exposure was merely a condition of employment not actionable under the version of section.
assuming,arguendo,that the plaintiffs have alleged a claim cognizable under section,our review focuses on the district court conclusion that the plaintiffs claim falls outside the relevant limitations period.
federal civil rights actions brought under,which lacks an express statute of limitations,are governed by the most closely analogous limitations period provided under state law.johnson railway express agency,d white united parcel service,cir.thus,where a section claim is brought in texas,the statute of limitations for personal injury actions in texas controls.see byers dallas morning news,cir price digital equip,cir.
the parties agree that a section claim must be brought not later than two years after the cause of action accrues.their dispute,rather,concerns the date on which the plaintiffs claim against alcoa accrued.the determination of that date is,in turn,a question of federal law.see perez laredo junior college,cir although state law governs the substantive limitation period,federal law determines when a civil rights action accrues and,therefore,when the statute of limitations begins to run.thus,we have held that t he limitations period for section employment discrimination cases commences when the plaintiff knows or reasonably should know that the challenged discriminatory act has occurred.mcwilliams escambia county sch,cir.
determining the crucial issue of when the plaintiffs knew,or reasonably should have known that alcoa was engaged in impermissible racial discrimination so as to give rise to a cause of action under section,requires this court first to identify precisely the exact unlawful employment practice of which the plaintiffs complain.see delaware state college,d perez,at.two competing definitions of the relevant discriminatory act,or unlawful employment practice,have been suggested by the parties the discriminatory denial of promotions and assignment of workers to three s
