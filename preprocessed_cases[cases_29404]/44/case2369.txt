the underlying claim in this civil rights action,brought under,stems from the death of arthur partee during his arrest by two benton township michigan police officers,defendants tim sutherland and william bradshaw.his estate sued the officers,police chief jim coburn,and the township,alleging that partee death was caused by use of excessive force,in violation of his rights under the fourth amendment.the district court granted summary judgment to all defendants,finding as to the arresting officers that there had been no showing that partee had a clearly established right to freedom from the use of the vascular neck restraint or that the officers use of what is commonly called a choke hold was objectively unreasonable,and as to chief coburn and the township that the plaintiff had failed to make out a case of inadequate training.the plaintiff now appeals,but only as to the ruling on officer sutherland liability in this matter we find that there are material disputes of fact concerning the reasonableness of his action in subduing arthur partee,and we therefore conclude that summary judgment on the claim against sutherland must be reversed.
factual and procedural background 
up to a point,the facts in this case are not in dispute.the parties agree that the events that led to arthur partee death began with his mother trip to the benton township police department.because her son arthur had been acting strangely,ethel partee went there seeking advice about having him hospitalized.officer sutherland informed her that arthur partee could not be involuntarily committed for evaluation because he did not appear to be a danger to himself or others,but sutherland did check to see if there were any outstanding warrants for partee and discovered an outstanding traffic warrant for driving without a license.he then offered to arrest arthur partee on the warrant so that he could then be evaluated,and ethel partee agreed to this arrangement.she subsequently permitted defendants bradshaw and sutherland to enter the home she shared with her son.
when the officers arrived,arthur partee was sitting on a couch in front of the television.he continued to sit there passively while the officers informed him of the warrant and requested his date of birth.partee declined to provide his date of birth,protested that the warrant was not for him,and then turned his attention back to the television,ignoring the officers but not resisting them in any way.as he continued to sit staring at the television,one of the officers told him that it would be foolish for him to fight with them.the two officers then moved the coffee table from in front of the couch,which precipitated a struggle with partee,the details of which are outlined below.
at the end of the struggle,partee lay handcuffed and face down on the ground.his mother,having witnessed the entire interaction,realized that her son was in trouble at that point and implored the officers to help him.in response,they told her that partee was just faking and playing possum.the two officers finally turned partee over and slapped him in the face,attempting to get him to respond.when he did not,they removed his handcuffs and initiated cpr,but without success.by the time medics were called and arrived at the residence,partee was no longer breathing and had no detectable pulse.he was pronounced dead on arrival at a local hospital.
start,the medical examiner who performed partee autopsy,concluded that partee death was caused by a sphyxia associated with physical restraint.according to start,a person can become unconscious with significant pressure applied to the neck in seconds,and this pressure would need to be consistently applied for two to five minutes for death to result.another doctor,spitz,agreed with start that the cause of death was physical,the improper application of a neck restraint.spitz testified that in order to produce death,a neck restraint would need to be maintained for two to three minutes.
ethel partee version of events 
it is undisputed that arthur partee mother,ethel,was present during the entire interaction between the officers and her son and,indeed,needed to be told to get back at one point.according to officer bradshaw she was close enough to hand him the handcuffs during the struggle.hence,there is little doubt that ethel partee was in a position to witness what occurred leading up to her son fatal injury.
ethel partee testified that after the officers moved the coffee table that was in front of arthur,officer sutherland took his handcuffs out while arthur remained on the couch,leaning back but resisting only passively by tr ying to put his arm behind his back and refusing to help or cooperate in any way with the officers commands.she said that officer sutherland all of a sudden jumped on her son,put his arm around arthur neck,and began choking and wrestling him while officer bradshaw stood by watching.she described the struggle as continuing for a period of minutes,with her son crying for help before going limp.she said that officer sutherland threw arthur limp body onto the floor face down and both officers got on top of him to cuff him.she began screaming that he was dead,but the officers told her that he was just faking.when the officers turned arthur partee over and slapped him in the face he did not respond.
officer sutherland version of events 
officer sutherland testified that when arthur partee was told of the warrant and asked about his date of birth,he was initially unresponsive and simply ignored the officers,neither cooperating nor fighting with them.he said that partee remained withdrawn even after being told he was under arrest and ordered to stand up and be cuffed multiple times.then,according to sutherland,partee rushed towards him when sutherland took his handcuffs out but was immediately pushed back onto the couch.he said that both officers then struggled with partee,each one trying to grab an arm and cuff it while partee resisted by holding his arms close to his body and tried to get off the couch and get away.
resisting the officers,partee moved around on the couch,eventually rolling into a kneeling position with his torso leaning against the sofa and his arms tucked beneath his chest.in his handwritten report made within hours of the incident,sutherland explained that he and bradshaw struggled for several minutes with partee before they were finally able to handcuff him.sutherland added that a t one point during the struggle partee was able to unsnap one of sutherland two snaps that hold in his sidearm.however,the report did not mention the use of a neck restraint.instead,sutherland wrote,partee appeared to have some difficulty breathing and then just stopped breathing.
in his subsequent deposition,officer sutherland provided more detail.he said then that he had reached underneath partee,trying to grab his arm and pull it out to cuff it but that his own arm became pinned beneath partee body.while his arm was immobilized,sutherland said,he felt partee reach back with his left hand and reach for his holstered gun.officer sutherland testified that he both felt and saw partee hand on his holstered gun and that as partee pulled his arm back underneath his body,he unsnapped one or two snaps of the holster.fearing that partee was trying to pull his weapon out,officer sutherland said that he used a vascular neck restraint on partee to cut off the flow of oxygenated blood to his brain.after restraining partee for two or three seconds,sutherland said,he gained control of him and pulled him to the ground to be handcuffed.
according to sutherland deposition,once partee was cuffed,he stopped to catch his breath and did not try to talk to partee or to otherwise see if he was responsive.he said that bradshaw and a third officer named koza,who had arrived on the scene around the time partee was cuffed,lifted partee to his feet to take him to the squad car,but that partee was unable to stand on his own.although he noticed some blood on partee,officer sutherland did not observe anything else abnormal about him and still did not attempt to communicate with him.
sutherland said that when he did notice that partee breathing was deteriorating,he radioed for medics.he also agreed that partee should be uncuffed,and he went to get a cpr kit from his car,returning to find that partee was not breathing.he said that he initiated rescue breathing and,when he lost partee pulse,he performed full cpr.
officer bradshaw version of events 
according to officer bradshaw,sutherland instructed partee to stand up from the couch and place his hands behind his back,and in response partee stood up and lunged toward officer sutherland.partee was pushed back onto the couch and the officers struggled with him in an effort to cuff him.the struggle entailed t he resistance of partee keeping his arms underneath his torso area.
bradshaw testified that although he and sutherland did not communicate with each other during the struggle,he was in close proximity to his partner throughout it and was in a position to see everything that was going on.however,bradshaw testified that he did not see partee reach out to grab sutherland weapon or unsnap his holster.in fact,bradshaw did not see partee extend his hand at any time except for once when bradshaw forced it out from behind partee back to cuff it but was unable to do so.bradshaw did not hear sutherland say anything about partee reaching for his gun or anything else indicating that sutherland feared for his safety.
in his initial handwritten report made within hours of the incident,to mention use of a neck restraint rather,he simply stated that partee was then struggled to the floor.later,bradshaw admitted that he saw sutherland use the neck restraint on partee.he was unable to recall how long sutherland held partee in the choke hold but estimated that it was only a matter of a few seconds.during the period of time when sutherland was utilizing the neck restraint,bradshaw said,he himself remained on partee opposite side,trying to get an arm to cuff.the neck restraint caused partee to go limp,according to bradshaw,thereby enabling him to gain control of partee right arm and take him to the ground.
bradshaw further testified that when he and koza attempted to lift partee up,partee neither helped nor resisted,and bradshaw noticed partee breathing become faint.he said that when ammonia was placed under partee nose,he jerked back but then reverted to his previous state.he described how sutherland rubbed partee sternum,an action designed to cause a pain reaction and bring a subject out of unconsciousness,but partee did not respond.he indicated that attempts at cpr were equally unsuccessful.
the district court granted summary judgment for all defendants based on qualified immunity,concluding that t he use of the vascular neck restraint under the circumstances was not objectively unreasonable because t he undisputed facts of this case reveal that partee actively and physically resisted arrest and,i n addition,there is evidence that during the struggle partee reached for sutherland gun.given the startling discrepancies not only between the eyewitness testimony of partee mother,ethel partee,and that of the two officers,but also between the testimony of sutherland and bradshaw and between the officers testimony and the forensic evidence presented by the medical experts,we conclude that the district court reached this conclusion only by making wholesale credibility determinations in favor of a single witness,officer sutherland.at one point,for example,the district court said in its opinion granting summary judgment to the defendants,contrary to plaintiff assertions,the credibility of sutherland testimony regarding the unsnapping of his holster is not undermined by his written report created shortly after the incident.the district court also concluded that even if partee constitutional rights had been violated,they were not clearly established rights,holding that t here simply was no clearly established law prohibiting the use of the vascular neck restraint under the circumstances of this case.
discussion 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.see ciminillo streicher,cir.summary judgment is proper where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in reviewing the record the court must view the facts and any inferences reasonably drawn from them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.john hickey,cir citing matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.summary judgment is only appropriate if,viewing the facts and inferences in this light,evidence is so lacking that it would be impossible for a reasonable jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.id.quotation marks and citations omitted.
the plaintiff brought suit under,arguing that the defendant officers used excessive force against arthur partee in violation of his fourth amendment rights.to state a claim under,a plaintiff must set forth facts that,when construed favorably,establish the deprivation of a right secured by the constitution or laws of the united states caused by a person acting under the color of state law.sigley city of parma heights,cir citing west atkins,d additional citation omitted.even when a claim is stated,however,government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.
in saucier katz,the supreme court established a inquiry to determine an official entitlement to qualified immunity in the context of an excessive force claim.see,d.first,the court must determine whether,t aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury,the facts alleged show the officer conduct violated a constitutional right.id.at.if so,the court must then determine whether th at right was clearly established on a specific level.id.at.
the fourth amendment guarantees citizens the right to be secure in their persons and protects against unreasonable seizures of a person.const.amend.iv.to determine whether an officer use of force in effecting an arrest is excessive in violation of the fourth amendment,the court must apply an objective reasonableness standard.see graham connor,d.under this standard,the question is whether the officers actions are objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them,without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.id.at.citations omitted.the test is reasonableness at the moment of the use of force,as judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene,rather than with the vision of hindsight.id.at.citations omitted.
the reasonableness determination requires a careful balancing of the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual fourth amendment interests against the countervailing governmental interests at stake.id.at.quotation marks and citations omitted.the individual interest in not having the particular force used against them is weighed against the officers interest in performing these actions,as gauged by the severity of the crime at issue,whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others,and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.shreve jessamine county fiscal court,cir quoting graham,at.though these factors are important,they are not exhaustive,as the court must ultimately determine whether the totality of the circumstances justifies a particular sort of seizure.john,at quoting tennessee garner,d.
because determining reasonableness in this context is such a endeavor,summary judgment is improper if the legal question of immunity turns on which version of the facts is accepted,because then the reasonableness of the use of force is the linchpin of the case.sova city of pleasant,cir citing brandenburg cureton,cir see also cureton,at finding summary judgment inappropriate where detective claimed that weapon was pointed directly at us,presumably proving that he or any office
