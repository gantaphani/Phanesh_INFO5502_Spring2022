on remand,the district court held it could not provide the government with a reversionary interest in the future care award that would comply with both the ftca and california law.the united states appeals.for the reasons set forth within,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
we first briefly describe the proceedings resulting in our initial opinion in this case and then set forth those leading to the present appeal.
after the negligence of government doctors in california caused significant and irreversible brain damage to,his parents,andrew and jennifer cibula,brought this ftca suit against the united states in the eastern district of virginia on behalf of themselves and following a bench trial,the district court found the united states liable for damages and awarded the cibulas for past care costs,for pain and suffering,for cibula pain and suffering,for lost future earnings,and,most relevant to this appeal,for future care costs.
in determining the amount of the future care award,the district court relied on the testimony of the cibulas expert,richard lurito,a economist,who had previously testified as an expert in more than cases.to calculate the cost of future care,lurito assumed that would live a normal life expectancy,which at the time of trial was an additional years.lurito based his calculations on the analysis of raphael minsky,another expert retained by the cibulas,as to the care and services would need over those years.at trial,lurito testified that a present value award of would allow if he earned four and a quarter percent after tax on his investment annually to reach into this pool of money,withdraw what he needs to pay for each of these medical care needs,and at the end of his expected life,there would be nothing left.this amount would allow to live at home,rather than the far less expensive figure necessary to fund his needs at a residential care facility.
lurito emphasized that his calculations took a conservative approach.he acknowledged that he did not consult any authorities on annuities and so did not know if considerably less funds would produce an income stream sufficient to meet all of future care needs.nevertheless,the district court relied on lurito testimony to conclude that a present value award of was the amount of money that is needed today,if invested prudently for the rest of life,to pay for the care that will need each year,such that no money will be left at the end of his normal life expectancy.
the united states argued that california law permitted it to retain a reversionary interest in this future care award.the district court rejected this argument because it concluded that virginia law governed and did not permit this remedy.applying virginia law,the district court ordered the future care award be placed in a trust for benefit to be established and managed by a guardian ad litem.
on appeal in cibula i,neither the united states nor the cibulas challenged the district court finding of liability,calculation of the present value of the future care damages,or placement of the calculated future care damages in a trust to be managed by a guardian ad litem.
however,the united states did challenge the district court refusal to create a reversionary trust.the united states contended that the district court should have applied california law and,pursuant to that state law,should have ordered the present value future care award be placed into a reversionary trust.the united states relied on section of the california civil procedure code.that statute accords any party in a medical malpractice action the right to elect that future damages be paid in whole or in part by periodic payments rather than by a payment if the award equals or exceeds fifty thousand dollars,a,and permits periodic payments other than those awarded for loss of future earnings to be subject to modification in the event of the plaintiff death.id.b,c salgado county of los angeles,cal th,d.
because courts can not subject the united states to continuing obligations like periodic payments,see,hull united states,cir,the government sought to pay the entire future care award as a lump sum into the trust created by the district court but retain a reversionary interest in any funds remaining in trust at the time of death.such a remedy would make the entire future care award immediately available to trustee to invest and provide for him,but also ensure that the united states would receive any funds remaining in the trust at the time of death.the government contended that in this way its proposal would properly approximate the periodic payment scheme available under california law.
we agreed with the government that the district court erred by not applying california law.accordingly,we remanded the case,instructing the district court to apply california law and craft a remedy that holds the government liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.cibula i,at quoting.
on remand,the district court requested proposals from the cibulas and the government as to how it should craft a remedy consistent with california law.
the cibulas made two proposals.they proposed that the government pay not the present value future care damages award but the estimated gross costs of future care approximately into a reversionary trust to ensure that is sufficiently compensated.alternatively,they proposed that the united states pay only the present value award into a reversionary trust but remain liable to them for the estimated gross costs in the event the present value award proved insufficient.the district court rejected both proposals,holding the first placed too onerous a burden on the government in relation to a private defendant in like circumstances under california law,and the second imposed an impermissible continuing obligation on the united states.see cibula i,at noting the ftca has been interpreted to prohibit ongoing obligations against the united states.the cibulas do not challenge these holdings on appeal.
the united states proposed that it pay trust a lump sum payment equal to the future care costs awarded at trial,and retain a reversionary interest in that trust should not survive for his full life expectancy or if funds remain at the expiration of his life expectancy.the district court rejected that proposal,finding that it too failed to treat the united states sufficiently like a private defendant under california law because it risked underfunding future care.the district court based this finding on new evidence the cibulas introduced at a,hearing held in november.at that hearing a new expert retained by the cibulas,james koch,opined that the recent economic downturn made unattainable the conservative after tax discount rate of that lurito,the cibulas trial expert,calculated and the district court accepted in finding the present value award of as the amount necessary to pay for the care that will need each year in the future.
the district court concluded that it was unable to craft a suitable reversionary trust that reconciled the competing objectives of the ftca and california law.accordingly,the court ordered the present value future care award of be placed into a special needs trust fo
