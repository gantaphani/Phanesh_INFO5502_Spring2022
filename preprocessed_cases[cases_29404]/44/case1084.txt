in the midst of trial in the district court,the parties agreed to a settlement.regardless of the verdict,the bryan family was to receive at least.and regardless of the verdict,defendants cindy baxter and renie skalko were to pay no more than million.so when the jury returned an million verdict for the bryans,baxter and skalko tendered million and asked the bryans to end the action.the bryans refused.they asserted that baxter and skalko had breached the settlement agreement confidentiality clause and thereby rendered the deal unenforceable.the parties brought their dispute to the district court.but the district court refused to resolve it,reasoning that the court lacked the subject matter jurisdiction to decide whether to enforce the parties terms or the jury verdict.
the district court erred.the parties presented their dispute to the district court in order to bring the action to a close.the case had not been dismissed,nor had the jury verdict been marked satisfied.indeed,the action remained active and ongoing the parties continued to litigate the effect of the jury verdict up to and after taking this appeal.the case should have remained with the district court.ancillary jurisdiction exists,for example,for proceedings related to the enforcement of the judgment.similarly,the district court had jurisdiction to decide whether or not to enforce the parties settlement agreement.a district court jurisdiction does not terminate at the moment the jury deliberations do.
the parties raise two other matters that we do not decide the merits of the bryan family allegation that baxter and skalko breached the settlement agreement and baxter and skalko argument that the district court ought to have granted summary judgment in their favor.the district court has not had an opportunity to consider the first issue and baxter and skalko have not addressed the second issue in light of the trial record.accordingly,we remand for further proceedings before the district court.
