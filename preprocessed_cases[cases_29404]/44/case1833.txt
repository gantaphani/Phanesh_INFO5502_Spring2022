in her suit alleging she was harmed by a dangerous drug,sarah ratliff,instead of suing edsel stewart,the doctor who had prescribed the drug,sued lawrence stewart,his son and also a physician.the district court concluded that the plaintiff counsel conduct was totally without basis in law or fact and that plaintiff counsel unnecessarily and vexatiously multiplied the proceedings in this matter at the expense of defendant stewart.the court awarded stewart attorneys fees and expenses to be paid by ratliff counsel,who appeal,arguing that the court was without jurisdiction to make the award and that,in any case,it abused its discretion in finding them at fault.
because the district court had collateral jurisdiction and did not abuse its discretion,we affirm the jurisdictional ruling.because the court incorrectly assessed the amount owed,we vacate the award of and render judgment for.
in november,sarah ratliff sued drug companies and two doctors in mississippi state court over complications she claims she suffered from the prescription of stadol ns.on february,the pharmaceutical defendants removed the action to federal court,alleging that the two physicians had been fraudulently joined to defeat diversity.judge pickering was assigned the case.
at some point in late summer or early fall of,after removal,lawrence stewart was served with process.unfortunately,he was the wrong doctor.ratliff received the case on referral from louis,from the information sent with the referral,only that stewart in mccomb,mississippi,had prescribed the drug,and,without checking as to which stewart was being referred to,ratliff attorneys sued the wrong stewart,who was the correct stewart son.
stewart repeatedly informed plaintiff counsel,by telephone and in writing,that they had sued the wrong doctor.receiving no response,stewart filed an answer on september,and continued to argue to ratliff lawyers that he did not have any relevant information whatsoever,because he was not involved in the facts constituting the suit.ratliff attorneys,however,failed to reach ratliff to ask her to confirm or deny stewart protestations.
in the spring of,stewart moved to dismiss,or alternately for summary judgment,and requested attorneys fees.he attached an affidavit stating that his only patient with the name of sarah ratliff had never been him,at stadol ns and that,in fact,that person named sarah ratliff had told him she was not the sarah ratliff who was suing him.ratliff attorneys filed a response in opposition to stewart motion.
it was at that point,after the response in opposition had been filed,that ratliff attorneys asked ratliff whether they had sued the wrong doctor,and she confirmed that they had.that communication was about seven months after stewart was sued,notwithstanding his repeated remonstrances.ratliff attorneys error,but not until more than one month after they had learned from their client that they had incorrectly sued stewart.
according to letters dated in june and july,counsel for stewart wrote judge senter concerning attorneys fees after judge senter law clerk had contacted them to inform them that ratliff attorneys had confessed error in response to stewart motion to dismiss.on july,a magistrate judge granted ratliff motion to substitute parties on august,the case was formally reassigned to judge senter who on august dismissed with prejudice ratliff suit against stewart.the order of dismissal did not award attorneys fees or costs,though stewart had requested them.
the case was again reassigned on january,when it was given to judge starrett.evidently that change did not reach stewart,because on january,his counsel wrote judge senter another letter,again reminding him of the request for attorneys fees.that to the wrong addressed days after judge senter entered dismissal in favor of stewart.on march,after a settlement agreement had been reached in january of that year,judge starrett dismissed the case as to all defendants,with prejudice,with the parties to bear their own respective costs.
on july,judge senter,from whom the case had been reassigned in january of that year,sanctioned ratliff and her attorneys pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.ratliff counsel filed a motion to alter or amend that judgment,arguing that,among other things,the case had been assigned to judge starrett.on august,judge senter vacated his order.
on august,stewart filed a motion to consider the previously filed request for attorneys fees to judge starrett,who,on march,adopted judge senter rule opinion and award.ratliff counsel filed a motion to alter or amend that order and judgment on the ground,inter alia,that the requirement of rule had not been met because no separate motion had been made by stewart,meaning that rule c a was not satisfied,and because there was no show cause order by the court,meaning that rule c b was not satisfied either.on september,judge starrett agreed with ratliff attorneys as to rule but found that sanctions were appropriate against ratliff attorneys under 
determinations of subject matter jurisdiction are reviewed de novo.urban developers llc city of jackson,cir citing usx tanenbaum,cir.the imposition of sanctions pursuant to is reviewed for abuse of discretion.generally,an abuse of discretion only occurs where no reasonable person could take the view adopted by the trial court.dawson united states,cir quoting lorentzen anderson pest control,cir.a district court necessarily abuses its discretion if its ruling is based on an erroneous view of the relevant legal standards or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.whitehead food max,cir quoting cooter gell hartmarx,d.
the first question is whether the district court had jurisdiction to impose sanctions under more than a year after stewart had been formally dismissed from the case.ratliff attorneys argue that because the court entered a final judgment long before awarding attorneys fees,and because the court order did not reserve jurisdiction,the court was powerless to sanction them.
although the district court no longer had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the dispute the collateral jurisdiction doctrine permits courts to sanction lawyers,even after a final judgment on the underlying merits.it is well established that a federal court may consider collateral issues after an action is no longer pending thus,even years after the entry of a judgment on the merits a federal court c an consider an award of counsel fees.cooter gell,at.quoting white new hampshire dep t of employment,d.
in sprague ticonic national bank,the court held that,as part of its equitable powers,a federal court can grant one party the entire expenses of the litigation,id.at,even if it is after the end of the term at which the main decree was entered,id.at.sprague concerned the power of a federal court to award counsel fees pursuant to an application filed several years after the entry of a judgment on the merits.white,at.since we view the petition for reimbursement as an independent proceeding supplemental to the original proceeding and not a request for a modification of the original decree,the lower court invocation of the traditional equitable rule that a final decree in a suit in equity could be revised only during the term of court of its entry was inapt.sprague,at.the passage of time thus presented no bar to an award of fees.although sprague was decided under the rules of equity,the court suggested that the same result would follow under the new federal rules of civil procedure.white,at.citing sprague,at.
in white,the court again discussed the power of federal courts to award attorneys fees after the underlying dispute has already been decided.at issue was whether,under,a party could request fees beyond the time limit to alter or amend the judgment.fed civ.e.the court held that a request for attorney fees under raises legal issues collateral to the main cause of to which rule e was never intended to apply.white,at.thus,even though filed approximately four and months after the entry of a final judgment,the motion for fees was not untimely.id.at.
in cooter gell,at,the court held that district courts may enforce rule even after the plaintiff has filed a notice of voluntary dismissal under rule a.the court noted that t he district court jurisdiction,invoked by the filing of the underlying complaint,supports consideration of both the merits of the action and separately the motion for rule sanctions arising from that filing,and nothing in the language of rule a i,rule,or other statute or federal rule terminates a district court authority to impose sanctions after such a dismissal.id.the court upheld the sanction even though it was years after the hearing on the motion and after dismissal of the complaint that the district court ordered respondents to submit a statement of costs and attorney fees.id.at.
the reasoning in cooter gell is on point here.the court observed that l ike the imposition of costs,and attorney fees,the imposition of a rule sanction is not a judgment on the merits rather,it requires the determination of a collateral issue whether the attorney has abused the judicial process,and,if so,what sanction would be appropriate.id.at.such a determination may be made after the principal suit has been terminated.id.
moreover,the holding in cooter gell is more than just a statement of jurisdiction it also directly concerns the proper interpretation of rule substantive reach.baseless filing puts the machinery of justice in motion,burdening courts and individuals alike with needless expense and delay.even if the careless litigant quickly dismisses the action,the harm triggering rule concerns has already occurred.therefore,a litigant who violates rule merits sanctions even after a dismissal.id.at.
in willy coastal,d,the court went so far as to hold that a district court can constitutionally impose rule sanctions even in cases where it is later determined that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the underlying dispute the district court order is one that is collateral to the merits such an order implicates no constitutional concern because it does not signify a district court assessment of the legal merits of the complaint.it therefore does not raise the issue of a district court adjudicating the merits of a case or controversy over which it lacks jurisdiction.id.at.quoting cooter gell,at.
requests for attorneys fees and expenses under those under rule similarly part of a court collateral jurisdiction.in jackson marine harvey barge repair,cir,we stated that a request for fees under either rule or requires the district court to make a determination which is collateral to the merits of a claim.we held that,because of the collateral nature of requests under,the trial court was not precluded by.e from considering the issue of sanctions more than ten days after entry of final judgment on the merits.id.
these authorities amply demonstrate that it is within the constitutional power of the district court to award attorneys fees and costs,even though stewart already had been formally dismissed.likewise,though the court here used,and not rule,there is no reason why the substantive reach of is not also sufficiently extensive to apply where collateral jurisdiction is exercised especially given that text does not compel a contrary reading 
just as with rule,is concerned with baseless filings that burden courts and individuals alike with needless expense and delay,and a litigant who violates,like one who violates rule,merits sanctions even after a dismissal.cooter gell,at.therefore,a district court has available in its quiver where a party unreasonably and vexatiously multiplies judicial proceedings,even if the subject matter of the suit has already been decided,and,indeed,even if the court constitutionally lacks jurisdiction over the principal dispute.
ratliff attorneys incorrectly argue that the collateral jurisdiction of the district court was extinguished before the attorneys fees and costs were awarded.the authority is unambiguous on this point constitutionally,a party can obtain attorneys fees even where its application is filed several years after the entry of a judgment on the merits.white,at.citing sprague,at.thus,ratliff attorneys argument,to be successful,must be that the court collateral jurisdiction expired under the federal rules or some statute.as our discussion of cooter gell suggests,that is a steep hill to climb,and the cases offered by ratliff do not change the result.ratliff attorneys best case is thomas capital security services,cir,on reh g en banc,cir.there,we stated that because the motion requesting an award of attorney fees came after the plaintiffs had appealed the district court decision on the merits and the court denial of the motion came while the plaintiff appeal was pending before this court,the doctrine of collateral jurisdiction applies.id.at.from this,ratliff attorneys argue that the district court could award sanctions only because the federal courts were still considering the case.but,they argue,if the appellate process ends or the time to appeal has lapsed,collateral jurisdiction also ends.
we disagree.first,in thomas we did not explicitly set forth the rule that ratliff attorneys offer.though the proposed rule may be a possible implication that can be drawn from this language in thomas,it is not the only possible interpretation.we note,for instance,that unlike here where the fees were requested in the motion to dismiss,in thomas the request for fees came after the district court decision on the merits,and it could be that particular feature of the case that was being referenced.whether additional restrictions,under the federal rules,apply where attorneys fees are sought after the final judgment is rendered is not a question now before us likewise,thomas was decided before the supreme court shed light on the contours of the doctrine of collateral jurisdiction in cooter gell and willy.
the other cases relied on by ratliff attorneys are similarly unconvincing.they cite hertz alamo,cir,for the proposition that district courts have jurisdiction to consider sanctions after dismissal of the entire case only if a party timely files a rule e motion.given the decision in white,at,that rule e does not bar requests for attorneys fees under,it is not surprising that this is not actually what our sister circuit said.instead,the hertz court held that if a party moves for a dismissal without prejudice to be instead a dismissal with prejudice,so that the party can obtain attorneys fees under state law,the motion to alter or amend the judgment must comply with rule e.hertz,at.that this has nothing to do with the matter now before us needs no elaboration.
the decision in olcott delaware flood,cir,also does not support ratliff attorneys.that court stated that a punitive sanction may be enforced even absent subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.although,in the district court,in fact,had expressly retained jurisdiction so there was no final court of appeals stated that a district court retains jurisdiction to impose and enforce sanctions until the court enters a final judgment,id.at,that is not a holding.
in mints educational testing service,cir,the court addressed whether a district court retains jurisdiction to award attorneys fees for expenses incident to remanding a removed action to state court.id.at.the court noted that provides that an order remanding a case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses,including attorney fees,incurred as a result of the removal,and held,using cooter gell for guidance,that fees can be awarded.id.at.the court stated that it might be argued that by not limiting entry of an order for fees to the time the order for remand is entered we would leave an period for a party to move for fees after a remand.id.at.such a fear would not be well grounded,because.d b directs that unless otherwise provided by statute or order of the court,a motion for attorney fees must be filed and served not later than days after entry of judgment.id.
this statement in mints is also.most obviously,as observed in our discussion of thomas,in the instant case stewart moved for attorneys fees before the court had dismissed him,so we need not address whether rule d requirement that a motion be filed not later th
