the defendants timely appealed.they submit that grand claims were within the scope of the parties arbitration agreement and that arbitration of the claims against mccahill is not barred despite her status as a of the arbitration agreement.we agree and therefore reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings.
backgrounda.facts 
in september,grand and verizon entered into an exclusive authorized agency agreement for commercial mobile radio service agreement.the agreement authorized grand to act as a verizon sales agent within a defined geographic area.the agreement governed the business relationship between grand and verizon.it required grand to provide services exclusively for verizon by offering customers verizon services,such as sales,installation,warranty service and equipment maintenance.the agreement also addressed the relationship between grand,verizon and subscribers who purchased products and services through grand.on this point,the agreement provided that subscriber lists were the exclusive confidential property of verizon wireless.the agreement provided for an initial term of five years at that point,the agreement would continue on a basis,terminable by either party on thirty days written notice to the other.
the agreement contained a provision entitled,dispute resolution and arbitration.it stated,in pertinent part 
except to the extent explicitly provided below,any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement,or any prior or future agreement between the parties,shall be settled by arbitration administered by the american arbitration association aaa in accordance with the wireless industry association wia rules of the aaa,as modified below,and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
the subsequent paragraphs explicitly stated that the disputes not covered included several intellectual property issues,as well as s eeking to compel arbitration s eeking to confirm or challenge any arbitral award seeking judicial relief for breaches of sections and of the agreement and seeking emergency injunctive relief pending the appointment of arbitrators.provisions followed addressing the procedural aspects of commencing and conducting arbitration.
there is no dispute that,under the agreement,grand operated retail locations for verizon products and services beginning in until the term expired in september.the parties then continued their relationship on a basis until july,when verizon notified grand of its intent to terminate the relationship.verizon submits that at grand request,verizon extended the termination date to october,in order to g i ve grand additional time to attempt to sell certain of its stores to another verizon wireless agent.
in october,according to grand complaint 
verizon mailed an oversized by color postcard,featuring the picture of an attractive young woman,to the customers of eight remaining grand wireless stores,proclaiming that these grand wireless stores had closed.the mailing provided the customers with the address of the nearest competing verizon wireless store.
grand further alleged that mccahill had authorized the mailing and knew when the mailing went out that it was false.grand stated that it was,at the time of the mailing,in negotiations with another wireless provider,t mobile,to become an authorized t mobile agent.further,grand alleged that mccahill knew that the mailing would deal a body blow to grand wireless ability to continue in business as a t mobile outlet and that the mailing was a deliberate attempt to eliminate grand wireless as a competitor to nearby verizon stores.grand alleged that its t mobile venture failed and that it has since ceased operations.
procedural history 
grand initially filed the present action in massachusetts state court.its complaint alleged that mccahill had violated rico,et,by engag ing in a fraudulent scheme that used the united states mails to transmit false representations that grand wireless has closed,in violation of the federal mail fraud statute.it further alleged that both mccahill and verizon had violated a massachusetts statute prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices.finally,grand alleged that both mccahill and verizon had committed the torts of injurious falsehoods and intentional interference with an advantageous relationship.
the defendants removed the case to the district court,where verizon and mccahill moved to compel grand to arbitrate its claims.grand opposed the motion for arbitration.it submitted that the motion to compel arbitration should be denied for two reasons that its claims fell outside of the scope of the arbitration clause and that mccahill could not enforce the arbitration clause because she was not a party to the agreement.
before the deadline had passed for the defendants to file their reply brief,the district court denied the motion to compel.in ruling,the district court did not issue a written opinion instead,it simply issued an order stating,motion is denied.the court adopts plaintiff memorandum.so ordered.the defendants moved for reconsideration.the district court denied their motion in another order,stating,court has reconsidered defendants motion to compel arbitration and to dismiss complaint or stay action pending arbitration and again denies same.so ordered.the defendants then brought this timely appeal

here,the parties do not dispute the validity of the agreement arbitration clause.instead,they dispute whether grand claims are within the scope of the arbitration clause and whether mccahill is entitled to invoke the arbitration clause.we address each contention in turn.
scope of the arbitration clause 
we first address whether grand claims are within the scope of the arbitration clause.grand and verizon agreed to arbitrate any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to their agreement 
as we have noted earlier,the district court simply adopted grand memorandum.therefore,the district court necessarily took that document view that the agreement arbitration clause was narrow.such a construction,according to that memorandum,would limit application of the arbitration clause to battles over the agency agreement,to claims that require interpretation of the agreement terms the memorandum also asserted that narrow arbitration clauses are not entitled to a presumption of arbitrability.
in this appeal,grand takes the same position that it did in the district court.the defendants contend,however,that grand claims relate to the agreement because they involve matters that occurred during the course of the agency relationship.specifically,grand claims concern verizon right to contact freely its customers and verizon termination of its relationship with grand.the defendants also submit that the language of the arbitration clause is broad,and therefore the dispute is entitled to a presumption of arbitrability.
unless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise,at t,commc ns workers of,the court must resolve a disagreement among the parties as to whether an arbitration clause applies to a particular dispute,granite rock int l of teamsters.a court may order arbitration of a particular dispute only where the court is satisfied that the parties agreed to arbitrate that dispute.id.at.when deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter courts generally should apply ordinary principles that govern the formation of contracts.first options of,kaplan.we conduct our analysis with the federal policy in favor of arbitration in mind,such that,as with any other contract,the parties intentions control,but those intentions are generously construed as to issues of arbitrability.mitsubishi motors soler chrysler plymouth.at a minimum,this policy requires that ambiguities as to the scope of the arbitration clause itself must be resolved in favor of arbitration.powershare,syntel,cir alteration in original quoting volt info,bd.of trs.of leland stanford.this presumption in favor of arbitration applies unless the party opposing arbitration rebuts it.dialysis access,llc rms lifeline,cir paul revere variable annuity ins.kirschhofer,cir it is true that,generally speaking,the presumption in favor of arbitration applies to the resolution of scope questions.
to determine whether grand claims fall within the scope of the arbitration clause,we focus on the factual allegations underlying the claims in the c omplaint.dialysis access,llc,at.grand alleged that verizon false and deliberate misrepresentation to grand wireless customers that grand wireless had ceased to do business harmed grand grand made factual allegations regarding verizon termination of its relationship with grand.the complaint described the customer mailing and grand belief that verizon and mccahill knew that the mailing contained false information yet authorized its distribution in order to harm grand in a deliberate attempt to eliminate grand wireless as a competitor.
based on the allegations in grand complaint,resolution of this dispute will entail determining,at least,the status of grand and verizon relationship as of october,whether the customers contacted by verizon were customers of grand,the extent of verizon knowledge regarding grand transition of business to t mobile,and whether grand stores were,in fact,closed at the time of verizon mailing.these factual issues relate to the terms of the agreement or,at a minimum,to the relationship established between grand and verizon under the agreement.grand allegations about verizon termination of their business relationship may implicate extensive portions of the agreement concerning termination.other allegations may require consideration of the portions of the agreement regarding verizon rights with respect to customers obtained by grand.given that a number of factual disputes arising from grand claims likely will have to be resolved by reference to the agreement,it is clear that grand claims arise out of or relate to the agreement and therefore fall within the scope of the arbitration clause.
even were we less sure of the arbitration clause applicability to grand claims,we would apply the presumption of arbitrability here.see kirschhofer,at holding that the presumption of arbitrability is applied to scope questions that arise when the parties have a contract that provides for arbitration of some issues and it is unclear whether a specific dispute falls within that contract internal quotation marks omitted.this presumption is particularly appropriate where,as here,the arbitration clause is broadly worded.at t,at see also granite rock.at characterizing an arbitration clause that covered a ny claim,dispute,or controversy arising from or relating to the validity,enforceability,or scope of the entire agreement as broad emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.an order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.united steelworkers of am.warrior gulf navigation.thus,where the language of an arbitration clause is broad and i n the absence of any express provision excluding a particular grievance from arbitration,we think only the most forceful evidence of a purpose to exclude the claim from arbitration can prevail.at t,at quoting warrior gulf,at.
grand presents us with no such forceful evidence to rebut the presumption of arbitration.instead,it asks us to apply conventional contract interpretation.in its view,the language arising out of or relating to this agreement unambiguously limits the scope of arbitrable claims to those situations which depend for resolution on interpreting or applying some provision of the agency agreement.because no provision of the agency agreement controls,is implicated,needs to be read or sheds any light on the adjudication of grand mail fraud claim,grand submits,its claims are not within the scope of the arbitration clause 
we can not accept grand view.as we discussed previously,resolution of some of the issues raised by grand claims may well require resort to the agreement.moreover,grand attempt at rebutting the presumption of arbitrability needed to show that the parties intended to exclude this type of dispute from the scope of the arbitration clause,see at t,at,not merely that the arbitration clause lacked explicit language covering grand claims.contrary to grand view,where arbitration clauses included broad language requiring arbitration of disputes arising out of or relating to parties contracts,courts have found arbitration appropriate on a variety of claims similar to those presented here.see.express,mcmahon,holding that parties could be compelled to arbitrate rico claims relating to,inter alia,making false statements and omitting material facts where brokerage agreement stated,any controversy arising out of or relating to my accounts,to transactions with you for me or to this agreement or the breach thereof,shall be settled by arbitration internal quotation marks omitted,commercial union ins.gilbane,cir holding that defendant massachusetts unfair and deceptive trade practices counterclaim was subject to arbitration where clause covered a ll claims,disputes and other matters in question arising out of,or relating to this agreement or the breach thereof.
in sum,in adopting grand memorandum in opposition to the defendants motion to compel arbitration,the district court approved grand statement that verizon unambiguously restricted the arbitration clause to battles over the agency agreement,and,therefore,the presumption of arbitrability would not enter into play this conclusion is unsupported by the case law and the facts of this case.the broad language of the arbitration clause presented here encompasses the dispute described in grand complaint.
b.mccahill ability to invoke the arbitration clause 
the allegations against mccahill arise out of actions that she allegedly took as part of her employment by verizon.she therefore wants to avail herself of
