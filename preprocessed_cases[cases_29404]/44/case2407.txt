plaintiff,glenda churchwell,appeals an order of the united states district court for the western district of kentucky,granting summary judgment in favor of defendants,bluegrass marine,marquette transportation company,and motor vessel marie hendrick,and dismissing plaintiff claims of unseaworthiness in violation of general maritime law,and negligence in violation of the jones act.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the district court dismissal of plaintiff claims.
background 
plaintiff personal injury claims arise out of an accident that occurred aboard defendants ship,the marie hendrick,on may,where plaintiff was employed as a cook.plaintiff was cleaning the kitchen after having served the crew breakfast.she poured grease from a skillet into a coffee can.according to plaintiff,a crewman named larry had instructed her that the grease must be kept in the coffee can.plaintiff then picked up the coffee can to place it back in its corner.she picked up the can by its rim using her right hand and placing her thumb in the interior of the can while placing remainder of her hand on the outside of the can.apparently,the inside of the can was greasy,and the can slipped from plaintiff fingers.the can hit the counter and fell onto the floor.the grease,which was not hot,landed on the counter,plaintiff,and the smooth,solid floor mat on which plaintiff was standing.plaintiff took one step backwards and slipped in the grease on the floor.plaintiff sustained back injuries from her fall.
according to plaintiff,she would not have dropped the grease can if she had been allowed to place it in a container with handles,and she would not have slipped if the mat had contained holes to the grease.plaintiff obtained the services of huston an engineer,to support her argument that defendants failure to provide mats with holes grease mats and a container with a handle created a dangerous work environment.huston testified at his deposition that defendants should have placed a grease mat in the kitchen because spills in a kitchen are foreseeable and unavoidable.additionally,huston testified that defendants should have provided plaintiff with a grease container that had a handle.according to huston,grease containers with handles are commercially available.finally,huston testified that it was his opinion that defendants failure to provide grease mats and a container with a handle made plaintiff accident more likely.specifically,a container with a handle would have decreased the likelihood of spills and a grease mat would have substantially decreased the likelihood of accidents from spilled liquid by containing and diverting the liquid.
defendants moved in limine to exclude huston testimony.they argued that huston testimony improperly characterized their duties under the relevant law by implying that defendants had a duty to provide an work place.additionally,defendants argued that huston testimony that safer alternatives existed,the grease mat and container with handle,was irrelevant to the issues in this case.according to defendants,the existence of safer alternatives does not render the existing conditions unsafe.
that same day,defendants moved for summary judgment.defendants argued that the negligent manner in which plaintiff picked up the grease container was the sole cause of plaintiff injuries.defendants pointed to huston admission that if plaintiff had picked up the container with two hands or if she had placed the container on a tray to move it that she would have been less likely to drop it.thus,according to defendants,summary judgment was proper because defendants had not breached any duty by providing an unreasonably dangerous work environment and plaintiff own negligence was the proximate cause of her injuries rendering the primary duty rule a bar to plaintiff suit.
plaintiff eventually responded to defendants motion for summary judgment but failed to respond to their motion in limine.thus,the district court granted defendants motion in limine,holding that huston testimony that the marie hendrick kitchen was unreasonably dangerous was an inadmissible legal conclusion and huston testimony regarding safer alternatives to the grease can and slippery mats was irrelevant.the district court also granted defendants motion for summary judgment,holding that there was no evidence that defendants had breached their duty of ordinary prudence under the jones act or that the marie hendrick was unseaworthy.the court reasoned that no similar mishaps had occurred in the past,plaintiff failed to present evidence that the mats and grease container violated custom,and the danger from the grease was open and apparent.it further reasoned that plaintiff own negligence caused the accident.finally,the district court rejected plaintiff maintenance and cure claim on the ground that plaintiff was no longer capable of further recovery and any treatment would only serve to alleviate pain and suffering.plaintiff now appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants on her unseaworthiness and jones act claims but not on her maintenance and cure claim.
discussion 
the district court erred in granting defendants motion for summary judgment on plaintiff unseaworthiness and jones act claims.plaintiff presents sufficient evidence such that she could prevail on both claims at trial.moreover,contrary to defendants assertions,plaintiff own negligence does not provide an adequate basis on which to grant summary judgment.maritime law espouses a system of comparative negligence,in which a plaintiff own negligence does not bar recovery.the only exception to this rule is the primary duty doctrine,under which the employee responsible for maintaining safe conditions may not sue his employer for his own failure to maintain safe conditions.as the primary duty doctrine has no application in this case,plaintiff alleged negligence is not grounds for summary judgment.therefore,we reverse the order of the district court,granting summary judgment in favor of defendants.
standard of review 
this court reviews a district court order granting summary judgment de novo.rannals diamond jo casino,cir.summary judgment is only proper where the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in reviewing a grant of summary judgement,we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.rannals,at.in particular,when we review a grant of summary judgment involving claims under the jones act,we are mindful of the policy of providing expansive remedies for seamen who are injured while acting in the course of their employment and recognize that the submission of jones act claims to a jury requires a very low evidentiary threshold.id.internal quotations omitted.plaintiff must offer more than a scintilla of evidence in order to create a jury question on the issue but not much more.see aparicio norfolk ry,cir addressing a fela negligence claim.
huston testimony 
as a threshold matter,we note that we may not consider huston testimony in determining whether plaintiff demonstrates the existence of genuine issues of material fact.we conclude that we may not consider huston testimony because plaintiff failed to preserve its admissibility for this court review.the district court excluded huston testimony in response to defendants motion in limine.despite being given multiple opportunities in the district court to respond to defendants motion,plaintiff failed to oppose the motion.therefore,plaintiff failed to preserve this issue for our review,and we can not now disregard the district court order excluding huston testimony.barner pilkington,cir holding that a party must alert the trial court to the legal basis for the admission of evidence in order preserve the right to appeal the trial court exclusion of evidence.
plaintiff unseaworthiness claim 
the district court erred in granting defendants motion for summary judgment on plaintiff unseaworthiness claim because plaintiff offered sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to each element of her unseaworthiness claim.
a.the doctrine of seaworthiness 
a ship owner is strictly liable for personal injuries caused by his or her vessel unseaworthiness.mitchell trawler racer,d.a vessel is unseaworthy if the vessel and its appurtenances are not reasonably fit for their intended use.mitchell,at.defective gear,an unfit or understaffed crew,or the use of an improper method of storage or unloading cargo all render a vessel unseaworthy.morales city of galveston,d.even the misuse of properly functioning equipment may render a vessel unseaworthy if the misuse occurs at the direction of a superior.waldron lines,d citing crumady v.the joachim hendrik fisser,d.generally,unseaworthiness is a question of fact for the jury and should not be resolved by the district court as a matter of law.see cook american,cir citing roper united states,d,overruled on other grounds by joiner,d.
to prevail on an unseaworthiness claim,a plaintiff must establish that a vessel unseaworthy condition was the proximate cause of his or her injuries.miller am.president lines,cir.a vessel unseaworthiness is the proximate cause of a plaintiff injuries if it was a substantial factor in causing such injuries.id.at.in other words,unseaworthiness proximately causes an injury if it played a substantial part in bringing about or actually causing the injury and the injury was either a direct result or a reasonably probable consequence of unseaworthiness.id.quoting johnson offshore express,cir.
summary judgment was improper 
plaintiff testimony creates sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material facts as to both elements of an unseaworthiness claim the unseaworthy condition of the ship and proximate causation.
unseaworthy condition 
plaintiff testimony creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the absence of grease mats and a container with a handle rendered the marie hendrick unseaworthy.a vessel may be unseaworthy because it contains defective gear,is missing necessary gear,or because its crew is instructed to use unsafe work methods.morales,at.see waldron,at.holding that crew misuse of equipment pursuant to order rendered vessel unseaworthy.according to plaintiff deposition testimony,the kitchen did not contain grease mats or containers with handles,which are arguably necessary gear.additionally,plaintiff testified that she was instructed to pour grease into a coffee can,an arguably unsafe work method.although the admission of huston testimony undoubtedly would have strengthened plaintiff contention that these conditions rendered the marie hendrick unseaworthy,a jury does not need expert testimony to conclude that defendants failure to provide grease mats and a container with a handle rendered plaintiff work environment unsafe.these issues fall squarely within the type of knowledge that most persons obtain through everyday life experiences.butera district of columbia,applying district of columbia law dillingham ibp,cir applying kansas law corey,cir quoting charles alan wright victor james gold,federal practice and procedure on the other hand,expert testimony does not assist where the jury has no need for an opinion because it easily can be derived from common sense,common experience,the jury own perceptions,or simple logic.because reasonable people could disagree about whether the absence of grease mats and containers with handles rendered plaintiff work space unsafe,this issue should be submitted to the jury.see hatch durocher dock dredge,cir holding that where reasonable people applying the proper legal standard could disagree the claim should be submitted to the jury.
accordingly,we reject defendants argument that proof of a safer work environment or methods is inadmissible the federal rules of evidence require district courts to admit all relevant evidence unless such evidence is otherwise inadmissible.see.the rules define relevant evidence as evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable than it would be without the evidence.emphasis added.as the supreme court and this court have noted on numerous occasions,this standard of relevancy is liberal.daubert merrell dow,d hildebrand bd.of trustees of.state,cir.
we believe that evidence of a safer environment or method is relevant within the meaning of rule.plaintiff is suing defendants for failure to maintain safe working conditions and negligence and thus must demonstrate that defendants failed to exercise reasonable or ordinary care in outfitting the kitchen.typically,this involves a person giving attention both to possible dangers,mistakes and pitfalls and to ways of ensuring that these pitfalls do not materialize.black law dictionary ed defining care in the context of negligence.proof that a safer alternative existed makes it more probable that defendants failed to exercise reasonable care in outfitting the kitchen.
the advisory committee notes to rule,which precludes the introduction of subsequent remedial measures to prove negligence,provide an illustrative analogy.advisory committee notes.according to the advisory committee notes,evidence of subsequent remedial measures are excludable for policy reasons and not because such measures are irrelevant.id.the notes indicate that one could logically infer from a defendant decision to take subsequent remedial measures that defendant prior conduct or failure to take such measures was negligent.id.although plaintiff testimony in this case does not cover subsequent remedial measures,the implication from the advisory committee notes is nonetheless clear.evidence of an alternative to allegedly negligent conduct is relevant,and thus admissible,unless excluded by another rule of evidence for policy reasons.in this case,no such exclusionary rule exists.see generally.art.iv,relevancy and its limits containing no applicable exclusionary rule.
locke river lines,does contradict this holding.in locke,the district court determined that the existence of a safer docking procedure did not render the procedures used by the defendant negligent or unsafe.id.at.locke,however,addressed the sufficiency of evidence and not the admissibility of evidence.id.in locke the court admitted expert testimony regarding safer docking procedures but found that such testimony,alone,did not prove that the defendant method was unsafe.id.unlike in locke,the issue in this case is not whether evidence of a safer environment or measures alone proves that defendants were negligent,but rather whether such evidence makes it more probable that defendants were negligent.as discussed above,we believe that it does make it more probable that defendants were negligent.
finally,we also reject defendants argument that the marie hendrick was not unseaworthy because plaintiff had a safe alternative to grasping the coffee can with one hand she could have used two hands.defendants cite several cases from outside this circuit to support this argument.these cases are not on point,however,because the defendants in the cited cases all clearly met their duty of care.that is,in the cited cases there was nothing more that the defendants could have done to prevent the accidents and make the ship safer.see lyons ohio river sand and gravel,cir holding that the defendant was not negligent for sending one man to obtain a screen because it was unforeseeable that the screen would be buried under heavy objects that the plaintiff would choose to lift without asking for help when the general practice on the ship was to give assistance to others in such situations robinson zapata,cir holding that the ship was not unseaworthy for failing to provide the plaintiff welder with a clamp to secure a piece of metal where other existed to insure the metal held in place and the plaintiff,with knowledge of these methods,chose not to secure the metal fueston lykes.steamship.holding that a ship was not unseaworthy where the plaintiff slipped after choosing not to climb the ladder leading to top platform but and instead climbed a ladder and leaped to the top platform the accidents in these c
