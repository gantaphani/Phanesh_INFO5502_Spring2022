we granted an interlocutory appeal to resolve a choice of law issue under new jersey choice of law principles.we must determine whether the measure of damages in a survival action on behalf of a pennsylvania decedent,arising from a motor vehicle accident in new jersey allegedly caused by the negligence of a new jersey driver,is governed by new jersey or pennsylvania law.the district court concluded that new jersey law governed but stayed the case pending an interlocutory appeal.we will affirm the district court application of new jersey law and will remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual background and procedural history 
on september,daniel carson was driving his vehicle on route,white horse pike,in mullica township,new jersey.carson was accompanied by his fiancee,janet golanka.carson and golanka lived in bucks county,pennsylvania,and drove to new jersey for a shopping trip.during their journey,a vehicle driven by stephen cracker crossed the center line and hit the vehicle driven by carson.carson was killed and golonka sustained serious injuries.
jean lebegern is carson mother and the personal representative of his estate.she brought survival and wrongful death actions in federal district court in new jersey against cracker,glenn forman,michael weiss,kenneth albert,and good time cycles.forman is a licensed new jersey car dealer alleged to have been the owner of the vehicle operated by cracker.forman purchased the vehicle from weiss,who was purportedly acting at the behest of albert good times cycles.all of the defendants were residents of new jersey at the time of the accident.
count ii of lebegern amended complaint is a claim under the pennsylvania survival act.cracker filed a motion to dismiss count ii on the ground that the new jersey survival act,not the pennsylvania survival act,applies here.lebegern filed a cross motion for summary judgment asking the district court to find that pennsylvania law governs the survival claim.the district court granted cracker motion to dismiss,finding that new jersey law does apply 
the reason for the dispute over choice of law is that the new jersey survival act allows recovery only for the decedent pain and suffering,while the pennsylvania survival act also provides for recovery of net earning capacity.compare stat.ann.with.ann.and.ann.skoda penn power,

iii.discussion 
general choice of law principles in new jersey 
new jersey has a flexible approach to resolving choice of law questions that requires application of the law of the state with the greatest interest in resolving the particular issue gantes kason,veazey doremus.the restatement second of conflict of laws,which the new jersey supreme court has cited as guiding the choice of law determination,uses an approach.erny estate of merola,citing restatement second of conflict of laws.damages issues are included in the analysis,and the law that applies is based on the state with the dominant policy interest.id.to apply the analysis,it is necessary to analyze the purposes underlying the competing state laws.id.at citing restatement second of conflict of laws.there is a presumption that the law of the situs state applies.when another state has the more significant interest and the policies of the situs state will not be frustrated by the application of foreign law,however,the presumption can be overcome.id.at.
the test consists of two prongs.first,we must determine whether there is an actual conflict.gantes,at.if there is not an actual conflict,the inquiry is over and,because new jersey would apply its own law in such a case,a federal court sitting in diversity must do the same.see curtis bedwell sons,geppert,explaining false conflict situation citing gilbert spruance.mfrs.ass ins.the second prong of the test requires us to assess the interests each state has in applying its own law and determine which state has the most significant relationship to the parties and the event.fu fu.to effectuate this analysis,we identify the governmental policies underlying the law of each state and how those policies are affected by each state contacts to the litigation and the parties.veazey,at citing henry,cir.if the state concerns with the litigation and the parties are not directed at the policies involved in the case before the court,the state has no interest in applying its law.id.at.
new jersey has articulated five broad factors to aid courts in applying the test.erny,at.they include interstate comity,the interests of the parties,the interests underlying the substantive body of law,the interests of judicial administration,and the competing interests of the states.fu,at citing restatement second of conflict of laws cmt.b.the fifth factor is the most important.erny,at.
in addition to these general considerations,four contacts are most relevant to the test in cases based on an alleged tort the place where the injury occurred,the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred,the domicile,residence,nationality,place of incorporation,and place of business of the parties,and the place where the relationship,if any,between the parties is centered.fu,at citing restatement second of conflict of laws.
in personal injury cases,the place of the injury is important,and when both the conduct and the injury occur in the same place,that jurisdiction law generally will apply except in those rare instances where another jurisdiction has a demonstrably dominant interest and no policy of the situs state is frustrated by application of the sister state policy.

applying new jersey choice of law principles 
actual conflict 
under new jersey choice of law principles,we must first establish whether there is an actual conflict.we agree with the district court that there is.the new jersey survival act would allow lebegern to recover only for carson pain and suffering from the time of alleged negligence until death.stat.ann.pollock barrickman,explaining how new jersey courts have construed the new jersey survival act.in contrast,pennsylvania survival act permits the estate of the decedent to recover prospective net earnings as well as damages for pain and suffering.ann.ann.skoda,at.
our review of the jurisprudence in this area has uncovered a misconception by some courts of the proper way to conduct an analysis of whether there is an actual conflict of law under this two pronged approach.what some courts have described as a false conflict is the result of a policy analysis to determine which state has the more significant interest in applying its law,which precedes the examination of whether there is an actual conflict in the application of the laws.the better approach is to determine whether there is a conflict by examining the substance of the laws before assessing whether the states interests are actually furthered by application of the potentially applicable doctrines.t he initial step in questions is a determination of whether there is a distinction in the laws of particular jurisdictions.grossman club med sales,emphasis added.the competing states interests in the application of their laws are not assessed until after the basic conflict question is answered.id.at citing veazey,at.
in grossman,the new jersey superior court reversed a trial court choice of law determination after the superior court concluded that there was no conflict between the laws of the potentially interested jurisdictions.id.the court conducted its analysis by examining the substance of the potentially applicable laws to assess whether they mandated different outcomes.id.at.similarly,first in gantes and later in erny,the new jersey supreme court looked first to the substance of potentially applicable laws to conclude that actual conflict existed.in gantes,the question was whether the georgia or new jersey statute of limitations law should apply.at.the court quickly disposed of the conflicts prong of the governmental interest test by noting that there was an obvious and direct conflict between georgia statute of repose and new jersey statute of limitations.id.the erny court also concluded its conflicts analysis by a review of the substance of the laws.the court found that an actual conflict existed between new jersey and new york joint and several liability laws after explaining how applying one jurisdiction law over another would impact the outcome.at.it was not until the second prong of the governmental interest the interests of each the new jersey supreme court entered into an discussion of the impact of the respective states underlying policy goals and intent.id.at.
the district courts in our circuit are split in their determination of the choice of law issue in survival actions,as we have here.an examination of case law indicates,however,that the significant factor in the disagreement is the point in the analysis at which the court considers whether or not there is a conflict in the states interests.the cases,which have considered the second prong of the new jersey test the state interest before the first the existence of an actual conflict in the application of the laws have found at the outset no conflict of state interests.on this basis,they have applied the pennsylvania survival act.in pollock.at,the court found a false conflict because of the nature of the state interest pennsylvania had a strong interest in the administration of its decedents estates whereas new jersey had no interest in the administration of the estates of decedents.the court stated because we do not believe the survival act was enacted with resident defendants in mind,but only in the interests of resident decedents,we believe that the facts of this case present a false conflict.id.at.
as the above discussion of new jersey precedent shows,this formulation is technically inaccurate.while the district court in pollock was certainly within its purview to reach the issue of state interest,the determination of whether or not there is a conflict of states interests is properly understood as being a issue.grossman,at.the only other district court holding that pennsylvania survival act applied in this context also conducted an interests analysis.foster maldonado.see also mathis motley,applying pennsylvania law to an accident in florida between a new jersey defendant and a pennsylvania plaintiff.
on the other hand,the district courts to hold that new jersey law applied found a conflict in the respective survival acts and then a conflict in state interests.capone nadig,amoroso burdette tomlin mem l,cannon hilton hotels,applying pennsylvania choice of law rules to hold that new jersey survival act applied in case involving an accident in new jersey with new jersey resident defendants and a pennsylvania resident decedent colley harvey cedars marina.
because new jersey and pennsylvania survival laws differ on the scope of damages,there is a true conflict between the laws of each potentially interested jurisdiction.this,however,is only the first prong of the inquiry.it triggers the second part of the test,the determination of the policies underlying each state laws and whether those policies are implicated by applying the relevant state law to the particular issue.erny,at.
resolving the conflict finding the more interested state 
determining which state has the greater interest involves looking at each state contacts to the litigation and assessing the policies behind each state law.id.at.to facilitate this analysis,we can summarize the most relevant contacts as follows 
place where the injury occurred new jersey 
place where the conduct causing the injury occurred new jersey 
domicile and residence of the parties 
a plaintiff pennsylvania 
b defendants new jersey 
as mentioned above,when both the place of injury and the conduct causing the injury are the same,the general approach is to apply the law of the jurisdiction where the injury occurred.id.at citing restatement second of conflict of laws cmt.e cmts.c and d.
having identified the most relevant contacts,it is necessary to determine which state has the most significant relationship to the occurrence and parties.id.at.evaluating the competing interests of the states is the most important aspect of the analysis used in determining the jurisdiction with the most significant relationship.id.at.pennsylvania has a strong and clear interest in providing full recovery in survival actions.the pennsylvania supreme court has said that,when it is the domicile of the decedent and his family,the state is vitally concerned with the administration of the decedent estate and the of the surviving dependents to the extent of granting full recovery,including expected earnings.griffith united air lines.the federal courts faced with choice of law issues in this context have all recognized pennsylvania important interest in securing an adequate recovery,amoroso.at.
the majority of federal courts to address the issue have held that new jersey also has an interest in applying its survival act under these circumstances because it would limit new jersey defendants exposure to damage awards,capone.at.i concur with the vast majority of cases in finding that,the new jersey legislature,in providing for such limited recovery under the survival act,was expressing its interest in protecting new jersey defendants.quoting mathis motley.in discussing a choice of law issue involving new jersey wrongful death statute,we stated that i nasmuch as the statute sets forth the type of damages that may be recovered in a wrongful death action,it reflects the new jersey legislature determination both of what is fair for a plaintiff to recover and a defendant to pay in such a case.petrella,at.the principle,observed in petrella,that when a statute details the nature and extent of damages recoverable in a wrongful death action,it reflects the legislature concern for both plaintiffs and defendants,applies here as though this case is addressed under the new jersey survival act.
to the extent that the purposes behind the new jersey survival act have been discussed,it appears that the act was part of a comprehensive scheme of recovery to work in concert with the wrongful death act to ensure proper redress by next of kin and the estate of the deceased following a tort leading to death.see smith whitaker.however,the interests of defendants appear also to be a concern of the new jersey legislature because the survival act was structured to avoid allowing multiple recoveries for the same loss.alfone,at.when a legislature creates such a damages scheme,it is considering the interests of both those who receive and those who pay.thus,we conclude that one of the purposes of the survival act was to protect defendants.see petrella,at alfone sarno,noting strong policy against recovery of duplicate damages under new jersey wrongful death and survival acts 
pennsylvania,on one hand,has expressed a strong interest in affording recovery to plaintiffs in survival act cases involving a pennsylvania decedent.new jersey,on the other hand,has an interest in protecting both new jersey plaintiffs and new jersey defendants by applying its survival act in the context of the broader new jersey remedial scheme.see smith,at.in this case,each state interests would be furthered by application of its law because there is a pennsylvania decedent and new jersey defendants.as discussed,new jersey permits plaintiffs to recover loss of support determined in part by expected earnings in wrongful death claims.id.at the amount of recovery is based upon the contributions,reduced to monetary terms,which the decedent might reasonably have been expected to make to his or her survivors.lost earnings,however,are not cognizable in new jersey survival act cases.pollock.at.pennsylvania,on the
