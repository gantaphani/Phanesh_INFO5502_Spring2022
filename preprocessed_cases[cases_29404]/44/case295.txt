brandon blair and richard tousignant plaintiffs appeal the district court dismissal of two separate actions in favor of defendants city of worcester,massachusetts city,former worcester chief of police james gallagher,and worcester police officers daniel dowd,thomas dowd,thomas duffy,falcone,edward mcginn,james moore,jose ortiz,jonathan thomas,and peter towler collectively,defendants the plaintiffs,in separate complaints that were later consolidated,alleged that they were attacked and beaten by worcester police officers,for which they sought recovery against the defendants under myriad legal theories.in an initial action,the district court granted the defendants motions to dismiss,without prejudice,for failure to perfect service of process.after the plaintiffs refiled their claims in a second action,the district court granted the defendant officers motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim,holding that the matter was.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
the record facts of this case,at least those relevant to the instant appeal,are not in material dispute.on december,the plaintiffs were involved in an altercation with several of the defendant officers.as a result of this incident,criminal charges were brought against the plaintiffs.at the conclusion of a jury trial,both plaintiffs were acquitted.shortly thereafter,on august,the plaintiffs,represented by theodore harris,filed separate complaints in federal district court,alleging various claims based on their purported mistreatment at the hands of the defendants.on september,donald rider,an attorney for the city,notified chief gallagher and officers daniel dowd,thomas dowd,duffy,patricia falcone mcginn,moore,ortiz,thomas,and towler that two civil rights lawsuits were pending against them in federal district court indicated that he would handle the lawsuits and requested that they inform him if served with process.the record does not reveal how rider learned of the lawsuits,although the plaintiffs introduced as evidence a copy of a newspaper article,dated august,describing the action,which might have been the source of his knowledge.subsequently,on november,deputy sheriff ronald richard attempted service upon officers daniel dowd,thomas dowd,duffy,mcginn,moore,ortiz,and towler by leaving copies of the summonses and the original complaints with an individual named katherine mcnamara,a principal clerk at the police department.these returns of service were filed with the district court on december.no returns of service were filed for the city,chief gallagher,officer thomas,or officer falcone.
on january,days after the plaintiffs last action in the case,the district court mailed to harris a notice indicating that because the case had been inactive more than one year,it would be dismissed in thirty days pursuant to local rule unless the plaintiffs took appropriate action.blair and tousignant learned of the notice,which was entered on the docket,and chose to retain different counsel.on february,attorney stephen campobasso filed an appearance on behalf of the plaintiffs and submitted motions requesting that the cases not be dismissed,which were granted.harris withdrew as counsel of record on march,and he was subsequently suspended from the practice of law for a period of eighteen months for reasons that are not apparent on the face of the record.
on april,campobasso filed amended complaints on the plaintiffs behalf.on june,campobasso obtained a summons for chief gallagher,which was then served,via a purported agent named jennifer tauper,and a return of service was subsequently filed with the court on july.the record discloses that,on august,campobasso sent a letter to attorney rider,to which copies of a summons and an amended complaint were apparently appended,in the apparent expectation that rider would assist in service of the summons and then return it to him.no copy of the attachment is in the record.on november,campobasso sent correspondence,apparently due to his concern regarding rider silence.on december,campobasso directed yet another letter to rider,requesting his assistance in getting the summonses filed with the court.he mentioned that his clients were growing uneasy regarding the lack of activity in the case.unfortunately,the record does not explicate which defendant or defendants campobasso sought to serve in this manner.regardless,campobasso efforts,which might have been an attempt to obtain waiver of personal service under rule d,were apparently,in any event,the plaintiffs do not rely on this set of correspondence in any of their claims of error.
campobasso took no further record action in the case and committed suicide in february.on april,jo ann citron and michael altman appeared on behalf of the plaintiffs as the third set of counsel of record.proceeding expeditiously thereafter,on april,the plaintiffs filed a motion for default judgment against the defendants.in response,the defendants moved to dismiss the plaintiffs claims,arguing that the plaintiffs had failed to effect personal service of process upon them.the defendants attached an affidavit from mcnamara stating that she was not authorized to accept service for the defendant officers.likewise,officer thomas dowd submitted an affidavit indicating that he had not appointed mcnamara as his agent for receiving service of process.
in response,the plaintiffs offered evidence purporting to show that mcnamara had actual and apparent authority to accept process on behalf of the defendant officers,requested leave to conduct additional discovery to prove this agency relationship,and argued that even if no agency relationship existed,the district court should extend the time to serve the defendants.on march,the district court issued an opinion denying the plaintiffs relief and granting the defendants motions to dismiss,without prejudice.the plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal on april,but subsequently requested and received a stay during the pendency of the action described below.
on june,the plaintiffs initiated a new action in federal district court,based on the same underlying conduct,seeking similar relief as before,asserting that the massachusetts renewal statute revived their otherwise claims.the district court,based on its construction of the renewal statute,rejected the plaintiffs contentions and dismissed the case.again,the plaintiffs appealed the two appeals have since been consolidated.
ii.analysis 
effect of the amended complaints 
the defendants argue that the filing of the april,amended complaints makes irrelevant any service of process,whether effective or not,that was performed in this case in relation to the original complaints.on the defendants theory,the amended being filed,and whether or not properly the original complaint,and made it no longer available as a basis for pursuing this case.under federal rule of civil procedure a,an amended complaint stating a new claim must be served on defendants,such as those here,who have failed to appear.the defendants argue that because the original complaint was superseded and the amended complaint was never served,dismissal of the suit for insufficient service of process was proper.
there are two flaws with the defendants theory.first,it is doubtful that the unserved amended complaint in fact superseded the original complaint.see anunciation capital fin.servs,table,wl,at cir,unpublished int l controls vesco,cir.second,the amended complaint did not in fact contain a new claim for relief,and therefore did not require service under rule a.the defendants are correct that the original complaint contained a statement indicating that either count nine or count,precisely,is subject to a presentment requirement,and that an amended complaint would be filed in the future to actually urge the claim following satisfaction of the presentment requirement.
dismissal on this basis would exalt form over substance because the original and amended complaints are substantively identical.rule a ensures that a party,having been served,is able make an informed decision not to answer a complaint without fearing additional exposure to liability for claims raised only in subsequent complaints that are never served.here,we have no doubt that the original complaints provided the defendants with fair notice that the plaintiffs sought recovery on both count nine and count ten.see of,cir.it is not as if satisfaction of the presentment requirement were somehow in statement revealed that notice of the claim had already been provided,and the silence of the government agency is sufficient compliance with the statute.see.laws ch.
moreover,the factual predicate for the plaintiffs claims did not change at all.see rullan,cir explaining that fair notice is provided where a complaint explains who did what to whom,when,where,and why citations omitted potter,cir indicating that a complaint may sufficiently raise a claim even if it points to no legal theory or the wrong legal theory citation omitted denovellis shalala,cir holding that a complaint need not clearly articulate the precise legal theories to provide fair notice.thus,because the amended complaints did not urge any new,substantive claims against any of the defendants,additional service of process was not required see.a accord gilles united states,cir explaining that dismissal based on improper service of an amended complaint is inappropriate so long as the amended complaint relates back under rule c to a prior,properly served complaint.
denial of discovery and an evidentiary hearing 
the district court dismissed the plaintiffs original action for insufficient service of process under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure.the plaintiffs do not argue that the existing record substantiates that they provided adequate service of process to any of the defendants.rather,they contend that the district court erred by denying their request for limited discovery and an evidentiary hearing for the purpose of determining whether mcnamara was authorized to accept service of process for the defendant officers.in relevant part,rule e of the federal rules permits a plaintiff to effect service by delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to an agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process.e c.this action was brought in a federal district court located in massachusetts,and service was attempted in massachusetts therefore,the plaintiffs were also permitted to serve the defendants in accordance with massachusetts state law.e.massachusetts likewise allows a plaintiff to effect service u pon an individual by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to an agent authorized by appointment or by statute to receive service of process.civ.d.the district court declined the plaintiffs requests for discovery and an evidentiary hearing based on its determination that they were merely grasp ing at straws without any realistic prospect of success.blair city of worcester,wl,at.
a district court generally retains broad discretion in determining whether to grant jurisdictional discovery.united states swiss am.bank,cir citation omitted.accordingly,t he standard for reversing a district court decision to disallow jurisdictional discovery is high.id.to obtain relief,the aggrieved party must show that the lower court discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice.id.citation omitted 
in contrast,the threshold showing that a plaintiff must present to the district court to merit limited discovery is relatively low.see surpitski,cir per curiam explaining that a party should be allowed to conduct jurisdictional discovery when its position is not frivolous see generally swiss am.bank,at as a general matter,discovery should be freely permitted internal quotation marks omitted quoting edmond postal serv.counsel.moreover,factual disputes regarding agency should typically be resolved only after a live hearing,see municipality of dorado,cir,in order to explore issues of credibility and resolve unanswered questions implicated by the parties briefing.pavia,cir.indeed,we may find an abuse of discretion even where the lower court decision is by no means wholly unsupported by the record.id.thus,where a plaintiff can demonstrate the existence of a plausible factual disagreement or ambiguity,our jurisprudence favors permitting the litigants the opportunity to flesh out the record.see id.
here,the returns of service executed by deputy richard state,in relevant part 
i hereby certify and return that on at am i served a true and attested copy of the summons,complaint and jury demand in this action in the following manner to wit,by delivering in hand to katherin sic mcnamara,agent,person in charge at the time of service for the defendant officer at worcester police department,lincoln sq,worcester,ma.
as the defendants point out,the language of the returns seems designed to indicate both service of an agent under.e and.civ.d,and service of a person in charge of a business under.civ.d,which provides one method for the service of corporations and unincorporated associations.quite obviously.civ.d is completely inapplicable to service of the defendant officers in their individual capacities.
a return of service generally serves as prima facie evidence that service was validly performed.see,cir curley radow,wl,at.july,johnson witkowski.whether or not this return of service qualifies as such evidence,the defendants have adduced sufficient rebuttal evidence to refute any presumption of valid service.in an affidavit,mcnamara stated that 
i have not been authorized or appointed by peter towler,thomas dowd,daniel dowd,thomas duffy,edward mcginn,james moore,or jose ortiz to accept service of process on their behalf for lawsuits in which they are being sued,whether in their individual capacity or their official capacity,and i was not so authorized or appointed by them in november.
thus,mcnamara specifically denied being appointed an agent by any of the defendant officers for whom returns of service were filed.additionally,officer thomas dowd provided an affidavit denying that he had authorized any individual or entity to accept service of process on my behalf.
under massachusetts law,an affidavit is sufficient to refute the prima facie presumption created by a return of service.see konan carroll,citing farley sprague,see also maniscaclo kenworthy,table,wl,at,per curiam where,as here,the affidavit is uncontradicted other than by the deputy return,the affidavit controls.similarly,federal courts have held that an affidavit denying agency,standing alone,may be sufficient to overcome the presumption of proper service created by the return of service.see hornick trucking,metropolitan theatre warner.pictures,puett starting gate thistle down,see also ellibee leonard,cir per curiam unpublished holding averments of defendants sufficient to refute agency relationship gottlieb sandia am,cir stating that although a marshal return is not conclusive on the question of service on an agent,it will stand in the absence of proof to the contrary.
hence,the defendants effectively rebutted any presumption that might have arisen from the returns of service executed by deputy richard.at that point,the ultimate burden of proving proper service returned to the plaintiffs.see,at indicating that,once challenged,plaintiffs have the burden of proving proper service.we emphasize,however,that the real issue at hand is not whether the plaintiffs proved merely whether they adduced sufficient evidence to warrant limited discovery and an evidentiary hearing.see id.
the plaintiffs have mustered,the second affidavit of theresa labriola one of their attorneys,a document known as worcester police policy and procedure policy,and returns of service for officers daniel dowd,thomas dowd,duffy,mcginn,moore,ortiz,and towler in a different refute mcnamara and officer thomas dowd affidavits.we examine each of these items in turn.
first,we address the labriola affidavit.in the affidavit,labriola indicates that deputy richard informed her that he had served worcester police officers hundreds of times in the past by leaving copies of the complaint and summons at the office of the chief of police,as he did here.at some point,he was supposedly informed that the chief office would no l
