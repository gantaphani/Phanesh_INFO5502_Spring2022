defendant metropolitan transportation authority mta or the authority appeals pursuant to b from an interlocutory order of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,leonard wexler,judge,denying its motion for summary judgment dismissing the personal injury claims asserted against it by its employee sean greene under the federal employers liability act,fela or the act.in an opinion reported at d,the district court denied the motion on the ground that,as owner and operator of defendant long island railroad company lirr,which mta acknowledges is a railroad engaged in interstate commerce,mta is a common carrier by railroad within the meaning of the act.on appeal,mta contends that the railroad is operated only by lirr,not mta,and that the district court ruling was thus erroneous.for the reasons that follow,we disagree and affirm the order of the district court.
background 
the following facts,along with others discussed in part.below,do not appear to be in dispute.mta is a public benefit corporation created by the new york state public authorities law public authorities law.see pub.auth,mckinney.the public authorities law describes mta responsibilities as including 
the continuance,further development and improvement of commuter transportation and other services related thereto within the metropolitan commuter transportation district,including but not limited to such transportation by railroad,omnibus,marine and air,in accordance with the provisions of this title.
id.emphasis added.with exceptions not pertinent here,mta is given the power to acquire any transportation facility,id,and,inter alia,to operate,maintain,renovate,improve,or repair such a facility and lease railroad cars for use in its passenger service,id.and.mta may levy and collect fares,and it may establish schedules,standards of operation,and public safety rules and regulations as necessary for the use and operation of any transportation facility.id.mta may exercise these powers itself or it may cause one or more of its powers to be exercised or performed by one or more wholly owned subsidiary corporations.id.mta wholly owns two subsidiaries that are commuter railroads lirr and commuter railroad company.
prior to,lirr maintained its own police force.greene was employed by lirr as a police officer from april through december.his duties consisted principally of conducting surveillance at parking lots at railroad stations maintained by lirr,in order to detect and deter thefts of and robberies from parked vehicles.in,the public authorities law authorized mta to provide and maintain a police department for all mta affiliates,including lirr.see id.pursuant to this provision,mta consolidated police services effective january,forming the mtapd,and all lirr police officers became mta employees,see id.initial appointments to mta police force to be all incumbent police officers from lirr.on that date,as a result,greene became an mta employee and was no longer an employee of lirr.greene was assigned to mtapd auto crime unit his duties as an mta police officer continued to consist primarily of surveilling lirr parking lots.
the present action arises out of a vehicular accident that occurred while greene was on duty on march.greene and fellow officer john wyckoff were dispatched by a radio operator to respond to a report of car theft at the lirr station in ronkonkoma,new york.the officers proceeded in a jeep,driven by wyckoff,which was owned by lirr lirr jeep.en route to the ronkonkoma station,the lirr jeep collided with a car driven by defendant barbara arias and owned by defendant thelma schulman.greene alleges that the collision caused him disabling injuries in addition to asserting claims against arias and schulman,he asserts claims against mta pursuant to fela and against lirr pursuant to fela and state law.the complaint alleges that mta was negligent in failing to provide greene with safe working conditions,including by failing to equip the jeep with a siren and adequate emergency lights and flashers in operating the vehicle in such a negligent manner as to cause an accident and in failing to enact or enforce safety rules for personnel in greene workplace.
following discovery,mta and lirr jointly moved for partial summary judgment dismissing the claims asserted against them under fela.while conceding that lirr is a railroad engaged in interstate commerce,they argued principally a that lirr could not be held liable under fela because at the time of the accident it was not greene employer,and b that mta could not be held liable under fela because it is not a common carrier by railroad within the meaning of the act.mta argued that lirr operates its own transportation facilities and that mta involvement with lirr is limited to indirect support functions such as coordinat ing the planning and overall policies of its agencies,approv ing operating and capital budgets and performance plans,and monitor ing financial and operating activities,greene long island,d at quoting mta letter to united states railroad retirement board dated december,at alterations ours see also mta memorandum of law in support of motion for reconsideration at.
the district court denied the motion.finding that it is not the corporate form of the entity that is dispositive in determining whether a defendant is a common carrier,d at,the court reviewed both mta functions and mta public characterizations of its role in railroad operations.the court noted that the legislation creating mta charges it with the continuance,further development and improvement of commuter transportation and other services related thereto,d at quoting pub.auth,and that 
t o these ends,the mta has broad powers including the power to 
acquire transportation facilities 
establish,construct,effectuate,operate,maintain,renovate,improve,extend or repair any facility acquired 
establish and collect fares and tolls 
establish standards of operation and rules and regulations regarding the conduct and safety of the public 
lease railroad cars for use in passenger service and,
do all things it deems necessary,convenient or desirable to manage,control and direct the maintenance and operation of transportation facilities,equipment or real property operated by or under contract,lease or other arrangement with mta.
d at.the court observed that 
mta refers to itself as the largest public transportation provider in the western hemisphere.cfo letter of transmittal dated march,comprehensive annual financial report of mta for year ended december.
d at.further,
w hen describing its functions,the mta states that it coordinates the planning and overall policies of its agencies,approves operating and capital budgets and performance plans,and monitors financial and operating activities of its agencies.the mta also states that it is responsible for certain cross agency support functions.the mta characterizes its subsidiary agencies,including its commuter rails as serv ing the public by operating the transportation facilities.letter dated december,from mta to general counsel,railroad retirement board 
while the mta component units are certainly responsible for providing transportation services,the mta itself is intimately involved in the management,not only of its subsidiaries finances,but of their real estate and other assets.thus,the mta states that the careful management of its real estate assets has included a leaseback transaction for the lirr hillside maintenance facility,where lirr trains are repaired and maintained,which transaction produced approximately million in capital funds for the mta.funds so obtained,along with other mta funds are used,inter alia,for repairing and upgrading railroad infrastructure,building new facilities and buying new equipment.
the mta has significant involvement in the marketing of the transportation services available through its subsidiary and component units.the mta website refers to all transportation facilities including the lirr as part of the network of mta services.riders are referred to as mta customers.among other things,the mta takes credit for offer ing the region efficient,environmentally sound travel alternatives.
d at.the court concluded that by virtue of its extensive involvement in lirr activities,mta operates a common carrier according to the plain meaning of that word,and that suit against mta under fela is permissible because greene is no less employed by a common carrier today than when he performed the same duties when employed by the lirr.id.at.
the court cautioned that its holding that mta may be sued under fela is limited to those employees of mta who are engaged in the interstate common carrier operations of its commuter rails,and does not extend to workers who are employed strictly in mta intrastate operations or its nonrail operations,such as employees of the new york city transit authority or the triborough bridge and tunnel authority.id.at the mere interconnectedness of these entities through mta does not transform those entities into common carriers engaged in interstate commerce.
finding that its denial of summary judgment for mta involve d a controlling question of law concerning the mta status under fela and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of this litigation,the district court certified the issue of whether mta is a common carrier for interlocutory appeal.see order of certification,august,at.this court granted mta motion for leave to appeal pursuant to b.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,mta argues that it can not be considered a common carrier for purposes of fela because,rather than operating a railroad,it is only involv ed in the performance of certain marketing,financial and real estate management functions for lirr.mta brief on appeal at.for the reasons that follow,we disagree.
a.the scope of fela 
fela,which is a broad remedial statute whose objective is to provide a federal remedy for railroad workers who suffer personal injuries as a result of the negligence of their employer,and which is to be liberal ly constr ued to achieve that objective,atchison,topeka santa fe ry.buell,d internal quotation marks omitted,provides,in part,that 
e very common carrier by railroad while engaging in interstate or foreign commerce shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers,agents,or employees of such carrier,or by reason of any defect or insufficiency,due to its negligence,in its cars,engines,appliances,machinery,track,roadbed,works,boats,wharves,or other equipment.
as amended in,this provision covers 
a ny employee of a carrier,any part of whose duties as such employee shall be the furtherance of interstate or foreign commerce or shall,in any way directly or closely and substantially,affect such commerce.
id.the test for coverage under the amendment is not whether the employee is engaged in transportation,but rather whether what he does in any way furthers or substantially affects transportation.reed pennsylvania.nor are the benefits of the act limited to those exposed to the special hazards of the railroad industry.id.at.see id.at.clerical employee in charge of filing tracings of railroad cars,engines,and tracks,inter alia,injured when a cracked window pane in her office blew in,was covered by fela.
fela defines the term common carrier to include the receiver or receivers or other persons or corporations charged with the duty of the management and operation of the business of a common carrier.id.the term is not otherwise defined,and most of the pertinent cases construing the applicability of fela,or of analogous federal statutes,to a given employer have been concerned with whether the employer was a carrier,or a common carrier,or a railroad.
in wells fargo taylor,the supreme court considered whether wells fargo,an express shipping company that had purchased carriage on an unaffiliated railroad,was itself a common carrier by railroad within the meaning of fela.the court concluded that it was not,because wells fargo was not the operator of the railroad 
in our opinion the words common carrier by railroad,as used in the act,mean one who operates a railroad as a means of carrying for the is to say,a railroad company acting as a common carrier.this view not only is in accord with the ordinary acceptation of the words,but is enforced by the mention of cars,engines,track,roadbed,and other property pertaining to a going railroad 
id.at.in edwards pacific fruit express,d,the defendant sued under fela was a refrigerator car company that owned,maintained,and repaired refrigerator cars that it leased to railroads for transport of perishable products in interstate commerce it also owned switching tracks to facilitate its repair of such cars.the court concluded that the company was not covered by fela,noting that there exist a number of activities and facilities which,while used in conjunction with railroads and closely related to railroading,are yet not railroading itself.id.at.robinson baltimore ohio.porter employed by pullman company,which paid his salary and controlled his work on a railroad car that was owned by pullman but was hauled by an independent railroad was not an employee of the railroad.
in southern pacific terminal icc,the court considered whether the granting of preferential treatment to a customer by southern pacific terminal sp terminal,an operator of wharfage facilities,was within the jurisdiction of the interstate commerce commission icc under the interstate commerce act,stat.codified,as amended,in various sections of,which prohibited,inter alia,undue customer preferences by railroad s.sp terminal was chartered to construct and maintain wharves and docks for the accommodation of vessels,not to operate a railroad.however,the statute defined the term railroad to include all bridges and ferries used or operated in connection with any railroad,southern pacific terminal,at.internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,sp terminal was owned by the southern pacific company,which also owned of several separately and individually incorporated railways and sp terminal owned the only track facilities available for movement of railroad cars between ships and the tracks of one of the railroads.the supreme court,noting that sp terminal property created a unity of the railroad lines and the terminal facilities,id.at,and was necessary in the transportation or delivery of the interstate and foreign freight transported by the lines of the southern pacific system,id.at.internal quotation marks omitted,concluded that sp terminal operations were within the jurisdiction of the icc,despite the fact that sp terminal itself owned no cars,no locomotives,no stock in any of the railroads,and issued no bills of lading.the court found that one 
important fact is the control of the properties by the southern pacific company through stock ownership.there is a separation of the companies if we regard only their charters there is a union of them if we regard their control and operation through the southern pacific company.this control and operation are the important facts to shippers.it is of no consequence that by mere charter declaration the terminal company is a wharfage company,or the southern pacific a holding company.verbal declarations can not alter the facts.the control and operation of the southern pacific company of the railroads and the terminal company have united them into a system of which all are necessary parts,the terminal company as well as the railroad companies the terminal company was organized to furnish terminal facilities for the system at the port of galveston and shipments on the railroad lines from and to points in different states of the union pass and repass over the docks of the terminal company.it forms a link in this chain of transportation.it is necessary to complete the avenue through which move shipments over these lines owned by a single corporation.
id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the court stated that 
a corporation such as this terminal company,which has competing lines,should not be permitted to defeat the jurisdiction of th e commission by showing that it is not in fact owned by any railroad company the terminal company is part and parcel of the system engaged in the transportation of commerce,and to the extent that such commerce is interstate the commission has jurisdiction to supervise and control it within statutory limits.to hold otherwise would in effect permit carriers generally,though the organization of separate corporations,to exempt all of their terminals from the icc regulating authority.
id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.the court rejected the defendants contentions that the parent company and each of the subsidiaries must be viewed independently of one another merely because they were separately incorporated 
the record does not present a case of stock ownership merely or of a holding company which was content to hold.it presents a case,as we have already said,of one actively managing and uniting the railroads and the terminal company into an organized system.and it is with the system that the law must deal,not with its elements.such elements may,indeed,be regarded from some standpoints as legal entities may have,in a sense,separate corporate operation but they are directed by the same paramount and combining power and made single by it.in all transactions it is treated as single.in the ordinance of the city of galveston,in the act of,of the legislature of the state,and in public circulars and in the lease of the favored customer,it is the system which is dealt with,and not its separate links.and,we have seen,the terminal facilities which the terminal company was authorized to maintain were for the system,not for the corporate elements considered separately.
in united states union stock yard transit,an action to enjoin various violations of the interstate commerce act,the court considered whether the union stock yard transit company of chicago stock yard company,organized to maintain a stockyard,was a railroad within the meaning of that statute.stock yard company,more than of whose stock was owned by a holding company,chicago junction railways union stock yards company,was authorized to operate normal stockyard facilities for loading,unloading,and caring for freight.it was also authorized to own and operate a railroad system,moving rail cars to and from trunk lines for transportation to and from points outside of the state.at some point,stock yard company leased the latter aspect of the business to an entity that eventually became known as chicago junction railway company junction company,nearly all of whose stock was owned by the same holding company that owned stock yard company.junction company thereafter performed the railroad services and paid stock yard company of the profits received by the junction company for performing the service in connection with the railroad transportation.id.at.that joint service then took the place of the single service formerly rendered by the stock yard company.id.in view of this continuity of operation,the manner of compensation and the performance of services in connection with interstate transportation by railroads,the supreme court concluded that the two companies,
because of the character of the service rendered by them,their joint operation and division of profits and their common ownership by a holding company,are to be deemed a railroad within the terms of the act of congress to regulate commerce,and the services which they perform are included in the definition of transportation as defined in that act t he stock yard company did not exempt itself from the operation of the law by leasing its railroad and equipment to the junction company,for it still receives of the profits of that company and both companies are under a common stock ownership with its consequent control,
in united states brooklyn eastern district terminal,the court considered whether the brooklyn eastern district terminal terminal or brooklyn terminal,chartered not as a railroad but as a navigation corporation,was a railroad within the meaning of the hours of service act,et,repealed by pub,b,stat,which prohibited any common carrier operating a railroad in interstate commerce from requiring or permitting an employee to remain on duty for more than consecutive hours.in connection with its business of transporting merchandise on boats in new york harbor and adjacent waters,brooklyn terminal,under individual contracts with interstate railroads and several steamship companies,operated a freight station at which it received freight for transport to its brooklyn docks.the court stated that the precise question before it was 
whether the fact that the terminal conducts these operations,not as an integral part of a single railroad system but wholly as an agent for one or several,exempts the railroad companies,because they are not the employer and exempts the terminal,because it is not a common carrier.
at.the court concluded that although brooklyn terminal did not hold itself out as a common carrier,did not itself own the railroad cars that traveled over its tracks,and had tracks that covered only a short route,it must be considered a common carrier by railroad given that the services it rendered were public in nature and of a kind ordinarily rendered by a common carrier 
in no respect d id the service actually performed by the terminal for or in respect to shippers differ from that performed by the railroad companies at their other stations.true,the service is performed by the terminal under contracts with the railroad companies as agent for them and not on its own account.but a common carrier does not cease to be such merely because the services which it renders to the public are performed as agent for another.
in united states state of california,the court considered whether the state of california,in the operation of its state belt railroad to serve some industrial plants,was a common carrier within the meaning of the safety appliance act,et,repealed by pub,b,stat,which prohibited such companies from using rail cars with defective coupling equipment.though the state maintained that it was not a common carrier because it,inter alia,maintained no freight station and issued no bills of lading,the court concluded that 
a ll the essential elements of interstate rail transportation are present in the service rendered by the state belt railroad.they are the receipt and transportation,for the public,for hire,of cars moving in interstate commerce its service,involving as it does the transportation of all carload freight moving in interstate commerce between the industries concerned and all railroad and steamship lines reaching the port,is of the same character,though wider in scope,as that held to be common carriage by rail in interstate commerce in the brooklyn terminal and the union stockyards cases.they abundantly support the conclusion that such is the service rendered by the state in the present case 
the matter of responsibility,discussed in southern pacific terminal,and union stock yard transit,was revisited in united states bestfoods,d,in which the united states brought suit under the comprehensive environmental response,compensation,and liability act of cercla,et,against a parent corporation for the costs of cleaning up industrial waste generated at a chemical plant owned by its subsidiary.cercla imposes liability on any person who at the time of disposal of any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility.a.the question before the supreme court in bestfoods was whether a parent corporation that actively participated in,and exercised control over,the operations of a subsidiary may,without more,be held liable as an operator of a polluting facility owned or operated by the subsidiary.at.emphasis added.the court answered that precise question in the negative,noting that although the parent and subsidiary had many of the same officers and directors,courts generally presume that the directors are wearing their subsidiary hats and not their parent hats when acting for the subsidiary,id.at.other internal quotation marks omitted.thus,liability under a statute that does not itself pierce the corporate veil may not be imposed on a parent corporation for the acts of its subsidiary corporation based solely on the parent ownership of the subsidiary and active participation in or control of the subsidiary board of directors.see id.at.the court pointed out,however,that a corporate parent that actively participated in,and exercised control over,the operations of the facility itself may be held directly liable in its own right as an operator of the facility.id.at.a parent can be held directly liable when the parent operates the facility in the stead of its subsidiary or alongside the subsidiary in some sort of a joint venture.id.at.
several of these cases were synthesized in lone star steel mcgee,cir,cert.denied,d,in which the fifth circuit considered whether lone star,a steel company,was a common carrier by railroad within the meaning of fela and the safety appliance act.lone star did not dispute that it was a carrier by rail it had a rail line within its plant area and handled incoming shipments for other companies that had facilities on its property.but it contended that it was not a common carrier,given that it made no direct charge by way of tariffs and received no direct freight revenues for any of its rail services.however,lone star was virtually the sole stockholder of t n,a railroad company that concededly was a common carrier.t n,in addition to charging for its own services,charged for the rail services performed by lone star and in a recent period,t n had paid lone star million in dividends.
after reviewing the circumstances and analyses in cases such as state of california,brooklyn eastern district terminal,union stock yard transit,and southern pacific terminal,the lone star court found four considerations to be 
of prime importance in determining whether a particular entity is a common carrier.performance of rail service,service being performed is part of the total rail service contracted for by a member of the public,entity is performing as part of a system of interstate rail transportation by virtue of common ownership between itself and a railroad or by a contractual relationship with a railroad,and hence such entity is deemed to be holding itself out to the public,and for the services performed is received in some manner,such as a fixed charge from a railroad or by a percent of the profits from a railroad.
at.applying those criteria to the circumstances before it,the court concluded that lone star was a common carrier 
unquestionably,lone star performs rail services and such services are a part of the total rail transportation contracted for and required by the industries located on its plant site.while it does not perform these services under contract with t n,it certainly is an integral part of the t n system of interstate rail transportation.and finally,even though it does not receive money in the form of direct transportation charges from t n or from the industries serviced,it is for all practical purposes the sole owner of t n.it is closely allied with t n,their operations are interwoven,and therefore it receives in the form of dividends a part of the rate charged the industries by t n.it has been suggested that we can not ignore the legal individuality of lone star and t n and therefore,we are precluded from attaching any significance to the fact that lone star is essentially the sole stockholder of t n and consequently receives dividends therefrom.it is contended that stock ownership does not make the two companies one.while we agree with this proposition,we do not think it is controlling because the record does not present a case of mere stock ownership.instead the record reflects that the operations of the two are highly integrated and mutually dependent.
id.at.the court concluded that 
i n light of the rail services lone star has performed,the fact that such services are actually rendered in fulfillment of t n obligations as a carrier,and giving consideration to the facts disclosed in the record revealing the close connection between the two companies and their mutual dependence on each other,both lone star and t n are operating,jointly,a railroad system which constitutes each of them a common carrier.
in sum,the above cases reveal that companies that have no corporate affiliation or agency relationship with a railroad and merely supply the railroad with equipment such as refrigeration cars,or merely use the railroads to provide services such as courier deliveries for third persons,are not carriers within the meaning of fela.see,edwards pacific fruit express,at.wells fargo taylor,at.on the other hand,companies in nonrailroad businesses that have rail lines and provide rail carriage ancillary to those businesses are common carriers by rail when they constitute necessary links to railroads that are common carriers.see,state of california,at.brooklyn eastern district terminal,at.lone star steel mcgee,at.further,a company that has neither its own rolling stock nor corporate stock in railroad companies may be considered a railroad if it is part of an integrated corporate family that includes common carriers by railroad and if it constitutes a necessary link to those carriers.see,southern pacific terminal,at.see also union stock yard transit,at.even the fact that a company conducts such operations,not as an integral part of a single railroad system but wholly as an agent for one or several,does not exempt it from the status of common carrier.brooklyn eastern district terminal,at.and while corporate ownership of a subsidiary and overlapping offices and directorates are not,without more,sufficient to impose liability on the parent for conduct of the subsidiary under a statute that does not itself pierce the corporate veil,the parent may nonetheless be liable for operations of the subsidiary in which the parent itself,wearing its parenting hat,participates.see,bestfoods,at.
bearing in mind the above principles and mta acknowledgement that lirr is an interstate common carrier by railroad,and focusing on fela definition of common carrier,which include s corporations charged with the duty of the management and operation of the business of a common carrier,we turn to the question of whether mta is within the scope of fela as a manager or operator of lirr business.
mta participation in lirr business 
the public authorities law imposes on mta the responsibility for 
the continuance,further development and improvement of commuter transportation and other services related thereto within the metropolitan commuter transportation district,including but not limited to such transportation by railroad.
pub.auth.emphasis added.to that end,mta is given special powers,including the power to acquire any transportation facility,id.to operate,maintain,renovate,improve or repair such a facility,id.to levy and collect fares and other fees,id.and to establish schedules,standards of operation,and public safety rules and regulations as necessary for use and operation of any transportation facility,id.mta is authorized to cause any one or more of its powers to be exercised or performed by one or more wholly owned subsidiary corporations,id.it may transfer to or from such a subsidiary any moneys,real property,or other property,and it may apply for government grants to meet capital or operating expenses for such a subsidiary.id.the a uthority may lease railroad cars for use in its passenger service id.
for the rail,bus,subway,bridge,tunnel,marine,and air operations within the metropolitan commuter transportation district,mta is to develop and implement a unified mass transportation policy.id.in accordance with its legislative mandate,mta encompasses,as subsidiaries or as components for which mta is financially accountable,many transportation agencies,including,the new york city transit authority,the staten island rapid transit operating authority,the metropolitan suburban bus authority,and the triborough bridge and tunnel authority.see mta annual report,notes to combined financial statements,at.mta provides centralized services to these agencies,in the areas discussed below with respect to lirr.
in,mta acquired lirr as a subsidiary.the board of directors of mta is also the board of directors of lirr,see id,and the mta chairman determines who will be pre
