the issue on this appeal is whether shares of stock transferred to a company that defrauded the transferor and numerous other victims can be included in the receivership estate of the defrauding company for purposes of a pro rata distribution to the defrauded victims.stephenson equity company seco appeals from opinions and orders of the district court for the southern district of new york robert sweet,district judge,dated november,and january,the combined effect of which approved a distribution plan in the receivership of credit bancorp,cbl and modified an injunction freezing cbl assets.sec credit bancorp,civ,wl,credit bancorp plan i sec credit bancorp,d credit bancorp plan ii we conclude that a pro rata distribution was within the equitable discretion of the district court,and we therefore affirm.
background 
seco is a partnership substantially owned and controlled by charles stephenson.stephenson is also founder and chairman of the board of vintage petroleum,incorporated vintage petroleum,a publicly traded oil and gas company.in march,an agent of cbl contacted stephenson to solicit seco participation in cbl insured credit facility program.under this program,investors transferred cash or securities to cbl and received a promise of a quarterly dividend based on the value of the unencumbered assets transferred by the investor.the assets were to be used as collateral in the event that the investor drew upon a line of credit offered by cbl.the assets also served an additional purpose in order to generate revenue from what cbl called riskless arbitrage transactions with european banks cbl reflected the assets off its normal balance sheet,and the shares transferred by the investors into cbl accounts increased the amount of sheet assets available to generate the riskless arbitrage transactions.cbl implied that it would be able to pay the investors their promised dividends from the profits earned on the arbitrage transactions.in reality,cbl,running a classic ponzi scheme,paid investors a return out of the assets transferred by later investors.
the seco cfa and the seco.the principal documents executed in contemplation of the asset transfer were the cbl credit facility agreement seco cfa and what the parties refer to as the trustee engagement letter seco tel.the seco cfa was executed on june,by stephenson,as general partner of seco,richard blech,as president and ceo of cbl,douglas brandon,as trustee,and frederick storaska,president of corporate executive services,the managing general partner of seco.it contemplated the transfer of eight million shares of seco vintage petroleum stock and a quarterly dividend to seco of percent of the value of the unencumbered assets.the seco tel was executed the same day by blech,brandon,and storaska.the seco tel incorporated the terms of the seco cfa.
according to the seco cfa,cbl will engage douglas brandon to act as trustee,to hold the assets the eight million vintage petroleum shares in a cbl account for the benefit of seco and cbl.seco cfa,id.seco will deliver to trustee the specified fungible assets to serve as collateral for the credit facility and to be held by united states brokerage firms for the credit bancorp account.id.under the same paragraph,however,cbl retains the sole right to transfer some or all of the assets to other accounts id.
b eneficial ownership to the assets shall at all times remain with seco,and cbl and trustee represent and warrant that the trustee shall have legal title to the assets and that seco shall retain equitable title and beneficial ownership at all times,including following the deposit of the assets into the account,and that the assets remain an asset of seco and do not become an asset of cbl,id.
the seco tel provides in relevant part 
i brandon am the signing for all cbl trustee accounts.these vintage securities are to be held by me in a cbl account and may not be sold,pledged,assigned,margined,liened,hypothecated,or otherwise disposed of except as provided for in the cfa at no time am i to release the securities to any third party.as the securities are being delivered solely as collateral for any advance seco may obtain under the credit facility with cbl,beneficial ownership is retained by seco.
seco transfer of shares into cbl accounts.as described above,the seco cfa provided that seco would deliver to trustee the specified fungible assets.emphasis added.however,in a letter dated june,stephenson authorized seco brokerage firm,merrill lynch,to transfer eight million shares of vintage petroleum into four separate cbl accounts,none of which was identified as a trust account.the first,at alex brown and sons,is a cbl account identified by account number only.the second and fourth accounts,at swiss american securities,and brown brothers harriman,respectively,are described as ffc for further credit of credit the third account,with national financial services,is described as fbo for benefit of credit.
in early july,cbl began transferring the vintage shares out of the first group of accounts and into a variety of its other accounts at financial institutions such as ameritrade,charles schwab,chase investment,and credit suisse private banking.none of these accounts was identified as a trust account.in both the first and subsequent groups of accounts,the investors assets,including seco,were commingled with the assets of cbl other investors.
cbl fraudulent activity.cbl was operational from some time in until november,when the sec filed suit and obtained a tro freezing the assets of cbl and its related entities.by that time,cbl had victimized more than investors.most investors had transferred assets to cbl as contemplated by cfa and tel agreements similar to those executed by seco.approximately to in this litigation as the bob mann customers directed their deposits of cash and mutual funds under advice from advisor capital investments into the cbl insured securities strategy program.
contrary to its claims that it was engaging in riskless arbitrage,cbl only material source of revenue was the deposit of cash and securities by its investors.cbl primary business,other than attracting new investors,was to engage in currency futures and options trading that led to substantial losses.cbl financed its trading with cash and securities taken directly from its accounts and with money borrowed by pledging deposited securities as collateral for margin loans.cbl has encumbered a substantial portion of the securities deposited by customers,including a majority of the vintage petroleum shares,to secure its margin loans.cbl also used its investors funds to pay the cash dividends to its investors,such as the dividends paid to seco approximating million dollars.
cbl shifted funds and securities regularly among brokerage accounts,and neither segregated customer deposits nor earmarked a particular customer deposited assets to be used to pay that customer custodial dividend.seco claim is distinguishable from that of many of cbl customers only in that the eight million vintage petroleum shares it deposited were not converted to cash and are currently being held in cbl brokerage accounts 
the proposed plans of distribution and the district court approval.the district court appointed a receiver,carl loewenson,the receiver to marshal cbl assets and to prepare a distribution plan.interim distribution plans were proposed by the receiver,the sec,and certain cbl customers as and gene ray collectively the seco intervenors and thomas stappas et the stappas intervenors under seco proposed plan,those cbl clients,like seco,who had executed cfas,would be given priority over clients who had deposited cash directly into cbl accounts.under the sec plan,the receiver would liquidate all of cbl the vintage petroleum shares in cbl distribute the resulting cash on a pro rata basis,based on the amounts of initial investments.
the receiver proposed plan the compromise plan was designed to achieve the sec objective that all investors benefit from the distribution on a pro rata basis according to the amount of their investments and also meet seco preference that the vintage petroleum shares not be liquidated under the compromise plan,the vintage petroleum shares are returned to seco,but seco is required to pay into the receivership estate a cash undertaking determined primarily from a percentage of the value of the shares the percentage reflecting the portion of all victims investments that were lost.the cash undertaking will be included in the receivership estate for purposes of the pro rata distribution 
in a comprehensive order and opinion dated november,the district court approved the compromise plan,credit bancorp plan i,wl,at,and,acting on the receiver request,in an opinion dated january,amended the compromise plan,credit bancorp plan ii,d at.also on january,the court entered an order directing the receiver,among other things,to use his best judgment to effectuate the compromise plan.seco filed a notice of appeal from the order and opinion dated november,and an amended notice of appeal from the november,order and opinion,the january,opinion,and the january,order 
discussion 
jurisdiction 
seco,in its appeal,and the receiver,in opposition,primarily join issue on whether the district court confirmation of the compromise plan was within the court equitable authority.the court resolved that issue in the receiver favor both in approving the compromise plan and in denying seco motion for partial summary judgment to obtain return of the vintage shares.the latter ruling is not independently appealable,and the former ruling ordinarily is not independently appealable unless the doctrine of practical finality,see moore federal practice ed,or the collateral order doctrine,see sec forex asset management llc,cir applying collateral order doctrine to approval of receiver distribution plan,applies.see also sec elliott,cir exercising appellate jurisdiction over order establishing final plan of distribution,without explicit discussion of jurisdiction.we need not consider either doctrine,however,because the effect of the district court ruling was a modification of the freeze order that had been initially entered as a tro and continued as a preliminary injunction,and i nterlocutory orders of the district courts modifying injunctions are appealable.a.appellate review under section a,moreover,extends to all matters inextricably bound up with the preliminary injunction,including,in this case,seco motion for partial summary judgment.sec black,cir quoting energy action educational foundation andrus,alterations in original.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court application of law with regard to its denial of seco motion for partial summary judgment de novo.black,at citing at t winback conserve program,cir.we review the district court decision relating to the choice of distribution plan for the receivership estate for abuse of discretion.see sec fischbach,cir sec wang,cir.
iii.the ownership interest in the vintage petroleum shares 
seco contends that cbl never obtained an ownership interest in the vintage petroleum shares and,therefore,that including the shares or cash paid in to represent their value in the receivership estate violates various provisions of state law.seco asserts that the seco cfa and tel created an express trust,whereby legal title was transferred to the trustee,with seco retaining a beneficial interest.seco contends that cbl only interest in the transferred shares was a security interest contingent upon seco availing itself of the line of credit offered by cbl.because seco never drew upon the line of credit,the argument continues,cbl never acquired a security interest or any other ownership interest.
if seco shares had been transferred pursuant to an express trust,we would confront the issue of whether the equitable interests of the settlor of an inter vivos trust may be adjusted by a pro rata distribution ordered by a district court,exercising its equitable jurisdiction in an receivership proceeding,to remedy fraud perpetrated upon the settlor and other victims.we need not resolve that issue,however,because,although cbl solicited investments with documents indicating in some respects the anticipated use of a trust arrangement,the documents knowingly executed by seco to transfer its vintage shares in fact and in law accomplished an outright transfer of share ownership from seco to cbl.
the documentation preparatory to the transfer of assets from seco to cbl indicated that a trust arrangement was contemplated,yet also included provisions inconsistent with a trust.for example,consistent with a trust arrangement,a trustee was designated,seco was expected to deliver the vintage shares to the trustee,the trustee was to hold the shares in a cbl account over which he had signing authority and the trustee was not to release the shares to any third party.on the other hand,inconsistent with a trust arrangement,cbl retained the right to transfer the assets out of the initial account s into which they were transferred.see restatement second of trusts the trustee is under a duty to the beneficiary to take reasonable steps to take and keep control of the trust property id.cmt.f the duty of the trustee is not only to take and keep control,but to take and keep exclusive control.
the documents accomplishing the transfer of assets are entirely inconsistent with a trust arrangement.none of the transfer documents executed by seco required the shares to be transferred into trust accounts,and in fact the shares were not transferred into trust accounts.see id.cmt.c where securities are held in trust the trustee is under a duty to take and keep possession of the securities,and to earmark them as trust property.it is undisputed that on june,seco authorized its broker,merrill lynch,to transfer the eight million vintage petroleum shares into three cbl brokerage accounts either for the benefit of cbl or for the further credit of cbl and a fourth cbl account identified only by account number.these accounts were under the exclusive control of richard blech,cbl president and ceo,not brandon,the putative trustee.whether the transfer complied with the cfa,as seco contends,or violated the cfa,as the receiver contends,the transfer made by seco effectively moved the shares into cbl accounts without trust restrictions.
thus,seco transferred its shares into cbl accounts and gave cbl the sole right to transfer those shares into other accounts,a right cbl exercised.moreover,the papers cbl furnished to its investors,including seco,explicitly informed them of the purpose of placing the transferred shares under the sole control of cbl to reflect assets off its normal balance sheet that would increase the amount of assets available to generate riskless arbitrage transactions.
iv.the receivership court authority to order a pro rata distribution 
seco transfer of the shares to the defrauders without the protection of an express trust does not,however,necessarily defeat seco claim.under state law,assets acquired by fraud are subject to a constructive trust for the benefit of the defrauded party.restatement first of restitution.see counihan allstate insurance,cir assets are held subject to constructive trust when a party is holding property under such circumstances that in equity and good conscience he ought not to retain it quoting miller schloss,koreag,controle et revision refco associates,in re koreag,controle et revision,cir applying new york law of constructive trust in a bankruptcy case.
in assessing the significance of whatever constructive trust might have arisen in this context,we note preliminarily that cbl fraud concerned the false promises made with respect to cbl sources of income,not with respect to the arrangements under which the shares would be transferred from seco to cbl.thus,just as we do not have a case involving shares transferred under an express trust,we also do not have a case where a party is fraudulently deceived into signing transfer papers that it was entitled to believe would have accomplished a transfer under an express trust.the actual transfer documents executed by seco made clear on their face that seco was transferring the shares to cbl to brandon and not in trust.
in any event,whatever beneficial interest seco might have in the transferred shares,arising from
