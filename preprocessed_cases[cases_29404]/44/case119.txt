the appellee,hospitality mutual insurance company hospitality,issued a liquor liability insurance policy the policy to torcia sons,torcia.torcia owns and operates the fat cat bar grill the fat cat,a springfield,massachusetts establishment.the policy represented the full extent of torcia applicable liability coverage.
the appellant,katie graf,secured a judgment in her favor in massachusetts state court after she was injured while a patron on the fat cat premises.following a jury trial,graf was awarded in damages and in prejudgment interest against torcia and a fat cat employee 
hospitality disclaimed liability for the prejudgment interest portion of the award,arguing that the terms of the policy limited coverage to per person,per incident.as a result,graf sought and was granted a writ of attachment on torcia liquor license to secure the excess judgment.
graf and torcia sought payment from hospitality for the cost of a bond to release the attachment.to obtain such a bond,hospitality would have been required to post approximately in cash or other collateral,and pay an annual premium of.again,hospitality refused on grounds that it was not liable for the cost of the bond because the damages award had independently triggered the policy coverage limit.
the parties then entered into a settlement agreement.in relevant part,the settlement agreement provided that graf would discharge the attachment of the liquor license and torcia would assign its rights against hospitality to graf.pursuant to the assignment of rights,graf brought suit against hospitality in massachusetts state court,and the action was then removed to federal court in the district of massachusetts 
in the ensuing litigation,the magistrate judge agreed with hospitality interpretation of the policy and granted hospitality motion to dismiss,see graf hospitality mut.ins,d,then denied graf subsequent motion to amend judgment in a text order.the magistrate judge found that the damages award represented the full extent of recoverable proceeds under the policy.he reasoned that to require hospitality to pay for the cost of the bond would have expanded hospitality liability in contravention of the express terms of the policy.graf now appeals.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and we affirm.

ii.the policy 
the policy obligates hospitality to pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury to any person,caused by an occurrence.policy i a.nevertheless,hospitality has no other obligation or liability to pay any other sums or perform any other acts of sic services unless they are explicitly provided for under supplementary payments.id.
the definitions of two terms are of central importance.first,damages is defined to mean all monetary sums which the insured is legally obligated to pay as damages including prejudgement interest awarded against an insured.id.at v c.with respect to supplementary payments,the policy provides that 
we will pay with respect to any claim or suit we defend 
the cost of bonds to release attachments,but only for bond amounts within the applicable limit of insurance.we do not have to furnish these bonds.
these payments will not reduce the limits of insurance of this policy.
id.at i c emphasis added.
the limits of insurance are addressed in sections iii and iv.section iii expressly incorporates by reference a per person and per occurrence coverage limit.id.at iii b the per person limit stated in the declarations is the most we will pay to one or more persons as the result of bodily injury to any one person in any one occurrence.section iv provides that a person may sue hospitality to recover on a final judgment against an insured obtained after an actual trial but hospitality will not be liable for damages that are not payable under the terms of this policy that are in excess of the applicable limit of insurance.id.at iv b.
iii.discussion 
we agree with the magistrate judge that the policy is susceptible to just one reasonable interpretation.the policy contains a supplementary payments provision section i c unambiguously obligates hospitality to pay for the cost of certain bonds,but only insofar as those bonds are for amounts within the applicable limit of insurance.emphasis added.here,the limit of insurance was reached by virtue of the damages award,and the policy did not obligate hospitality to pay for the cost of a bond covering a prejudgment interest award beyond that amount graf arguments to the contrary may be quickly dispatched.
graf argues here,as she did before the magistrate judge,that section i c requires hospitality to pay for the cost of a bond to release the liquor license because the amount of that bond,some,is itself within the policy limit.graf vigorously pursues this point,but her argument tortures what we believe to be the plain meaning of the applicable terms.as we have noted,section i c provides that hospitality will pay with respect to any claim or suit it defend s t he cost of bonds to release attachments,but only for bond amounts within the applicable limit of insurance.emphasis added.
taken to its conclusion,graf argument would obligate hospitality to pay for a bond or perhaps even multiple bonds so long as the amount of the bond was or less,irrespective of whether the coverage limit had already been reached,potentially increasing hospitality exposure by or even more,depending on the applicability of the occurrence limitation.this,we believe,makes no sense and can not be squared with the plain language of the policy.to accept graf proposed reading,we would have to disregard the second clause in the sentence,which plainly limits the circumstances in which hospitality must pay for the cost of a bond to situations in which the bond amount is within the applicable limit of insurance.see jacobs,at,at e very word and phrase must be presumed to have been employed with a purpose and must be given meaning and effect whenever practicable citations omitted.
what is more,graf position is belied by other policy provisions.section iii provides that t he per person limit of is the most we will pay to one or more persons as the result of bodily injury to any one person in any one occurrence.section iv adds further clarity by providing that even where a plaintiff obtains a judgment greater than the coverage limit,hospitality will not be liable for damages in excess of the applicable limit of insurance.even if the meaning of the supplementary payments provi
