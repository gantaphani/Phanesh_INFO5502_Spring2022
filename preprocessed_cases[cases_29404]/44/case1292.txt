opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter arises from a dispute regarding alleged misrepresentations made to the,adrienne dilworth,when she purchased a life insurance policy from the metropolitan life insurance company hereinafter called metlife to insure her old daughter,aisha sharif.in particular,dilworth asserted claims predicated on negligence,common law fraud and deceit,violation of the pennsylvania unfair trade practices and consumer protection law.stat.ann.tit,west hereinafter called utpcpl,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,bad faith under.ann.west,and breach of fiduciary duty the district court on metlife motion under federal rule of civil procedure b dismissed dilworth claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,bad faith,and breach of fiduciary duty.inasmuch as dilworth has not appealed from the order of dismissal of those claims,we are not concerned with them on this appeal.accordingly,at this point dilworth claims are for negligence and fraud and deceit,thus sounding in tort,or are statutory under the utpcpl.
subsequently,metlife moved for summary judgment and the court granted that motion by an order entered april.dilworth then moved for reconsideration of the order for summary judgment but the court denied that motion by an order entered on may.the court bases for granting metlife summary judgment were that the statute of limitations barred all of dilworth claims remaining after the rule b dismissal,except those under the utpcpl,as her causes of action on the barred counts accrued when metlife delivered the policy more than two years before she brought this case.in reaching this conclusion the court rejected dilworth argument that the discovery rule saved her claims.the court then held that the utpcpl claim failed on the merits as she had not relied justifiably on metlife misrepresentations when she purchased the policy dilworth appeals from these two orders.for the reasons we set forth below we will reverse the orders of april,and may,and will remand the case to the district court for trial.
the circumstances leading to this litigation may be traced to november,when dilworth met with haisela dorsey,a metlife agent,regarding the purchase of a life insurance policy insuring the life of her daughter dorsey had a close relationship to dilworth as she was dilworth sister best friend.on that same day,dilworth signed an application for life insurance insuring her daughter.metlife subsequently issued the policy which provided for a face amount of and required monthly premium payments of.metlife delivered the policy on december,to dilworth who did not read it in detail but instead merely skimmed it app.at.
dilworth asserts that she believed that she was purchasing a policy requiring a minimal number of cash payments.she alleges that dorsey,the metlife sales agent,represented that the policy would require her to make premium payments for only nine years because after that period the remaining premium payments would be fully funded.the policy was said to through the use of accrued dividends,accumulated cash value,and interest.policies with such provisions commonly are referred to as vanishing premium policies.thus,dilworth contends that it was her understanding that after nine,close to ten years,i would have to pay anything else into it.app.at.
in our experience defendants and their agents usually contest the factual predicate underlying claims similar to those dilworth asserts.while metlife may take that position at the trial,this case nevertheless is unusual in that dorsey,the metlife sales agent,acknowledged in her deposition that she had characterized the policy to dilworth as thus,dorsey stated in her deposition that 
the way it was supposed to be,it was an accelerated payment plan to be paid up in ten years.she bought it to have college money for her daughter.and she bought it somewhere in,so by the year it was supposed to be paid up and then collect dividends.
it was anything like she was to get monthly dividend payments,no.it was to be a policy that would be paid up in ten years,and that there would be the time the daughter was,the daughter was supposed to have millions of dollars,and she was supposed to be able to collect the money before death,because at,they can declare you legally dead,if she wanted to get the other part.
app.at.in the circumstances,we regard it as clear for purposes of this appeal that dorsey misled dilworth.we also regard it as established at this time that metlife was hardly an innocent party in dorsey conduct for she testified that metlife instructed her to inform her customers that the life insurance policies were guaranteed to,even though this was not an accurate representation of them 
q and the dividends on the life insurance policies were not guaranteed either right 
a.they were not guaranteed.they told me that they were not guaranteed,but i was told to tell the clients that they were guaranteed.
notwithstanding dorsey representations,the life insurance policy that metlife delivered to dilworth did not provide that after a minimal number of payments it automatically would.therefore,rather than providing for the premiums vanishing,the policy required dilworth to make monthly premiums,every month for its duration.this requirement did not involve a undertaking as its premium schedule provided for monthly premiums of for years.
the appeal raises two questions that we discuss in detail whether the district court erred in holding that dilworth needed to undertake a cursory examination of the policy to show due diligence and that such a review would have revealed her injury thus depriving her of the benefit of the discovery rule to overcome metlife statute of limitations defense and whether the district court erred in holding that dilworth utpcpl claim failed as she could not demonstrate that she justifiably had relied on the representations made to her because the plain language of the policy expressly contradicted dorsey alleged oral misrepresentations

on an appeal from an order entering summary judgment,we undertake a de novo review and apply the same standard the district court applies on such motions.petruzzi iga supermarkets,cir.accordingly,summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c union pac.greentree transp.trucking,cir.we view the record on appeal in the light most favorable to the party who lost on summary judgment in the district court.united states diebold,d.the parties agree that pennsylvania law,including its statute of limitations,applies in this case.see guaranty trust york.erie tompkins.witherow firestone tire rubber,cir.under pennsylvania law,a party seeking to benefit from the discovery rule to delay the running of the statute of limitations has the burden of establishing that she was unable to know of her injury and could not ascertain that knowledge exercising reasonable diligence.dalrymple brown,citing pocono int l raceway pocono produce,drelles mfgs.life ins,wda,wl,at.july.the standard of reasonable diligence is objective.redenz rosenberg.if the discovery rule is applicable the statute of limitations does not begin to run against a plaintiff during the period in which she reasonably was unaware of her injury.
the pennsylvania supreme court has not spoken directly to the issues raised on this appeal in a vanishing premium context.thus,its decisions do not establish clear law to enable us to answer the following questions whether dilworth can demonstrate that she acted with reasonable diligence and obtain the benefit of the discovery rule when the precise terms of her policy possibly were inconsistent with her reasonable expectations of what the policy contained and whether her reasonable expectations excuse her failure to perform a cursory examination of her insurance policy for purposes of delaying the running of the statute of limitations therefore,we must predict how that court would resolve these issues should it be called upon to do so.see robertson allied signal,cir.in this undertaking we examine what the pennsylvania supreme court has said in related areas the decisional law of the pennsylvania intermediate courts opinions of federal courts of appeals and district courts applying state law and decisions from other jurisdictions that have discussed the issues we face here.gruber,cir.of course,it is implicit in our formulation of the issues that,at least at this time,we regard dilworth expectations,predicated as they were on dorsey statements,as reasonable.
iii.discussion 
whether the statute of limitations bars dilworth tort claims 
dilworth contends that the district court erred in failing to apply pennsylvania discovery rule to toll the running of the statute of limitations to her claims until such time as she could have reasonably discovered the misrepresentations made by the defendant agents in order to induce the sale.appellant br.at.the parties agree that pennsylvania statute of limitation.ann.west,applies to all of dilworth claims except those she predicates on the utpcpl her causes of action accrued when she received the written insurance policy in december and she did not file suit until april.therefore,unless the discovery rule delayed the triggering of the running of the statute of limitations,her claims,except those premised on the utpcpl,are barred by its filing requirement 
dilworth contends that the district court erred in holding that she needed to undertake a cursory examination of the policy to show her reasonable diligence so as to justify the application of the discovery rule.she predicates this argument on her contention that her reasonable expectations as to the terms of the policy to be issued caused her not to question whether the policy that metlife issued was actually the type of policy that the agent sold her.
in discussing this point,we first note that the parties and the district court seem to have conflated decisions of the pennsylvania courts defining the discovery rule requirement of reasonable diligence with cases articulating what constitutes justifiable reliance under the utpcpl.the district court recognized that a plaintiff is entitled to exclude from the limitations period any time during which the injured party is reasonably unaware that an injury has been sustained.district court opinion at citing dalrymple,at emphasis in original.the court then concluded that dilworth had sufficient information upon receipt of her policy that,had she made a cursory examination of the policy,she would have discovered the injury.id.citing silverman bell sav.loan ass n.
we think that the district court approach may not have been quite correct because silverman did not involve a statute of limitations issue and therefore the court should not have relied on that case to define what constituted reasonable diligence for purposes of the discovery rule.rather,the silverman court used the cursory examination standard to determine,whether a person reliance upon a fraudulent misrepresentation is justifiable in an action alleging fraudulent misrepresentation.silverman,at 
we find the pennsylvania superior court opinion in toy metropolitan life insurance,to be useful in considering the contours of the discovery rule in this case.there the superior court recognized that there are different standards to determine whether a plaintiff has exercised reasonable diligence to ascertain the facts to justify a delay in the triggering of the statute of limitations and the standards necessary to prove that a plaintiff justifiably relied on a defendant representations to sustain a claim under the utpcpl.the toy court affirmed the trial court decision pursuant to the statute of limitations to bar the plaintiff tort the language of the policy should have alerted her to her claims and because she unreasonably delayed seeking the information that would have alerted her to the fact that she had not received the contract reversed the grant of summary judgment against her on her utpcpl claims,as the appellate court,unlike the trial court,held that she justifiably could have relied on the agent representations,despite the fact that a reading of the policy would have revealed that her expectations were erroneous.toy,at.
it is important to note,however,that the pennsylvania supreme court never has held that the discovery rule mandates that an insured inspect her policy to obtain the benefit of the discovery rule.in fact,the examination requirement,and the derivative impact of such a requirement which allows the insurer to use the language of an insurance policy to defeat the reasonable expectations of the insured,is at odds with the pennsylvania supreme court justifiable reliance jurisprudence.see rempel,at see also in re general am.life ins.sales practices litig.knouse general american life ins,cir hereinafter cited as knouse predicting that the supreme court of pennsylvania would import its reasonable expectations analysis into its discovery rule jurisprudence and hold that in some circumstances in vanishing premium cases an insured does not have a duty to read his policy and discover his injury or risk.
we,however,need not in this case predict whether the pennsylvania supreme court would deem it necessary for an insured to perform a cursory examination of an insurance policy to demonstrate due diligence for purposes of the discovery rule.assuming,without deciding,that in the exercise of reasonable diligence an insured must make such a cursory review,such an examination of the policy in this case would not have put dilworth on notice of the misrepresentations accordingly,even if armed with the information she could have gleaned from a cursory examination of the policy,dilworth would not have been able to see that it did not provide vanishing premiums.
therefore,we hold that the district court erred by holding that the language of the policy dispositively demonstrated that a reasonable person would have been put on notice that she had not received a vanishing premium policy if she had performed a cursory examination of the policy.the court erroneously focused on the fact that the policy set forth the number of payments it required but did so without examining whether the policy articulated the source of those payments.though the policy indicated that years of payments would be necessary,even if dilworth had been aware of this provision it would not have been inconsistent with the agent representation that after the first nine or ten years of payments the remaining or years of payments would come from the accrued dividends,accumulated cash value,and interest 
in this regard,the opinion of the court of appeals for the eighth circuit in knouse,at,a diversity of citizenship case applying pennsylvania law,is helpful.there the insurance company led the plaintiffs to believe that they were purchasing vanishing premium policies even though the company actually issued traditional life insurance policies.as in the present case,the policies required a specific number of payments.the plaintiffs brought suit alleging,in part,fraud,deceit,and negligence.the insurance company asserted that pennsylvania statute of limitations barred the plaintiffs claims because they could,and should,have discovered their alleged injuries when they received the policies.the district court agreed with the insurance company and dismissed the claims on summary judgment.on appeal the court of appeals,however,reversed the orders of the district court,and remanded the case for trial.the court of appeals stated 
t here is nothing on the cover pages of any of the policies at issue here that would inexorably lead to a conclusion that plaintiffs,unsophisticated insureds should have known that the vanishing premium concept allegedly explained to them would not occur as represented.each cover page states only that plaintiffs had a right to examine each policy and that flexible premiums were payable until each insured reached a certain age these provisions could be read by a reasonable unsophisticated insured as being completely consistent with the agents alleged representations that the premiums paid by plaintiffs for a limited time,in combination with policy int
