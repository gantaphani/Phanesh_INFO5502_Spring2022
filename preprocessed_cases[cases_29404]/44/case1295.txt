introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on an appeal by philadelphia newspapers,pni from an order of the district court denying its motion to vacate a protective order.though pni originally was not a party in this case,it sought to intervene and asked the court to vacate the protective order which had designated as confidential all information produced during the course of the action.app.at the district court granted pni motion to intervene but denied its motion to vacate the protective order.because the district court erred in denying pni motion to vacate the protective order,we will reverse the district court order to the extent that it denied that prong of pni motion.
the facts germane to this appeal are not complex.john shingara,an employee of the pennsylvania state police,filed this action under against several other employees of the pennsylvania state police the defendants.shingara alleges that the defendants retaliated against him for speaking out about allegedly faulty radar speed detection devices that the state police used.through discovery,shingara obtained documents related to those devices.shingara counsel gave some of those documents to pni and pni relied on them in publishing newspaper articles regarding the allegedly faulty radar devices.after pni published those articles,the defendants,at a time when pni was not yet a party in this case,without notice to pni,through an oral motion sought a protective order from the district court seeking to prevent further disclosure of discovery documents to the media.on december,the district court granted the motion and entered the following order 
defendants motion for a protective order is granted.
all information,including documents,deposition testimony,and other responses to discovery,produced or otherwise disclosed by either of the parties,including any witness for either of the parties,during the course of this action shall be held in confidence and shall be used only for purposes of this action and shall not be disclosed or made available to any persons other than the parties,their attorneys,including counsel,persons employed in such attorneys offices or by such attorneys who are assisting counsel in this action,or any independent consultant or expert retained or employed for purposes of this action by either of the parties or their attorneys.
should either of the parties find it necessary in the preparation or trial of this action to disclose information obtained in discovery to any person other than a person identified in paragraph above,a notice shall be served on the other party fully identifying the person to whom disclosure is to be made,together with a designation of the specific information or documents to be disclosed to such person.any objection to the proposed disclosure,and the reasons for the objection,shall be stated in writing within ten days of the receipt of the notice.if that objection is not resolved by agreement,then the matter shall be submitted to this court by the party seeking disclosure,and the disclosure shall not be made pending this court ruling as to whether the objection should be sustained.
this order shall not apply to public documents.
both parties shall comply with local rule and.rules of prof l conduct.app.at.
as we have indicated,pni filed a motion to intervene in shingara action and asked the district court to vacate the protective order.in response,on april,the district court granted pni motion to intervene but denied its motion to vacate the protective order.pni timely filed a notice of appeal to this court on april,from the april,order to the extent that the court denied pni motion to vacate the protective order 
ii.jurisdiction 
while we recognize that orders relating to discovery generally are not final for purposes of appellate jurisdiction,we have jurisdiction here under pursuant to the collateral order doctrine because the district court order conclusively determines the disputed question the district court order resolves an important issue that is completely separate from the merits of the dispute and the district court order will be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.in re ford motor,cir discussing cohen beneficial indus.loan.see also in re san juan star,cir.in this regard it is obvious that the order denying the motion to vacate the protective order satisfies the first two criteria for finality under the collateral order doctrine.the possibility that the district court on motion of a party may reconsider the order with respect to a particular document is too narrow to reject the conclusion that the court has determined not to disturb the protective order.in fact,the court set forth the possibility of focused reconsideration of its protective order only in the order itself and not in the april,order denying its vacatur.furthermore,the designation as confidential of information produced in the action addresses a matter completely distinct from the substantive issues in the case.
the more substantial question relating to the applicability of the collateral order doctrine is whether the district court april,order effectively will be unreviewable on appeal after the entry of a final judgment.in this regard we note that the district court recognized in its opinion denying the motion to vacate the protective order that after the case is resolved the confidentiality restrictions may be relaxed.in that event an appeal at that time from the april,order might be moot and thus be ineffective.we are convinced,however,that even if an appeal of the april,order would not be moot after final judgment,the protective order never will be effectively appealable unless we entertain pni appeal now.we have reached this conclusion because in this case a newspaper is being constrained in its attempt to obtain information so that it can report the news,and in such a situation time is of the essence see in re san juan star,at.after all,nobody wants to read yesterday news thus,we are satisfied that if we permit pni to appeal only after a final judgment,its appeal will be futile either because the controversy will be moot or pni,if successful,will obtain only stale relief.
iii.the merits 
on this appeal,our standard of review is clear.though we review the grant of a protective order,and thus the denial of a motion to vacate the protective order,for abuse of discretion,we exercise plenary review over the district court interpretation and application of the legal standard for granting or modifying a confidentiality order.pansy borough of stroudsburg,cir.
under federal rule of civil procedure c,a court for good cause shown may,in certain circumstances,enter a protective order in the context of discovery.we are satisfied that after the court enters such an order there must be good cause to maintain the order in the face of a motion to vacate it,particularly when,as here,the moving party did not have an opportunity to oppose the entry of the protective order in the first instance.in pansy,we explained that it is that good cause must exist to obtain a protective order over discovery materials.at.while the facts in pansy involved a confidentiality order issued to protect a settlement agreement from public knowledge,we indicated there that the good cause analysis of rule c applied whether an order of confidentiality is granted at the discovery stage or any other stage of litigation.id.
in pansy we explained that there is good cause when a party shows that disclosure will result in a clearly defined,specific and serious injury but that broad allegations of harm are not sufficient to establish good cause.id.we also stated that the party seeking protection has the burden of showing that there is good cause for it.id.at.we directed the district court to determine whether there is good cause by balancing the interests of the public and the parties and further indicated that the court should explain the reasoning behind its balancing conclusion.id.at.
we discussed several balancing factors in pansy,though we stated that those factors are not exhaustive.id.in particular,in pansy and in a later decision,glenmede trust thompson,cir,we listed
