background and procedural history 
mcclaren was hired on april,by tenet health care system medical,tenet to manage the food services unit of a hospital in el paso,texas.mcclaren worked in that capacity at sierra medical center sierra until,when he was promoted to director of food and nutrition.as director,mcclaren duties included supervision of employees,designation of the menu,and management of the financial aspects of the food services unit.
throughout his career,including prior to his arrival at sierra,mcclaren suffered from back and other health problems.in,while at sierra,he slipped,fell,and sustained a serious back injury requiring two surgeries.mcclaren subsequently filed a worker compensation claim against tenet.tenet and mcclaren settled the claim,with tenet agreeing to pay for mcclaren medical treatment and pain medication.mcclaren continued to receive medical treatment related to the injury from his slip and fall through,and during this time his doctor continued to file reports with the texas workers compensation committee 
in february,tenet agreed that morrison would assume responsibility for food services at three hospitals in the el paso area,including sierra.per this agreement,morrison retained all of tenet hospital employees for at least days.on may,mcclaren learned that his position would be eliminated by morrison as of june.morrison explains that this restructuring of management was due to its desire to place all three el paso area hospitals under one director of food and nutrition,rather than staffing a director at each location.a new position of assistant director,with a lower salary,was created that approximated mcclaren position at sierra.according to morrison,it planned to create a new management structure two assistant director positions at the two smaller hospitals including sierra that would report to the director residing at the largest area hospital.mcclaren applied for the new assistant director position at sierra and interviewed for the position on may.he was told a decision would be made before june.at the time he applied and was considered,mcclaren was years old.morrison did not hire mcclaren as the assistant director,but instead hired martin king,a man who had been employed by tenet and who previously reported to mcclaren.king was,at the time,years old.
mcclaren learned of morrison decision to hire king through another employee without the knowledge of morrison management.king also confirmed his new employment directly with mcclaren,unbeknownst to morrison.after learning of morrison decision,but without communicating with morrison,mcclaren visited his doctor,wehrle,on june.there,the doctor explained that mcclaren back injuries and pain presented him with two treatment options an additional series of steroid injections or back surgery.mcclaren complained to wehrle that on that day he suffered from intractable back pain,and the doctor notes reflect persistent significant back pain since november.at that same visit on june,mcclaren opted for surgery and asked for a referral to a surgeon.
on june,mcclaren filed a request for leave from morrison under the family medical leave act.the request for leave form asked for mcclaren date of anticipated return to work,to which mcclaren answered.on june,mcclaren packed his personal belongings at work and left voicemail messages for his supervisors explaining his decision to take sick leave.on june,mcclaren filed for retirement benefits from the social security administration ssa.two days later,morrison mailed mcclaren a termination letter explaining that it had not hired him as assistant director and notifying him that his last day of employment with morrison was june,but that he would be paid through june.
in september,mcclaren filed discrimination charges with the texas human rights commission and the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,alleging that morrison discriminated against him on the basis of age and disability,in violation of the age discrimination in employment act adea and the americans with disabilities act ada,when morrison terminated his position and failed to hire him for the assistant director position at sierra.
in february,mcclaren filed for disability benefits with the ssa,and he received those benefits until he turned,at which time he began to receive retirement benefits mcclaren described his disability as diabetes,high blood pressure,hypothyroidism,atherosclerotic heart disease,rheumatoid arthritis,degenerative arthritis,and back fusion at l.he also stated that those conditions caused him to make changes,including modified job,reasonable accommodations,and special parking.mcclaren claimed to the ssa he stopped working based on wehrle diagnosis that mcclaren was unable to work while taking pain medications,muscle relaxers,and because employer morrison changed job restrictions.
the eeoc issued a right to sue letter,and mcclaren filed multiple claims against morrison in texas state court.mcclaren original petition stated only a claim of age discrimination against morrison upon removal to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction,morrison filed a motion for summary judgment that was subsequently denied.the case proceeded to trial before a jury,which ultimately awarded mcclaren damages.after reducing the jury award,the district court entered final judgment.morrison moved for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure b,arguing that mcclaren was judicially estopped from establishing a prima facie case of age discrimination in light of his statements to the ssa regarding his eligibility for disability benefits.morrison further contended even if a prima facie case existed,mcclaren failed to demonstrate that morrison proffered reason for not hiring mcclaren was pretext for discrimination.
noting that the fifth circuit had yet to address the question of judicial estoppel in the context of a state law age discrimination claim made in light of statements supporting a claim for social security disability benefits,the district court held that mcclaren was estopped from making a prima facie claim and granted morrison motion for judgment as a matter of law.the district court did not reach whether,if a prima facie case had been met,mcclaren demonstrated that morrison proffered reason for termination was pretext.mcclaren timely filed the instant appeal.

whether mcclaren is judicially estopped from making a prima facie case of age discrimination.
at primary issue in this appeal is whether mcclaren is judicially estopped from claiming he was qualified for purposes of his age discrimination claim,even though he applied for and received social security disability insurance ssdi program benefits as one who is disabled and unable to perform his past relevant work.in other words,we must decide whether mcclaren claims of qualification and disability are sufficiently inconsistent to preclude his age discrimination claim on the basis of judicial estoppel.
morrison argues that mcclaren can not prevail on his age discrimination claim because the two claims are inconsistent and mcclaren has failed to sufficiently explain the inconsistencies.mcclaren argues he adequately explained that his disability claim does not preclude his discrimination claim because,at the time he was terminated,he was not disabled and was qualified for his job.according to mcclaren,he later became disabled due to a worsening condition and due to his choice of medical treatment and,for that reason,became eligible for disability benefits after his termination.he claims that he only chose surgery because he knew morrison did not hire him for the assistant director position and that he would have chosen additional steroid injections if he had the option of continuing to work.
under the tchra,an employer may not fail or refuse to hire an individual,discharge an individual,or discriminate in any other manner against an individual in connection with compensation or the terms,conditions,or privileges of employment on the basis of age.ann.section is substantively identical to its federal equivalent in title vii,with the exception that federal law makes age discrimination unlawful under the adea.quantum chem.toennies,see also jaso travis county juvenile,no pet.
in order to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination under the tchra in a or failure to hire case,mcclaren must show that he was in the protected class he was qualified for the position sought he was not selected and he was either a replaced by another person outside of the protected class b replaced by someone younger or c otherwise not selected because of age.see machinchick pb power,cir citing rachid jack in the box,cir stating prima facie requirements in a discharge,rather than failure to hire,case see also blow city of san antonio,cir providing elements in a title vii failure to promote case.before the district court and now on appeal,morrison maintains mcclaren is unable to show that he was qualified for the assistant director position he sought.
morrison argued in its rule motion that mcclaren is judicially estopped from showing he is therefore precluded from making his discrimination mcclaren averred to the ssa he was disabled and unable to perform his prior relevant work in order to receive ssdi benefits observing the lack of fifth circuit precedent on the issue,the district court relied on united states supreme court,third circuit,and texas case law in granting morrison rule motion.specifically,the district court held mcclaren averment of disability and inability to perform his job as of june,that is,two days prior to his termination judicially estopped him from subsequently claiming he was qualified for the assistant director position that was denied him on june.
in cleveland policy management systems,d,the supreme court addressed whether a plaintiff who claims both to be totally disabled for purposes of receiving ssdi benefits and qualified for employment under the ada is judicially estopped from bringing his ada claim.as a preliminary matter,the supreme court first observed that to make a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ada,a plaintiff must first demonstrate he is qualified for the position in question and in order to receive ssdi benefits,a claimant must make a showing of a disability.id.at.although apparently incompatible,the court concluded these two statuses may nevertheless as to one claimant,observing that a claimant for ssdi benefits is not per se precluded from making a showing of qualification for purposes of setting out a prima facie case of disability discrimination.id.at.
in such a case,to survive judgment for the employer,a plaintiff must address the apparent inconsistency between qualified for employment under the ada and disabled for ssdi benefits.id.at.holding that ada plaintiff can not simply ignore the apparent contradiction that arises out of the earlier ssdi total disability claim.a plaintiff explanation of the apparent inconsistency must be sufficient to warrant a reasonable juror concluding that,assuming the truth of,or the plaintiff good faith belief in,the earlier statement,the plaintiff could nonetheless perform the essential functions of her job,with or without reasonable accommodation.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.if a plaintiff fails to explain the inconsistency between his qualification and disability,or if the explanation is insufficient,then his ada claim is judicially estopped by his earlier statements regarding disability.id.
although the cleveland court did not address the application of judicial estoppel to an adea or,as here,a state law age discrimination claim asserted after a plaintiff has filed for ssdi benefits,we find the reasoning employed therein persuasive to the precise issue before this court and,for the first time,this circuit.we also observe that at least one other circuit court and district court have applied cleveland analysis to a discrimination claim brought under the adea.detz greiner indus,cir holding plaintiff judicially estopped from establishing adea claim where attempt to explain the inconsistency between disabled and qualified consisted only of argument that his termination rendered him unable to work johnson exxon mobil,wl,at,unpublished opinion holding plaintiff judicially estopped from establishing he was qualified for purposes of age discrimination claim because plaintiff could not resolve the inconsistency between his disability and his qualification by simply disavowing elements of his claims to the former.
here,mcclaren age discrimination claim arises under the tchra rather than the adea,but as noted previously,this distinction does not prevent our application of the cleveland analysis because the tchra parallels federal discrimination laws.specialty retailers,at.moreover,at least one texas court of appeals has applied cleveland judicial estoppel analysis to a joint sex and disability discrimination claim.see johnson hoechst celanese,christi,pet.ref 
having concluded the supreme court analysis in cleveland applies to the age discrimination claim before this court,we must first address whether there is a genuine conflict between mcclaren statements to the ssa and his claim under the tchra.mcclaren submitted documentation to the ssa detailing how he was entitled to ssdi benefits based on various maladies,including pain lower back,chest pain,fatigue,weakness,obesity,high blood pressure,neropathy sic both legs feet,dizziness,sleeplessness,diabetes,hycholesterol sic.further,mcclaren averred to the ssa that these symptoms were constant and precluded him from performing many of the essential functions of life.alternatively,in support of his tchra complaint,mcclaren represented to the district court and the jury that he would have been able to perform the duties associated with the assistant director position.we conclude the two positions taken by mcclaren are facially inconsistent.
nevertheless,under cleveland,mcclaren is entitled to proffer an explanation for this inconsistency,which,if sufficient,would require this court to reverse the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law.mcclaren points to several pieces of evidence in the record that he maintains established he was qualified for the position of assistant director,despite his allegedly disabling injuries his own testimony revealing he was physically able to work in may,at the time of his application for the assistant director position testimony from morrison representatives indicating the failure to hire mcclaren was not due to his health or physical condition the fact that mcclaren never requested an accommodation for his back injury and mcclaren testimony that if morrison had offered mcclaren the position at issue,he would have accepted and continued working,choosing a less invasive medical treatment for his back pain than the back surgery he elected after morrison d
