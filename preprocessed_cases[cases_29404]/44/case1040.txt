opinion of the court 
david andrews was found not guilty of the crimes for which he was charged.he brought suit against officer robert sciulli for false arrest and malicious prosecution on appeal he contends that the district court erred by granting summary judgment,on the basis of qualified immunity,in favor of sciulli.we agree.we will reverse the district court judgment and remand the cause for trial.
on november,in stowe township,pa,brooke wagner was walking on a sidewalk from a friend house to her home.she was fifteen years old.a man in a car approached her and asked if she wanted a ride.she told him no.he demanded that she get in the car.wagner again refused and told him that she would report him to the police.he sped away.she used her mobile phone to call her mother,who told her to go home.the mother then called the police.
both officer sciulli and officer antonio reymundo ruiz of the stowe township police department arrived at wagner home within minutes of the mother report.upon questioning by ruiz,wagner described the vehicle as a red,sedan.she said that the car had a pennsylvania license plate bearing the letters acg.she described the driver as a white male with dark hair,around years old.ruiz gave this information to sciulli,who then went to the location of the incident.sciulli prepared an incident investigation report that same day,recording the details wagner had provided.
the next day,the mother was driving wagner home from a grocery store when wagner saw a red car.she told her mother that it was the car that had stopped next to her the day before.she noted that the license number was.they followed the car until it stopped in a parking lot.her mother drove into the lot and parked.wagner observed the driver get out and walk into a building.she believed he was the man that tried to lure her into the car on the day before.
wagner mother then drove her directly to the police station.they met with sciulli and officer gruber wagner reported what she observed the red car,the full license number,and the driver.she also stated her conclusion that this was the car and man she encountered the previous day.the officers checked the license number,in the jnet database and identified the car as belonging to david andrews.they obtained andrews license photo and created a photo array with images of andrews and seven other men sciulli presented the lineup to wagner and instructed her to circle the picture of anyone she recognized.wagner circled the image of andrews.
after wagner and her mother left the station,sciulli went to the parking lot they said was the location of andrews car and he looked at the vehicle andrews automobile was not a sedan,but a red,coupe 
sciulli drafted an affidavit of probable cause to arrest andrews.the affidavit,dated november,stated 
officers were notified on at approximately hours,of a possible child luring incident.i,officer sciulli,and officer ruiz were dispatched to island avenue to meet the victim.at this time,officers spoke with the victim.the female juvenile information was obtained and is on record and said juvenile and parent will be present at all court hearings.
the victim female juvenile age stated that while walking home from a friend house,a red vehicle pulled up next to her while walking on the sidewalk and asked her juvenile age if she wanted a ride.the victim stated no.the defendant then said come on,just get in.the victim then said no,i fine.now i am going to report you.the victim then stated that the vehicle sped away.
the victim then described this male as a middle aged white male with dark hair with streaks of gray.victim described the vehicle as a red door sedan.
on,the victim spotted this same vehicle described above,driving on island avenue,while riding with her mother.she identified the plate as,pa tag.they followed the vehicle to axion,and victim again positively identified the male driver as the suspect she encountered the previous day.
the victim and her mother came to the station to give officers this information.officers ran the pa plate,and found it to be registered to david gene andrews,out of beaver falls.based on this information,officers created a line up using similar identifiers as andrews.
the victim was shown a line up,created by myself and officer gruber,generated by descriptors through sic.the victim was asked to look at the pictures and to see if there was anyone of the pictures that she recognized as the driver of the car.she was advised that he might or might not be in the pictures.the victim looked at the pictures and almost immediately picked out the picture of defendant.the defendant was identified through jnet drivers sic license as david gene andrews,dob redacted.
your affiant respectfully requests that a warrant be issued for david gene andrews based on the facts enumerated above.
the magisterial district judge reviewed the affidavit and issued the arrest warrant on november.that same day,police arrested andrews and charged him with luring a child into a motor vehicle,stalking,corruption of a minor,and harassment.in a bench trial,he was acquitted of all charges in june.andrews filed this lawsuit on november.the district court granted sciulli motion for summary judgment on september.this appeal followed.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.estate of smith marasco,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed civ.a.when we review the district court grant of summary judgment,we will reverse only in those instances when we conclude that material facts are in dispute,or when we determine that the undisputed facts viewed in a light most favorable to the party could objectively support a jury verdict in favor of the party.orsatti new jersey state police,cir.
andrews raises claims of false arrest and malicious prosecution against sciulli.to assess claims of false arrest,the court must determine whether the arresting officers had probable cause to believe the person arrested had committed the offense.dowling city of philadelphia,cir.malicious prosecution requires evidence that 
the defendant initiated a criminal proceeding the criminal proceeding ended in the plaintiff favor the proceeding was initiated without probable cause the defendant acted maliciously or for a purpose other than bringing the plaintiff to justice and the plaintiff suffered a deprivation of liberty consistent with the concept of seizure as a consequence of a legal proceeding.

however,sciulli contended at summary judgment that he has qualified immunity from this lawsuit because probable cause grounded the arrest and prosecution.g overnment officials performing discretionary functions,generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.orsatti,at quoting harlow fitzgerald.since the district court decided that no constitutional violation occurred,we examine this first.
the district court correctly ascertained that,since false arrest and malicious prosecution hinge on probable cause,the constitutional violation question in this case turns on whether a reasonable officer could have believed that probable cause existed to arrest the plaintiff at that time.blaylock city of philadelphia,cir.quoting hunter bryant.moreover,because sciulli arrested andrews on a valid warrant,the district court properly focused its probable cause analysis on whether sciulli knowingly and deliberately,or with a reckless disregard for the truth,made false statements or omissions that create d a falsehood in applying for a warrant.sherwood mulvihill,cir.therefore,we must concentrate on two elements first,whether the officer,with at least a reckless disregard for the truth,made false statements or omissions that create d a falsehood in applying for a warrant,and second,whether those assertions or omissions were material,or necessary,to the finding of probable cause.wilson russo,cir.quoting sherwood,at.dempsey bucknell,cir.
however,as we recently acknowledged,a certain tension exists when probable cause is at issue in a motion for summary judgment.dempsey,at.this is particularly so for analyses that center upon misrepresentations and omissions in the affidavit of probable cause.although a finding of probable cause generally can be based on an officer credibility determinations and independent assessments of conflicting evidence,it is axiomatic that at the summary judgment stage,we view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.dempsey,at.as a result 
we can not exclude from the probable cause analysis unfavorable facts an officer otherwise would have been able to consider.instead,we view all such facts and assess whether any reasonable jury could conclude that those facts,considered in their totality in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,did not demonstrate a fair probability that a crime occurred.
id.for these reasons we rely on our general rule that an assertion is made with reckless disregard when viewing all the evidence,the affiant must have entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his statements or had obvious reasons to doubt the accuracy of the information he reported.wilson,at quoting united states clapp,cir.misleading assertions can relate to even minor details,and do not need a separate determination of relevance.the focus in these instances is upon evidence demonstrating that the affiant willingly and affirmatively distort ed the truth.id.at.omissions are made with reckless disregard where an officer withholds a fact in his ken that a ny reasonable person would have known was the kind of thing the judge would wish to know.id.quoting united states jacobs,cir.
the district court found an omission in the affidavit sciulli prepared.it concluded that sciulli was aware that wagner reported a partial license plate acg on the day of the incident,but omitted it from his affidavit.it ruled that a reasonable person would know that a judge would want to see this in the probable cause affidavit.
the district court was also convinced that sciulli willfully made a number of false or misleading assertions.specifically,sciulli falsely represented wagner description of the perpetrator as a middle aged white male with dark hair with streaks of gray.appx.the police incident report sciulli prepared indicates she said that the man was about years old,with dark hair.appx.the district court noted that sciulli averments more closely aligned with andrews driver license photo,and concluded from this that sciulli actions went beyond carelessness or simple negligence.these were affirmative assertions of misleading information.
next,the district court was convinced that,due to the license plate differences,sciulli had an obvious reason to doubt that his assertion that wagner spotted the same vehicle the day after the incident.andrews,wl,at.similarly,it concluded sciulli statement that wagner positively identified andrews again was inaccurate because it overstated her confidence in the identification.none of these conclusions by the district court are at issue in this appeal 
we are convinced,however,that the district court erred by failing to identify an additional omission.in spite of ruling that sciulli reference to the same vehicle was a misleading assertion,the district court concluded that the record did not provide any evidence that the officer knew there were differences between andrews car and the perpetrator car.this is error sciulli affirmed that,after speaking with wagner and her mother on november,about the location of andrews car,he went to look at the vehicle.he was aware,at that time,that the car was not a sedan.
q.did you make any effort to go to the axiom parking lot to observe the vehicle that wagner or her mother said was there when they observed it on november,
okay,when did you go to that parking lot 
i ca recall an exact time.it would have been after speaking with them.
q.when you saw that vehicle,you knew that it was not a four door,correct 
appx.sciulli expressed uncertainty about the time,not the date,that he went to the parking lot.moreover,he admitted knowing that andrews car was different from wagner description.this is clear evidence that,at some point on november,sciulli knew that andrews car was different from the car wagner described the previous day sciulli equivocates only on whether he had this knowledge before he wrote the affidavit.appx.but,there is no dispute that sciulli signed and swore to the truthfulness of his affidavit on november.appx.this is significant.
when an officer submits a sworn affidavit of probable cause,he or she is not free to disregard plainly exculpatory evidence,even if substantial inculpatory evidence standing by itself suggests that probable cause exists.dempsey,at quoting wilson,at.therefore,even if sciulli drafted the affidavit on november,before going to the parking lot,he,at the very least,had good reason to doubt,on november,the truthfulness of his affidavit that falsely stated andrews car was the same red sedan that wagner described on the day of the incident.consistent with the district court ruling on the license plate number,we are confident that this omission regarding the discrepancy in the number of doors on the cars is something that any reasonable person would know that a judge would want to know.wilson,at.
the district court analysis focused on the omitted license plate number and the overstatement of confidence attached to wagner positive identification of andrews.but,it did not present a reconstructed affidavit that corrects misleading assertions and includes omitted evidence.the memorandum opinion was filed roughly eleven months before we clarified our requirement that courts perform a reconstruction of the affidavit to ensure that all relevant evidence known to the police officer at the time is considered in the materiality analysis.dempsey,at.therefore,particularly since we have concluded that there is an additional omission,we will in the interest of judicial economy reconstruct the affidavit,rather than require it to be done on remand.id.at.it reads as follows 
officers were notified on at approximately hours,of a possible child luring incident.i,officer sciulli,and officer ruiz were dispatched to island avenue to meet the victim.at this time,officers spoke with the victim.the female juvenile information was obtained and is on record and said juvenile and parent will be present at all court hearings.
the victim female juvenile age stated that while walking home from a friend house,a red vehicle with four doors pulled up next to her while walking on the sidewalk and asked her juvenile age if she wanted a ride.the victim stated no.the defendant then said come on,just get in.the victim then said no,i fine.now i am going to report you.the victim then stated that the vehicle sped away.
the victim then described this male as a middle aged white male with dark hair with streaks of gray about years old.victim described the vehicle as a red door sedan.she identified a partial license plate as acg,pa tag.
on,the victim spotted this same vehicle described above a vehicle,a red coupe,driving on island avenue,while riding with her mother.she identified the plate as,pa tag.they followed the vehicle to axion,and victim again positively identified the male driver as the suspect she encountered the previous day.
the victim and her mother came to the station to give officers this information.officers ran the pa plate,and found it to be registered to david gene andrews,out of beaver falls.based on this information,officers created a line up using similar identifiers as andrews.
the victim was shown a line up,created by myself and officer gruber,generated by descriptors through sic.the victim was asked to look at the pictures and to see if there was anyone of the pictures that she recognized as the driver of the car.she was advised that he might or might not be in the pictures.the victim looked at the pictures and almost immediately picked out the picture of defendant.the defendant was identified through jnet drivers sic license as david gene andrews,dob redacted.
your affiant respectfully requests that a warrant be issued for david gene andrews based on the facts enumerated above.
to affirm the district court grant of summary judgment,we must conclude that no reasonable jury could find facts that would lead to the conclusion that the reconstructed affidavit lacked probable cause.wilson,at.when the district court ruled that the omissions and misleading assertions it found were not material to probable cause,it did so convinced that there were no substantial distinctions between the facts in wilson and in this case.although we ultimately conclude that wilson is distinguished,it does provide a useful point of reference in our analysis of this case.
in wilson,a police officer darrin russo claimed that probable cause for a warrant existed because an eyewitness the owner of a floral shop that was robbed positively identified franklin wilson from a photo array.id.at.russo excluded some exculpatory evidence we decided that the exculpatory evidence russo left out did not fatally undermine the eyewitness positive identification and concluded that w hen a police officer has received a reliable identification by a victim of his or her attacker,the police have probable cause.id.at quoting sharrar felsing,cir.nonetheless,stressing that probable cause requires an individualized analysis,we also said that i ndependent exculpatory evidence or substantial evidence of the witness own unreliability that is known by the arresting officers could outweigh the identification such that probable cause would not exist.id.at.therefore,since the district court probable cause ruling in this case rests squarely on wagner positive identification of andrews,our materiality review centers on whether any of the misleading assertions and omitted facts that we corrected in our reconstructed affidavit could outweigh this identification,or undermine reliance on it.
the first changes to the affidavit concern wagner physical description of the perpetrator from the day of the incident.sciulli misrepresented the description by,as the district court noted,making it hue closer to the image of andrews driver license photo.the reconstructed affidavit reads as follows 
the victim then described this male as a middle aged white male with dark hair with streaks of gray about years old.
we agree with the district court application of wilson to these misleading assertions standing alone,they would not be material to probable cause.
in wilson,the police officer did not inform the court that the shop owner estimated the robber height on the day of the crime to be between and but,the man she identified three days later in a photo lineup wilson,was only.id.at.we ruled that this indication of unreliability does not,from the vantage point of the arresting officer,fatally undermine the forceful positive identification.id.at.
we elaborated,however,that different facts could produce different results.we posed the example of an officer who is aware that a witness described the robber as tall,but selected a person in a photo lineup who is actually tall.this substantial evidence of the witness own unreliability could change the probable cause analysis.id.at.we also gave a scenario in which an officer knows about reliable,independent,exculpatory dna evidence that contradicts a positive identification.in such a case the positive identification would not be enough to outweigh such evidence.id.these examples were,of course,illustrative of a common sense approach to the materiality analysis they are not rules.see illinois gates,p robable cause is a fluid concept turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts not readily,or even usually,reduced to a neat set of legal rules.see also goodwin conway,cir.probable cause analysis uses a common sense approach to issues grounded in a totality of the circumstances.nonetheless,we can safely extract from them a general principle that glaring discrepancies in a witness testimony can undermine the reliability of an eyewitness who provides a positive identification the same is true when our review uncovers highly reliable,independent,exculpatory evidence known by the officer.
applying this understanding to the facts in question here,sciulli misrepresentation of wagner description of the perpetrator age and hair,on its own,does not outweigh or undermine her positive identification.although sciulli misrepresentations did make wagner description of the perpetrator seem more like andrews,correcting middle aged to read about,and deleting a reference to a streaks of gray in the perpetrator hair are,by our lights,trivial differences that would not impact a reasonable jury conclusions about probable cause.sciulli misrepresentation made his description of the perpetrator age inaccurate and more vague.but,as with the height difference in wilson,an estimate of age is inherently grounded in a subjective approximation that allows for reasonable margins of error.here,even after making appropriate corrections,we regard the difference between about and andrews actual age at that time as difficult to visualize or estimate in any precise way,falling within a margin of error that is expected with approximations of this type.therefore,this misleading assertion did not obscure a discrepancy that is meaningful enough,by itself,to create doubt about the credibility of the witness for these reasons,we conclude that sciulli misrepresentation,standing alone,would not be material to the determination of probable cause here.similarly,sciulli misrepresentation of wagner description of the perpetrator hair adding the detail of streaks of gray was also undeniably inaccurate,and made the description sound closer to andrews hair color.nonetheless,wagner more general reference to dark hair is still inculpatory albeit less strong,given that andrews had black hair,and would not,by itself,be material to probable cause.
in summary,we conclude that this collection of misrepresentations in sciulli affidavit concerning the physical description of andrews,standing alone,would not be sufficient to prevent a from concluding that the reconstructed affidavit still established probable cause 
we turn,next,to the portion of the reconstructed affidavit dealing with cars that wagner linked to the crime.we made the following corrections.
victim described the vehicle as a red door sedan.she identified a partial license plate as acg,pa tag.
on,the victim spotted this same vehicle described above a vehicle,a red coupe,driving on island avenue,while riding with her mother.
we agree with the district court that sciulli assertion that andrews car was the same vehicle conveyed a higher degree of confidence in wagner positive identification than was due.its materiality to probable cause,however,is best understood in the context of the omissions that accompany it.therefore,we now turn to those.
sciulli affidavit hid from the magisterial district judge the partial license plate number on the car wagner described immediately after the crime.it also did not disclose that andrews car was a coupe.these details plainly distinguish andrews car from wagner initial description.unlike wagner age estimate,these are irreconcilable differences that are not easily or reasonably explained.importantly,sciulli does not dispute this.he argues only that he did not have timely knowledge of the differences.all of this gives weight to the conclusion that these discrepancies are substantial evidence of the witness own unreliability sufficient to outweigh her positive identification of andrews.id.at.however,there is one additional aspect of this case that is decisive on this issue for us.we can explain it most easily by focusing on a portion of our decision in wilson that,thus far,has not been discussed.
in wilson,three witnesses contributed information that led to the decision by police to put wilson image in a photo array.a floral shop owner and employee eyewitnesses to the crime gave physical descriptions of the robber,but neither of them knew anything about the robber identity.the third witness a woman who worked nearby in a dental office was not an eyewitness to the crime.but,upon hearing th
