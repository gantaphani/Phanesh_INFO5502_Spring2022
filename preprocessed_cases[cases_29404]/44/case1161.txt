opinion of the court 
this court internal operating procedure provides 
it is the tradition of this court that the holding of a panel in a precedential opinion is binding on subsequent panels.thus,no subsequent panel overrules the holding in a precedential opinion of a previous panel.court en banc consideration is required to do so.
third circuit.we adhere strictly to that tradition.it is only on a rare occasion that we overrule a prior precedential opinion.we assemble en banc to consider whether this is such an occasion.
in the appeal before us,the bankruptcy court,affirmed by the district court,followed our precedent in avellino bienes frenville matter of frenville,cir frenville,to hold that a plan of reorganization did not discharge tort claims filed by mary van brunt and her husband gordon the van brunts against grossman.the underlying asbestos exposure occurred but the injury manifested itself.the appellant,successor to defendant grossman and its affiliates hereafter grossman,asks us to overrule the holding of frenville.
background 
in,appellee mary van brunt,who was remodeling her home,purchased products that allegedly contained asbestos.she purchased those products in upstate new york from grossman,a home improvement and lumber retailer.in april,grossman filed petitions under chapter of the bankruptcy code,et.
the following are among the undisputed facts set forth in the bankruptcy court findings of fact a t the time of the bankruptcy,grossman had actual knowledge that it had previously sold asbestos containing products such as gypsum board and joint compound grossman knew of the adverse health risks associated with exposure to asbestos it was aware that asbestos manufacturers had been or were being sued by asbestos claimants it was aware that producers of both gypsum board and joint compound were being sued for injuries and it was not aware of any product liability lawsuits based upon alleged exposure to products that had been filed against it app.at.
grossman proceeded to provide notice by publication of the deadline for filing proofs of claim.there was no suggestion in the publication notice that grossman might have future asbestos liability.grossman chapter plan of reorganization purported to discharge all claims that arose before the plan effective date.the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan of reorganization in december.
van brunt did not file a proof of claim before confirmation of the plan of reorganization because,at the time,she was unaware of any claim as she manifested no symptoms related to asbestos exposure.it was only in,almost ten years later,that van brunt began to manifest symptoms of mesothelioma,a cancer linked to asbestos exposure.she was diagnosed with the disease in march.
shortly after her diagnosis,the van brunts filed an action for tort and breach of warranty in a new york state court against,the to grossman and other companies who allegedly manufactured the products that van brunt purchased from grossman in.van brunt conceded that she did not know the manufacturer of any of the products that she acquired from grossman for her remodeling projects in.after the van brunts filed their suit,moved to reopen the chapter case,seeking a determination that their claims were discharged by the plan.van brunt died in while the case was pending.gordon van brunt has been substituted in her stead as the representative of her estate.
the bankruptcy court concluded that the plan of reorganization did not discharge the van brunts claims because they arose after the effective date of the plan,van brunt in re grossman,in re grossman i.in so holding,the bankruptcy court relied on our decisions in frenville and its progeny.id.at citing frenville,at schweitzer consol.rail,cir.frenville held that a claim,as that term is defined by the bankruptcy code,arises when the underlying state law cause of action accrues.at citing.the applicable new york law provides that a cause of action for injury does not accrue until the injury manifests itself.in re grossman i,at citations omitted.the bankruptcy court therefore reasoned that the van brunts had no claim subject to discharge in because van brunt did not manifest symptoms of thus the new york cause of action did not.id.the bankruptcy court entered judgment for the van brunts and against,effectively allowing the van brunts to proceed with their claims in the new york state court id.at.
the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court decision in every respect but one.see van brunt in re grossman,in re grossman ii.the district court reversed the bankruptcy court conclusion that the breach of warranty claim arose,reasoning that the claim accrued under new york law at the time of delivery of the product and was discharged in the grossman bankruptcy.id.at.the van brunts have not appealed that determination.instead,appeals the district court affirmance of the bankruptcy court holding that the van brunts tort claims were not claims under.

discussiona.the frenville accrual test 
in,frenville was the subject of an involuntary petition for bankruptcy filed in new jersey under chapter of the bankruptcy reform act of,et the code.see frenville,at.thereafter,involuntary petitions under chapter of the code were filed against two principals of the company id.
later that year,four banks filed a lawsuit in a new york state court against the company former accountants,avellino bienes a b,alleging that a b negligently and recklessly prepared the company financial statements and seeking damages for their alleged losses exceeding five million dollars.id.at.a b filed a complaint in the bankruptcy court in new jersey seeking relief from the automatic stay in order to implead frenville as a defendant in order to obtain indemnification or contribution under new york law.id.at.the bankruptcy court,affirmed by the district court,held that the automatic stay barred a b action.id.at.a b appealed.
we reversed,holding that because the automatic stay applied only to claims that arose,under new york law a b did not have a right to payment for its claim for indemnification or contribution from frenville until after the banks filed their suit against a id.at.it followed that a b claim against frenville arose even though the conduct upon which a b liability was predicated negligent preparation of frenville financial statements occurred.id.at.it followed that the automatic stay was inapplicable.we emphasized that the crucial issue was when the right to payment arose as determined by reference to the new york law that governed the indemnification claim.id.at.
this court subsequently summarized frenville as holding that the existence of a valid claim depends on whether the claimant possessed a right to payment and when that right arose as determined by reference to the relevant law.kilbarr servs,office of supply servs.in re remington rand,cir citing frenville,at.the frenville test for determining when a claim arises has been referred to as the accrual test.
in the case before us,the district court and bankruptcy court correctly applied the accrual test in holding that the van brunts tort claims were not discharged by the plan of reorganization.according to frenville,the claims arose for bankruptcy purposes when the underlying state law cause of action accrued.see frenville,at.the new york tort cause of action accrued in when van brunt manifested symptoms of mesothelioma the claims were therefore under frenville.
the question remains,however,whether we should continue to follow frenville and its accrual test.we have recognized that s ignificant authority contrary to frenville exists in other circuits jones chemetron,cir.a sister circuit has described our approach in frenville as universally rejected.cadleway,andrews in re andrews,cir.the courts of appeals that have considered frenville have uniformly declined to follow it.see watson parker in re parker,cir in re andrews,at am.law ctr.pc stanley in re jastrem,cir epstein official comm.of unsecured creditors of the estate of piper aircraft in re piper aircraft,cir woburn assocs.kahn in re hemingway,cir grady robins,cir see also official comm.of asbestos pers.injury claimants sealed air.in re grace,frenville has proved a remarkably unpopular decision and no other circuit court of appeals has followed it.at least one bankruptcy court has stated that frenville may be fairly characterized as one of the most criticized and least followed precedents decided under the current bankruptcy code.firearms imp.exp.united capital ins.in re firearms imp.exp,see also in re pan am.hosp,noting that the decision has been sharply criticized and widely rejected by other courts.
in addition to the cases cited above,cites numerous district court and bankruptcy court decisions that have declined to follow frenville the criticism has been echoed by commentators.see,ralph mabey annette jarvis,in re frenville a critique by the national bankruptcy conference committee on claims and distributions,bus.law.
notwithstanding what appears to be universal disapproval,we decide cases before us based on our own examination of the issue,not on the views of other jurisdictions.nevertheless,those widely held views impel us to consider whether the reasoning applied by our colleagues elsewhere is persuasive.
courts have declined to follow frenville because of its apparent conflict with the bankruptcy code expansive treatment of the term claim.the bankruptcy code,which was adopted by the bankruptcy reform act of,stat,defines a claim as 
a right to payment,whether or not such right is reduced to judgment,liquidated,unliquidated,fixed,contingent,matured,unmatured,disputed,undisputed,legal,equitable,secured,or unsecured 
emphasis added.the house and senate reports make explicit that the effect of the definition is a significant departure from then present law which did not define claim,at,reprinted in,at,reprinted in.in adopting the new definition of claim,the reports state that b y this broadest possible definition of the term claim the bill contemplates that all legal obligations of the debtor,no matter how remote or contingent,will be able to be dealt with in the bankruptcy case and permits the broadest possible relief in the bankruptcy court,at.
the supreme court has likewise noted that claim has the broadest available definition fcc next wave pers.commc ns,quoting johnson home state bank,see also in re remington rand,at,congress defined claim in the broadest possible terms and unambiguously stated its intent to address all possible legal obligations in defining a bankruptcy claim citations omitted.the supreme court has stated that,
i n determining what claims are allowable and how a debtor assets shall be distributed,a bankruptcy court does not apply the law of the state where it sits b ankruptcy courts must administer and enforce the bankruptcy act as interpreted by this court in accordance with authority granted by congress to determine how and what claims shall be allowed under equitable principles.
vanston bondholders protective comm.green.
the frenville court focused on the right to payment language in and,according to some courts,impos ed too narrow an interpretation on the term claim,piper,at,by failing to give sufficient weight to the words modifying it contingent,unmatured,and unliquidated.the accrual test in frenville does not account for the fact that a claim can exist under the code before a right to payment exists under state law.
we are persuaded that the widespread criticism of frenville accrual test is justified,as it imposes too narrow an interpretation of a claim under the bankruptcy code.accordingly,the frenville accrual test should be and now is overruled.
b.when a claim arises 
our decision to overrule frenville leaves a void in our jurisprudence as to when a claim arises.that decision has various implications.one such implication involves the application of the automatic stay provided in of the bankruptcy code which operates to stay the commencement or continuation of any action or proceeding that was or could have been commenced against the debtor.see a.the fourth circuit has stated,t he automatic stay is one of the fundamental debtor protections provided by the bankruptcy laws.it gives the debtor a breathing spell from his creditors.grady,at quoting,at,reprinted in,at,reprinted in.it is applicable,however,only to stay a claim that arose.see u.a.
principal among the effects of the determination when a claim arises is the effect on the dischargeability of a claim.under u.d a of the code,the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges the debtor from any debt that arose before the date of such confirmation a debt is defined as liability on a claim,id,which in turn is defined as a right to payment,id.this is consistent with congress intent to provide debtors with a fresh start,an objective,noted the second circuit,made more feasible by maximizing the scope of a discharge.united states ltv in re chateaugay,cir.on the other hand,a broad discharge may disadvantage potential claimants,such as tort claimants,whose injuries were allegedly caused by the debtor but which have not yet manifested and who therefore had no reason to file claims in the bankruptcy.these competing considerations have not been resolved consistently by the cases decided to date.
moreover,the determination when a claim arises has significant due process implications.if potential future tort claimants have not filed claims because they are unaware of their injuries,they might challenge the effectiveness of any purported notice of the claims bar date.discharge of such claims without providing adequate notice raises questions under the fourteenth amendment.see mullane cent.hanover bank trust.
the courts have generally divided into two groups on the decision as to when a claim arises for purposes of the code,with numerous variations.one group has applied the conduct test and the other has applied what has been termed the relationship test.illustrative of the cases that have adopted the conduct test is the decision of the fourth circuit in grady,at.
in grady,the plaintiff had inserted a dalkon shield intrauterine contraceptive device several years before the manufacturer filed a petition for chapter bankruptcy.id.at.the plaintiff alleged that she experienced injuries from the dalkon shield,including the need for a hysterectomy.id.the district court,which did not refer the case to the bankruptcy court,determined that the plaintiff claim arose when the acts giving rise to the defendant liability were performed,not when the harm caused by those acts was manifested.id.citation omitted.the court of appeals affirmed,finding that the plaintiff held a contingent claim that arose before the commencement of the bankruptcy case.id.at.the court cautioned that it was not deciding whether grady claim or those of future tort claimants are dischargeable in this case.id.at.it held only that because the dalkon shield was inserted in the claimant before the filing of the bankruptcy petition,it constituted a claim within the meaning of the automatic stay.a,a claim id.
in contrast,the eleventh circuit criticized a conduct test that would enable individuals to hold a claim against a debtor by virtue of their potential future exposure to the debtor product,regardless of whether the claimant had any relationship or contact with the debtor.in re piper,at.it stated that approach would define a claim too broadly in certain circumstances and would stretch the scope of too far.id.similarly,a commentator observed that under the conduct test,c laimants who did not use or have any exposure to the dangerous product until long after the bankruptcy case has concluded would nonetheless be subject to the terms of a preexisting confirmed chapter plan.alan resnick,bankruptcy as a vehicle for resolving mass tort liability.these claimants may be unidentifiable because of their lack of contact with the debtor or the product and,accordingly,may not have had the benefit of notice and an opportunity to participate in the bankruptcy case.id.
some of the courts concerned that the conduct test may be too broad have adopted what has been referred to as a relationship test.see in re piper,at.under this test,a claim arises from a debtor tortious conduct where there is also some relationship between the debtor and the claimant,such as a purchase,use,operation of,or exposure to the debtor product.see also lemelle,cir in re chateaugay,at one commentator opined that t he relationship test ameliorates the problem often attributed to the conduct test that a bankruptcy proceeding can not identify and afford due process to claimants.barbara houser,chapter as a mass tort solution,loy.
in lemelle,the plaintiff brought a wrongful death action against the successor corporation of a mobile home manufacturer that had emerged from chapter proceedings.at.the plaintiff alleged that the decedent death was caused by the manufacturer defective mobile home design and construction.id.the decedent died in a fire allegedly caused by the manufacturing defect about two years after the debtor plan of reorganization was confirmed and approximately fifteen years after the design and manufacture of the mobile home.id.at.the district court determined that the plan of reorganization discharged all of the debtor obligations,including the liability on the tort claim.id.at.
the fifth circuit reversed,noting that in order for the plaintiff wrongful death claim to have been discharged in the debtor bankruptcy,at a minimum,there must be evidence that would permit the debtor to identify,during the course of the bankruptcy proceedings,potential victims and thereby permit notice to these potential victims of the pendency of the proceedings.id.at citation omitted.the court found that the record was devoid of any evidence of any contact,privity,or other relationship between the debtor,on the one hand,and the plaintiff or the decedents,on the other.id.the court concluded that absent any such evidence,the district court could not find that the claims asserted by the plaintiff were discharged in the debtor bankruptcy proceedings.id.the court reasoned that even the broad definition of claim can not be extended to include claimants whom the record indicates were completely unknown and unidentified at the time the debtor filed its petition and whose rights depended entirely on the fortuity of future occurrences.id.
the second circuit followed a similar approach in an environmental regulatory context.in in re chateaugay,at,the court held that the epa costs of responding to a release of hazardous waste,even if not yet incurred at the time of bankruptcy,involved claims under.the court reasoned that t he relationship between environmental regulating agencies and those subject to regulation provides sufficient contemplation of contingencies to bring most ultimately maturing payment obligations based on conduct within the definition of claims under the bankruptcy code.id.at.
a somewhat modified approach was taken by the eleventh circuit in a case involving the bankruptcy of piper aircraft,a manufacturer of general aviation aircraft and spare aircraft parts.in re piper.the bankruptcy court,affirmed by the district court,held that a class of future claimants who might assert,after confirmation of the debtor plan of reorganization,personal injury or property damage claims against piper based on its aircraft products that were manufactured or sold before the confirmation date,did not have claims under.see id.at.the bankruptcy and district courts had adopted the relationship test which,according to the court of appeals,requires some prepetition relationship,such as contact,exposure,impact,or privity,between the debtor conduct and the claimant in order for the claimant to have a claim.id.at internal quotation and citation omitted.
the court of appeals agreed that the relationship test was generally superior to either our test in frenville,id.at,or the conduct test adopted by other courts of appeals,id.at.it also held that claimants having contact with the debtor product,but prior to confirmation,also could be identified during the course of the bankruptcy procedure.id.it thus framed what it chose to denominate as the piper test as follows 
a n individual has a claim against a debtor manufacturer if i events occurring before confirmation create a relationship,such as contact,exposure,impact,or privity,between the claimant and the debtor product and ii the basis for liability is the debtor prepetition conduct in designing,manufacturing and selling the allegedly defective or dangerous product.
id.at.the court stated that t he debtor prepetition conduct gives rise to a claim to be administered in a case only if there is a relationship established before confirmation between an identifiable claimant or group of claimants and that prepetition conduct.id.
the court of appeals observed that the courts applying the conduct test also presume some prepetition relationship between the debtor conduct and the claimant.in re parker,at noting that the relationship in the case before us would meet either the conduct test or the prepetition relationship test.the relationship test operates much like the conduct test,but it requires a relationship between the debtor and the putative claimant.see in re pan am,at discussing same.
the relationship test in piper has been criticized for narrowing the definition of claim under.see,michelle morgan,the denial of future tort claims in in re piper aircraft will the court solution keep the debtor flying high or bring it crashing down,loy.chi.in a final report issued in,the national bankruptcy review commission proposed a definition of claim that incorporated the conduct test,albeit with some limitations,rather than the relationship test see.comm n,bankruptcy the next twenty years,national bankruptcy review commission final report at,reprinted in volume g collier on bankruptcy app.pt.alan resnick henry sommer,ed.
in addition,various bankruptcy courts have followed a form of the conduct test when considering the existence of an claim.see,in re quigley,if the asbestos pi claimant was exposed to asbestos before the quigley petition date,he or she holds a claim.in re lloyd mitchell,a claim for injury by a asbestos victim arises upon exposure,not manifestation.citing grady,at.
irrespective of the title used,there seems to be something approaching a consensus among the courts that a prerequisite for recognizing a claim is that the claimant exposure to a product giving rise to the claim occurred,even though the injury manifested after the reorganization.we agree and hold that a claim arises when an individual is exposed to a product or other conduct giving rise to an injury,which underlies a right to payment under the bankruptcy code.see.applied to the van brunts,it means that their claims arose sometime in,the date mary van brunt alleged that grossman product exposed her to asbestos.
that does not necessarily mean that the van brunts claims were discharged by the plan of reorganization.any application of the test to be applied can not be divorced from fundamental principles of due process notice is a n elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality mullane,at.without notice of a bankruptcy claim,the claimant will not have a meaningful opportunity to protect his or her claim.see a there shall be given such notice as is appropriate of an order for relief under the bankruptcy code.inadequate notice therefore precludes discharge of a claim in bankruptcy.chemetron,at.this issue has arisen starkly in the situation presented by persons with asbestos injuries that are not manifested until years or even decades after exposure.
the most innovative approach yet to the asbestos problem was adopted by the new york bankruptcy court as part of the manville plan of reorganization.see in the matter of.in an effort to grapple with a social,economic and legal crisis of national importance w
