david and sylvia mckinney collectively,the mckinneys appeal from the district court dismissal of their and state tort law claims.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
factual and procedural history 
first we will summarize the facts alleged in the mckinneys complaint,which for purposes of the motion to dismiss are accepted as true and construed in the light most favorable to the mckinneys.see nolen nucentrix broadband networks,cir.
david mckinney mckinney was employed by the irving independent school district iisd as a teacher at the gilbert transitional center gilbert,a public school for students with severe behavioral problems,emotional disturbances,and learning disabilities.in december of,mckinney agreed to also drive the bus that brought the students to and from gilbert 
students are referred to gilbert from other schools in the iisd because gilbert provides a more heavily structured and supervised environment.no student is assigned to gilbert without going through a process known as admission,review and dismissal ard,when placement at gilbert may be formally recommended.gilbert is the most restrictive placement option available for public school students in the iisd.
due to the needs of the students at gilbert,the school environment is heavily monitored and supervised however,the iisd did not take similar care on the school bus.shortly after mckinney began driving the bus,he began to document frequent and serious behavioral problems on his bus route,including students fighting,throwing objects at other motorists,and leaping from the emergency exit in the rear of the bus into traffic.on one occasion,mckinney called for assistance because he was unable to operate the bus safely while also monitoring the students conduct.because of these behavioral problems,mckinney repeatedly requested that the iisd place a monitor on the bus to supervise the students and ensure his safety,the safety of the children,and the safety of other motorists mckinney requests for the appointment of a monitor were directed specifically to sandra mayes mayes and patricia kelley kelley.madeleine teal teal also had authority to appoint a bus monitor and was involved in the decisionmaking process.mckinney requests were denied.
on november,mckinney was driving through traffic when he was attacked by a student,who sprayed him in the eyes with a fire extinguisher.although mckinney vision and ability to drive were greatly impaired,he was able to safely maneuver the bus to a stop.as a result of the attack,mckinney has sustained significant injuries,including asthma and reactive airways disease that impair his ability to talk,his physical endurance,and his stamina,and he has been unable to teach or drive a school bus.
on november,the mckinneys filed the instant suit against the iisd and three of its employees,mayes,kelley,and teal,collectively,defendants.the complaint alleged that defendants acted under color of law to deprive mckinney of his due process rights under the fourteenth amendment by knowingly and affirmatively creating a dangerous environment,which they knew to be dangerous,that resulted in his foreseeable injuries and by failing to implement a policy to ensure his safety and thus acting with deliberate indifference to his safety.specifically,the complaint contended that by concentrating and segregating the special education students with known behavioral problems into one school and one transportation population,and by adopting and adhering to a policy that did not require the assignment of any supervision to those students on the school bus,defendants created the dangerous environment that was the actual and proximate cause of mckinney injuries and violated his rights to liberty,bodily integrity,and a safe environment.accordingly,mckinney maintained that defendants were liable under based on a danger theory.mckinney additionally asserted state law claims of negligence under the texas tort claims act and common law negligence.his wife,sylvia mckinney,brought a claim for loss of consortium.
on december,defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.they argued that the danger theory of recovery under has not been adopted by this circuit,and that the claims fail.
on january,the district court granted defendants motion,refused the mckinneys request for leave to amend their complaint,and entered final judgment in favor of defendants.the district court noted that this court has not expressly adopted the theory as a basis for liability under,but nevertheless held that,even if mckinney could maintain a viable claim based on such a theory,the complaint did not allege facts sufficient to establish such a claim.specifically,the district court determined that,although the pleadings described a dangerous environment,there were no allegations of facts showing that defendants conduct increased the danger.the district court noted that it was the students conduct that made mckinney working environment dangerous and reasoned that while defendants may have failed to limit or reduce the danger,that was not the same as having increased it.the district court also concluded that the complaint did not allege facts sufficient to establish that defendants were deliberately indifferent because the student attack on mckinney could have occurred regardless of whether a monitor was placed on the bus,and defendants did not affirmatively place mckinney in a position of danger,stripping mckinney of his ability to defend himself,or cut off mckinney potential sources of private aid.the district court found compelling the fact that mckinney was voluntarily on the bus,and could have resigned in order to avoid the dangerous situation,meaning that no due process obligation on defendants part was triggered.the district court further determined that the state law claims failed.the mckinneys now appeal.

the mckinneys argue that the district court erred in dismissing their claim they contend that the district court erred in its determination that,even if the danger theory were viable,the complaint did not contain sufficient allegations to support the theory.they also devote a large portion of their brief to the argument that this court should recognize and explicitly adopt the danger theory.we decline to do so.in light of the recent holding of our en banc court in mcclendon city of columbia,cir en banc mcclendon ii,the mckinneys do not state a viable substantive due process claim under regardless of the theory of liability,because they have failed to allege that iisd acted with deliberate indifference.
