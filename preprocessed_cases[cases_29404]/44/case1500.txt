laura sennett appeals the district court order granting summary judgment to the united states on her claim seeking money damages for alleged violations of the privacy protection act ppa.see.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
the facts are essentially undisputed.sennett is a photojournalist who claims a special interest in covering protests,political demonstrations,and grassroots activism.since,sennett has published her photographs under the pseudonym isis in various publications such as the toronto free press.sennett has also posted her photography and commentary on her website,her personal blog and the internet in general.
on april,sennett received a phone tip that there would be a demonstration during the international monetary fund imf annual spring meeting at the four seasons hotel in washington,where some of the delegates that attended the meeting were housed.following the tip,sennett arrived at the four seasons at approximately on april,in order to photograph the protest.according to sennett,she was unaware that the purported protesters planned to destroy property or commit other criminal acts she merely intended to photograph the event and publish the resulting photographs.
the incident was captured on tape by hotel surveillance cameras,which showed a group of about sixteen individuals gathered at the main entrance of the hotel.many in the group were wearing masks,black hooded jackets,and sunglasses,although some made no effort to disguise their identities.a number of the individuals wore backpacks.several of the individuals entered the hotel lobby and threw firecrackers and pyrotechnic devices,along with balloons,at various targets in the lobby.at some point,one of the individuals in the lobby shattered a large glass window by the entrance.after the vandals left the building,all of the individuals,including those who had remained outside of the hotel lobby,fled on foot or by bicycle.the hotel estimated that the protesters caused more than in property damage.
officer vincent antignano,who was a detective with the prince william county police department and a deputized federal marshal for the fbi joint terrorism task force,investigated the incident.in reviewing the hotel security camera footage,officer antignano noticed a white female using a small handheld camera to videotape or photograph the protest.the unidentified photographer wore dark clothing,a light colored beret,black combat boots,and she carried a gray and black backpack.she could be seen arriving at the four seasons hotel at the same time as the other individuals in the group.like several others present,the photographer did not enter the lobby and remained outside during the incident in the lobby.and,after the people who damaged the lobby exited the hotel,the unidentified female fled from the hotel with or in the same general direction as the protesters.
eventually,officer antignano identified the female photographer as sennett.in his affidavit in support of a search warrant for her residence,officer antignano explained that he discovered sennett identity based on tips provided by two reliable sources 
a reliable source rs who is not in the position to testify,but has provided reliable information in the past,advised that the unidentified white female has been seen at several protests throughout the washington dc area.furthermore,she is frequently seen wearing the light colored beret and black combat boots at demonstrations in the washington dc area.
with the help of open source websites google,youtube,a white female matching the same physical description was observed on videotape demonstrating in front of fbi headquarters on december.she was also observed demonstrating in front of the church of scientology on february.during both events,she was observed wearing the same light colored beret and black combat boots captured on hotel security cameras.
a second reliable source rs,who is not in the position to testify,but has provided reliable information in the past,advised that the unidentified white female goes by the name of isis.the source was able to provide a cellular telephone number 
o pen source information regarding the cellular telephone number revealed a laura sennett living in arlington,virginia.a photograph obtained from virginia dmv of sennett matched the female captured on the hotel security cameras.
officer antignano obtained sennett address using the foregoing information,and various officers conducted surveillance of her residence and confirmed that sennett lived there.
based on this information,officer antignano sought a search warrant,believing it likely that sennett residence contained evidence of suspected criminal activity that occurred during the imf protest at the four seasons,including burning or destroying a dwelling,see manufacturing,possessing,or using fire bombs or explosives,see and injuring property,see.the magistrate issued the requested warrant.the warrant authorized seizure of items connected with the imf protest,such as clothing worn by sennett during the event,along with essentially anything that might store pictures or video 
any and all computers and peripheral devices,such as but not limited to desktop,laptop,mobile and handheld computers,printers,scanners,external drives and tapes,cds,dvds,thumb drives,flash cards,and any other digital media capable of storing digital or electronic data.any and all computer hardware and software that is used with the operation of these computers,to view or create data any and all cell phones,personal digital assistants,and other devices in which records and data may be stored.any and all beret s,black style boots,backpack,including any identifiable clothing related to the offense.gunpowder,smoke devices,firecrackers,flash powder,hobby cord,and any or all items related to smoke generating pyrotechnic devices,paint,balloons,or similar items that may have been used in the commission of the instant offense.
on september,officer antignano and numerous other law enforcement officers executed the search warrant.the agents seized dozens of items,including an external hard drive allegedly containing more than photographs,two computers,several cameras,and several camera memory cards.according to sennett complaint,three officers,including officer antignano,told sennett during the raid that they knew she was a photojournalist.sennett purportedly admitted during the search that she was present and took photos at the hotel during the protest,and that the photos were located on her computer.sennett was never arrested or charged with any crimes relating to this incident.
believing the search of her apartment to be unlawful,sennett brought this action against the united states under the privacy protection act ppa.see et the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the united states.the court concluded that the suspect exception to the ppa,see a,barred sennett claim because there was probable cause to believe that sennett was involved in criminal activity at the four seasons hotel on april,and the search of her home related to the investigation of that incident.see sennett united states,d.
on appeal,sennett argues,as she did below,that summary judgment was inappropriate because the facts,if viewed in a light most favorable to her,did not permit a finding of probable cause.we disagree.
congress passed the ppa in response to zurcher stanford daily,d,in which the supreme court held that the fourth amendment does not prohibit the search of a newspaper office for photographs revealing the identities of those who assaulted police officers during a demonstration,even though no one employed by the newspaper was suspected of involvement.see guest leis,cir t he ppa was enacted to afford the press and certain other persons not suspected of committing a crime with protections not provided currently by the fourth amendment.internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,the ppa prohibits government searches for documents and materials that are intended for publication.see a b prohibiting the search for and seizure of materials possessed with a purpose to disseminate to the public citicasters mccaskill,cir explaining
