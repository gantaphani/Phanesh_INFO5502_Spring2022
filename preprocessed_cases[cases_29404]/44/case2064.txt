in this case appellants lloyd blackmore blackmore and new star freight service new star contend the district court erred in admitting the testimony of a grief expert and in upholding the jury damage award to appellee frank vogler vogler for the future mental anguish and loss of society due to the deaths of his wife and young child.in addition,blackmore and new star maintain the district court erred in upholding the jury award for conscious pain and suffering on the part of the decedents.we affirm in part,order a remittitur in part,and reverse in part.
facts and proceedings 
blackmore,employed by new star as a truck driver,was driving a rig south on highway near huntington,texas.becky vogler vogler and her daughter kallie vogler kallie were approaching blackmore rig on highway,driving north.kallie was in a seat in the backseat of vogler honda accord.blackmore veered onto the right shoulder,rode the shoulder for some distance,and then came back onto the highway.blackmore,however,and the truck crossed the center line and jackknifed into vogler lane.at some point during these events,vogler car left her lane of traffic and edged both wheels off the pavement.in addition,the honda speed slowed to miles per hour the rig first struck the front of vogler car.the honda then rotated around so that the passenger side was hit by the truck.finally,the ran over the roof of the car from front to back.both vogler and kallie were dead by the time they were removed from their vehicle.
vogler husband,vogler vogler surviving minor children by her first marriage,shelby conway and clayton conway shelby and clayton and vogler parents,henry and debra franklin the franklins filed a wrongful death suit against blackmore and new star.shelby and clayton settled with blackmore and new star prior to trial,and the franklins settled after the verdict but before the appeal.only vogler claims,and more specifically,his damages,are currently at issue.blackmore and new star do not contest the jury finding of liability on appeal.
at trial,in addition to testimony by vogler himself,the collective plaintiffs put forth an expert in thanatology referred to by blackmore and new star as a grief expert.this expert,phyllis silverman silverman,has a bachelor degree in psychology and sociology,a master in social work,and a in public health.she is also licensed as a social worker.she has published papers and approximately other writings in journals,chapters in books,and complete books.she was a visiting scholar and resident in women studies at brandeis,an adjunct professor at smith college school for social work,and a professor and professor emeritus at the massachusetts general hospital institute of health professions.because she had not interviewed or evaluated the collective plaintiffs,the district court confined her testimony to general theories of grief and recovery.
after finding blackmore and new star liable for the deaths of vogler and kallie,the jury awarded vogler damages both individually and as the representative of the estates of his wife and child.the jury awarded to vogler estate for her pain and mental anguish prior to her death,and to kallie estate for her pain and mental anguish prior to her death.vogler received for his pecuniary loss,loss of companionship and society,and mental anguish because of the loss of vogler that was sustained in the past,and for his future suffering in the same capacity,as well as his loss of vogler future earnings.he was similarly compensated for his loss of companionship and society and mental anguish sustained in the past because of kallie death,and for his future suffering because of the loss of his daughter.no punitive damages were awarded by the jury.the district court upheld the jury awards against blackmore and new star,denying their motions for new trial or for remittitur,and for partial judgment as a matter of law.blackmore and new star timely appeal.
ii.standard of review 
t he question of admissibility of expert testimony is reviewable under the standard.joiner,d.although this court has not ruled specifically on the admissibility of the testimony of grief experts,the admissibility of expert evidence generally is governed by the standard enunciated in daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,which permits admission of testimony only if it is both relevant and reliable.id.at.even if the expert testimony was improperly admitted,we next review the error under the harmless error doctrine,affirming the judgment,unless the ruling affected substantial rights of the complaining party.bocanegra vicmar,cir.
blackmore and new star characterize the future damages awarded to vogler as excessive,entitling blackmore and new star to either a new trial or remittitur.when a jury findings are not being attacked directly,but instead are challenged through a district court decision not to grant a new trial or remittitur,the standard of review is one of abuse of discretion.esposito davis,cir.t here is no abuse of discretion denying a motion for new trial unless there is a complete absence of evidence to support the verdict.id.
we give special solicitude to findings of damages for grief and emotional distress,in large part 
b ecause the assessment of damages for grief and emotional distress is so dependent on the facts and is so largely a matter judgment,we are chary of substituting our views for those of the trial judge.he has seen the parties and heard the evidence we have only read papers.the jury assessment of damages is even more weighted against appellate reconsideration,especially when the trial judge has approved it.
in re air crash disaster near new orleans,on july,cir.it is under this narrow review that the jury awards to vogler must be evaluated.
on the issue of whether damages should be awarded at all,this court treads lightly upon jury verdicts,as the standard of review is very deferential absent an error of law,the reviewing court will sustain the amount of damages awarded by the fact finder,unless the amount is clearly erroneous or so gross or inadequate as to be contrary to right reason.sockwell phelps,cir.thus,reversal is proper only if no reasonable jury could have arrived at the verdict.stevenson dupont de nemours and,cir internal citations omitted.the evidence is reviewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,and o n each issue,we will not disturb the jury verdict unless,considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,the facts and inferences point so overwhelmingly to the party that reasonable jurors could not have arrived at a verdict except in their favor.streber hunter,cir internal citations omitted.
iii.discussion 
a.the grief expert 
daubert and its progeny suggest that several factors weigh in favor of finding expert testimony to be sufficiently reliable.id.at.the supreme court in kumho tire carmichael further suggested that the daubert standard is a flexible one,and that the district court should make certain that an expert,whether basing testimony upon professional studies or personal experience,employs in the courtroom the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.kumho,d.
while blackmore and new star use the word reliable in their argument against the admission of silverman testimony,they substantively allege that the testimony was not relevant because it was unconnected to the case.because the focus of blackmore and new star arguments is whether silverman testimony was connected to the case such that it would assist the jury in determining a fact at issue,the focus is properly the relevance of her testimony,which,according to daubert,is a question of whether the reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue.at.
this court,while not specifically addressing the relevance of a grief expert,has opined on the intersection of relevance and expert testimony.in bocanegra vicmar services,for instance,this court concluded that the district court improperly excluded as irrelevant the expert testimony of a toxicologist about the effects of marijuana on cognitive functions after the high,cir.the district court in bocanegra had excluded the testimony because the toxicology expert could not point to any causal connection between the defendant marijuana use and the accident.id.on appeal,however,this court explained that after the expert extensive testimony about studies demonstrating the effect of marijuana use on cognitive functions,
b ecause of the expert knowledge and training in the field of toxicology,his testimony would have been helpful to the,not because it would have explained the connection between the marijuana and the accident,but because it explained the effect of recent ingestion of marijuana on an individual cognitive functions,including perception and reaction time,both critical factors in any accident.
id.at emphasis added.it is therefore unnecessary given these facts that silverman testimony explain the connection between vogler grieving and the accident.
blackmore and new star insist that silverman testimony would not have assisted the jury,see federal rule of evidence,because grief is a universally experienced emotion that is well within the common sense understanding of jurors and requires no expert testimony in support of this contention,blackmore and new star point to several federal courts that have upheld the exclusion,in varying circumstances,of proffered grief expert testimony the admission of such testimony,claim blackmore and new star,might unduly influence the jurors with its scientific appearance and might even serve as a surrogate for the testimony of a plaintiff.
it is undeniable that all of the dangers alluded to by blackmore and new star lurk in the relatively untested area of grief expert testimony.but blackmore and new star do not argue categorically against the admission of such testimony,nor do they challenge the credentials of silverman.thus,they acknowledge that the decision to admit her testimony lay in the trial court balancing of several the jury was competent to assess the evidence intelligently without expert testimony,whether the evidence had probative weight,and whether the risk of prejudice was greater.even the cases cited by blackmore and new star permitted the exclusion of grief expert testimony as an exercise of the trial court discretion.because silverman testimony was relevant,if not necessary to the jury,the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the evidence.
further,even if we were to find that the district court abused its discretion in admitting silverman testimony,the admission of that testimony was harmless.the facts of this case are tragic a mother and child are dead,leaving a grieving father to care for his wife children from a prior marriage while attempting to care for himself.evidence presented by the collective plaintiffs at trial included pictures of a happy family and the mangled,flattened remains of vogler car.it is highly unlikely that silverman testimony aided in the jury resolution of the case or in its awards to vogler.
b.the award to vogler 
when evaluating jury awards,this court reviews such awards in the context of awards in cases with similar injuries in the relevant jurisdiction.salinas,cir.this circuit has limited searches for federal discrimination law awards to the relevant jurisdiction of the fifth circuit.id.the relevant jurisdiction in a wrongful death case is the state providing the substantive law for the claim.therefore texas wrongful death cases and fifth circuit cases applying texas wrongful death law comprise the relevant jurisdiction.
this circuit employs the maximum recovery rule when granting a remittitur.to this end,damages are reduced to the maximum amount a reasonable jury could have awarded.giles,cir.in order to calculate this amount,this court looks not only to actual awards,but may also apply a multiplier of fifty percent to past similar awards,so long as no multiplier was used in calculating those past awards.salinas,at.
jury damage awards for the death of a spouse.
few,if any,of the awards cited by either side differentiate between past and future suffering and loss of companionship.because blackmore and new star do not object to the awards by the jury for vogler suffering and loss of companionship in the past,only cases in which future damages are explicitly designated are proper bases of comparison.
only one case in the relevant jurisdiction,douglass delta air lines,aff in part,rev in part,cir has divided damages as they are herein contested in douglass,a woman was awarded for her future mental anguish and future loss of companionship due to the loss of her husband.
based on douglass,the maximum recovery for vogler,using the multiplier,would seem to be.the award to vogler for his future damages,however,included pecuniary loss that would be sustained in the future,as well as loss of companionship and mental anguish.at trial,vogler economic expert testified that the present value of vogler future earning capacity as a dental assistant was between and,with an addition of up to for the value of household services.although blackmore and new star characterize the future pecuniary loss as the difference between the award for vogler and the award for kallie,such justification was not made by the jury.the jury therefore could have accepted vogler expert valuation of his wife future earnings and future household services to be as high as.added to the maximum amount recoverable for future pain and suffering,even under the cases cited by blackmore and new star,the jury could have reasonably awarded vogler million for the pecuniary loss,loss of companionship and society,and mental anguish that in reasonable probability will be sustained in the future.we therefore affirm the ruling of the district court upholding the award to vogler for the loss of his wife.
blackmore and new star distinguished higher awards as factually dissimilar to the case at bar.because no remittitur is warranted under the maximum recovery rule using cases alleged by blackmore and new star to be sufficiently similar,the issue of higher awards need not be addressed.
jury damage awards for the death of a child.
none of the cases cited by either blackmore and new star or vogler address awards made in a wholly similar a man has lost both his wife and his child.further,only one of the cases seems to distinguish between past and future loss of companionship and mental anguish.in the case of haskett butts,a woman was compensated for her future pain and mental anguish at the loss of her stillborn child with an award of.although this case deals specifically with future pain and mental anguish,we find that it is not a similar injury for purposes of comparison with the present case.texas law deals with the issue of stillborn fetuses and mental anguish as separate from the death of a child,since,under texas law,a fetus is a part of the mother body.at.because of this definition of the fetus,a jury can not include in its damage award amounts for loss of society,companionship,or affection due to the loss of the fetus.id.at.haskett is therefore not an appropriate comparison for the case at bar 
complicating our review of the award to vogler for kallie death is that no cases cited by either party separate past and future loss of companionship and mental anguish all that seems evident from the relevant caselaw is that awards for the loss of a child vary widely.
our review of the caselaw reveals that there is no factually similar case in the relevant jurisdiction therefore,the maximum recovery rule is not implicated.as we noted in another case in which remittitur was requested,b ecause the facts of each case are different,prior damages awards are not always controlling a departure from prior awards is merited if unique facts are present that are not reflected within the controlling caselaw.lebron united states,cir.nothing recommends remittitur in this case,and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the jury.as the judgment of the district court in upholding the award is not contrary to reason,we affirm.
c.the award to the estate of vogler 
vogler,as representative of the estate of vogler,was awarded for vogler conscious pain and suffering and mental anguish prior to her death.black
