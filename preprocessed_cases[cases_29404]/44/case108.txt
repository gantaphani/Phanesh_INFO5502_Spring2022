appellant universal insurance universal seeks review of a district court order dismissing its federal court action on res judicata grounds.the district court determined that the issues raised in the federal court action had been previously litigated in an administrative action before appellee office of the insurance commissioner oic.for the reasons outlined below,we affirm the district court decision.
background 
on june,a vehicle owned by carmen de jesus fonseca fonseca was involved in an automobile accident with a vehicle operated by aidita luciano munoz munoz.at the time of the accident,munoz was operating the vehicle pursuant to a rental agreement with enterprise rent a car,the owner of the vehicle.the munoz vehicle was insured by universal pursuant to a commercial automobile insurance policy.after the accident,fonseca filed a claim with universal.in january,universal denied fonseca claim.
after universal denied her claim,fonseca filed a request to review the denial with the oic.on january,the oic fined universal and ordered universal to adjust and resolve the claim.in the order,the oic advised universal that it had twenty days to request a hearing and,if it did not request a hearing within the time constraints,the order would become final and enforceable.
universal timely requested a hearing.after submitting the request,however,the parties informed the oic that there were no material facts in controversy and,therefore,there was no need to hold a hearing.the parties agreed that they would submit the matter for adjudication based on the parties memoranda of law supporting their respective positions.in its submission,universal argued that the graves amendment,insulated it from liability.
on june,the oic issued its decision.in the decision,the oic rejected universal argument and confirmed the january order.the oic advised universal that it had twenty days to file a motion for reconsideration and thirty days to file an appeal to the court of appeals of puerto rico the oic also informed universal that if it chose to file a motion for reconsideration and that motion was subsequently denied,the thirty day period to request judicial review would run from the date the motion for reconsideration was denied.the oic decision expressly warned universal that if it did not file a timely appeal for judicial review,the administrative decision would become final and unappealable.
universal filed a timely motion for reconsideration.the oic denied that motion on july.universal,however,chose not to file an appeal with the court of appeals of puerto rico.instead,universal launched an alternative attack,and,on august,filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico.the district court,however,inter alia,determined that the doctrine of res judicata barred the federal court action 
universal now claims that the district court erred when it dismissed the federal court action on res judicata grounds.the oic submits that the district court correctly determined that res judicata barred the action.we review the district court decision de novo.fin.vergara nuñez,cir.
ii.res judicata 
according to the doctrine of res judicata,a final judgment on the merits precludes parties from relitigating claims that were or could have been brought in a prior action.haag united states,cir.a federal court must give preclusive effect to a judgment if the state court would.atwater chester,cir.here,the district court properly applied puerto rico law.
a party asserting res judicata under puerto rico law must establish i the existence of a prior judgment on the merits that is final and unappealable ii a perfect identity of thing or cause between both actions and iii a perfect identity of the parties and the capacities in which they acted.fin,at quoting boateng interam,cir.
a prior and current action will share a perfect identity 
of thing if they involve the same object or matter and will share a perfect identity of cause if they flow from the same principal ground or origin or,put another way,if they derive from a common nucleus of operative facts.

the supreme court of puerto rico recognizes a great flexibility on the application of the doctrine of res judicata in the administrative sphere so that justice may be done.negrón fin.servs,offic.trans.in proper cases res judicata is applicable to administrative decisions.pagán hernández of,offic.trans.when an administrative agency is acting in a judicial capacity and resolves disputed issues of fact properly before it which the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate,the courts have not hesitated to apply res judicata to enforce repose.see also aunyx cannon,cir normally,decisions of administrative agencies are entitled to res judicata effect when the agency acted in a judicial capacity.the oic decision was a prior judgment on the merits that is final and unappealable.
the crux of both the administrative proceeding and the district court complaint is whether the graves amendment shielded universal from liability arising from a third party claim.thus,both the administrative proceeding and the district court action share a perfect identity of thing.see garcía monogas,at.here,the perfect identity of the parties prong is also satisfied the parties in the administrative proceeding are the same as the parties in the district court proceeding.id.
we next turn to universal contention that the district court erred by ignoring universal reservation of rights,and by failing to recognize a public policy exception to the application of res judicata.
universal argues that the district court dismissed universal complaint based on res judicata,but it did not considered sic universal timely reserve of rights.app.at.the d istrict c ourt should have considered universal reserve of rights to deny the application of res judicata in this case.appellant opening brief at.the reference to app.at refers this court to universal brief filed before the district court.

filing a brief that merely adopts by reference a memorandum previously filed in the district court does not comply with the federal rules of appellate procedure.

universal next claims that the district court erred by failing to apply the public policy exception to res judicata.universal alleges that this matter concerns an important issue of public policy a disregard of congressional intent evidenced by the oic misapplication of graves amendment immunity.
under puerto rico law,res judicata may not apply if public policy demands an exception.barreto rosa varona mendez,cir.the public policy exception has been applied by puerto rico courts where the potentially preclusive prior judgment affected the rights of a minor,was moot,involved a dismissal for lack of prosecution,or stemmed from a tainted proceeding.núñez collin toledo dávila,cir.
