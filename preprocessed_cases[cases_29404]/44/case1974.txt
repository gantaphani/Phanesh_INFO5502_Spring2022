in this diversity action,at issue is the summary judgment awarded great american insurance company of new york.as receiver for grant morris judgment creditor of jerry lee largent,darrell minter claims great american is liable for morris state court judgment against largent and his employer,hammer trucking,arising out of a collision between morris and largent vehicles.largent was intoxicated at the time.hammer trucking had leased to jtm materials,the vehicle being driven by largent,which was used exclusively for jtm benefit.primarily at issue is whether largent intoxication at the time of the collision precludes his being a permissive user under the omnibus clause of jtm primary commercial automobile liability policy,issued by paul fire and marine insurance,and,therefore,precludes his being an insured under the great american excess policy.a genuine issue of material fact exists for that issue.accordingly,we vacate the judgment in favor of great american reverse the district court rulings against coverage under the omnibus clause and minter tort claims affirm its rulings for all other coverage issues and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
on saturday,november,the the truck driven by largent collided with a vehicle driven by morris,who sustained significant injuries.largent pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated.
the truck was owned by largent employer,hammer trucking.on june,approximately four months before the collision,hammer trucking leased the truck to jtm,a federal and motor carrier.under the lease,hammer trucking,inter alia was to maintain control of the truck and use it for the exclusive benefit of jtm had a duty to properly maintain the truck and was to bear all maintenance and operating expenses including largent salary.
originally,the truck was parked overnight at hammer trucking.because largent wife needed their car to drive to her new job,hammer trucking allowed largent to drive the truck to and from work and park it overnight at his apartment.
on the day of the collision,largent,who lived in bridgeport,texas,was in the process of delivering the truck to a facility near decatur,texas,for scheduled maintenance consistent with hammer trucking duties under its lease with jtm.that day,largent had been instructed by don hammer,hammer trucking owner and president,to deliver the truck by the next day sunday,november.at approximately saturday,november,largent drove the truck to his sister house,also located in bridgeport,in order for her to give him a ride back from the maintenance facility in decatur.because his sister could not give him a ride,largent then decided to return to his house and take the truck to the maintenance facility the next morning.the collision occurred while he was returning home.
largent had an extensive criminal record,including convictions for dwi,reckless conduct for which largent was originally charged with dwi,and felony possession of methamphetamine for which he served three years in prison he also had five citations for driving without liability insurance.morris jtm materials,worth,no pet.when hammer trucking entered into its lease agreement with jtm several months before the collision,jtm safety director conducted a background check on largent,consisting of an ams driver report for texas that background check,however,covered only the three years preceding september and did not reveal largent previous offenses for dwi,reckless conduct,methamphetamine possession,or any of his citations for driving without liability insurance.id.it appears that this report and a drug screening test were the extent of jtm investigation to qualify largent as a truck driver.on the other hand,a driving report from the texas department of public safety would have revealed the full extent of largent driving and criminal record.id.
jtm primary commercial automobile liability insurance policy was issued by paul its excess policy,by great american.the paul policy has a million coverage limit for each accident caused by a covered automobile great american excess coverage became effective upon that limit being exhausted.
in may,in texas state court,morris filed an action against largent,hammer trucking,and by an amended petition jtm,claiming,inter alia negligence and negligence per se by largent negligent hiring,retention,and supervision of largent,negligent entrustment,and vicarious liability against hammer trucking and jtm based on respondent superior joint enterprise,joint venture,and civil conspiracy against jtm and largent being jtm statutory,actual,constructive,or borrowed employee,and jtm being liable under the federal motor carrier safety regulations.the claims against jtm were severed from those against largent and hammer trucking.
upon jtm being added as a defendant,it notified aon risk services of texas.aon was great american agent,inter alia,for all usual and customary services of an insurance agent.in september,aon forwarded a copy of morris first amended petition and a corresponding summons to paul however,aon did not forward notice of morris action to great american.paul provided jtm a defense against morris claims but did not do so for hammer trucking or largent.
jtm was awarded summary judgment shortly before the claims against largent and hammer trucking were tried.for their jury trial in august,largent and hammer trucking proceeded pro se.during trial,morris was awarded a directed verdict on liability,with the court ruling at the time of the accident,largent was acting within the scope of his employment with hammer trucking and was a permissive user of the truck.the following questions were submitted to the jury the amount of morris compensatory damages whether largent and hammer trucking acted with malice and if so,the amount of exemplary damages.the jury awarded damages jointly and severally against hammer trucking and largent for approximately million,with very substantial interest it also found they had acted with malice and assessed exemplary damages of against largent and against hammer trucking.
the judgment against largent and hammer trucking was not appealed.as for the summary judgment awarded jtm,the fort worth court of appeals vacated that judgment for part of the vicarious liability claims and for the claims for negligent hiring,retention,supervision,and entrustment,and remanded for trial on those issues,morris,at,and affirmed for respondeat superior,civil conspiracy,joint venture and joint enterprise,id.at.in vacating the summary judgment awarded jtm for part of morris vicarious liability claims,the court held if jtm was a federally regulated motor carrier,it was liable,as a matter of law,under the federal motor carrier safety regulations.id.at.importantly,in affirming jtm summary judgment against morris respondeat superior claim,the court held largent was acting outside the scope of his employment at the time of the collision.id.at.the record is silent concerning the disposition of this matter on remand.
in may prior to the decision rendered in by the fort worth court of appeals for the claims against jtm,in order to satisfy morris judgment against largent,the state court ordered largent to turn over assets to minter,who had been appointed receiver.those assets included largent claims against paul and great american that they failed to provide a defense failed to indemnify under their policies issued to jtm acted in bad faith engaged in unfair insurance practices,in violation of.ann.vernon supp.and violated the texas deceptive trade practices act,see.bus.ann,vernon supp.
minter filed a state court action against paul,which settled for million including all claims against jtm and hammer trucking.the million coverage limit for jtm policy was reached apparently,the additional was for settlement of tort claims.
in september,minter filed this diversity action against great american,seeking recovery of that part of morris state court judgment against largent which had not been satisfied by the settlement with paul.great american filed a action against aon for breach of contract and tort claims for failure to give timely notice of morris action.great american and minter moved for summary judgment.
the district court awarded summary judgment to great american,holding based on the ruling of the fort worth court of appeals concerning the summary judgment that had been awarded jtm,minter was collaterally estopped from claiming largent was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the collision great american was not collaterally estopped from contending largent was not a permissive user of the truck,despite the contrary state court judgment,because the issue had not been vigorously litigated in state court concerning permission vel non,largent intoxication took his use of the truck outside the scope of permission granted by hammer trucking or jtm coverage did not exist under either the te endorsement to,or the exclusive use clause of,the paul policy because largent had no ownership interest in the truck coverage did not exist under the endorsement to the paul policy because that provision acts as an independent basis for coverage only when other coverage is lacking accordingly,no coverage existed under the underlying paul policy,and,therefore,none existed under the great american excess policy and there being no coverage under the great american policy,minter tort claims failed as a matter of law.minter great am.ins,wl.unpublished.

the evidence and inferences from the summary judgment record are viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,taylor gregg,cir.along that line,portions of the state trial transcript are in the summary judgment record.interpretation of an unambiguous insurance contract is a question of law,am.states ins.bailey,cir.it is undisputed that texas law applies.
section of the great american excess policy defines an insured as,inter alia 
your jtm employees,other than your executive officers,but only for acts within the scope of their employment any other person or organization who is insured under any policy of underlying insurance.the coverage afforded such insureds under this policy will be no broader than the underlying insurance except for this policy limit of insurance.
emphasis added.the paul policy was listed in the great american policy schedule of underlying policies.
concerning part for this definition of insured jtm employee acting within scope of employment,minter claims jtm and,therefore,great american is liable because largent was jtm statutory employee under the federal motor carrier safety regulations fmcsr.see.as noted,the fort worth court of appeals held if jtm is an interstate carrier,jtm is vicariously liable as a matter of law for largent negligence.morris,at emphasis added.great american contests jtm being an interstate carrier and therefore subject to the fmcsr.in any event,assuming jtm is both an interstate carrier and,therefore,vicariously liable for largent negligence,minter must still establish largent was an insured to recover against great american.radman jones motor,the simple fact of the matter is that congress intended that the icc carrier be the insurer of its leased tractor trailer drivers with respect to the general public.emphasis deleted.
to that end,minter claims largent was acting within the scope of his employment with jtm at the time of the collision.minter does not contend,much less demonstrate,that the district court erred in ruling minter is collaterally estopped from making this claim accordingly,he is precluded from asserting scope of employment here.as a result,minter can not show coverage under the great american policy.
consequently,coverage exists under that policy only if,pursuant to part for the above definition of insured,coverage is established under the underlying paul policy.for doing so,minter maintains coverage exists under four of that policy provisions the clause coverage for anyone using a covered auto with jtm permission the endorsement establishing liability for federally regulated motor carriers for injuries sustained by general public,where no other coverage exists the exclusive use clause coverage for owner of a covered auto from whom jtm hires or borrows a covered auto that is used exclusively in jtm trucking business and the te endorsement coverage for owner of covered auto which jtm rents or leases.c onstruction of insurance policies is a matter of state law.canal ins.first ins,cir,modified by cir.both parties assume that texas law applies we do as well.for the following reasons,the summary judgment awarded great american against each of these four claims is vacated for the omnibus clause but affirmed for the other three.
jtm underlying paul policy defines an insured as,inter alia,a nyone using with jtm permission a covered auto you own,hire,or borrow emphasis added.this clause is commonly known as an omnibus clause.see black law dictionary ed defining omnibus clause as a provision in an automobile insurance policy that extends coverage to all drivers operating the insured vehicle with the owner permission.great american does not contest the truck being a covered auto under the paul policy.therefore,at issue is whether,at the time of the collision,largent was using it with jtm permission.
as noted,although the state trial court held largent was acting within the scope of permission,the district court held that,because this issue was not vigorously litigated in state court,see mower boyer,great american was not collaterally estopped from it.minter does not properly contest,much less demonstrate error in,this holding therefore,we will consider this permission issue.
in texas,permission is defined as consent to use the vehicle at the time and place in question and in a manner authorized by the owner,either express or implied.hartford accident indem.lowery,writ ref citation omitted emphasis added.although express permission requires an affirmative statement,implied permission may be inferred from a course of conduct or relationship between the parties in which there is mutual acquiescence or lack of objection signifying consent.royal indem.abbott sons.
pursuant to its lease with jtm,hammer trucking had sole responsibility for maintaining the truck.and,it is undisputed that,on the night of the collision,largent had express permission from don hammer to drive the truck to the maintenance facility.in awarding summary judgment to great american,the district court ruled driving to largent sister house was outside the scope of the permission expressly granted to him,as he was only given express permission to take the truck to the maintenance yard.minter,wl,at.at the state court trial,however,don hammer testified that he gave largent permission to go to his sister house to secure a ride back from the maintenance yard.
great american contends largent proceeding to his sister house was a personal errand hammer trucking and jtm had told largent the truck was not to be used for personal errands and,therefore,largent was outside the scope of the express permission.given that largent asserted he had express permission to seek a ride from his sister,and there is competent summary judgment evidence in support,a material fact issue exists for whether largent had express permission to drive the truck to his sister house.the district court erred in holding otherwise.
even assuming largent did not have such express permission,it can be reasonably inferred that hammer trucking expected largent to arrange his return transportation from the maintenance facility in decatur.don hammer knew that largent wife used their only car to commute to her job at night.this was why hammer allowed largent to keep the truck at his he had no other regular transportation to and from work.this arrangement between hammer trucking and largent suggests a course of conduct between the parties in which there is mutual acquiescence signifying consent.royal indem,at.therefore,a material fact issue also exists for whether largent had implied permission to drive to his sister house,which was approximately one mile from his apartment,in order to arrange his return transportation from decatur.
these genuine issues of material fact,however,do not compel vacating the summary judgment awarded great american against the issue.even if largent had express or implied permission to drive to his sister house,another issue is whether his intoxication placed his use of the truck outside the scope of that permission part of the manner authorized.texas follows the minor deviation rule in determining whether a vehicle use is outside the scope of permission.see coronado employers ins.under this rule,the court must determine in each instance,taking into account the extent of deviation in actual distance or time,the purposes for which the vehicle was given,and other factors,whether the deviation was minor or material.id.at emphasis added.
some deviations may be so minor that they do not create a fact issue whether permission was revoked other,more significant deviations may create such an issue and some deviations may be so material that they revoke permission as a matter of law.id.at.along this line,the district court ruled 
had largent only driven the truck to his sister house,the deviation might have been minor,as the trip was allegedly related to his bringing the truck in for maintenance at hammer request.however,largent operation of the truck while intoxicated was so far outside of the express permission granted to him by jtm and hammer that his deviation was material as a matter of law.
minter,wl,at citation omitted emphasis added.
great american contends the summary judgment record establishes jtm had a zero tolerance policy regarding alcohol use by its drivers,which it communicated to largent in the form of a drug and alcohol handbook and don hammer expressly instructed largent that he was not to operate the truck after drinking alcohol.minter counters by noting that,in state court,jtm admitted it had no safety policies or procedures for leased trucks such as hammer or for independent contractors,leased drivers.the district court assumed jtm had expressly forbidden largent from operating the truck under the influence of alcohol,despite minter having presented summary judgment evidence to the contrary.id.at.
the summary judgment record shows don hammer instructed largent to deliver the truck for scheduled maintenance before on sunday,november.don hammer had anticipated delivery would probably take place the prior evening saturday.moreover,as previously stated,there is a material fact issue whether largent had express or implied permission to drive to his sister house to arrange return transportation.as stated,we will assume largent the nonmovant did have permission.therefore,for summary judgment purposes,we must determine whether largent intoxication was a deviation so material that,as a matter of law,the permission was revoked.
in coronado,the left work at approximately with his work crew but,instead of taking them home,took them to a local bar to drink beer.at.they stayed three to four hours,then proceeded to another bar some distance away.id.upon leaving the second bar after midnight,the driver was involved in an accident,causing a passenger death.id.the resulting wrongful death action claimed the driver was a permissive user under the omnibus clause in the employer automobile liability policy.id.at.
the texas supreme court phrased the issue as follows whether an employee who was driving a company owned vehicle on a purely personal mission after working hours was covered under that clause.id.at emphasis added.the court rejected plaintiff contention that,based on a supervisor having twice found the employee drinking beer shortly after work,while still using the truck,the employee had implied permission to drive while intoxicated.id.at.the court held 
t he eight hour deviation at issue was so gross as to be a material deviation as a matter of law.the use of the vehicle at the time of the accident was so far outside the scope of the permission granted for use of the vehicle that we can not say that a fact issue is raised that his employer had impliedly consented to this use.
id.at emphasis added.the court viewed intoxication as an other factor,as opposed to a primary consideration,in determining whether the deviation was material as a matter of law.
a similar issue arose in old am.county mut.fire ins.renfrow,per curiam.an employee,who had permission only to drive the company truck home after work and to return to the job site the next morning,drove it to visit his girlfriend approximately miles away in saginaw,texas.id.at.upon returning,the girlfriend was killed in a accident.plaintiffs offered evidence that the employee commonly drove the company truck to his girlfriend house and to his foreman house to drink beer,id.at,and claimed this established implied permission to use the company truck for personal errands.the court held as a matter of law,the trip to saginaw was a material deviation,because it was so far removed from the geographic area in which the employee had permission to drive.id.at.
in royal indemnity,herring employed landers to work on his ranch.at.landers lived there and had permission to drive two to perform his duties.id.one weekend,herring and landers drove to the horse races in bronte,texas on returning that afternoon,each drank two bottles of beer.id.at.that evening,while herring was away,landers drove one of the to san angelo,texas approximately miles away,on a personal errand he bought and drank more beer on the way and,eventually,lost control of the vehicle and ran into a building.id.at.a jury found at the time of the accident,landers was driving the truck within the scope of implied permission from herring and,therefore,coverage existed under the omnibus clause of herring automobile policy.id.at.in reversing,the texas supreme court held 
t he evidence shows neither a relationship nor a prior course of conduct from which implied permission might fairly be inferred.landers was employed as a ranch hand.he had never driven one of the vehicles off the ranch except when specifically instructed to do so,and had never used any of them for a personal errand.his employer had always driven him to town whenever he wanted to go,and had no reason to believe that he intended or might need to use one of the vehicles on the evening of the accident.in view of these undisputed facts,the limited privileges landers was allowed in the herring house,his occasional pleasure trips with herring,the availability of the vehicles,his use of the same on the ranch,and the absence of any prior instruction not to take the vehicles off the ranch,afford no basis for concluding that landers had implied permission to use the truck for a trip to san angelo on a personal mission.
id.at emphasis added.
in these cases,the critical inquiry cited by the court was the deviation in actual distance or time from the original permission granted.intoxication was not mentioned by the royal indemnity court in finding permission lacking as a matter of law,despite the uncontested fact that the had consumed several alcoholic beverages immediately prior to driving into a building.obviously,intoxication is an other factor to consider for whether a deviation is material.see coronado,at.indeed,it was a factor considered by the coronado court in holding the deviation material as a matter of law.great american has cited no texas case law,however,holding that intoxication per se revokes permission.instead,it is an other factor to be considered in determining the extent of the deviation.
in the light of largent driving record containing a history of alcohol offenses,as well as a drug felony,jtm failure to request that driving record from the texas department of public safety,largent being instructed by don hammer not to drink and drive,and its being dispu
