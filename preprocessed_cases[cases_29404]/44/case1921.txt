background 
black is the mother and next friend of jane doe,who contracted an illness as an infant that left her developmentally disabled.during the school year,jane was enrolled as a special education student at como middle school within npsd.in april,she was the only female of five students in finis sanders fourth period special education math class.sanders fourth period class lasted from until,with a five minute break between classes.due to problems during break time in the second floor boys restroom,como middle school principal jesse owens required a male teacher to supervise the restroom between classes.sanders was assigned the area near the boys restroom,which was approximately fifty feet from his classroom.another teacher,leroy richardson,supervised the hallway area between his classroom and sanders.sanders classroom contained two bookshelves located three feet from the back wall.carpet was placed in the hidden space created by the bookshelves.black claims that two male classmates sexually assaulted jane in the back of sanders classroom during the break time between classes.
after the alleged assault on jane,black filed suit in mississippi state court against npsd,its superintendent,bonnie smith,orange,sanders,and ten john does.black asserted negligence claims under the mississippi tort claims act,ann,et west mtca.after a bench trial,the trial court entered judgment in favor of black and awarded her for past medical and therapy bills and future therapy treatment.the court dismissed the claims against the defendants in their individual capacities because they could not be held personally liable under the mtca for acts or omissions occurring within the course and scope of their employment.the mississippi court of appeals affirmed the trial court judgment.doe ex.rel.doe north panola sch,so d.
while her state court appeal was pending,black filed suit against npsd,smith,orange and sanders in the northern district of mississippi.black complaint,nearly identical to her state court petition,alleged that doe was sexually assaulted by two male classmates in sanders classroom during break time between classes.black asserted recovery based on,title i of the americans with disabilities act,section of the rehabilitation act,and the civil rights act of,
npsd moved to dismiss black claims,or in the alternative,for summary judgment,on the grounds that black federal action was barred by res judicata.black timely responded to npsd motion however,she subsequently moved to permit supplementation of her response,arguing that her federal claims were barred from her prior state court action by the mtca.the district court denied black motion to permit supplementation,agreed that her claims were barred by res judicata,and dismissed black suit by judgment entered on february.

we review the grant of summary judgment,legal determination of res judicata and eleventh amendment immunity de novo.see vera tue,cir summary judgment procter gamble amway,cir res judicata cozzo tangipahoa parish gov,cir eleventh amendment immunity.
iii.discussion 
res judicata generally 
to determine the preclusive effect of a state court judgment in a federal action,federal courts must apply the law of the state from which the judgment emerged.amica mut.ins.moak,cir.under mississippi law,the doctrine of res judicata bars parties from litigating claims within the scope of the judgment in a prior action.anderson lavere,so d.this includes claims that were made or should have been made in the prior suit.id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.res judicata reflects the refusal of the law to tolerate a multiplicity of litigation.little v g welding supply,so d.it is a doctrine of public policy designed to avoid the expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits,conserve judicial resources,and foster reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibilities of inconsistent decisions.harrison,so d,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
under mississippi law,four identities must be present before the doctrine of res judicata will apply identity of subject matter identity of the cause of action identity of the parties and identity of the quality or character of a person against whom a claim is made.see also green amerada hess,cir.if these four identities are present,the doctrine of res judicata will prevent the parties from relitigating all issues that were decided or could have been raised in the previous action.harrison,so d at.
b.the four identities 
subject matter and cause of action 
although mississippi courts have not defined explicitly the identity of subject matter,they have defined the identity of cause of action.the identities are distinct but related,and as such,examination in tandem illustrates their distinctions more readily.in older cases,the mississippi supreme court referred to subject matter identity as identity in the thing sued for.forbes columbia pulp paper,so d,pray hewitt,so d,campbell campbell,so d.most recently,the mississippi supreme court defined subject matter as the substance of the lawsuit.harrison,so d at.
in contrast,i dentity of the cause of action exists when there is a commonality in the underlying facts and circumstances upon which a claim is asserted and relief is sought from the two actions.city of jackson lakeland lounge of jackson,so d,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in other words,in the res judicata context,a cause of action is a group of operative facts that entitles a petitioner to seek remedy in court.see lavere,so d at.the requirement that the litigation involve the same claim premised upon the same body of operative fact as was previously adjudicated comports with the prohibition against protected by res judicata.harrison,so d at.when making this notably difficult determination,mississippi courts look past the legal bases asserted and rely more on the factual and transactional relationship between the original action and the subsequent action.id.this court applies a similarly transactional approach.see see also smith safeco ins,cir finding that because the claims arose out of a common nucleus of operative fact,they comprised one transaction,and res judicata barred a second suit.
several mississippi cases analyzing res judicata further illustrate the relationship between the identities of subject matter and cause of action.in lakeland lounge,an club owner sought to declare a city ordinance that regulated his business unconstitutional under the first amendment.so d at.after the federal district court declared the ordinance unconstitutional,the city filed a state action to enjoin the club owner operations,arguing that he violated the ordinance.id.at.the state trial court ruled that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and violated the equal protection clause.id.at.in holding that res judicata barred the state action challenging the ordinance constitutionality,the mississippi supreme court found identity of subject matter the zoning ordinance and its constitutionality.id.at.furthermore,although the federal court cases determined the constitutionality of the c ity public policy determinations involving the secondary effects of adult entertainment and the pending ordinance doctrine,the underlying issue was topless entertainment.id.because the underlying facts were the same,the city did not destroy the identity of cause of action by raising a new legal theory in the state action.see id.
in black city of tupelo,so d,the plaintiff filed suit in federal court alleging various misconduct by city police officers.after the suit was dismissed,the plaintiff filed suit in state court based on the same allegations.id.the mississippi supreme court held that the subject matter of the suits was the same they pertained to alleged incidents within the police department.id.at.likewise,because the allegations in the first suit were based on the same underlying facts and circumstances as in the second suit,the causes of action were also identical.id.
in little,the mississippi supreme court held that res judicata barred a state wrongful death suit arising out of an explosion that killed two welders.so d at.the court determined that there was identity of subject matter because the subjects of both suits were the welders deaths.id.although the prior federal suit was a products liability case premised on a design defect,while the state suit was premised on a manufacturing defect,the crucial fact was that the appellants were seeking to hold an entity liable for the deaths of the welders.id.moreover,the appellants relied on the same facts and circumstances alleged in the federal suit the release of a dangerous gas that caused an explosion killing two men.id.thus,there was a commonality of the underlying facts and circumstances,and the second identity of cause of action was met.id.
by contrast,in lavere,the court held that there was no identity of subject matter between two actions.so d at.the first action involved the administration of the estate of robert johnson,a blues artist.lavere,so d at.in the estate administration action,the trial court determined that claud johnson was the sole heir to the estate.id.at.in a second lawsuit,two legatees of the decedent sister estate sued claud johnson,stephen lavere,and others,alleging conversion,fraud and breach of contract arising out of a contract between johnson and lavere regarding rights to certain photographs of the artist.id.the mississippi supreme court concluded that the subject matter of the first action was the administration of the estate,including the determination of heirship.id.at.the subject matter of the second action was the ownership of the photographs and associated copyrights.id.with respect to the identity of causes of action,the first suit arose out of the death of robert johnson,the opening and administration of his estate,and the determination of his heirs.id.at.however,the second suit involved the alleged acts or omissions of lavere concerning the contract.id.these were not the same causes of action.id.
in this case,black argues that neither identity is established.she argues that identity of subject matter exists only when the primary right and duty or wrong are the same in each action.reid,so d at t he primary test for comparing causes of action is whether the primary right and duty or wrong are the same in each action.black urges the court to employ an analysis similar to that for subject matter jurisdiction,where different statutory bases and rights determine courts jurisdiction.see common cause of mississippi smith,so d.her argument is misplaced.first,mississippi law fails to support the appellant contention that the identity of subject matter for res judicata purposes is determined according to a subject matter jurisdiction analysis.no case discussing the identity of subject matter alludes to subject matter jurisdiction.second,the primary right language in reid discussed the identity of cause of action,not subject matter.so d at.third,the identity of subject matter is defined as the underlying issue before the court,not the legal basis for recovery.see lakeland lounge,so d at.
regarding the identity of cause of action,the appellant again cites reid primary right or duty language to support her argument that two definitions of cause of action exist a legal one,defined by the primary right or duty,and a factual one,defined by the transactional test discussed above.based on her legal definition of cause of action,she contends that there is no identity of cause of action because she is vindicating different rights in her federal suit again,black misconstrues reid regarding the identity of cause of action.although reid referred to primary right and duty as the test for a cause of action,it specifically defined the identity of cause of action as identity of underlying facts and circumstances upon which a claim is asserted and relief sought in the two actions.so d at.furthermore,because the reid plaintiffs sought insurance coverage for their son injuries in a prior proceeding arising out of the same accident and the same insurance policy,their subsequent action for uninsured motorist coverage raised the same cause of action.id.thus,reid provides no support for black assertion that there is a primary right or duty test separate from the transactional test for determining a cause of action.see see also harrison,so d at it is the facts giving rise to a claim and not the legal theory for the claim that defines cause of action.black federal suit alleged different theories of liability,which are irrelevant to the determination of identity of cause of action.see harrison,so d at.
thus,identity of subject matter turns on a general characterization of the suit.it is the substance of the action.by contrast,identity of cause of action is defined by the underlying group of facts giving rise to a claim.in black case,the subject matter of both the first and second suit can be described as the sexual assault of jane doe.the causes of action are the underlying facts giving rise to jane doe claims her sexual assault at the hands of two boys in her unsupervised classroom.identical factual allegations of sexual assault support the legal theories in both lawsuits.accordingly,there are identities of subject matter and cause of action.
identity of parties and identity of quality of parties 
on appeal,black contests the presence of the third and fourth identities related to parties.however,in the district court,black expressly conceded that these identities were present,and she addressed only the first two identities when contesting the defendants summary judgment motion.a party concession of an issue means the issue is waived and may not be revived.smith united states,cir.by conceding the issues in the district court and failing to address them,black waived any argument regarding the third and fourth identities.see id.parties waived issues by expressly stating in their motion for summary judgment that they conceded the issues and by failing to provide any argument on those issues.
moreover,the identity of parties and identity of the quality or character of parties are satisfied.black was the plaintiff in both suits.both suits were brought against npsd and the individual school officials based on npsd conduct and the individual officials capacity as employees of npsd.therefore,identity of the parties and identity of their quality or character were established.see little,so d at strict identity of parties is not required if the parties in the second suit are sufficiently connected with the first suit such that their interests would be affected as if they were parties black,so d at identities of parties and of their quality were established where police officers who were named only in the second suit are employees of the city of tupelo,which was named in both suits estate of anderson deposit guar.bank,so d,finding all four identities met in second suit against bank arising out of its powers as trustee,bank officers named only in second suit operated in their capacities as employees of the bank in managing the trust.black contention that these identities are not established because the individual defendants were sued only in their official capacities in the state suit and individually in the federal suit is without merit.thus,all four identities were present in black federal action,and the district court properly dismissed her claims on res judicata grounds.
c.the district court order of analysis of the identities 
black also argues that the district court improperly considered whether she could have brought her claims before determining whether the four identities existed.under the mississippi law of res judicata,once the four identities are established,any claims that could have been brought in the prior action are barred.lavere,so d at.black is correct that this could have rule comes into effect only once the four identities have been established.see id.at.however,the district court did not first conclude that doe could have brought her federal claims in state court before determining whether res judicata was applicable.rather,the court found that the elements of res judicata were satisfied.it then reached the issue of whether the federal constitutional claims could have been litigated with the state negligence claims.there was no error in the order of the district court analysis.
sovereign immunity 
black further contends that,even if res judicata applies,she is not barred from asserting her federal claims because mississippi has not waived its sovereign immunity.she argues that mississippi waiver of sovereign immunity must be expressly granted by statutory provision.npsd contends that black forfeited this argument by failing to raise it in the district court generally,t his court will not consider an issue that a party fails to raise in the district court absent extraordinary circumstances.leverette louisville ladder,cir.extraordinary circumstances exist when the issue involved is purely a legal one and failure to address it would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice.verdin c b boat,cir.black contends that sovereign immunity may be raised for the first time because a this court review is de novo,and b sovereign immunity is jurisdictional.however,this contention lacks merit.even on de novo review,a party may not raise new legal arguments.see,johnson sawyer,cir although we can affirm a summary judgment on grounds not relied upon by the district court,those grounds must at least have been proposed or asserted in that court by the movant fdic laguarta,cir refusing to affirm summary judgment on grounds neither raised below nor even raised sua sponte by the district court.further,the sovereign immunity that black urges is the state immunity from suit in its own courts,which she contends precluded the state court from exercising jurisdiction.that form of sovereign immunity has no effect on the federal court jurisdiction,which may be raised for the first time on appeal.see mcdonal abbott,cir.the purely legal nature of black argument permits a succinct discussion of sovereign immunity.see verdin,at.
under the eleventh amendment,states retain immunity from private suit in their own courts.alden maine,d.however,the states immunity is not unlimited states can not disregard the constitution or valid federal law under the guise of the eleventh amendment.id.at.at.thus,two constitutional principles limit state sovereign immunity.id.first,states are immune from suit only in the absence of their consent.id.at.at.where,on its own initiative,a state enacts a statute that consents to suit,it abandons sovereign immunity.id.an exception exists under of the fourteenth amendment,states can not prohibit individuals from bringing private suits in state court under.id.at.at internal citation omitted.when congress enacts appropriate legislation,such as,pursuant to its enforcement power under,it may properly assert authority over the states that is otherwise unauthorized by the constitution.id.internal citations omitted second,state sovereign immunity prohibits private suits against states but not against lesser entities.alden,at.at.eleventh amendment immunity does not extend to suits prosecuted against municipalities or other governmental entities that are not considered arms of the state.id.citing healthy city bd.of ed.doyle,at,d lincoln county luning.
mississippi consent to suit 
through the mtca,mississippi waived its immunity in a limited fashion for certain tort actions.of mississippi medical center robinson,so d.by definition,the mtca is the exclusive state remedy against a governmental entity and its employees for tortious acts or omissions which give rise to civil liability.ann.elkins mckenzie,so d,internal citations omitted mccomb separate municipal school district,so d,moore carroll county,mississippi.for purposes of the mtca,a school district is a political subdivision of the state.ann.i.the mtca waives sovereign immunity for several types of claims against governmental entities and their employees acting in the course and scope of their employment.see ann.its waiver of immunity is valid only to the extent the governmental entity carries excess liability insurance.ann.lincoln county school district doe,so d school district did not carry effective liability insurance to waive immunity for plaintiff personal injury claim.the tort claims fund and plans under the mtca provide excess liability insurance for governmental entities against liabilities outside the provisions of this chapter,including but not limited to liabilities arising from sections through of title of the united states code ann.see also mcgehee depoyster,so d.the mtca also preserves all immunities granted by the eleventh amendment of the united states constitution.ann.
black argues that because the mtca did not expressly waive immunity for her federal claims,she was barred from asserting them in state court.although the mississippi supreme court has yet to explicitly hold that the mtca waiver of sovereign immunity is the exclusive waiver for all actions brought in state court,its decisions regarding the nature of federally created rights and the mtca excess liability insurance requirement suggest that the mtca waives immunity for black federal claims.see mcgehee,so d at elkins,so d at.first,mississippi distinguishes constitutional violations from ordinary torts.see barrett miller,so d.it is well established that mississippi courts share concurrent subject matter jurisdiction with federal courts in the enforcement of federally created rights.burrell mississippi state tax commission,so d,elkins,so d at see also martinez california,d howlett by and through howlett rose,d.when mississippi courts enforce federally created rights,they must follow the federal interpretations of those rights.burrell,so d at howlett,at.at.
second,the mtca notice requirement does not apply to claims.mcgehee,so d at citing felder casey,d.the mississippi supreme court recognized that enforcement of the mtca notice requirement could yield different outcomes for claims depending on whether they were brought in state or federal court.id.at.this risk was impermissible because s tates may not apply such an law when entertaining substantive federal rights in their courts.id.at.thus,the court acknowledged the supremacy of federal law governing federal causes of action.see accord felder,at.at internal citations omitted howlett,at.at.
third,the mtca fails to insulate the state and its subdivisions from liability for violations of constitutional rights.mcgehee,so d at specifically concluding that the mtca expressly places actions beyond its purview.the mtca tort claims fund establishes plans for political subdivisions to provide coverage for liabilities outside the provisions of this chapter,including but not limited to liabilities arising from sections through of title of the united states code id.quoting ann.emphasis omitted.the tort claims fund permits mississippi liability for its subdivisions acts only to the extent that resulting judgments do not burden the state fisc.ann.see also mcgehee,so d at alden,at.at.although the mtca does not explicitly waive immunity for federal causes of action,its acknowledgment and coverage of liabilities outside the mtca effectively waives immunity.see ann.mcgehee,so d at.
black sovereign immunity argument is not novel.the supreme court addressed the question of whether a defense of sovereign immunity,unavailable in federal court,would be available to a school board otherwise subject to suit in state court.howlett,at.at.the petitioner,a former high school student,filed a state court complaint alleging claims against his former school district and principal.id.at.at.the school district argued that the state court lacked jurisdiction to hear the petitioner federal claims because the state of florida did not waive sovereign immunity for claims asserted in state court.id.at.at.the court rejected the school district argument,holding t o the extent that the florida law of sovereign immunity reflects a substantial disagreement with the extent to which
