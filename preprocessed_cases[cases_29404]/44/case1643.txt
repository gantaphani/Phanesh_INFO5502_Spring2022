appellant,michelle hodge,was injured by mirrors that fell from an upper shelf of a mirror display in a richmond,virginia,outlet of stores.hodge thereafter brought an action against sounding in negligence.hodge claimed that given the foreseeability of mirrors falling from shelves and injuring a customer in circumstances similar to those surrounding her accident,had constructive notice that the mirror display constituted an unsafe condition.additionally,hodge claimed that deliberately failed to question a customer who witnessed the incident about what happened,requiring the application of an adverse inference for spoliation of evidence.the district court granted summary judgment to on the grounds that hodge presented insufficient evidence under governing virginia law to support her negligence claim,and that no spoliation inference was warranted.finding no reversible error,we now affirm.
the record evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to hodge,shows the following.on july,hodge went with her son,jessie,to the richmond to purchase a mirror.upon arriving at the aisle in which mirrors were displayed for sale around,she noticed that the mirrors were in a state of disarray and not arranged as they should have been the area was a mess.hodge noticed larger mirrors placed in front of smaller ones,and that the mirrors were not arranged by price or size.some of the mirrors were located on an upper shelf as high as six feet off the ground and slanted against the back of the shelf,restrained only by a lip on the shelf one and a half inches high.
shortly after arriving in the display area,hodge was briefly distracted.when she turned her attention back to the display,she realized that she needed to move the mirrors around to examine them,so she bent over to place jessie on the floor.as she stood up,she was struck by several mirrors that fell from the upper shelf,and suffered substantial injuries.a woman that hodge had been talking to only a moment earlier the witness exclaimed oh my god,those mirrors just fell on that girl.hodge had not moved or touched the mirrors.
the first employee on the scene was assistant manager many bowman,who heard the glass shatter over hodge and arrived while the witness was still present.hodge testified that someone probably bowman then directed another employee to get some restraints to hold the mirrors back.after some time passed,the witness asked bowman if she could leave,but bowman does not remember answering the witness question.when hodge noticed the witness leaving,hodge told bowman that the witness had seen everything,and urged her to get the witness name,contact information,and account of the events.although it was policy to request information about accidents from potential witnesses,bowman declined and,pointing to the camera pod at the end of the aisle,stated that e verything we need will be on that camera right there.the witness then left.
bowman eventually went to look for the witness after another employee arrived at the accident scene.bowman paged the witness over the intercom and searched the grocery area,but was unable to find her.bowman later testified that she did not want to follow the witness immediately after the accident because she did not want to leave the area of the accident unsecured,and because she thought,incorrectly as it turned out,that the security cameras captured the events.the witness identity was never discovered.
was aware of the tendency for the mirror display in this store to become disorganized over the course of the day,most often through customers moving mirrors around while shopping.to address this problem,had employees check the display periodically and rearrange the mirrors if required.one such employee was jason chalmers,who not only inspected and adjusted the mirrors at three separate times each day,but also as needed,as he passed by the display during the course of other duties.chalmers provided uncontradicted testimony that he checked the mirrors around hours before the that the display sometimes became disordered within an hour of his inspection.
hodge filed suit against in federal district court,which had diversity jurisdiction over the case.applying the negligence law of virginia,the district court concluded that hodge failed to establish the existence of an unsafe condition in the store because she could not provide any evidence as to why the mirrors fell and that,even if she could show that the display constituted an unsafe condition,she had produced no evidence that could have foreseen the risk of danger.the district court also refused hodge request for an adverse inference for spoliation of evidence,reasoning that hodge did not prove that bowman conduct regarding the witness was willful.accordingly,the district court granted summary judgment to and dismissed the case.see hodge stores.
on appeal,hodge assigns error to the district court conclusions as to the merits of her negligence claim and as to her request for a spoliation inference.because a decision that an adverse inference based on spoliation was warranted would affect our analysis of the merits of hodge negligence claim,we address her spoliation claim first.because the evidence does not show that bowman willfully lost the witness potential testimony,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant such an inference.
the imposition of a sanction,an adverse inference for spoliation of evidence is an inherent power of federal one limited to that action necessary to redress conduct which abuses the judicial process and the decision to impose such a sanction is governed by federal law.silvestri general motors,cir quoting chambers nasco,d.moreover,spoliation is not a substantive claim or defense but a rule of evidence,and thus is administered at the discretion of the trial court.vodusek bayliner marine,cir.accordingly,even when reviewing the grant of summary judgment,the refusal to apply a spoliation inference must stand unless it was an abuse of the district court broad discretion in this regard.cole keller,cir.
hodge argues that the district court erred by refusing to apply an adverse inference based on alleged spoliation of relevant evidence.more specifically,hodge claims that,given her own incapacity,bowman failure even to try to obtain the witness account of the events or her identification and contact information which could have allowed hodge to obtain that account later constituted a willful loss of evidence,requiring a spoliation inference in hodge favor.
the spoliation of evidence rule allows the drawing of an adverse inference against a party whose intentional conduct causes not just the destruction of evidence,as intimates,but also against one who fails to preserve or produce the testimony of witnesses.see vodusek,at noting that failure to produce a witness that naturally would have elucidated a fact at issue may justify an adverse inference nlrb ford radio mica,cir noting that when motivation of employer in taking certain action is at issue,the general counsel refusal to elicit th e readily available and crucial testimony of a disinterested witness may well be taken to mean that the information was adverse to his case.but such an inference can not be drawn merely from his negligent loss or destruction of evidence the inference requires a showing that the party knew the evidence was relevant to some issue at trial and that his willful conduct resulted in its loss or destruction.vodusek,at.
according to hodge,the evidence in this case supports an inference that bowman knew that it was likely that would be exposed to legal liability from the accident,and that the witness could provide evidence that would adversely affect legal position,justifying an inference that bowman failure to try to obtain the witness account was deliberate.hodge claims that,in concluding that no spoliation inference was justified because of lack of proof that bowman conduct was willful,the trial court misconstrued vodusek,the only authority it cited on this ground.in turn,she contends,the court confused willful conduct which is sufficient to infer spoliation with bad faith which suffices to
