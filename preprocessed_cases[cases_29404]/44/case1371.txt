opinion of the court 
this matter comes on before this court on appeal from an order of the district court granting defendants motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint.see city of philadelphia beretta,d beretta.on this appeal,we determine whether the defendant gun manufacturers can be liable under negligence,negligent entrustment,or public nuisance theories for costs incurred by plaintiffs,principally the city of philadelphia,associated with the criminal use of handguns.for the reasons we set forth below,we answer this question in the negative and thus will affirm the order of the district court.
background 
plaintiffs,city of philadelphia the city and five civic organizations the organizational plaintiffs brought suit in the court of common pleas of philadelphia county,pennsylvania,against defendants,gun manufacturers,asserting claims of public nuisance,negligence,and negligent entrustment under pennsylvania law.plaintiffs do not contend that defendants violated any of the federal or state laws specifically regulating the sale and distribution of firearms in the united states and in the commonwealth of pennsylvania instead,plaintiffs allege that defendants conduct in the marketing and distribution of handguns allows them to fall into the hands of criminals and children,creating and contributing to their criminal use in philadelphia.plaintiffs assert that their injuries include the costs associated with preventing and responding to incidents of handgun violence and crime.see app.at compl.listing costs including those associated with criminal justice administration,police services,emergency medical services and educational programs.
the defendants timely removed the case to the district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship and,following removal,moved to dismiss the complaint under.b and b by opinion and order dated december,the district court concluded,inter alia,that plaintiffs failed to state claims for negligence,negligent entrustment,and public nuisance.thus,the district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice following which plaintiffs timely appealed

iii.discussion 
public nuisance 
a public nuisance is an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public.camden county bd.of chosen freeholders beretta,cir camden county citations and internal quotations omitted affirming dismissal of public nuisance claim against gun manufacturers under new jersey law in camden county bd.of chosen freeholders beretta,d.the courts traditionally have limited the scope of nuisance claims to interference connected with real property or infringement of public rights.id.citing page keeton et,prosser and keeton on torts at ed.thus,in camden county we observed that the scope of nuisance law has returned to its more narrow focus on these two traditional areas.id.at.moreover,f or the interference to be actionable,the defendant must exert a certain degree of control over its source.id.at citation omitted see,commonwealth of pennsylvania barnes tucker,defendants controlled mine with acid drainage muehlieb city of philadelphia,defendant kept at least dogs on residential street groff borough of sellersville,defendants owned dilapidated building.
in camden county we observed that no new jersey court has ever allowed a public nuisance claim to proceed against manufacturers of lawful products that are lawfully placed in the stream of commerce.camden county,at.likewise,the parties here do not present any pennsylvania case allowing such a claim.indeed,we indicated in camden county that t o extend public nuisance law to embrace the manufacture of handguns would be unprecedented nationwide for an appellate court.id.at see also bubalo navegar,wl,dismissing nuisance claim against gun manufacturer 
further,public nuisance is a matter of state law,and it is not the role of a federal court to expand state law in ways not foreshadowed by state precedent.see camden county,at.instead,a federal court follows the precedents of the state highest court and predicts how that court would decide the issue presented.see id.pennsylvania precedent does not support the public nuisance claim plaintiffs advance here,and we can not predict that the pennsylvania supreme court will choose to expand state public nuisance law in the manner plaintiffs urge.see leo chem,cir stating that,when deciding diversity case,f ederal courts may not engage in judicial activism.federalism concerns require that we permit state courts to decide whether and to what extent they will expand state common law our role is to apply the current law of the jurisdiction,and leave it undisturbed.quoting city of philadelphia lead indus.ass n,cir 
moreover,the gun manufacturers do not exercise significant control over the source of the interference with the public right consequently,the causal chain is too attenuated to make out a public nuisance claim.see camden county,at finding that,even if public nuisance could encompass the lawful manufacture of handguns,the manufacturers nonetheless fail to exercise sufficient control over the source of the interference with the public right to be liable under a nuisance theory penelas arms,wl,at dismissing public nuisance claims under florida law and stating that gun manufacturers have no ability to control third parties misconduct,aff,so d.see also city of cincinnati beretta,wl,at ohio affirming dismissal of nuisance claims against gun manufacturers,appeal allowed,ohio.
in camden county we found that even if the requisite element is not always termed control a degree of control by the defendant over the source of the interference is required and that the causal chain connecting gun manufacturers to the damages claimed by the city of camden was simply too attenuated to attribute sufficient control to the manufacturers to make out a public nuisance claim.camden county,at.in this case,as the district court observed,plaintiffs sole allegation of control is that the gun manufacturer s do not adopt policies which would place restrictions on the activities of the federally licensed firearms dealers.beretta,d at.further,as in camden county,t he gun manufacturers supply their products to adult,independent federally licensed firearms dealers.the defendants are not in control of the guns at the time they are misused,nor do they control the independent firearms dealers.id.
accordingly,as plaintiffs fail to state a cognizable public nuisance claim against the gun manufacturers under pennsylvania law,and as defendants lack the requisite control over the interference with a public right,we will affirm the district court dismissal of plaintiffs public nuisance claim.
negligence and negligent entrustment 
the district court found that plaintiffs claims failed for lack of proximate cause because their injuries are too remote from the gun manufacturers alleged conduct.see beretta,d at citations omitted the doctrine of remoteness provides that a plaintiff who complain s of harm flowing merely from the misfortunes visited upon a third person by the defendant acts is generally said to stand at too remote a distance to recover.holmes securities investor prot,d citation omitted see also steamfitters local union welfare fund philip morris,cir steamfitters applying doctrine in suit against tobacco manufacturers,cert.denied,d.thus,a plaintiff who can not establish some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged fails to plead a key element for establishing proximate causation,independent of and in addition to other traditional elements of proximate cause.laborers local health benefit fund philip morris,cir laborers local quoting holmes,at.at,cert.denied,d.accordingly,an injury that is too remote from its causal agent fails to satisfy tort law proximate cause requiremen
