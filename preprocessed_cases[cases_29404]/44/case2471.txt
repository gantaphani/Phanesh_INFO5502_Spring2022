plaintiff,rossie marie miller,appeals from two orders of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of all of the defendants in this wrongful death action brought pursuant to and denying miller motion for leave to amend the complaint.miller initiated the action after her brother,john king lindsay stanford,died of a brain tumor on april,while in pretrial custody at the calhoun county correctional facility the correctional facility in calhoun county,michigan the county.the complaint alleges that the county policies governing the provision of medical care to inmates and the training of correctional facility staff were deliberately indifferent and grossly negligent with respect to the serious medical needs of inmates,in violation of the eighth amendment.the complaint further alleges that numerous individual corrections officer defendants had been deliberately indifferent to stanford serious medical condition in the days and hours leading up to his death.finally,the complaint alleges that the correctional facility physician,mehmet ismailoglu,had been deliberately indifferent and grossly negligent with respect to stanford medical condition.the district court concluded that miller failed to demonstrate that any of the defendants were deliberately indifferent to stanford medical condition in violation of his eighth amendment rights.in addition,the district court denied miller motion for leave to amend the complaint to allege that ismailoglu was a policymaker for purposes of municipal liability under pembaur city of cincinnati,d.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm.
background 
at on friday,april,john king lindsay stanford,then years old,was booked into the correctional facility in battle creek,michigan and placed in pretrial detention on charges of auto theft.as part of the booking procedure,stanford was asked a number of questions regarding his medical history.in response to one such question,stanford indicated that he had sustained a head injury approximately one month earlier.he did not disclose any further details of his injury,however,except to report that his injury was not causing him any problems at that time.the booking officer recorded this information in stanford file.
stanford was assigned to share a cell with inmate michael owen.owen later reported that shortly before on friday,april,stanford complained of a headache to a guard and requested aspirin.owen further reported that sometime in the afternoon of saturday,april,stanford again complained of a headache to a guard,and again requested aspirin.according to owen,stanford made a third request for aspirin around on saturday evening.
at approximately on saturday,april,stanford approached two corrections osteen and again requested pain medication for a headache behind his eye.osteen left to obtain the necessary approval from sergeant lindsay,the shift commander,and returned at about ten minutes past midnight with two motrin tablets.
at approximately on april,lapham appeared at stanford cell in response to pounding on the door by owen.owen later stated that he had been pounding for at least several minutes before the deputy arrived.when lapham entered the cell,he observed stanford lying on the floor of the cell in a puddle of water.although stanford was awake,he did not appear to be aware of lapham presence,and did not respond to the deputy verbal inquiries.lapham immediately radioed lindsay to report a medical situation.while they were waiting for help to arrive,owen advised lapham that stanford had fallen out of bed three times in short succession.
within a brief time,lindsay arrived at the cell,along with deputies osteen,everett,and taylor.lindsay observed water on the floor and noted that the front of stanford pants was wet.upon questioning,owen advised the sergeant that stanford had dropped a cup of water when he fell.lindsay then asked stanford whether he had hit his head when he fell,to which stanford,now responsive,stated that he had not.in the meantime,lapham left the cell to retrieve stanford medical profile,and reported back to lindsay that stanford had sustained a recent head injury.stanford advised the officers that he had been in pain since the early evening of april.he complained of severe pain in his eyeballs.when lindsay asked whether stanford had suffered any head injuries,stanford replied that he had,about a year and a half ago.joint appendix at.lindsay checked stanford pulse at this time and found it to be strong and steady.
the officers placed stanford in a wheelchair and transported him to the prisoner intake area intake for observation.lindsay,lapham,and taylor accompanied stanford.lapham reported that on numerous occasions along the way,the officers had to stop and sit inmate stanford back up in the chair because he kept sliding out.at.lindsay later opined that this was probably not uncommon because the wheelchair was an older model lacking footrests.at lindsay dep.at.during one of these stops,lindsay inquired whether stanford could see her,and stanford responded,you look like mickey to me,at,an apparent reference to lindsay nickname.lindsay then asked whether stanford could see her clearly or whether she was blurry,to which stanford replied that he could see her ok.at.lindsay also asked stanford whether he was under the influence of any street drugs and whether he had a history of diabetes stanford responded to both questions in the negative.taylor reported that during this period,stanford appeared coherent to some degree but very disoriented.at.
upon arrival at intake,the deputies assisted stanford in changing into dry clothing.meanwhile,lindsay accessed stanford computer file and phoned mehmet ismailoglu,the physician for the correctional facility.lindsay advised the doctor that stanford had fallen,was initially unresponsive to questioning,but had later spoken responsively and coherently to her.in addition,lindsay told the doctor that stanford pupils were equally dilated,and that he had earlier complained of a headache behind his right eye.lindsay also informed the doctor that stanford had reported sustaining a head injury in the past,although she later could not recall whether she told the doctor that the injury occurred a month or a year and a half earlier.
ismailoglu advised lindsay that medical staff would see stanford in the morning.lindsay suggested that the intake staff monitor stanford on a basis,and ismailoglu agreed.ismailoglu later testified that there was not anything striking about the call i got from the jail.there was no urgency in the message that i got.there was nothing there to alert me that i should either respond physically or call them call for to have this individual transported.at ismailoglu dep.at.the record reflects that lindsay phone call to ismailoglu lasted minutes.at,ismailoglu dep.at ismailoglu br.at.at deposition,ismailoglu could not specifically recall having been told that stanford had reported a recent head injury,that he was initially unresponsive,or that he was unable to remain seated in the wheelchair while en route to intake.
intake staff initiated a log shortly before on april and made observations of stanford roughly every half hour for the next seven hours.the stated reason for initiating the log was possible seizure.at.stanford cell was equipped with a mattress,which was placed directly on the floor.for most of the night,intake staff observed stanford rolling around on floor.at.nevertheless,the record reflects that when officers spoke to stanford,they found him to be responsive and coherent.at.at approximately,stanford requested a snickers bar,stating that he thought his blood sugar was low and that this might be causing his headache.the intake staff administered a blood sugar test and confirmed a normal reading.three hours later,stanford was observed masturbating.the entry for shows that stanford was m oving,appears at.likewise,the entry for reflects that stanford was l ying in the bed area,appears at.the record reflects that throughout the night stanford condition neither worsend sic or improved.at.

hospital records indicate that stanford was comatose when he arrived at the emergency room at approximately at.ismailoglu was again contacted.the evaluating physician at the hospital diagnosed stanford as suffering from a massive right vasoganglion hemorrhage and recommended that surgery not be performed.at.stanford condition deteriorated throughout the day.he died at on sunday,april.it was later determined that the cause of death was a primary brain.at certificate of death.
on april,rossie marie miller,stanford sister,initiated this action in the western district of michigan,southern division,seeking relief under.the district court had federal question jurisdiction over the case pursuant to.counts i and ii of the complaint allege that defendants calhoun county,sheriff allen byam,and jail administrator captain terry cook collectively the county defendants had been deliberately indifferent and grossly negligent with respect to stanford medical needs during his period of incarceration.count iii alleges that defendants lindsay,osteen,lapham,deputy jeffrey holley,deputy holly thomas,leavell,and everett collectively the corrections officer defendants likewise had been deliberately indifferent and grossly negligent with respect to stanford medical needs during his period of incarceration.count iv alleges deliberate indifference and gross negligence on the part of ismailoglu.the case ultimately was assigned to magistrate judge hugh brenneman,and the parties consented to judge brenneman exercising full judicial authority pursuant to c and.
on may,ismailoglu moved for summary judgment.oral argument on the motion was heard on august.the county defendants and corrections officer defendants moved to dismiss for summary judgment on september.shortly thereafter,on september,miller sought leave to amend the complaint to allege that ismailoglu was a policymaker for purposes of.on november,oral argument was heard jointly on the county defendants and corrections officer defendants motion to dismiss for summary judgment and miller motion for leave to amend.in an opinion dated february,and an order dated march,the district court granted ismailoglu motion for summary judgment.thereafter,on september,the district court issued an opinion and an order denying miller motion to amend as futile and granting summary judgment for the county defendants and corrections officer defendants.miller now appeals those rulings.this court has jurisdiction over the present appeal pursuant to.

the supreme court has adopted a mixed objective and subjective standard for ascertaining the existence of deliberate indifference in the context of the eighth amendment 
a prison official can not be found liable under the eighth amendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,and he must also draw the inference.

in the proceedings below,miller alleged that the county defendants were deliberately indifferent to stanford serious medical needs by failing to provide adequate medical screening and treatment of inmates,and by failing to implement and enforce adequate procedures for the hiring and training of correctional facility staff,medical personnel,and professionals.the district court rejected these allegations,finding that miller had presented no evidence that the correctional facility engaged in a clear and persistent pattern of mistreatment of detainees,and no evidence that other detainees at the correctional facility had been subjected to the same alleged mistreatment.policies and procedures were in place requiring corrections officers to contact a physician in the event of a medical emergency,the district court found,and those procedures were followed during stanford period of incarceration.the court rejected miller argument that the county defendants failed to hire or train personnel to handle medical emergencies,finding that all of the officers at the correctional facility had received at least basic training in first aid and cpr.in addition,the court found no evidence that the corrections officers training was inadequate.finally,the court noted that the fact that a nurse is now on duty throughout the night at the correctional facility is not evidence that the county defendants were deliberately indifferent at the time of stanford incarceration.
miller now argues that the district court erred in focusing on the written policies of the county defendants without considering the de facto customs and practices in place at the correctional facility.specifically,miller contends that the sheriff and county delegated de facto to the shift commander and doctor.miller br.at.as such,miller maintains that the deliberate indifference that lindsay and ismailoglu allegedly exhibited during stanford period of incarceration should be attributable to the county,as it reflects the county official policy.
although it is true that final policymaking authority may be delegated,pembaur,at,it is equally true that mere authority to exercise discretion while performing particular functions does not make a municipal employee a final policymaker unless the official decisions are final and unreviewable and are not constrained by the official policies of superior officials.feliciano city of cleveland,cir.c onsideration should be given to whether the employee formulates plans for the implementation of broad goals.hager pike county bd.of,cir quoting faughender city of olmsted,ohio,cir.in light of this standard,miller argument finds no support in the record.
there is no dispute that under state law,byam,as sheriff,enjoyed final policymaking authority over the correctional facility,and that he and his predecessor promulgated the procedures and policies that governed the correctional facility.however,miller conflates decisionmaking with policymaking when she insists that lindsay was,by county policy,the de facto as to emergency care for inmates on the midnight shift.miller br.at.even assuming that lindsay had been vested with authority to make limited decisions concerning inmate medical care during her shift,miller fails to explain how this differs from mere authority to exercise discretion.feliciano,at see also pembaur,at.the fact that a particular a policymaking discretion in the exercise of particular functions does not,without more,give rise to municipal liability based on an exercise of that discretion.miller advances no argument and proffers no evidence that lindsay decisions were not subject to review,or that lindsay possessed any authority to formulate plans for the implementation of broad goals.hager,at.indeed,miller only evidentiary support for her argument that lindsay had been delegated policymaking authority is a citation to byam deposition testimony,in which the sheriff expressed his belief that the officers at the correctional facility followed protocol in dealing with stanford.such statements provide no support for the proposition that lindsay had been delegated final authority to implement policy 
to sidestep the absence of documentary evidence supporting her claim,miller notes that liability need not be predicated upon written policies,but may arise from custom.monell,at.however,miller falls well short of establishing that the county adhered to an actionable custom.a municipal custom may be established by proof of the knowledge of policymaking officials and their acquiescence in the established practice.memphis.area local,am.postal workers union city of memphis,cir.for a custom to give rise to monell liability,the custom must be so permanent and well settled as to constitute a custom or usage with the force of law.doe claiborne county,cir quoting monell,at.such a custom must include d eeply embedded traditional ways of carrying out state policy.id.quoting nashville,chattanooga louis ry.browning.
miller argues that the district court was in error in concluding that a county may not be responsible for the de facto customs and practices that characterize its actual operation.miller br.at.the district court,however,drew no such conclusion.in granting summary judgment for the county defendants,the district court properly applied the factors identified in doe claiborne county.that case,like the present case,involved a plaintiff who argued that liability should attach against a municipal entity by virtue of prevailing custom within the municipality,namely,institutional inaction in the face of violations of substantive due process rights.see doe,at.in the instant case,the district court,modifying the doe factors to fit the facts presented,wrote that 
t o state a municipal liability claim under an inaction theory in the present case,plaintiff must establish 
the existence of a clear and persistent pattern of mistreatment of detainees 
notice or constructive notice on the part of the county 
the county tacit approval of the unconstitutional conduct,such that their deliberate indifference in their failure to act can be said to amount to an official policy of inaction and 
that the county custom was the moving force or direct causal link in the constitutional deprivation.
miller calhoun county,slip op.at,citing doe,at.indeed,contrary to miller assertion,the lower court very application of doe evinces the court recognition that a municipality may be held liable for municipal custom under certain circumstances.those circumstances are nevertheless absent from this case.
d eliberate indifference is a stringent standard of fault,requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a known or obvious consequence of his action.bd.of county comm rs brown,d.this in turn typically requires proof that the municipality was aware of prior unconstitutional actions by its employees and failed to take corrective measures.stemler city of florence,cir.additionally,a plaintiff must prove that the municipal policies and practices directly caused the constitutional violation.gray ex rel.estate of gray city of detroit,cir.
the district court properly found that miller failed to make the threshold showing of a clear and persistent pattern of mistreatment of detainees.miller argues that the county is at fault for permitting a situation in which lindsay,untrained in emergency medical care,bore complete responsibility for deciding whether to contact the doctor and what information to convey to him.but miller does not deny that the correctional facility had a policy whereby the shift commander was to contact the doctor in the event of a medical emergency,or that lindsay followed that policy on april.miller further fails to adduce independent evidence tending to show that such a policy was unreasonable.gray,at stating that reasonable policies negligently administered do not give rise to a finding of deliberate indifference.indeed,there is no evidence of similar incidents having previously occurred at the correctional facility such that the county would be on notice of the danger of constitutional violations.under such circumstances,the district court did not err in concluding that the county was not deliberately indifferent to stanford serious medical condition.
miller contends,in a related argument,that the district court overlooked the county liability arising from its failure to properly train those exercising constitutional authority over others.miller br.at.it is settled that o nly where a municipality failure to train its employees in a relevant respect evidences a deliberate indifference to the rights of its inhabitants can such a shortcoming be properly thought of as a city policy or custom that is actionable under.harris,at.mere allegations that an officer was improperly trained or that an injury could have been avoided with better training are insufficient to prove liability.sova city of pleasant,cir.
miller offers no evidence supporting her allegation that the county failure to train amounted to deliberate indifference to the medical needs of detainees at the correctional facility.her argument pivots on lindsay admitted lack of emergency medical training,an argument that the district court rejected.lindsay testified at deposition that she had received hours of training from the department of corrections that included instruction on handling certain medical situations,and that she was trained in first aid and cpr.at,lindsay dep.at.other corrections officers reported having received similar training.at everett dep.at,holley dep.at,lapham dep.at,osteen dep.at,thomas dep.at.lindsay further testified that the correctional facility adhered to a medical policy whereby inmates were initially checked by staff to find out what the problem is according to the inmate,and then that information is then relayed to the medical staff who handles the inmate care from that point.at lindsay dep.at.to counter this evidence,miller merely argues that a reasonable jury could find deliberate indifference on the part of the county.she offers no evidence beyond the facts of this case tending to show that the county training and staffing policies were inadequate.there is no history of similar incidents at the correctional facility,nothing to show that the county was on notice,and nothing to show that the county failure to take meliorative action was deliberate.
in the final equation,miller bases her argument entirely on the circumstances surrounding her brother death,but a single act may establish municipal liability only where the actor is a municipal policymaker.pembaur,at.as the supreme court instructed in harris,the question is 
whether that training program is adequate and if it is not,the question becomes whether such inadequate training can justifiably be said to represent city policy.it may seem contrary to common sense to assert that a municipality will actually have a policy of not taking reasonable steps to train its employees.but it may happen that in light of the duties assigned to specific officers or employees the need for more or different training is so obvious,and the inadequacy so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights,that the policymakers of the city can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.
at.see also gray,at noting that the supreme court has adopted an objective obviousness standard for training program adequacy.because miller has failed to demonstrate that the correctional facility policies were objectively inadequate,much less that the county was deliberately indifferent to the obvious inadequacy of those policies,we find that the district court did not err in rejecting,as a matter of law,plaintiff theory regarding failure to train.
in summary,we believe that the record amply supports a conclusion that the district court did not err in finding that lindsay was not a policymaker for purposes of.further,the district court did not err in finding that miller failed to satisfy the doe factors and failed to submit any evidence to support a theory of liability.accordingly,we affirm the lower court grant of summary judgment for the county defendants 
b.the district court did not err in denying plaintiff motion for leave to amend the complaint 
on september,miller sought leave to amend her complaint to allege that ismailoglu was a policymaker for purposes of pembaur liability.the district court denied the motion for leave to amend,finding no basis in michigan law to support the legal conclusion that ismailoglu was a policymaker.thus,the district court concluded that amendment of the complaint would be futile.miller now renews her argument that ismailoglu was a municipal policymaker.
a party may amend its pleading once as a matter of course at any time before the responsive pleading is served.a.after a responsive pleading has been served,a party may amend its pleading only by leave of court,and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.id.a court need not grant leave to amend,however,where amendment would be futile.foman davis,d.amendment of a complaint is futile when the proposed amendment would not permit the complaint to survive a motion to dismiss.neighborhood dev.advisory council on historic,cir.where a district court draws a legal conclusion that amendment would be futile,that conclusion is reviewed de novo.inge rock fin,cir.
miller argues that ismailoglu was a municipal policymaker,and that in holding to the contrary,the district court focused exclusively on the county written policies while ignoring de facto customs and practices.accordingly,miller does not appear to dispute the district court finding that state law confers final policymaking authority for county jails on the sheriff and jail administrator.rather,miller position on appeal is that the sheriff and jail administrator delegated de facto to the shift commander and doctor.miller br.at.it was in the exercise of this delegated authority,miller argues,that ismailoglu became a policymaker.
miller argument with respect to ismailoglu suffers from the same deficiencies as her argument with respect to lindsay.in particular,miller does not differentiate between policymaking and mere authority to exercise discretion.feliciano,at.only the former confers liability on a municipality.see pembaur,at.the fact that a particular a policymaking discretion in the exercise of particular functions does not,without more,give rise to municipal liability based on an exercise of that discretion.miller glosses over the fact that policymaking implies the power to formulate plans for the implementation of broad goals.hager,at internal quotation marks omitted.a policymaker decisions are final and unreviewable and are not constrained by the official policies of superior officials.feliciano,at.
miller makes no argument and advances no evidence that ismailoglu possessed authority to set broad goals with respect to the medical treatment of inmates at the correctional facility.to the contrary,the record reflects that ismailoglu contracted to provide services for approximately eight hours per week,and to be on call hours a day.at byam dep.at,ismailoglu dep.at.with respect to medical staffing procedures,ismailoglu testified that he was involved in the administrative portion of it.at ismailoglu dep.at.indeed,ismailoglu deposition testimony reveals not a single instance in which the doctor set or influenced medical policy at the correctional facility.by way of comparison,sheriff byam testified that,pursuant to his policymaking authority,he had appointed a training coordinator for the correctional facility,at byam dep.at sought accreditation for the correctional facility,at byam dep.at requested bids for medical services,at byam dep.at changed medical providers,at byam dep.at formulated policy for medical care at the correctional facility,at byam dep.at and initiated an investigation into stanford death,at byam dep.at.the record leaves no doubt that de facto policymaking authority resided with the sheriff,not with ismailoglu.
accordingly,the record clearly supports the district court conclusion that amendment of the complaint to allege that ismailoglu was a policymaker would have been futile.we therefore affirm the district court denial of miller motion for leave to amend the complaint.
c.the district court did not err in granting summary judgment for ismailoglu 
on march,the district court granted summary judgment for ismailoglu.in an earlier opinion,the court stated that it was basing its decision on the undisputed facts that the doctor accepted lindsay telephone call,listened to a recitation of facts from the facility personnel,and made a medical judgment to treat the symptoms with a course of action that included observing the decedent keeping an observation log every thirty minutes and,examination of the decedent when the medical staff arrived for the morning shift.miller calhoun county,slip op.at.the court found no evidence that ismailoglu acted negligently or with deliberate indifferenc
