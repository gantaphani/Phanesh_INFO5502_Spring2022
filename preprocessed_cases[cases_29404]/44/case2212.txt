defendants,riddell sports,rsi,riddell,ri,and all american sports corporation,doing business as american.aa,appeal a judgment holding them strictly liable for a design defect in a football helmet worn by plaintiff jose rodriguez when he allegedly suffered a blow causing brain injury,and finding them liable for the bystander emotional distress suffered by jose mother,raquel rodriguez.concluding that the district court erred in charging the jury and that,as a matter of law,no bystander claim was viable,we reverse,remand in part,and render in part.
in,jose was a football player at los fresnos high school.at the first football scrimmage of the year,he played both offense and defense and took more than twenty hits to his helmet.after making his last tackle,which witnesses described as a seemingly normal one,he got up,went to the huddle,and walked or jogged off the field to the bench,where he first sat,then lay down in front of the bench and lost consciousness.
jose mother,raquel,was present in the stands during the scrimmage but did not see jose last tackle,see him leave the field,or see him lie down.sometime later,she was told that he was lying on the ground,so she went down to the field and saw him unconscious and foaming at the mouth.jose was taken to a hospital and diagnosed as having suffered a subdural hematoma,causing permanent brain injury and a permanent vegetative state.
jose and his mother sued for product liability and bystander injury against the manufacturer of jose helmet.they asserted that a design defect in the helmet manufactured by ri and reconditioned by aa significantly increased the chance of brain injury such as that jose had suffered.
defendants are separate but related corporations.ri manufactures the helmet aa is an athletic equipment reconditioner rsi is a holding company and the parent of ri and aa.the helmet jose wore was manufactured by ri and purchased by the school district before the football season and was reconditioned by aa in early.the helmet liner contained cells of an foam old rubatex foam that plaintiffs claim was fabricated by ri in september.
plaintiffs assert that the helmet was manufactured and purchased in.they base this contention on the fact that the number stamped in the shell of the helmet meant the year and that the number stamped in the liner meant september.defendants challenge this claim,arguing that the helmet may have been manufactured as early as.
in,ri received samples of a new foam.it did some initial tests on the foam from february to may but did not test the foam again until october,when it concluded that the new foam had better qualities and began to use it in its helmets.
plaintiffs claim that if jose helmet had contained the new foam or thicker pieces of the old foam,the injury would not have occurred.plaintiffs biomechanical expert,stalnaker,testified that the new foam would have reduced substantially the risk of a subdural hematoma.therefore,stalnaker characterized jose helmet as defective and unreasonably dangerous and,alternatively,opined that it could have been made safer simply by using less comfort foam and thicker pieces of the old foam.
in response,ri helmet designer stated that the helmet stalnaker designed for demonstration at trial,with thicker foam,was not practical.stalnaker design required removing most of the soft comfort foam and replacing it with hard foam.ri designer claimed players would not wear such a helmet,because it would be too uncomfortable.as to the claim that the new foam should have been used in jose helmet,ri argued that it could not be used until testing was complete in october months after jose injury.
plaintiffs argued,however,that ri could have begun using the new foam much earlier,because ri had received its first samples of it in february.ri disagreed,introducing evidence that it had sent the sample foam back to the supplier for the supplier to address some concerns ri had with it.ri also presented testimony that the producer of the new foam was not sure initially that it could supply the new foam consistently.
nonetheless,plaintiffs alleged that the reason the new foam was not tested again until october was that ri wanted to use up its stock of old,inferior foam.the only evidence plaintiffs introduced to support these allegations was that ri canceled an order of the old foam in.this occurred,however,before ri had even received samples of the new foam.
plaintiffs also argued that even if jose helmet was manufactured before ri received any new foam,the new foam could have been inserted by aa when it had jose helmet from december to may for reconditioning.defendants denied that the new foam was available for use at that time and argued further that aa,as a mere service provider,had no obligation to upgrade jose helmet.
in addition to the products liability claim,plaintiffs assert a bystander claim on the theory that raquel rodriguez witnessed the manifestation of jose injury and,under texas law,is entitled to recover for emotional distress.defendants dispute the existence of any such bystander claim,because raquel rodriguez did not perceive both the accident and the manifestation of injury.
after plaintiffs rested,defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law for insufficiency of the evidence on the design defect claim and as to the bystander claim.after both sides closed,the court deemed all motions timely reurged.
defendants also objected to the jury charge,arguing that the referred to the defendants as one allow the jury to find for plaintiffs without their having proved their case against each defendant.the court denied the objection.
after the verdict,defendants reurged their motion for on the bystander claim.the court denied all pending motions and awarded jose million and raquel million.
defendants contend the court erred as a matter of law in its jury charge by treating all the defendants as one entity and submitting questions on products liability as to parent rsi.it is undisputed that defendants objected to the charge before the case was submitted,in accordance with fed.civ.we review errors of law de novo but reverse a charging error only where the charge as a whole leaves us with substantial and ineradicable doubt whether the jury has been properly guided in its deliberations.stine marathon oil,cir citation omitted.
question one of the charge asked was there a design defect in the football helmet at the time it left the possession of defendants that was a producing cause of the injury in question emphasis added.question four,the other question referring to the defendants,asked did the defendants actions rise to a level of willful or callous and reckless indifference to the safety or rights of others emphasis added 
the evidence showed that aa is a separate corporation from ri.although both aa and ri are owned by rsi,a holding company,plaintiffs did not argue that defendants were alter egos,that they were agents of each other,or that the corporate veil should be pierced.absent proof of one of these conditions,the corporate form must be respected.see lucas.
defendants argue that treating them as one entity was an error of law,because they are separate,and that the harm of this aggregation is that it allowed the jury to apply the strict liability applies only to service provider aa and to rsi and allowed the jury to consider the helmet to be in the possession of the triggering a duty to it was merely at the shop of a service provider.
plaintiffs respond that defendants can not object to the combining of the defendants in the charge,because defendants invited the error by referring to themselves collectively.see united states baytank,cir defendants disagree,saying that plaintiffs take defendants comments out of context and that defense counsel said defendant only when referring to a particular defendant,usually ri.
a thorough review of the record shows that defendants did not object as often as they could have when plaintiffs referred to them as one entity and that defense counsel,from time to time,may have been a bit sloppy in his references to defendants nonetheless,the evidence is plain that the three defendants were distinct corporations.
further,it is plaintiffs duty to prove each element of their prima facie case.thus if combining two corporations into one is necessary to apply a strict liability standard,then plaintiffs must prove that the corporations should be combined,and sloppiness on the part of defendants does not excuse plaintiffs from this burden.
plaintiffs argue,alternatively,that it was harmless error for the court to combine all three defendants,because defendants have common stockholders and common insurance coverage.thus,according to plaintiffs,it does not matter which defendant is found liable,because the same insurance company will pay.
this is not enough to disregard the corporate form,however.under plaintiffs theory,there would be no point in having separately incorporated subsidiaries,because merely having common stockholders or insurers would be enough to allow the corporate form to be disregarded.moreover,plaintiffs do not address defendants argument that aggregating the defendants allowed the jury to treat aa possession of the helmet as equivalent to ri possession and control of the duties and liabilities that apply to a manufacturer instead of those that apply to a service provider.
under texas law,a manufacturer is strictly liable for a design defect if a product was unreasonably dangerous when it left its control.bell helicopter bradshaw,christi,writ ref restatement of torts.
if the product is not unreasonably dangerous at the time it leaves the manufacturer control,the manufacturer does not become strictly liable for damages if the product subsequently becomes unreasonably dangerous unless the manufacturer regains a significant degree of control of the product,and the product is then determined to be unreasonably dangerous before the manufacturer loses control of the product.

we evaluate whether a product has a design defect in light of the economic and scientific feasibility of safer alternatives.caterpillar,shears,citing boatland of houston,bailey.the degree of feasibility is one factor courts weigh in balancing the utility of a product versus its risks.id.citing turner motors.however,if there are no safer alternatives,a product is not unreasonably dangerous as a matter of law.id.citing boatland,at.texas law does not require a manufacturer to destroy the utility of his product in order to make it safe.hagans oliver mach,cir.
defendants contend that the jury may have found strict liability in either of two ways,one of which would have been based on legal error.on one hand,the jury may have given credence to plaintiffs evidence that jose helmet was unreasonably dangerous at the time of its design or by the time it was sold.the jury may have believed stalnaker testimony that the helmet could have been made safer at the time of its design in merely by inserting more foam and using less comfort foam.if the jury reached this conclusion of fact,its verdict would be unassailable,because,by law,if a safer alternative design existed at the time of manufacture and sale,then the product was unreasonably dangerous.
on the other hand,if the jury did not believe that a safer alternative existed when the helmet was sold,it must have found liability under a legally erroneous theory.the jury may have believed defendants design witness,who testified that stalnaker design was infeasible because removing the comfort foam to add more hard,foam would make the helmet so uncomfortable that no one would want to wear it.
if this were the case,the jury,to reach its finding of liability,must have believed that as soon as ri completed its first round of tests on the new foam in may months before ri manufactured any helmets using the new safer alternative design had become available.the jury further must have the jury instruction referred to all three defendants as when aa the reconditioner had jose helmet in may,it was the same as if ri the manufacturer had the helmet,and therefore there was a duty to substitute the new foam that ri had in sample form,because the new foam constituted a safer alternative design 
this would have been error,because under texas law a maintenance contract does not impose on the contractor responsibility for design defects or to upgrade a product.see muniz ransomes am,aff,cir.in fact,even if,hypothetically,plaintiffs had made a negligence claim against aa for not using the new foam,to maintain the action the contractor must have a duty to enhance the product.aa contract with the school specifically said that it did not have that duty aa does not undertake to change or modify the design,construction,material or fitness of the athletic equipment herein listed,it sic only obligation being to recondition such equipment as herein specified.
plaintiffs disagree,arguing that ri regained significant control over the helmet when aa took it in for reconditioning as the authorized agent and sister company of riddell,the helmet is deemed to have left the hands of riddell on the same day it left the hands of all american with insufficiently thick,inferior old foam.plaintiffs introduced no evidence that the is the authorized agent or sister company of ri.we assume,though,that plaintiffs meant to argue that ri and aa have such a unique relationship that ri regained a significant degree of control over the helmet when aa reconditioned it,thus subjecting ri to strict liability because the safest available foam was not used.
plaintiffs rely heavily on bell helicopter,in which plaintiff claimed that a helicopter had an unreasonably dangerous tail rotor blade.although the court found that the blade was not unreasonably dangerous when it initially left bell control in,the court held that bell regained a significant degree of control of the helicopter when houston helicopters,a bell service station,acquired title to the helicopter in.bell helicopter,at.
in,bell learned that the tail rotor blade was dangerous and began a program to replace it.the helicopter at issue,however,was never refitted with an improved blade houston helicopters sold the helicopter to the plaintiff in.the court held as a matter of law that bell had control of the helicopter,for strict liability purposes,when houston helicopters owned it,because of the unique relationship between the service stations and bell.id.at.
although bell did not possess the actual power of the faa to require owners to replace the system with the system,as a practical matter,it could accomplish the same result through its service stations.all of bell service stations were required to adhere to and comply with all service bulletins or safety notices regarding component parts,the servicing of same,or the replacement thereof.had bell demanded a replacement of the system with the system or delivered an adequate notice concerning the unreasonably dangerous condition of the system during the time the helicopter remained in the possession of houston helicopters,the latter would have complied with bell directive.
defendants contend that bell helicopter is not determinative and that this case is more like dion ford motor,writ denied,which distinguished bell helicopter and ruled that a manufacturer had not regained a significant degree of control of a tractor so as to subject it to strict liability.in dion,a plaintiff sued for damages incurred when his model tractor rolled over and crushed him he argued that the tractor was unreasonably dangerous because it did not have a rollover protection system.the court held that the tractor was not unreasonably dangerous when it was manufactured in,because no tractors manufactured at that time had rollover protection systems.
as technology improved,all ford tractors were built with rollover protection systems,and ford began manufacturing such systems that could be placed on the model.the court noted that,like the plaintiff in bell helicopter,dion had his tractor serviced at a service station authorized by the manufacturer no one at the station told him that he should have a rollover protection system installed.the court distinguished bell helicopter,pointing out that mcmaster ford never took title to the tractor,and ford never issued any replacement program for the tractor.id.at.the court concluded that ford did not regain a significant degree of control as required by bell helicopter company.id 
whether a duty exists under a given set of facts and circumstances is essentially a question of law for the trial court.id.citations omitted.we review questions of law de novo.stine marathon oil,cir.
our task,therefore,is to determine whether the instant facts are more similar to those in bell helicopter or to those in dion.if the former,then as a matter of law the manufacturer regained a significant degree of control and is strictly liable.if the latter,then strict liability does not apply to the reconditioning of the helmet.
the facts of this case are more similar to those in dion indeed,they are almost identical.as in dion,ri manufactured and sold the product,at which point it lost control of it.then,some time later,an authorized service provider serviced the helmet without ever taking title to it.further,ri instituted no program to replace the old foam with the new.in fact,ri had not even begun to use the new foam itself.
thus,as a matter of law,ri never regained the significant degree of control required to make it strictly liable for the helmet when it was in aa shop for servicing if the jury found ri strictly liable for aa failure to improve the helmet,this was legal error.
as we have said,we vacate a jury award if the jury charge as a whole leaves substantial and ineradicable doubt whether the jury has been properly guided.see skidmore precision printing packaging,cir.we do not reverse where the jury instructions contain mere factual errors instead,we assume the jury considered all the evidence in reaching its decision.walther lone star gas,cir.
when the court erroneously instructs a jury on the law,however,the jury may correctly apply the facts to the incorrect legal standard in making its decision.therefore,if a jury could find liability according to multiple theories,and one of them is erroneous,we reverse unless we can tell that the jury came to its decision using only correct legal theories.id.if it is impossible to tell whether a correct theory has been used,we reverse for a new trial.id such is the case here.
the court also erred as a matter of law in allowing the case to go to the jury with regard to rsi.it is undisputed that rsi is a holding company and parent of ri and aa but does not produce anything or place anything in the stream of commerce.generally,a court will not disregard the corporate fiction and hold a corporation liable for the obligations of its subsidiary except where it appears the corporate entity of the subsidiary is being used as a sham to perpetrate a fraud,to avoid liability,to avoid the effect of a statute,or in other exceptional circumstances.lucas,citing torregrossa szelc.
there must be something more than mere unity of financial interest,ownership and control for a court to treat the subsidiary as the alter ego of the parent and make the parent liable for the subsidiary tort.id.nothing of this sort is even alleged,so it was an error of law not to dismiss rsi we reverse and render judgment for that defendant.
raquel rodriguez bystander recovery must be reversed as a matter of law.in texas,bystander recovery is available if a plaintiff can establish that 
the plaintiff was located near the scene of the accident,as contrasted with one who was a distance away from it 
the plaintiff suffered shock as a result of a direct emotional impact upon the plaintiff from a sensory and contemporaneous observance of the accident,as contrasted with learning of the accident from others after its occurrence and 
the plaintiff and the victim were closely related,as contrasted with an absence of any relationship or the presence of only a distant relationship.
freeman city of pasadena,the texas supreme court,while recognizing that these elements are flexible and should be applied on a basis,recently clarified that the issue of bystander recovery becomes a question of law when the material facts are undisputed.see united services auto.ass keith.
in keith,dianna keith arrived on the scene of an automobile accident and perceived that her daughter car was still smoking,and heard the scary noises her daughter was making in response to her injuries.keith remained there while the rescue crews removed her daughter from the car and accompanied her daughter to the hospital.
despite keith being a witness to the pain and suffering that resulted from the accident,the court denied the claim,stating that texas law still requires the bystander presence when the injury occurred and the contemporaneous perception of the accident.id.where a plaintiff does not meet these requirements,even where the observance of the effects of the injury creates an emotional impact,she is in the same position as any other close relative who sees and experiences the immediate aftermath of a serious injury to a loved one recovery is not available.id.that a parent arrives on the scene and witnesses a child pain and suffering at the site of the accident rather than at the hospital or some other location does not affect the analysis.id.
here,raquel rodriguez did not witness the did not have a contemporaneous perception of it.there is little doubt that seeing her son suffering from the effects of his at the mouth and spitting horrifying and emotionally painful.emotional distress,however,must occur under certain conditions,not met here,for a parent to be entitled to bystander recovery.the court erred in allowing this question of law to go to the jury.
defendants claim the court committed plain error by repeatedly intervening in the trial to the plaintiffs benefit and by encouraging the jury to think of the defendants as one entity.the testimony of the expert witnesses was in sharp conflict on the issues of causation and design defect.the credibility of the experts therefore became a crucial criterion by which the jury could determine whom to believe.defendants contend the court repeatedly questioned defense witnesses in such a way so as to discredit them and show that the court did not believe them.
further,defendants aver that the court references to jose rodriguez as a victim and to defendants as defendant tipped the jury that the judge thought rodriguez was a victim of defendants product and that the defendants could be viewed as one entity,in contradiction of corporate law.finally,defendants claim the court took charge of the questioning of one defense witness and suggested an argument against defendants that plaintiffs had not come up with on their own.
defendants did not object at trial to the court interventions,so a plain error standard applies.see united states gray,cir.plain error is clear or obvious,and,a t a minimum,contemplates an error which was clear under current law at the time of trial.united states calverley,cir en banc quoting united states olano,d.t o be reviewable under this standard an obvious legal error must affect substantial rights p lain forfeited errors affecting substantial rights should be corrected on appeal only if they seriously affect the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at quoting united states atkinson.
a trial judge has wide discretion over the tone and tempo of a trial and may elicit further information from a witness if he believes it would benefit the jury.united states rodriguez,cir quoting united states adkins,cir.federal rule of evidence b allows the court to interrogate witnesses,whether called by itself or by a party.the court may question witnesses and elicit facts not yet adduced or clarify those previously presented.united states williams,cir quoting moore united states,cir.a judge questions must be for the purpose of aiding the jury in understanding the testimony.united states saenz,citing united states bermea,cir.however,the trial court efforts to move the trial along may not come at the cost of strict impartiality.id.citing united states davis,cir.
