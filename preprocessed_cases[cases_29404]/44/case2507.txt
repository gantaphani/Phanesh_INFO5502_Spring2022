background 
members of the kalamazoo county sheriff department arrested blackmore at approximately on may,for driving on a suspended license.the officers then transported blackmore to the kalamazoo county jail,booked him and placed him in a cell at approximately within an hour of his arrival,blackmore began experiencing abdominal pain and complained to a deputy jailor,requesting medical care.blackmore continued to complain about this pain.an entry in the sergeant jail log reflects that at on sunday,may,blackmore was complaining of abdominal pain.about that time,jail officials gave blackmore antacids,but did not otherwise secure medical care.
at some unidentified time on monday,may,blackmore filed a request for medical care in which he complained of sharp and extreme a b dominal pain in the lower area lasting hours for which he needed medical attention right away.a later entry in the sergeant jail log reflects that at,blackmore stated that he is having sharp abdominal pains blackmore had vomited and the antacids that were given to him earlier did not help and that blackmore stated that the pains have been constant since saturday afternoon.at this time,jail officials placed blackmore into an observation cell,but did not provide any medical treatment.id.
