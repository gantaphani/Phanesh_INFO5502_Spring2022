background 
as this case comes to us following a bench trial,we recount the relevant facts as found by the district court,consistent with record support.able sales compañía de azúcar de,cir bolduc united states,cir see also immigration naturalization,d,ii district court factual findings.
gonzález represented clients in cases before the immigration authorities in san juan,puerto rico.she befriended an immigration officer named andrés núñez,but the two later fell out when she rejected his romantic overtures thereafter,she began to be treated less favorably at the san juan ins office.for example,she was made to wait many hours to file documents,was reprimanded for using a routing slip normally prepared by ins officials,was not sent timely notifications of her appointments with immigration officers,causing her to miss meetings,and was punished with suspension for failing to follow proper procedures in stamping documents.she filed several complaints with ins oversight officers complaining of this treatment,but no action was taken.
in the meantime,special agent luis reyes was investigating sham marriages involving dominican aliens.reyes supervisor,roberto ramos,was a friend of núñez and often ate lunch with him.reyes investigation led him to suspect that gonzález was aiding and abetting citizens and undocumented dominican aliens to enter into sham marriages so that the latter could avoid deportation or obtain other marriage benefits,and that she had prepared coaching questions to help them lie to the ins.reyes presented his findings to the attorney office,which obtained and executed search warrants on gonzález home and office and seized a number of documents.among the seized documents was what the parties call the coaching questionnaire,in which gonzález advised clients as follows 
be careful with medical plans and credit cards,or purchasing cards for any store such as sears,sam s,penney,pitusa.if your spouse is not on that card as a beneficiary or user,do not take it to immigration on the day of the interview,do not say you have it,it is better to say that you do not have a medical plan,nor any credit card at all,there is no way the immigration service could know this.
a grand jury indicted gonzález and two others for conspiracy to defraud the ins and other crimes,but the district court entered judgment of acquittal for gonzález at the close of evidence.
gonzález then sued the defendants under the ftca,b,and bivens six unknown named agents of the federal bureau of narcotics,d,alleging malicious prosecution and abuse of process specifically,she averred that núñez and his colleagues improperly used their official positions to destroy her law practice,to obtain the search warrants,to procure her arrest,and to secure her indictment.
the district court dismissed the bivens claims for lack of jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b because they were untimely it dismissed the malicious prosecution and abuse of process claims under federal rule of civil procedure b because they failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted.on appeal,we affirmed the dismissal of the bivens claims,gonzález rucci immigration naturalization,cir i,but reversed the dismissal of the malicious prosecution and abuse of process claims,holding that they were viable.id.at.

standard of review 
federal rule of civil procedure governs our review of a trial court findings of fact following a bench trial findings of fact,whether based on oral or other evidence,must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous,and the reviewing court must give due regard to the trial court opportunity to judge the witnesses credibility.a.we will deem a finding clearly erroneous only if,viewing the record in its entirety,we are left with a strong,unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.united states jones,cir quoting ex rel.five town cmty.sch,cir accord carr pms fishing,cir describing this standard of review as forbidding because it requires that the reviewing court have an abiding conviction that the factfinder stumbled badly.we accord plenary review to the district court conclusions of law following a bench trial.see anderson ex rel.dowd city of boston,cir.
malicious prosecution claim 
in an ftca case such as this one,we glean the applicable substantive law from the state or commonwealth where the alleged tort,puerto rico.mitchell united states,cir.a malicious prosecution claim under puerto rico law has four elements the defendant instituted a criminal action against the plaintiff the action was terminated in favor of the plaintiff the defendant acted with malice and without probable cause and the plaintiff suffered damages.i,at citing united states,d.
the defendants do not dispute that gonzález established the first two elements of her malicious prosecution claim,nor do they seem seriously to dispute the fourth.they do,however,challenge the existence of the third element whether some or all of them acted with malice and pursued gonzález indictment without probable cause.gonzález argues that the evidence presented at trial established this element.she testified about how she was singled out for harassment at the san juan ins office following her rejection of núñez.she also testified that none of the dominican aliens the attorney office alleged to be her clients were,in fact,her clients.according to gonzález,reyes thus had no basis to conclude that she took part in a scheme to coach these persons to enter into sham marriages,and he had no basis subsequently to seek her indictment.gonzález argued before the district court,and reiterates to us,that the extreme animosity demonstrated toward her at the san juan ins office,combined with reyes lack of any genuine justification for seeking her indictment and his supervisor ramos frequent lunches with núñez,permits the reasonable inference that reyes and the prosecutors who acted on his findings were motivated by malice in pursuing her prosecution.
the district court was unpersuaded by this theory and found,on its assessment of the testimony of gonzález and reyes and other evidence,that gonzález had not satisfied the third element of her malicious prosecution claim.specifically,the court found that she had failed to prove any link between reyes investigation and actions by núñez or other relevant ins officers who may have had a vendetta against her,and that ramos and núñez lunches together did not establish such a link.on the other hand,the court credited reyes testimony that,before seeking gonzález indictment,he interviewed several persons suspected of entering into sham marriages,and that these persons implicated gonzález in coaching th
