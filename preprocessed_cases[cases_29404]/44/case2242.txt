standard of review 
summary judgment is appropriate when the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.anderson liberty lobby,d.
procedural due process 
plaintiffs allege that washington made death threats in the presence of the officers and that the officers were therefore required to detain her for at least hours for domestic violence,pursuant to mcl a,rather than arresting her for trespassing and releasing her on an interim bond.the officers failure to detain washington for those hours allegedly deprived plaintiffs of their fourteenth amendment rights to procedural due process.the district court disagreed and entered summary judgment on the procedural due process claim.
the supreme court has held that a state statute written in purportedly mandatory terms providing that a peace office shall arrest a person whom he has probable cause to believe has violated a domestic restraining order does not give rise to a protected property interest under the due process clause.town of castle rock,gonzales,d.the supreme court found that police have the discretion to determine probable cause to believe a restraining order has been circumstances of the violation or the competing duties of that officer or his agency counsel decisively against enforcement in a particular instance.id.at.castle rock held that,even if a statute confers an individual entitlement to enforcement,this is not the sort of entitlement out of which a property interest is created.id.at.
the district court found that mcl a provides that a police officer may arrest an individual charged with domestic violence,not that he must the law gives officers discretion in determining whether an action constitutes a domestic violence incident.while plaintiffs are correct that officers do not have the discretion to release an individual pursuant to mcl a should she be arrested for domestic violence,the supreme court has held that police officers have discretion to determine whether to arrest someone for domestic violence in the first place,even if the relevant statute seems to make such an arrest mandatory.thus,even assuming that the officers heard washington make a threat,they had discretion not to arrest her on charges of domestic violence.
thus,the district court did not err in granting defendants motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs procedural due process claim.
substantive due process 
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in finding that they had failed to establish a substantive due process claim based on a danger when defendants released washington.essentially,plaintiffs argue that the officers created a danger to them when the officers chose to ticket washington for trespassing and to release her,rather than to detain her for hours on charges of domestic violence.they also argue that the officers arrest of washington for trespassing created an illusion of safety because plaintiffs believed that washington would be held for hours pursuant to a domestic violence arrest.
