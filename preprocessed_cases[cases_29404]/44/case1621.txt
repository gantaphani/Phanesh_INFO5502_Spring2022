officers michael batton,kenneth keel,and christopher heisey of the maryland transportation authority mdta collectively,appellants appeal a district court order denying their motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity in an action alleging that they unconstitutionally employed deadly force against josh waterman.we reverse and remand.
in reviewing the denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity,we accept as true the facts that the district court concluded may be reasonably inferred from the record when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff see prince george county,cir.to the extent that the district court has not fully set forth the facts on which its decision is based,we assume the facts that may reasonably be inferred from the record when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.see winfield bass,cir en banc.employing these principles reveals the following facts.
on the afternoon of november,at approximately,waterman was driving in the baltimore washington international airport terminal area.mdta officer eric farrow observed waterman traveling miles per hour in a zone,and farrow activated the emergency sirens and lights on his patrol vehicle and initiated pursuit.when waterman did not stop,mdta officer adam watkowski,who was in another patrol vehicle,activated his sirens and lights and joined in the pursuit.
as they followed waterman,officers farrow and watkowski communicated by radio with the mdta officers located at the toll plaza of the fort mchenry tunnel the tunnel.at approximately,watkowski reported to communications at the tunnel that he was involved in a chase in progress heading northbound on toward the tunnel.communications relayed the message to all units and identified the vehicle as a gold mazda with north carolina license plate.appellants heard that message.other officers stationed near the toll plaza radioed that they were standing by.one officer received permission to prepare stop sticks in the northbound lanes on the north side of the toll plaza,and someone radioed that the sticks were being prepared.
at approximately,officer watkowski radioed to communications that waterman just tried to run me off the road he trying to take us off the road.waterman batton,d,alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted appellants all heard that communication.additionally,at approximately,just after waterman and the trailing officers entered the tunnel,watkowski radioed to communications that waterman reached under the seat have all units use caution.id.internal quotation marks omitted.officer heisey heard the warning,but none of the appellants heard that waterman had reached under his seat.
when waterman emerged from the tunnel approximately two minutes later,he drove toward lane of the toll plaza,the northbound lane by this time,the pursuit had continued for more than minutes.as waterman drove toward the plaza at a normal speed,keeping a safe distance from vehicles in front of him,five uniformed mdta and officers sean hames and lance from around the concrete island located between lanes and.with their weapons drawn,the officers approached waterman vehicle from the front and passenger sides,yelling for waterman to stop.
waterman slowed as he approached the toll plaza,then coasted for about one second at approximately miles per hour.the vehicle ahead of waterman then began to move forward.immediately thereafter,the rear of waterman vehicle dipped down and rose back motion the officers described as lurching or lunging waterman began to accelerate in the general direction of the toll plaza and the officers ahead of him.at the instant of acceleration,officer keel was about feet ahead of the vehicle officer heisey,feet ahead officer hames,a little more than feet ahead and officer batton,a little more than feet ahead although none of the officers were directly in front of waterman vehicle,they stood only a few feet to the passenger side of the vehicle projected path 
perceiving the lurching of the vehicle and waterman acceleration as the beginning of an attempt to run them over,appellants began firing their weapons as soon as waterman accelerated.as the officers shot at him,waterman vehicle reached a top speed of approximately miles per hour.waterman vehicle then passed all of the officers,avoiding them by several feet and temporarily stopping behind another vehicle blocking its path.as appellants scrambled toward waterman,they continued to fire their weapons at him from the passenger side of the vehicle and from behind,ceasing their fire as he passed through the toll plaza.in all,within the period after waterman vehicle lurched forward,officer batton fired four rounds,officer keel,two,and officer heisey,two.
when waterman vehicle passed through the toll lane,it ran over the stop sticks.officer watkowski followed waterman through the lane in his vehicle and collided with him,bringing both vehicles to a stop.
waterman sustained five gunshot wounds a shot that grazed his front right shoulder a shot that entered the front right side of his neck and was recovered from his left shoulder and shots that went through his right arm,right thigh,and left thigh.about two minutes after his vehicle came to a stop,several officers pulled waterman from his vehicle and attempted to administer cpr.an ambulance then transported waterman to john hopkins medical center,where he was pronounced dead at.it was later determined that the shot that entered waterman neck was rapidly fatal,meaning that it killed him within seconds to two minutes.
waterman personal representative and parents the estate initiated this action in the circuit court for baltimore city,alleging several causes of action under maryland law in addition to a fourth amendment claim,see west.as is relevant here,the estate alleged that the officers violated waterman fourth amendment rights by unjustifiably employing deadly force.appellants removed the case to federal court and,following discovery,moved for summary judgment on several grounds,including that they were entitled to qualified immunity on the fourth amendment claim.the district court denied appellants motion in its entirety.see waterman,d at.
appellants appeal the portion of the district court order denying their motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity.we conclude that the district court erred in denying appellants summary judgment on the qualified immunity issue.
qualified immunity protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.malley briggs,d.it protects law enforcement officers from bad guesses in gray areas and ensures that they are liable only for transgressing bright lines.maciariello sumner,cir.thus,government officials performing discretionary functions are entitled to qualified immunity from liability for civil damages to the extent that their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.in analyzing an appeal from the rejection of a qualified immunity defense,our first task is to identify the specific right that the plaintiff asserts was infringed by the challenged conduct.see taylor waters,cir.we then ask whether the facts,viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,demonstrate a violation of that right.see saucier katz,d.if they do,we consider whether,at the time of the claimed violation,the right alleged to be violated was clearly that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates the right in question.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
although the exact conduct at issue need not have been held unlawful in order for the law governing an officer actions to be clearly established,the existing authority must be such that the unlawfulness of the conduct is manifest.see anderson creighton,d pritchett alford,cir explaining that t he fact that an exact right allegedly violated has not earlier been specifically recognized by any court does not prevent a determination that it was nevertheless clearly established for qualified immunity purposes and that c learly established in this context includes not only already specifically adjudicated rights,but those manifestly included within more general applications of the core constitutional principle invoked.a determination that a right is clearly established may be based on controlling authority in the jurisdiction in question or on a consensus of cases of persuasive authority such that a reasonable officer could not have believed that his actions were lawful.wilson layne,d.
the right the estate alleges was violated here is waterman fourth amendment right to be free of unreasonable seizures,a right which includes seizures accomplished by excessive force.see jones buchanan,cir.the test for whether force employed to effect a seizure is excessive is one of objective reasonableness under the circumstances.graham connor,d.in determining whether force was excessive,a court must weigh the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual fourth amendment interests against the countervailing governmental interests at stake.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.because police officers are often forced to make circumstances that are tense,uncertain,and rapidly evolving,id.at,the facts must be evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene,and the use of hindsight must be avoided,see id.at.additionally,the reasonableness of the officer actions in creating the dangerous situation is not relevant to the fourth amendment analysis rather,reasonableness is determined based on the information possessed by the officer at the moment that force is employed.see elliott leavitt,cir greenidge ruffin,cir 
here,appellants seized waterman by shooting him.it is important to recognize that t he intrusiveness of a seizure by means of deadly force is unmatched.tennessee garner,d.nevertheless,a police officer may employ deadly force when the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm,either to the officer or to others.id.at.
we now turn to the question of whether the record,viewed in the light most favorable to the estate,shows that appellants shooting of waterman constituted an unreasonable seizure under the fourth amendment.because appellants argue only that the use of deadly force was justified by the threat waterman posed to them and their fellow opposed to the general confine our analysis to that issue.thus,the question before us is whether a reasonable jury could conclude,based on the evidence forecast in the record,that a perception by the officers that waterman posed a threat of serious physical harm to them would have been unreasonable.we conclude that no reasonable jury could reach that conclusion with regard to appellants initial shots but that it could conclude that the shots fired after waterman passed the officers were unconstitutional.we address the constitutionality of these two groups of shots seriatim.
when waterman vehicle lurched forward,the officers were forced to immediately decide whether waterman was attempting to assault the officers ahead of him or whether he intended only to drive by them,leaving them unharmed.to the extent that reasonable officers under these facts could have taken time to ponder whether the lurching of the vehicle and waterman acceleration were the beginning of an aggressive move toward them,they would have considered several factors suggesting that it was.those would have included that waterman,by any account,was not acting rationally in leading the officers on a chase that he was not stopping despite seeing the officers approaching ahead of him with their weapons drawn that he was accelerating in the general direction of the officers and,most importantly,that officer watkowski had reported just minutes before that waterman had attempted to run him off the road.see pace capobianco,cir by the time of the shooting,davis had used the automobile in a manner to give reasonable policemen probable cause to believe that it had become a deadly weapon with which davis was armed.on the other hand,reasonable officers also would have considered the following factors as weighing against a conclusion that waterman was trying to run over them that waterman had not driven recklessly in the seconds between the time he emerged from the tunnel and the moment he accelerated in their general direction that there was no visible damage to waterman vehicle or the vehicles of the officers pursuing him that other than his flight,no information indicated that waterman had committed any serious crime prior to reportedly assaulting officer watkowski with his vehicle and that waterman had not yet increased his speed past miles per hour or turned his vehicle so that the officers were directly in his path.
of course,the critical reality here is that the officers did not have even a moment to pause and ponder these many conflicting factors.see graham,at.the calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make circumstances that are tense,uncertain,and rapidly the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.at the instant that waterman vehicle lurched forward,the vehicle could have reached officers batton and heisey in about one second even without accelerating further,and in even less time if it had continued to accelerate.thus,if the officers paused for even an instant,they risked losing their last chance to defend themselves.
taking into consideration all of these factors,particularly the nature of the decision,we conclude as a matter of law that appellants had probable cause to believe that waterman oncoming vehicle posed an immediate threat of serious physical harm at least to officers batton and heisey while reasonable officers would have recognized the possibility that waterman intended only to accelerate by them rather than at them,they the instant they had to have interpreted the acceleration in the face of their show of force as the initiation of a second attempt by waterman to avoid capture by using his vehicle as a weapon against law enforcement personnel.see garner,at.holding that an officer may use deadly force when a fleeing suspect threatens the officer with a weapon.thus,although appellants could have held their fire and taken the chance that waterman acceleration in traffic was not for the purpose of committing another assault against an officer,t he constitution simply does not require police to gamble with their lives in the face of a serious threat of harm.elliott,at.
in denying appellants motion for summary judgment,the district court relied heavily on the fact that none of the officers were directly in the path of waterman vehicle at the moment it lurched forward and the officers opened fire.in so doing,the court cited several cases for the proposition that when an officer attempts to justify his use of deadly force against the driver of an oncoming vehicle by claiming that he was trying to prevent the vehicle from running someone over,the position of the person relative to the path of the vehicle is important.see hernandez jarman,cir abraham raso,cir acosta city county of san francisco,cir fraire city of arlington,cir.we most certainly agree with this general proposition.and here,the closeness of the officers to the projected path of waterman vehicle is crucial to our conclusion that deadly force was justified.any reasonable factfinder considering all of the forecasted evidence in the record would determine that waterman was accelerating in appellants general direction and that officers batton and heisey could have been run over in about one second if waterman had turned slightly toward them.
scott edinburg,cir,is instructive on this point.there,a man attempted to steal the vehicle of an police officer from a gas station parking lot.see scott,at.as the officer yelled from behind the automobile for the man to stop,the man backed up quickly,either attempting to run the officer down or acting recklessly with respect to that possibility.see id.at.when the thief stopped backing up and began to speed off through the parking lot,the officer began firing and continued to do so when the vehicle exited the parking lot.see id.at.one of the officer shots killed the thief.see id.at.on appeal from the grant of summary judgment to the officer in the subsequent suit,the seventh circuit held that the use of deadly force was justified to protect bystanders from the oncoming stolen vehicle.see id.at.the court specifically rejected the contention that the fact that no bystanders were in the direct path of the vehicle precluded the use of deadly force when several people were in the immediate vicinity of the path.see id.at.of course,scott differs from the case at bar in that in scott much of the concern was probably that the thief would accidentally hit someone,while the concern here is that waterman would again intentionally use his vehicle as a weapon.but just as the officer in scott had reason to believe that the thief recklessness might cause him to turn out of his projected path,here appellants had reason to believe that waterman aggressiveness toward officers trying to capture him suggested he was about to turn toward officers not yet in his direct path.
in sum,the officers here were faced with a suspect well positioned to seriously injure or kill one or more of them with his within a fraction of a they did not employ deadly force.according to the best information available,the suspect had used his vehicle as a weapon against another officer just minutes before.based on this information and the other factors discussed,we hold as a matter of law that a reasonable officer could have believed at the instant of acceleration that waterman presented a threat of serious physical harm.appellants thus were entitled to qualified immunity regarding the initial group of shots.
the estate maintains that even if the initial shots were justifiable,the same was not true of the shots fired after waterman vehicle passed the officers and the officers were out of danger the subsequent shots.appellants rely on rowland perry,cir,in support of their argument that the subsequent shots,which occurred mere seconds after the initial shots,should not be analyzed separately.we conclude,however,that separate analysis is appropriate.
in rowland,a law enforcement officer,officer perry,saw a woman drop a five dollar bill,which rowland retrieved without attempting to return it.see rowland,at.perry approached rowland and,at perry request,rowland offered the money to the woman,who refused it,claiming that it was not hers.see id.perry could not hear the words between the two,but believed that rowland simply waved the money in the face of the openly distressed and tearful woman.id.perry pursued rowland and eventually grabbed his collar and jerked him around.see id.at.frightened,rowland instinctively tried to escape perry grasp.perry then punched rowland,threw him to the ground,and thr ew his weight against rowland right leg and wrench ed his knee until it cracked.id.at.
in concluding that perry was not entitled to qualified immunity in rowland subsequent lawsuit,this court stated the following 
in his appraisal of the objective reasonableness of the force used against rowland,perry urges what amounts to a segmented view of the sequence of events.he emphasizes the resistance offered by rowland during the struggle with perry,separating this fact from the rest of the story.this resistance alone,he argues,is enough to make perry reasonably believe that force was necessary.furthermore,the defendant divides the use of force into two parts.first,perry initially grabbed rowland collar in response to his attempts to flee.second,perry escalated the use of force in response to rowland resistance,culminating in the maneuver that finally subdued the suspect.viewed in this way,each distinct act of force becomes reasonable given what perry knew at each point in this progression.
this approach seems to us to miss the forest for the trees.the better way to assess the objective reasonableness of force is to view it in full context,with an eye toward the proportionality of the force in light of all the circumstances.artificial divisions in the sequence of events do not aid a court evaluation of objective reasonableness.this view is supported by the decision in tennessee garner,which held that the question is whether the totality of the circumstances justified a particular sort of seizure.
id.at alteration in original citation internal quotation marks omitted.in the end,we denied perry qualified immunity because it was impossible to escape the conclusion that a man suffered a serious leg injury over a lost five dollar bill.id.at.
appellants maintain that reviewing the constitutionality of the subsequent shots separately from that of the initial shots would constitute just the sort of a rtificial divisions in the sequence of events that we refused to undertake in rowland.appellants argument is not without support.in characterizing perry approach as miss ing the forest for the trees,rowland is unclear regarding whether it rejects a the notion that the reasonableness of force employed can turn on a change of circumstances during an encounter lasting only a few seconds,or b the idea that any of the events should be reviewed outside the context of the conduct that precipitated the,the simple failure to return a five dollar bill.
although both readings are plausible,we conclude that the latter reading is the better one.it is established in this circuit that the reasonableness of an officer actions is determined based on the information possessed by the officer at the moment that force is employed.see elliott,at.to simply view all of the force employed in light of only the information possessed by the officer when he began to employ force would limit,for no good reason,the relevant circumstances to be considered in judging the constitutionality of the officer actions.we therefore hold that force justified at the beginning of an encounter is not justified even seconds later if the justification for the initial force has been eliminated.see abraham raso,cir finding issue of fact regarding whether officer was justified in firing on vehicle from side after stepping out of the way to avoid being run over,and explaining that a passing risk to a police officer is not an ongoing license to kill an otherwise unthreatening suspect dickerson mcclellan,cir noting that analyzing separate segments of single encounter may be appropriate if the officers initial decision to shoot was reasonable under the circumstances but there was no need to continue shooting ellis wynalda,cir holding that when fleeing felon tossed a mesh bag weighing four or five pounds toward the officer,the officer would have been justified if he fired at that moment out of fear that the bag might knock his firearm out of his hand,but that he was not justified in firing after bag hit him and fell to the ground without injuring him and suspect turned and ran see also bates ex rel.johns chesterfield county,cir concluding with regard to escalating physical confrontation between officer and resisting suspect that officer use of force was reasonable a t every stage of the incident hopkins andaya,cir per curiam dividing encounter into two segments and holding that even if the first application of force was constitutional,the second may not have been.
applying this principle here,we conclude that the record,viewed in the light most favorable to the estate,shows that once waterman vehicle passed the officers,the threat to their safety was eliminated and thus could not justify the subsequent shots.a factfinder could reasonably conclude that as the officers pursued waterman vehicle,they knew or should have known that waterman had passed them without veering in their direction.under these circumstances,a reasonable factfinder could determine that any belief that the officers continued at that point to face an imminent threat of serious physical harm would be unreasonable.
having determined that the record,when viewed in the light most favorable to the estate,shows that the subsequent shots were unconstitutional,we now consider whether that unconstitutionality was clearly established on november,when the shooting occurred.we conclude that it was not and thus that appellants were entitled to quali
