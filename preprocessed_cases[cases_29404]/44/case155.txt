as plaintiffs in a prior suit,several of the here the defendants obtained a state court judgment for million against the here,boston property exchange transfer company bpe,formerly benistar property exchange trust company.in order to satisfy that judgment,the successful,present defendants obtained an order from the state court assigning to them bpe related arbitration claims against painewebber.in this federal action,bpe claims damages from the defendant assignees and their lawyers for mishandling the painewebber arbitration.the district court dismissed all of bpe claims,either on a motion to dismiss or on summary judgment.we affirm.
this is the latest of over a decade of state and federal cases arising out of the financial misconduct of bpe and its owner daniel carpenter in what the parties refer to as the cahaly litigation,the following evidence led to findings that bpe,carpenter,and other defendants were liable for various forms of financial misconduct.see generally cahaly benistar prop.exch.trust,cahaly benistar prop.exch.trust,cert.denied.bpe was a financial intermediary for property exchanges under section of the federal tax code,which allows a property owner to avoid recognizing capital gains from a sale by using the proceeds to purchase a similar or property within days.the seller must lodge the proceeds from the sale with a qualified intermediary or one of several other regulatory safe harbors until the funds are used to buy the replacement property.see k g.
the cahaly plaintiffs,who are among the defendants in this case,were six individuals or companies that used bpe when engaging in exchanges bpe held their funds under agreements providing that the monies would be available on demand,prior to which they would be held in escrow accounts,either a money market account earning three percent interest or an investment account earning six percent.
in,carpenter opened trading accounts for such funds at merrill lynch,superseded in by new accounts at painewebber.contrary to the escrow agreements,carpenter engaged in aggressive and trading of options on technology stocks,rendered the more risky by margin funding with money borrowed from the brokerage houses.although the trading was successful for a time,carpenter began to lose money quickly when technology stocks fell sharply in,the consequences being that bpe was unable to return the exchangors funds as required,and ultimately lost about million of their money.
bpe was found liable for inter alia conversion,breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,intentional misrepresentation,and violation of the massachusetts consumer protection statute.laws ch.these judgments were upheld on appeal by the massachusetts appeals court and the supreme judicial court of massachusetts,cahaly,at cahaly,d at,and the cahaly plaintiffs obtained a final judgment against bpe of some million,including punitive damages,interest,attorneys fees,and costs.
at the time of that judgment,bpe was about to begin arbitration of claims against painewebber,which it charged with responsibility for its debacle,as described further below.the cahaly plaintiffs filed a motion with the superior court to compel assignment of bpe legal claims to them to help satisfy their judgment against bpe,a move bpe strenuously opposed.then superior court judge botsford who presided over the cahaly trials granted the motion in the following assignment order 
after hearing,and pursuant to,and,it is ordered that benistar property exchange trust company,legal claims against ubs painewebber,painewebber be assigned for prosecution to the plaintiffs in this action.any action that the plaintiffs,as assignees,may take with respect to the pending nasd proceedings is a matter for the arbitrators to decide,not this court.any damages that may be awarded to benistar property against painewebber are to be held in escrow by the plaintiffs through their counsel pending further order of this court.
thereupon,the cahaly plaintiffs and their lawyers who are also defendants here took control of the arbitration against painewebber.they promptly replaced bpe statement of claim with an amended claim based on a completely new theory of liability.bpe says here that in doing this,the defendants hijacked the arbitration claims in a way that violated their legal duties as assignees and attorneys.
each theory,of course,starts with painewebber relationship with bpe through the brokerage accounts already mentioned,which extended from october through january.as technology stocks declined in this period,bpe losses rose to million in november and million by december.painewebber eventually decided to cut its losses from the margin transactions by forcing bpe to close its accounts and liquidate its trading positions in december and early january.the crux of bpe original arbitration claim was that painewebber caused bpe own losses by forcing it to stop trading if painewebber had allowed bpe to continue trading,bpe would allegedly have benefitted from a market rally in late december and january that could have erased the losses.bpe argued that painewebber bore responsibility not just for losing the million,but for the cahaly plaintiffs entire judgment against bpe,which it then estimated at about million.bpe sought indemnification for the cahaly judgment,contribution for costs and attorneys fees related to the cahaly litigation,and compensation for other funds that it said painewebber withheld wrongfully from bpe.in total,bpe requested compensatory damages of million,along with punitive damages of million,which would treble the award sought to million.
from the start,bpe and the state court judge knew that the cahaly plaintiffs derided this position.one basis of their argument for assignment was that bpe proposed theory of recovery was meritless and that the arbitration panel would certainly never find painewebber liable for stopping carpenter from continuing to illegally trade the plaintiffs depository funds.once the assignment was ordered,the cahaly plaintiffs substituted an amended statement of claim based on the theory that painewebber never should have allowed carpenter and bpe to speculate in technology stock options with what it knew or should have known were escrowed property exchange funds.the cahaly plaintiffs also charged that painewebber committed professional malpractice in brokering unsuitable speculative trades for bpe,and they contended that the broker failure to discern the nature of bpe business and stop the trading earlier constituted negligence and breach of fiduciary duties,among other claims.the amended claim was stated at million in compensatory damages plus attorneys fees,costs,and an unspecified punitive amount.
the arbitration panel ruled for bpe on the basis of the amended theory,with an award of million in compensatory damages along with interest and attorneys fees,for a total of million,but with no punitive damages.the panel gave no explanation for its decision.in accordance with the assignment order,the award went to the cahaly plaintiffs toward satisfaction of their judgment against bpe,but because the amount was less than the judgment,bpe received nothing.
on december,bpe filed this complaint against the cahaly plaintiffs and their lawyers the iantosca defendants and the attorney defendants,in federal district court,citing diversity jurisdiction.as amended,the complaint claimed negligence,breach of the duty of care,and breach of fiduciary duty against the attorney defendants counts i iii negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,and breach of contract against the iantosca defendants counts iv vi and violation of.laws ch.and the connecticut unfair trade practices act cutpa against all defendants counts vii and viii.
under each theory,the dereliction alleged was the same that the defendants committed these violations by jettisoning bpe claim in the painewebber arbitration in favor of the new one.because the arbitration produced million,not the million sought under the discarded theory,bpe asked for the entire difference of million along with punitive damages of million.
in response to the defendants motions,the district court dismissed some claims but left others intact.see bos.prop.exch.transfer iantosca,d.it dismissed all claims against the attorney defendants,holding that the lawyers owed no duty to bpe in conducting the painewebber arbitration because of a potential conflict of interest between bpe and their clients,the iantosca defendants,id.at and thus bpe had failed to state a claim against the attorney defendants for violation of chapter or cutpa,id.at.the district court dismissed the cutpa claim against the iantosca defendants,but declined to dismiss the others.id.at.
following the dismissal order,the attorney defendants moved for entry of partial final judgment in their favor on all claims against them,as allowed under.b.the district court signed the bottom of the first page of their motion motion allowed,and the ensuing entry in the docket report read,judge nathaniel gorton endorsed order entered granting motion for entry of judgment under rule b entered.the district court did not produce a separate document signifying that a judgment had been entered,nor did the court make any findings to support granting the motion.
discovery continued for the remaining claims against the iantosca defendants,and both sides filed motions for summary judgment.bpe was denied,and the iantosca defendants was granted as to all remaining claims.see bos.prop.exch.transfer iantosca,d.the district court held that the superior court assignment order was not a contract,and that it imposed no duty to prosecute bpe arbitration claim on its original theory.id.at.bpe chapter claim was discarded for failure to show that the defendants exceeded the scope of the assignment order or acted in an unfair or deceptive manner.id.at.
preceding the merits issues,there is a question about our appellate jurisdiction over the attorney defendants.they argue that bpe appeal was untimely as to them because the district court endorsement of their rule b motion ripened into a final judgment for which the appeal period ran out before bpe filed its notice of appeal.this objection is not well taken.
under fed.a a,a notice of appeal generally must be filed within thirty days of the entry of the judgment or order appealed from.see also budinich becton dickinson co,time limit is mandatory and jurisdictional.typically,under,there is an appealable judgment only when the district court issues an order that disposes of all claims against all parties with some exceptions not pertinent here,leav ing nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.catlin united states.rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure provides for an exception,however,under which a district court can enter partial final judgment related to a subset of the claims or parties involved,but only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.
the attorney defendants say that the district court endorsed order signed on a page of their rule b motion is a final judgment as to the claims against them.and although a judgment customarily requires entry of a separate document in the civil docket.a,under.c b,judgment enters after days have passed since a judgment order was placed on the civil docket,even if no separate document was filed.the attorney defendants therefore argue that judgment in their favor entered days after the endorsed order,in november,making this appeal untimely as to them,having been filed more than a year later on december.
this argument misses the mark,because rule c details when a judgment has entered,if timing is the only question,but it does not address whether a judgment has entered,when the issue implicates more than timing.the jurisdictional question here is in the latter category,and to determine whether the endorsed order was a judgment,it is rule b that controls.by its terms the endorsed order was not a judgment thus,judgment in favor of the attorney defendants did not become final until the district court summary judgment order disposed of the remaining claims.
rule b reads this way 
judgment on multiple claims or involving multiple parties.when an action presents more than one claim for relief whether as a claim,counterclaim,crossclaim,or claim or when multiple parties are involved,the court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more,but fewer than all,claims or parties only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.otherwise,any order or other decision,however designated,that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties does not end the action as to any of the claims or parties and may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims and all the parties rights and liabilities.emphasis added 
as the supreme court has put it,a district court entering a rule b judgment must go through two steps it must determine that it is dealing with a final judgment that provides an ultimate disposition on a cognizable claim for relief,and it must determine whether there is any just reason for delay.curtiss wright,accord willhauck halpin,cir.this court has said that in most cases,some concise findings will likely be needed to explain why there is no just reason for delay,spiegel trs.of tufts,cir,and in simply signing his name to the attorney defendants motion,the district judge made no such findings.that would be the end of the matter,save for the fact that in at least two cases we have relaxed the usual requirement of rule b findings in order to hear an appeal immediately in the interests of justice.see quinn city of boston,cir feinstein resolution trust,cir.
the attorney defendants here ask for similar relaxation of the findings requirement,but careful attention to their circumstances fails to show why they should have it.rule b can prove pivotal to the question of appellate jurisdiction in two situations.in the first,the district court disposes of a subset of the claims,and the appellant attempts to appeal the order immediately.in that situation,a valid rule b determination of no just reason for delay would provide the appellate court with jurisdiction,and a tolerance for arguably inadequate findings would do the same.by contrast,as in this case,rule b can also be invoked to deprive an appellate court of jurisdiction,when a district court disposes of the subset and the losing party waits until the conclusion of litigation to appeal.the appellee then argues that the appeal is untimely as to the claims that were disposed of earlier because the appellant did not appeal within days of the purported rule b order.
our prior cases treating the requirement for a rule b finding as malleable have rested on conclusions that either the public or predominant equitable interest weighed in favor of adjudicating those appeals.see quinn,at the most important factor counseling in favor of allowing an immediate appeal in this case is the public interest in short,the nature of the issue calls out for immediate resolution.feinstein,at a weighing of the factors relevant to the use of rule b tilts sharply in favor of allowing the appeals to go forward.citation omitted while we do not hold that the rigor of rule b is diminished only when the result would be to entertain an immediate appeal,here we know of no public interest or other equitable argument for relaxation of the usual requirement of findings.for want of them,therefore,the endorsed order did not qualify as a final judgment under rule b,the time did not run from the endorsement,and the appeal is timely now as to all defendants.
there is one more issue enough in need of attention at the threshold that we raise it ourselves,though we do not resolve it.we are puzzled that this lawsuit ever ended up in federal court or remained in the federal forum as long as it has.bpe claims injury mainly under massachusetts law.its claim has no merit if the defendants action was authorized by the terms of the state court assignment and that assignment was properly ordered under state law.the parties were in litigation before the massachusetts state courts,and bpe has provided no convincing explanation for its failure to seek resolution there of the scope and propriety of the a
