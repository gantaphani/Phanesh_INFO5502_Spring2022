in this action,michael tyrone walker,a state prisoner,alleges that his rights under the first,eighth and fourteenth amendments were violated when prison officials sought a state court order authorizing them to him after he went nine days without eating.the district court granted summary judgment to all of the defendants except arthur auxer,a prison official and mark lasky,the medical director of the prison.shortly before their trial began,walker withdrew his claims against auxer,leaving lasky as the sole remaining defendant.the jury ultimately returned a verdict in favor of lasky,and walker appealed.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm.
background 
in august,walker was incarcerated in the special management unit smu at the state correctional institution at camp hill,pennsylvania hill.the smu was reserved for the most difficult prisoners in the state system and walker placement there meant that he was confined in his cell hours a day.
walker is a member of the nation of islam,a islamic sect that follows the teachings of elijah muhammad.members of the nation of islam fast during ramadan and at other times during the year in accordance with the teachings of elijah muhammad.walker claims that since his incarceration in he has engaged in periodic religious fasts in which he abstains from solid foods but drinks liquids 
walker prison adjustment record reflects that on august,he became angry,allegedly because he was not receiving legal material he made threats,became argumentative,and was placed on further restriction even though he was already in the smu.a few days later,while still confined in the smu,walker claims to have begun a religious fast which he planned to continue for three to fifteen days.like his earlier fasts,he purportedly abstained from solid food,but drank liquids.
beginning on august,walker was seen at least daily by prison medical staff.william young,a physician on the medical staff at hill under lasky supervision,examined walker on that date.walker claims that young checked his weight and blood pressure,listened to his breathing,and examined his eyes walker also claims that young noted that walker was fasting for religious purposes.walker claims that young recorded his condition as normal on august,and.walker weight was recorded as pounds on august,pounds on august,pounds on august,and pounds on august.according to young testimony,weight loss becomes a concern when a person who is fasting loses ten percent of their weight.young directed that blood and urine be obtained from walker on august and according to walker,young never urged him to stop fasting or exercising.
on august,the medical staff read walker a form captioned,the effects of starvation and dehydration,and walker acknowledged the form by signing it.in doing so,he attested to his understanding that the department of corrections will do everything within its power to prevent the death of any person committed to its custody,and this means that permission may be sought from a judge to force an inmate to eat or drink.
on august,after what the prison officials claim was nine days of documented refusal to eat,the department of corrections doc filed an ex parte application for a preliminary injunction in state court pursuant to.the complaint alleged that walker was on a hunger strike.an affidavit of lasky dated august,was attached to the complaint.in that affidavit,lasky stated that,based upon his observations earlier that day,walker appeared somewhat lethargic,slow walking and spoke with a slight slur.lasky affidavit further stated that those symptoms could be the effects of starvation and dehydration and that unless walker received nutrition and hydration as soon as possible,he could suffer tissue breakdown which may result in coma,cardiac arrest and possibly death.the affidavit also stated that feeding was required to prevent irreparable harm.lasky had not examined walker before executing that affidavit,but he had spoken to walker through his cell door.however,walker claims that lasky had not spoken with him and that the doctor actually confused him with another inmate.
in addition to lasky affidavit,the complaint alleged that walker conduct threaten ed the good order of the hill in that other inmates may engage in hunger strikes as a result of walker conduct or may believe that the department is not concerned with their well being.other prisoners were allegedly already engaged in hunger strikes 
the doc also asked the state court for authorization to provide treatment including,but not limited to,nutrition,hydration,and medication,as medically necessary to preserve walker health and life pending the adjudication of the matter.the doc also sought permission to involuntarily obtain specimens of bodily fluids for analysis.
on august,the court of common pleas of cumberland county entered an order allowing the prison officials to,inter alia,involuntarily administer medical treatment including but not limited to nutrition,hydration and medication as may be medically necessary to preserve walker health and life pending the adjudication of this matter,as is determined by the medical personnel duly charged with his care.the court also scheduled a hearing for september,and appointed counsel to represent walker at that hearing.
thereafter,lasky informed walker that the medical department had obtained a court order authorizing.walker claims that he told lasky that he was fasting for religious reasons and that lasky ignored him.a short time later,correction officers took walker from his cell to the prison infirmary walker claims that he was there stripped,strapped to a hospital bed,and placed in ankle and wrist restraints.his head was also restrained,and a chest strap was used to prevent him from moving a corrections officer then read walker the court order,and gave him a copy of it.
walker claims that he told officials standing near his bed that he was willing to stop his hunger strike to avoid being as he was being strapped to the bed however,lasky testified that walker never stated he was willing to eat before he was.rather,the prison officials testified that lasky gave walker the option of eating,and walker refused.walker claims that auxer told him that his concession to eat came too late.in any event,after walker was strapped to the bed,nurses placed a nasogastric tube through his nose,down his throat and into his stomach,and walker was then through the tube.the procedure was videotaped.
walker claims that he was fed liquified liver and mashed potatoes with milk even though he told medical personnel that the did not eat meat or milk products because both foods upset his stomach lasky allegedly let walker be the foods that were being served to the general prison population for the noon meal.lasky denies that walker told anyone he was a vegetarian or that walker medical records stated that walker was a vegetarian.however,lasky confirms that walker was mashed potatoes and milk.
sometime after the of the noon meal,walker claims to have told medical personnel,including lasky,that he was willing to stop his fast and that he reiterated that certain foods upset his stomach.lasky purportedly responded by telling walker that the feeding tube would not be removed and that walker would be required to eat the evening meal with the feeding tube in place.when told that the evening meal would include spaghetti with meat,walker claims to have again told lasky that this meal would upset his stomach.
lasky denies any intention of making walker sick and testified that he believed the food did not pose a substantial risk of serious harm.walker claims that he only ate the meal under threat of because he was in great discomfort.
walker testified that the made him vomit during the night and that,since he was still restrained,he choked.walker claims that he asked lasky to remove the feeding tube the following morning,but lasky said that the tube would remain until after breakfast the following day.walker also testified that he was strapped to the bed by ankle and wrist restraints throughout this period and that he was released from the restraints only for short periods during the day.
the nasogastric feeding tube was finally removed on september,days after its insertion.lasky testified this was a reasonable period after walker began eating on his own to insure against having to reinsert the tube,to minimize medical risks of complication,and to assure that walker could be provided with nutrition if he again refused to eat.
three days later,walker and his lawyer were present at a hearing the court of common pleas held on the doc request for authorization to walker.during that hearing,walker counsel told the state court i would like to just add for the record,judge,the walker reason for the hunger strike was to draw attention to some civil matters being addressed by jim flower another lawyer representing walker in another civil matter and that his agreeing to an extension of the preliminary injunction in this case in no way impacts or constitutes any admission for the purposes of flower proceeding.
ii.district court proceedings 
on march,walker filed a pro se complaint against martin horn commissioner,pennsylvania department of corrections,jeffrey beard,deputy commissioner,kenneth kyler,superintendent hill,william ward,unit manager smu,hill,arthur auxer,manager smu hereinafter collectively prison officials,martin lasky,medical director,hill and william young,physician,medical department,hill.walker alleged violations of the first,eighth and fourteenth amendments arising from being 
the court appointed counsel for walker and walker thereafter filed an amended complaint.in time,the magistrate judge filed a report and recommendation r r,recommending granting summary judgment to horn,kyler,ward,and young on all of walker claims.the r r also recommended granting beard,auxer and lasky summary judgment on walker fourteenth amendment due process claim.however,the magistrate judge rejected the qualified immunity arguments of beard,auxer and lasky and also recommended against dismissing walker first and eighth amendment claims under the doctrine.
the district court adopted the magistrate judge r r with two exceptions.the district court granted summary judgment to beard on all of walker claims and found that the claims for injunctive relief were moot.the district court rejected claims of lack of jurisdiction and qualified immunity of auxer and lasky pertaining to walker first and eighth amendment claims.both lasky and auxer appealed but we dismissed the appeals for lack of appellate jurisdiction because genuine issues of material fact remained as to whether lasky and auxer were entitled to qualified immunity walker horn,cir.
thereafter,walker withdrew his claims against auxer and the case proceeded to a jury trial involving only lasky.the jury found that walker was not involved in a religious fast and that lasky had not violated walker constitutional rights.the district court thereafter entered judgment in favor of lasky.walker then filed this appeal in which he argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants on his procedural due process claim and that the district court erred in admitting evidence of his prior robbery convictions pursuant to.a in the trial of his constitutional claims against lasky 
iii.discussion 
a.our jurisdiction to address walker procedural due process claim.
walker submits that he has a liberty interest under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,and a liberty interest against being he also claims that the constitution requires procedural safeguards to ensure that a decision to someone is neither arbitrary nor erroneous,and that the prison officials and lasky ignored those procedural safeguards 
before we can address the merits of walker constitutional claims,we must first address the parties arguments about whether the doctrine deprives us of jurisdiction over those claims 
the doctrine arises from which states in relevant part that f inal judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had,may be reviewed by the supreme court valenti mitchell,cir.since congress has never conferred a similar power of review on the united states district courts,the supreme court has inferred that congress did not intend to empower district courts to review state court decisions.desi pizza,city of,cir citations omitted see also port auth.police benevolent,port auth.of and police,cir t he fundamental principle of the doctrine is that a federal district court may not sit as an appellate court to adjudicate appeals of state court proceedings.
to ensure that congress intent to prevent the lower federal courts from sitting in direct review of the decisions of a state tribunal is given effect,the doctrine prohibits district courts from adjudicating actions in which the relief requested requires determining whether the state court decision is wrong or voiding the state court ruling.desi pizza,at citations,internal quotations,bracket and ellipses omitted.although refers to orders and decrees of the highest state court,the doctrine has been applied to final decisions of lower state courts as well.port auth.police benevolent,at.
thus,a claim is barred by under two circumstances first,if the federal claim was actually litigated in state court prior to the filing of the federal action or,second,if the federal claim is inextricably intertwined with the state adjudication,meaning that federal relief can only be predicated upon a conviction that the state court was wrong.desi pizza,at citation omitted.in either case,bars a litigant federal claims and divests the district court of subject matter jurisdiction over those claims.id.at.
determining whether a plaintiff actually litigated a federal claim in the state court for purposes is not always as easy as may at first appear because has a close affinity to the principles embodied in the legal concepts of claim and issue preclusion.valenti,at.therefore,a plaintiff can not ordinarily litigate one constitutional claim in state court and then raise a related constitutional claim in the district court.id.in valenti,plaintiffs litigated an equal protection claim in state court and then sought to raise a first amendment claim in the district court.we held that deprived the district court of subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the first amendment claim.we explained 
plaintiffs each had an opportunity to raise a first amendment challenge in state court and failed to do so.they can not be allowed to escape by raising a new constitutional theory in federal court.under principles of claim preclusion,they had a full and fair opportunity to litigate their first amendment claim in the state court,and here they merely seek a second bite at the apple.
valenti,at.
a federal claim is inextricably intertwined with an issue adjudicated by a state court when the federal court must determine that the state court judgment was erroneously entered in order to grant the requested relief,or the federal court must take an action that would negate the state court judgment.desi pizza,at in the first circumstance bars the plaintiff federal claim because granting the plaintiff relief would require the federal court to conclude that the state court made an incorrect factual or legal determination.in cases falling into this category,federal relief can only be predicated upon a conviction that the state court was wrong.id.citation and internal quotations omitted.that inquiry requires that we identify the pillars on which the judgment rests.to do this,we consider the questions of state law that the state court was obligated to reach in order to render its decision.id.in the second situation discussed above,the plaintiff federal claim is precluded because the relief sought would undo or prevent the enforcement of the state court order.id.at.in other words,does not allow a plaintiff to seek relief that,if granted,would prevent a state court from enforcing its orders.id.
here,prison officials argue that walker procedural due process claim is,in essence,a request to a lower federal court to review a state court injunction authorizing the prison officials to walker.they claim that a finding in walker favor on his procedural due process claim would necessarily be a federal ruling that the state court order was wrong.they are thus claiming,in terminology,that walker due process claim is inextricably intertwined with the state court adjudication.therefore,say the prison officials,the procedural due process claim is barred by and the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over that claim.
in making this argument,they rely heavily on port authority police benevolent association,port authority of new york and new jersey police department,cir.there,the port authority obtained an injunction from a state court prohibiting a nonprofit organization employed by the police benevolent association from soliciting contributions from port authority tenants.in state court,the police benevolent authority unsuccessfully argued that solicitation was protected speech under the first amendment and that the port authority regulations prohibiting soliciting tenants violated its first amendment rights.
the police benevolent association then went to federal court and asserted the same constitutional claim they had asserted in the state court action.they asked the district court for an injunction preventing the port authority from enforcing its antisolicitation regulations.the association conceded that the federal injunction would effectively enjoin the enforcement of the state court injunction if granted,and the district court abstained under younger harris,d.on appeal,we held that the district court properly abstained under younger,but also noted that the district court could have dismissed the complaint pursuant to because assertion of jurisdiction over the compliant would have required the district court to decide issues that were inextricably intertwined with the state court decision.at.
the prison officials argue that port authority police benevolent association controls because prevents the district court from ruling on the propriety of the state court order allowing walker to be.walker counters by arguing that his procedural due process claim does not require the district court to review the propriety of the state court injunction or to find that the state court decision was wrong.admittedly,walker due process claim is not a frontal attack on the propriety of the state court order.however,it nevertheless questions the propriety of the state court order.walker constitutional claim is bottomed on his theory that the prison officials had inadequate procedural safeguards to insure that the state court ruling would be based upon accurate and complete information.walker correctly claims that the state court order was based exclusively on lasky affidavit.however,says walker,lasky never examined him and,in fact,confused him with another prisoner.moreover,says walker,the complaint seeking state injunctive relief did not include an affidavit from young,who had examined him several times,or a copy of relevant medical records.in walker view,had there been a department of corrections requirement that his medical records and an affidavit of his treating physician be attached to the complaint,the state court would have learned that walker was being examined by a physician on a daily basis,was not dehydrated,sustained no weight loss between august and august,and was otherwise in good health.however,says walker,because of the lack of procedural safeguards,the state court record lacked the information necessary to guarantee that the state court decision was not arbitrary or erroneous.he writes had minimal procedural safeguards been provided,the state court would have learned that the affidavit of lasky was incorrect and that was not warranted because walker treating physician had concluded that walker was in good health.walker br.at.
in our view,walker is simply saying that the state court decision was wrong and blaming the error on certain alleged procedural deficiencies.
for example,walker argues 
b ecause lasky never examined walker and,confused him with another inmate important statements in lasky affidavit were erroneous as a result,the state court was completely misled had walker been given notice and the opportunity to participate in the proceeding,the state court would have learned that statements in lasky affidavit were erroneous.moreover had doc regulations required defendants to attach to their application for ex parte relief a copy of walker medical records or an affidavit from the treating physician,it would have been immediately apparent to the state court that lasky affidavit was incorrect.
walker br.at 
walker is clearly claiming that had he been given adequate procedural due process,the state court would not have entered an erroneous order to him.thus,walker due process claim is inextricably intertwined with the state court adjudication.he can not prevail on his procedural claim unless we pull the thread that will unravel the constitutional fabric of the state court order.consequently,bars walker due process claim and the district court had no subject matter jurisdiction over it.accordingly,we need not address walker argument that the district court erred by granting summary judgment to the defendants on his procedural due process claim 
admission of robbery convictions.
as noted earlier,as a result of the district court summary judgment rulings and walker withdrawal of claims against auxer,walker only remaining claims were his claims that lasky violated his first and eighth amendment rights,and the jury returned a verdict in lasky favor on those claims 
during the trial,lasky counsel sought to introduce evidence of walker prior record to impeach his credibility.in the ten year period before the trial,walker had been convicted of two charges of simple assault,four firearms violations,one charge of terroristic threats and nine robberies.lasky counsel referred to these convictions in his opening statement.later,walker moved to exclude the convictions pursuant to.a in a ruling,the district court granted walker motion with respect to the convictions for assault,firearms violations and terroristic threats,finding that the probative value of the convictions was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.however,the district court held that,because the crime of robbery involves dishonesty within the meaning of.a,the court was without discretion to weigh the prejudicial effect of the proffered evidence against its value and,therefore,evidence of the robbery conviction is automatically admissible for impeachment purposes.app.at.
provides,in relevant part 
a general rule.for the purposes of attacking the credibility of a witness,
evidence that a witness other than an accused has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted,subject to rule,if the crime was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year under the law under which the witness was convicted,and 
evidence that any witness has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted if it involved dishonesty or false statement,regardless of the punishment.
a.therefore,if the prior conviction involved dishonesty or false statements,the conviction is automatically admissible insofar as the district court is without discretion to weigh the prejudicial effect of the proffered evidence against its probative value.walden,cir.because rule a does not permit the district court to engage in balancing,rule a must be construed narrowly to apply only to those crimes that bear on a witness propensity to testify truthfully.id.citation omitted.
walker contends that the district court erred by holding that robbery is a crime involving dishonesty,and that the district court therefore erred in allowing counsel to use his robbery convictions for impeachment purposes in support of that argument,he cites to the original conference committee report which spoke of the types of crimes contemplated by subsection a 
by the phrase dishonesty and false statement the conference means crimes such as perjury or subornation of perjury,false statement,criminal fraud,embezzlement,or false pretense,or any other offense in the nature of crimen falsi,the commission of which involves some element of deceit,untruthfulness,or falsification bearing on the accused propensity to testify truthfully.
conf,sess,reprinted in.he then refers to the advisory committee note following the amendment to rule a which reads 
the advisory committee concluded that the conference report provides sufficient guidance to trial courts and that no amendment to the dishonesty and false statement provision is necessary,notwithstanding some decisions that take an unduly broad view of dishonesty admitting convictions such as for bank robbery or bank larceny.
advisory committee note to amendment.in light of these statements,walker submits that crimes involving dishonesty are limited to the types of crimes explicitly detailed in the two statements above and this excludes robbery because it is not a crime involving dishonesty.
it is somewhat surprising that we have not yet decided whether robbery involves dishonesty within the meaning of rule a.however,in a case decided before the effective date of the federal rules of evidence,we did hold that petit larceny is not a crimen falsi crime.in government of the virgin islands toto,cir,we wrote 
the term crimen falsi has roots in the common law doctrine that persons convicted of certain kinds of crimes were disqualified from testifying.while the doctrine of testimonial disqualification has withered from our law,the term crimen falsi has retained vitality in the context of impeachment.the established law in this circuit is that a witness may be impeached by evidence of a prior conviction only if it is for a a felony or b a misdemeanor in the nature of crimen falsi.the specific contours of crimen falsi are uncertain.crimen falsi describes crimes involving,or at least relating to,communicative,often verbal,dishonesty we have said that they are crimes which touch on the honesty of the witness.for our purposes here,we have no difficulty in accepting the government formulation of the concept although the term crimen falsi has been subject to many definitions,the generally accepted scope of the term would be crimes that are in the nature of perjury,criminal fraud,embezzlement,false pretense or any other offense the commission of which involves some element of untruthfulness,or falsification bearing on the accused propensity to testify truthfully.absent special circumstances,as the district court so aptly put it petit larceny is just not that.
id.at citations omitted emphasis added.however we also noted that,in certain cases,petit larceny may be a crimen falsi crime.we explained it is conceivable that a conviction for petit larceny might subsume a crime in the nature of crimen falsi,petit stealing by false pretenses.id.in a case decided after the effective date of the federal rules of evidence,we held that a crime must involve expressive dishonesty to be admissible under rule a.in cree hatcher,cir,we stated the proper test for admissibility under rule a does not measure the severity or reprehensibility of the crime,but rather focuses on the witness propensity for falsehood,deceit or deception.applying that teaching here,we readily conclude that,although robbery is certainly a very serious crime,it does not involve communicative or expressive dishonesty.therefore,the district court erred by holding that robbery is a crime involving dishonesty that is automatically admissible under rule a 
of course,that does not end our inquiry.under.a,admitting walker robbery convictions for impeachment is not reversible error unless a substantial right of a party is affected.our standard of review of a district court nonconstitutional error allows us to find an error harmless only if it is highly probable that the error did not affect the outcome of the case.mcqueeney wilmington trust,cir.
not unexpectedly,walker argues that the admission of his robbery convictions was not harmless error because his credibility was central to his ability to prove his claim that lasky violated his first and eighth amendment rights.he reminds us that he was the only witness who testified that he is a practicing member of the nation of islam and that he was engaged in a religious fast when he was forcibly fed.he was also the only witness who testified that,contrary to lasky affidavit,he gave a blood and urine sample as ordered by young finally,his testimony also provided the only evidence that he had never been offered a liquid protein supplement by lasky therefore,according to walker,the evidence of his robbery convictions significantly undermined his credibility.he argues the only reasonable explanation for the jury finding that he failed to prove he was engaged in a religious fast was that he was not,in their minds,a credible witness.walker br.at.
walker stresses that his lack of credibility was the central theme of lasky counsel closing argument according to walker,lasky counsel argued that walker testimony about the religious basis of his fast was simply not credible.rather,argued lasky counsel,walker just did not want young,who examined him daily,to interfere with his hunger strike,and walker therefore used the magic words religious fast.walker also contends that lasky counsel argued that even though walker told young that he was on a religious fast and young noted this in the medical records on august,young had no independent verification that the fast was religious and that walker statement could not be taken at face value.
lastly,and finally,walker contends that lasky counsel told the jury that they needed to consider walker credibility while deliberating reminding them that walker had been convicted of crimes of dishonesty nine times,the robberies.in walker telling,because the robbery convictions were central to lasky efforts to discredit his testimony,the introduction of the convictions was not harmless.
lasky contends that,given the very limited use of the robbery convictions and the amount of other evidence bearing on walker credibility,it is highly improbable that the robbery convictions affected the outcome of walker case at all.moreover,says lasky,since walker testified on direct examination that he was residing at hill at the time of the incident eight years earlier,and was currently residing at,the jury had to have known that walker had a significant criminal record that included convictions for serious crimes.further,says lasky,during,walker mentioned a third prison,where he had been incarcerated.in lasky view,given the small amount of time spent on the actual impeachment and the fact that walker testified that he had been incarcerated in three different prisons over at least the previous eight years,any prejudice from the robbery convictions was inconsequential.
lasky next refers us to the significant amount of other evidence regarding walker credibility.according to lasky,even walker religious motive for fasting is something of a red herring.no mention was made of a religious fast during argument over the preliminary injunction in the state court.in fact,walker counsel in the state court said the fast was not religious at all,but was an attempt to focus attention on walker then pending litigation.lasky supports this with evidence that a friend and fellow litigant of walker,darrel alston,engaged in a hunger strike and was not a member of the nation of islam.
lasky cites evidence corroborating his contention that walker motives were not religious.as we noted earlier,just before walker stopped eating,he had an argument with the guards over access to his legal materials.he was written up for misconduct and put on further restriction.walker had five civil and two criminal cases pending at the time,and access to his legal materials was therefore important to him.prison policy allowed only one box of legal materials in his cell at any one time,and the rest had to be kept in storage lasky claims this policy was the reason for the argument and walker went on a hunger strike in protest,that he now seeks to redefine as a religious fast.
lasky notes the conflicting evidence about when walker would fast,the number of years he had engaged in fasts and the average duration of his fasts.the evidence of fasting was first once or twice a month,then every weekend,then for three days or as long as fifteen days.walker trial testimony w
