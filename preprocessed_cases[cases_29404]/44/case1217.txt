opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before the court on an appeal by mary geruschat,dolores speney,antoinette morocco,and donna buxton appellants from the district court memorandum order dated july,which adopted as its own and affirmed the bankruptcy court opinion and order dated september,in which the bankruptcy court asserted its jurisdiction to resolve a malpractice,negligence,and fraud suit that appellants,creditors in a consolidated chapter bankruptcy proceeding,brought in a state court against the accountants who performed work during the bankruptcy,ernst young llp and its employee,charles modispacher together ernst young,refused to remand appellants case to the state court from which ernst young removed it,and dismissed the complaint on its merits.this appeal,however,primarily is about jurisdiction,both our jurisdiction to review the bankruptcy and district courts decisions not to abstain from exercising jurisdiction and not to remand the matter to the state court,and,depending on the extent,if any,that we have jurisdiction to review those courts decisions,whether the district court properly found that the bankruptcy court had subject matter jurisdiction and the final adjudicative authority to resolve the actions.
as we will discuss in detail later,appellants initially filed their suit in a state court,but ernst young removed the case to a federal court,a bankruptcy court.appellants then sought an order remanding the case to the state court on the grounds that a there were procedural irregularities in the removal process,b the bankruptcy court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute,and c even if the bankruptcy court did have jurisdiction,it should have abstained permissively or was required to abstain mandatorily from exercising its jurisdiction.the bankruptcy court disagreed with appellants,exercised jurisdiction,and dismissed the case on its merits.on appellants appeal,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order and,though to a degree writing separately,adopted the bankruptcy court opinion and order as its own.
this appeal followed.but appellants challenge only the decisions regarding the procedural irregularities in the removal process,the bankruptcy court finding that it had jurisdiction and final adjudicative authority,and its decision not to abstain from exercising that jurisdiction.thus,we are not reviewing the disposition of the malpractice,negligence,and fraud dispute on the merits.inasmuch as we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review a substantial portion of the issues appellants raise on this appeal,and that the bankruptcy and district courts did not err in the rulings over which we have appellate jurisdiction,we will affirm the july,memorandum order of the district court and,accordingly,in effect,will affirm the bankruptcy court opinion and order dated september.
ii.facts and procedural history 
the case has grown out of the activities of earned capital corporation,managed properties,canterbury village,and eastern arabian,collectively debtors,corporations engaged in developing real property.to raise capital,the debtors sold investment shares in the property,and,in return,promised the investors an annual return.
the debtors plan involved the development of acres in the borough of seven fields,butler county,pennsylvania,with townhouses and recreational facilities.unfortunately for the debtors,however,their plan did not go as expected.thus,they became delinquent in making the payments they promised to the investors,leading the debtors to oversell shares to maintain the promised payments.the debtors could not continue this scheme indefinitely,and,consequently,on june,they filed separate voluntary petitions under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania.that court consolidated the chapter proceedings on june,in a case entitled in re earned capital corporation.
prior to the time that the debtors filed their bankruptcy petitions,they had employed the accounting firm of arthur young company a predecessor of ernst young to review their financial records and prepare the financial schedules needed for the bankruptcy.on june,the bankruptcy court approved the appointment of ernst young ernst young determined that the debtors were insolvent and that they owed the vast majority of their obligations totaling over to the approximately investors.an official committee of unsecured creditors committee,selected from among the investors,represented the investors in the bankruptcy case.the committee and the debtors filed competing plans of reorganization,both calling for consolidation of the debtors assets and liabilities into one surviving reorganized corporation.
the bankruptcy court found the debtors to be insolvent and confirmed an amended plan of reorganization amended plan on october.according to appellants,the court based this disposition on information that ernst young provided the court and the debtors creditors.under the amended plan,the debtors were merged into a successor entity,seven fields development corporation seven fields,and their assets,the principal one of which was the butler county real estate,became assets of seven fields.under the amended plan,all of the secured and trade creditors claims were to be paid in full or in accordance with agreements otherwise negotiated,but the investor class of unsecured creditors was to receive common stock in seven fields at a par value equal to of their allowed claims with the remaining classified as unsecured,nondischargeable debt.under the amended plan,a ll activities of seven fields shall seek to achieve the goal of full payment to the,app.at,and assets were to be managed,improved,developed and sold,where appropriate,to the end that all creditors will eventually achieve maximum returns,id.at.the investors voted overwhelmingly in favor of the plan,to,on an individual basis,and,in claims terms,to.after confirmation,seven fields liquidated its assets,substantially through the sale of the butler county real estate,and made distributions to the investors.seven fields,however,did not pay the allowed claims of the investors in full through this liquidation.
on september,appellants,on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated as shareholders of seven fields,filed a complaint against ernst young in the court of common pleas of butler county,alleging professional negligence count i,fraud and deceit count ii,and negligent misrepresentation count iii.because,as will be seen,the precise allegations in the complaint are significant in determining a central issue on appeal,the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court over appellants causes of action,we recite the relevant allegations verbatim 
prior to the formation of seven fields,the predecessor entities were involved in a bankruptcy in which ernst young acted as accountants and performed services on behalf of,inter alia,the appellants and other members of the and after the bankruptcy.
as a result of the work performed by ernst young,all of the predecessor entities were represented by ernst young to be insolvent,the predecessor entities were consolidated and a successor corporation,seven fields,acceded to ownership of the assets of the predecessor entities which included a substantial tract of land in butler county,pennsylvania.
in addition to declaring the predecessor entities insolvent,ernst young advised the united states bankruptcy court,the appellant class and others,that even after the reorganization and bankruptcy and in spite of the fact that seven fields owned a substantial tract of land in butler county,pennsylvania,ernst young represented to the appellant class members and others that the new company had a debt of about million to the group of investors.
the foregoing had been represented previously and throughout the bankruptcy by ernst young to the united states bankruptcy court,the investor class and others.
appellants and the remaining class members had all invested varying sums of money in one or more of the predecessor entities including earned capital,and upon being advised by ernst young that the company was million in debt,appellants and the remaining class members were horrified in that ernst young,in effect,represented that appellants and the remaining class members had either lost all of their money or were going to lose a substantial portion of the money.
as a result of the advice received by ernst young,an effort to develop the property and other assets was made which included sales of assets at prices below their market value and a general development scheme was put together by the successor corporation and its officers,which instead of emphasizing the highest use of the properties to which the new corporation had title,was instead calculated to generate cash as quickly as possible in an effort to both repay appellants and other class members their loss and in a further effort to reassure appellants and other class members that some money would be returned.
as a result of the state of mind and perception on the part of the new corporation,appellants and other class members,the property was developed sold in a manner which caused all of the investors to suffer losses on the investment previously made and to fail to realize even a return of the full amount of their investment.
on november,ernst young filed a notice of removal of the butler county case with the clerk of the bankruptcy court,removing the case to the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania under rule a of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure and and.then,ernst young filed a motion to dismiss appellants complaint on november,arguing that even though their claims are in the nature of a shareholder derivative suit,appellants failed to assert the claims on behalf of seven fields and had not made any demand on seven fields as required under federal rule of civil procedure.app.at.additionally,ernst young argued that the doctrines of res judicata,collateral estoppel,and judicial estoppel required dismissal of the complaint because the claims necessarily require the court to disturb a valid,final and binding reorganization plan and confirmation order,as well as the court order approving its fees.id.at 
appellants responded with a motion requesting that the bankruptcy court remand the case to the butler county court of common pleas pursuant to b and federal rule of bankruptcy d,or,in the alternative,abstain from exercising jurisdiction under c and c.in this motion,appellants argued that the notice of removal was procedurally deficient in that ernst young erroneously filed it with the clerk of the bankruptcy court and not the clerk of the district court,and that the bankruptcy court did not have subject matter jurisdiction.appellants,in the alternative,also asserted that if the bankruptcy court did have jurisdiction,it should have abstained permissively or was required to abstain mandatorily from exercising its jurisdiction over the causes of action.moreover,appellants filed a motion to strike defendants notice of removal,arguing that ernst young was not permitted to remove the case as the underlying bankruptcy case on which removal was predicated had been marked closed and ernst young did not move to reopen the case before filing the notice of removal.
on september,the bankruptcy court issued an opinion and order in which it sua sponte reopened the underlying bankruptcy case and denied appellants motions to remand and strike the notice of removal,thus asserting its subject matter jurisdiction to rule on the merits of the case.in re earned capital.on the merits,the bankruptcy court granted ernst young motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim because appellants claims are shareholder derivative claims that can only be presented by appellants through a shareholder derivative suit,and appellants failed to make a demand on the board of directors or comparable authority under federal rule of civil procedure for them to bring the action against ernst young.id.at.the court also found that it should dismiss the complaint on the grounds of res judicata,collateral estoppel,and judicial estoppel inasmuch as the bankruptcy court already had declared the debtors insolvent in the confirmation proceedings and had awarded fees to ernst in which the committee,which represented the interests of the investors,fully participated.id.at.appellants appealed from the opinion and order of the bankruptcy court to the district court under a,which,in turn,on july,affirmed the order of the bankruptcy court and adopted the bankruptcy court opinion and order as its own.geruschat ernst young llp.
on august,appellants timely filed a notice of appeal,contesting the district court affirmance of the bankruptcy court order granting ernst young motion to dismiss their case,denying appellants motion to strike ernst young notice of removal,denying appellants motion to remand the case to the state court,and reopening the underlying bankruptcy case.however,when we examined appellants brief,we observed that it was devoid of any discussion relating to the merits of the case insofar as the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court opinion and order granting ernst young motion to dismiss.it thus appeared that between the time appellants filed their notice of appeal and the time that they filed their brief,they decided not to appeal the bankruptcy and district courts disposition of the case on the merits and,instead,challenged only the resolution of jurisdictional issues in the bankruptcy proceedings.at oral argument,appellants confirmed that they had made a deliberate decision to forego their appeal insofar as it relates to the merits of the dispute.accordingly,the only issues appellants raise before us relate to removal procedure,subject matter jurisdiction,the bankruptcy court adjudicative authority over the claims,and abstention.in particular,appellants present the issues before us as follows 
does a bankruptcy court have subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate a case removed from state court where the underlying bankruptcy case on which removal is predicated was closed many years before removal and where the removing party did not seek to open the earlier bankruptcy case for cause pursuant to b prior to removal of the state court case 
may a party within this circuit remove a case directly to the bankruptcy court under a without a prior referral from the district court 
did the requisite close nexus exist under resorts int l.litig.trust price waterhouse,cir,to confer subject matter jurisdiction in the district court over appellants state law claims where such claims affected neither the bankruptcy estate nor the debtor,and where success on the merits of such claims would have no impact on the property of the estate or distribution to any creditor 
did appellants state law malpractice action constitute a proceeding under thus depriving the bankruptcy court of original jurisdiction to enter final orders and further requiring the district court to abstain from jurisdiction under c 
did the bankruptcy court commit clear error of law when it assumed that the status of appellants complaint as a core proceeding was dispositive of the issue of discretionary abstention under c 
appellants br.at.we have divided those issues into three categories removal procedure errors issues and jurisdiction issues and and abstention issues and.
iii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
appellants central issue in this case implicates the question of whether the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction under and.there is no question that the district court had jurisdiction over the appeal of the bankruptcy court september,opinion and order under a.
but before we reach the question of whether the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction and the other issues appellants raise,we first must ensure that we have jurisdiction to review this case under and d.see emerald investors trust gaunt parsippany partners,cir as always,after we are satisfied of our own jurisdiction,the threshold,and,indeed,as it turns out,the only issue on this appeal is whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction.footnote omitted.the parties initially did not question our jurisdiction prior to argument,however,we observed that there might be a problem with respect to our jurisdiction.thus,at our direction,our clerk sent a notice to the parties requesting that they be prepared to briefly discuss whether d precludes us from reviewing both the bankruptcy court decision to abstain under c and the district court affirmance of this decision,because discretionary abstention does not appear to be subject to appeal pursuant to d.at oral argument,we expressed an additional concern with respect to our jurisdiction to review certain aspects of the case under b,the bankruptcy removal statute,which bars a court of appeals review of decisions to remand or not to remand made on the basis of any equitable ground.accordingly,we asked the parties to submit supplemental memoranda addressing jurisdictional issues.having given the parties an opportunity to address the questions relating to our jurisdiction,and having received those memoranda and heard their oral arguments,the issues with respect to our jurisdiction are now ripe for our disposition.
the essence of this appeal is that the bankruptcy or district court should have remanded the case to the state court because ernst young notice of removal was procedurally defective,the federal courts lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the causes of action,the bankruptcy court lacked final adjudicative authority,and the federal courts should have abstained permissively or were required to abstain mandatorily from asserting their jurisdiction there are three statutory provisions potentially affecting our jurisdiction to review the orders in which the bankruptcy and district courts declined to remand the case,assumed jurisdiction,and did not abstain from asserting jurisdiction d general b bankruptcy and c and d bankruptcy abstention and limitation of appeals of orders with respect to abstention.
section d is the general statutory provision governing the reviewability of orders remanding cases removed from state courts.section d states a n order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise except in certain civil rights cases.though the supreme court has concluded that section d applies regardless of whether a party has removed a case pursuant to the general removal provision,a,or the bankruptcy removal provision,see things remembered,petrarca,d,section d is inapplicable here as in this case we are not dealing with an order remanding the case.after all,the bankruptcy court denied appellants motions seeking to remand the case and the district court affirmed the denial.see city county of san francisco pg e,cir.holding that section d does not apply to decisions not to remand a case,cert.denied,d in re bissonnet invs.llc,cir same.indeed,we regularly entertain appeals following final judgments in which appellants contend that the district court erred in denying a motion to remand.
in contrast,under the removal statute applicable specifically to bankruptcy cases,
t he court to which such claim or cause of action is removed may remand such claim or cause of action on any equitable ground.an order entered under this subsection remanding a claim or cause of action,or a decision to not remand,is not reviewable by appeal or otherwise by the court of appeals under section d,or of this title or by the supreme court of the united states under section of this title.
b emphasis added.thus,section b,in addition to barring review of decisions to remand,precludes appellate review of decisions to not remand,the type of order involved in this case.
but section b makes clear that a decision to remand or not to remand a case is unreviewable by a court of appeals only when the district court relies on any equitable ground as the basis for its decision.while the statute does not define equitable ground,we have recognized that equitable as used in section b is not to be understood as distinguishing equitable from legal grounds in a traditional sense,but,instead,equitable signals that which is reasonable,fair,or appropriate.allied signal recovery trust allied signal,cir quoting things remembered,at.at ginsburg,concurring.
accordingly,we first must decide which,if any,of the categories of issues appellants raise contesting the bankruptcy and district courts decisions not to remand the causes of action are insulated from appellate review by section b.additionally,we also must determine whether,the bankruptcy abstention provision,insulates from our review the decisions relating to abstention.
removal procedure errors 
we have no doubt that the bankruptcy court decision to not remand the case in the face of appellants procedural arguments that ernst young did not seek to reopen the bankruptcy case before filing its notice of removal and that ernst young improperly filed the notice of removal directly with the bankruptcy clerk was based on the bankruptcy court determination that there were not equitable ground s,reasonable,fair,or appropriate grounds,for the remand,a decision that we can not review.the supreme court in things remembered faced very similar circumstances.in that case,the issue was whether a federal court of appeals may review a district court order remanding a bankruptcy court case to state court on grounds of untimely removal.things remembered,at.at.the court decided that the general statutory provision governing the reviewability of remand orders,d,barred appellate review of the remand order see things remembered,at.at.while the majority opinion did not discuss the possibility that the bankruptcy remand provision of section b similarly would bar review,justice ginsburg in her concurring opinion,joined by justice stevens,concluded that section b independently would bar review of the order remanding the case by reason of untimely removal,finding that the basis for remand was on an equitable ground.id.at.at ginsburg,concurring.
surely,if a remand based on untimely removal is predicated on an equitable ground,the decision not to remand based on the procedural defects raised here also addresses a proposed remand on equitable grounds,and thus we are precluded from reviewing it.we recognize that the issue in things remembered was whether a decision to remand was unreviewable and the issue here is whether a decision not to remand is unreviewable,and,although we can distinguish the cases on that basis,this difference is not material here as bankruptcy remand section b tells us that appellate courts should treat decisions to remand or not remand alike in ascertaining their own jurisdiction.
appellants do not specifically discuss in their supplemental memorandum whether we are barred from reviewing the issue raised relating to ernst young filing of the notice of removal with the bankruptcy clerk and not the district court clerk.nevertheless,we are treating appellants discussion relating to our obligation to review their challenges to the bankruptcy court subject matter jurisdiction as incorporating this aspect of their appeal.however,we do not categorize this filing issue as relating to the bankruptcy court subject matter jurisdiction,a holding that would be very significant with respect to our jurisdiction for,as we next discuss,section b does not preclude a court of appeals from reviewing a challenge to a bankruptcy or district court subject matter jurisdiction.rather,ernst young error,if there was an error,was merely an error relating to removal procedure in the nature of a issue as the supreme court used that term in bowles russell,d.it had nothing to do with the delineat ion of the classes of cases subject matter jurisdiction falling within a court adjudicatory authority.kontrick ryan,d.thus,section b precludes us from reviewing the alleged procedural error here 
appellants argue that section b does not bar our review of issues attributable to ernst young failure to seek to reopen the bankruptcy case before filing its notice of removal,as they raised the issue with the bankruptcy judge in a motion to strike defendant notice of removal,and not by means of a motion to remand.appellants suppl.mem.at.we do not find this argument to be substantial.inasmuch as section precludes our review of decision s to not remand,we look to the substance of the bankruptcy court decision and not the form of the party motion in determining the applicability of section it is clear that the bankruptcy court decision in which it denied plaintiffs motion to strike defendants notice of removal,and the district court affirmance thereof,are decision s to not remand inasmuch as they deny appellants request to remand the matter to the state court because of the alleged procedural defect.we add that appellants themselves acknowledge this point for they requested in their proposed order attached to their motion that the court order recite that defendants notice of removal is hereby stricken,and this case is remanded to the court of common pleas of butler county,pennsylvania.app.at 
bankruptcy court jurisdiction and adjudicative authority 
we agree with appellants that the decisions of the bankruptcy and district courts not to remand the case on the basis that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction and their argument that the bankruptcy court did not have the authority to exercise final adjudicative authority,while not per se reviewable under section b,nevertheless are subject to appellate review.see things remembered,at.at ginsburg,concurring see also city county of san francisco,at this is a question of subject matter jurisdiction that does not implicate the jurisdictional limitations of section b.in re v m,cir because appellant argument attacks the lower court subject matter jurisdiction,we not only have jurisdiction to review but are obligated to do so,rapid am.in re celotex,cir w e hold that b does not preclude us from reviewing the district court decision denying the motion to remand to the extent that the motion rested on the district court allegedly lacking subject matter jurisdiction.we reach our conclusion because courts of appeals on appeals from bankruptcy and district courts must ensure that those courts do not exceed the authority that article iii of the constitution and congress has granted them.section can not detract from this obligation and we are of the view that a bankruptcy judge absent consent of the parties does not have jurisdiction to enter a final order in a matter.c.of course,there is no question that the district court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal from the bankruptcy court.see a.
abstention 
the question of whether we have jurisdiction to review the district court affirmance of the bankruptcy court decision not to abstain under c mandatory abstention and section c permissive abstention is a process.first,we must decide which version of section we are to apply in this case.this selection is significant as congress adopted amendments to section altering courts of appeals jurisdiction in the amendments,the amendments,and the amendments.congress enacted the current version of section in the amendments,though it further amended section in technical respects in second,once we decide which version of section applies,we must construe the statute to determine the extent of and limitations on a court of appeals jurisdiction over abstention decisions.
under the current version of section d,
a ny decision to abstain or not to abstain made under subsection c other than a decision not to abstain in a proceeding described in subsection c mandatory abstention is not reviewable by appeal or otherwise by the court of appeals under section d,or of this title subsection c and this subsection shall not be construed to limit the applicability of the stay 
thus,we have recognized that,as section d now stands,appeals of decisions not to exercise mandatory abstention pursuant to c are explicitly permitted,stoe flaherty,cir,yet appeals of decisions involving permissive abstention,whether or not the court abstains,are barred,see allied signal,at.moreover,under section d a decision mandatorily abstaining is not appealable.
inasmuch as appellants appeal the denial of their motion for mandatory abstention,it might be thought that they would contend that the current version of section is applicable here.yet they contend that section d in its current form does not control this case,a position they predicate on the circumstance that the debtors filed their bankruptcy petitions in,well before congress enacted the current version of section through the amendments and even well before congress enacted the amendments.appellants suppl.mem.at.actually it is understandable that they take this position as they argue that the bankruptcy court should have abstained both mandatorily and permissively,and currently,as we have indicated,appeals of orders denying permissive abstention unquestionably are not allowed.
the appellants rely on the amendments,the version the bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act of,stat,enacted on july,because that version provided that a ny decision to abstain made under this subsection is not reviewable by appeal or otherwise.see christo padgett,cir.but the amendments did not limit appeals of decisions not to abstain.accordingly,if we were to look to the amendments for our rule of decision,the bankruptcy court decision not to abstain mandatorily or permissively would be subject to our review and we could review all of appellants abstention arguments.
ernst young,on the other hand,urges us to look to the version of section c enacted in the judicial improvements act of,stat,the amendments,which provided that a ny decision to abstain or not to abstain under this subsection is not reviewable by appeal or otherwise by the court of appeals appellees suppl.mem.at.ernst young contends that under the amendments we are prohibited from reviewing decisions not to abstain either mandatorily or permissively.id.at.thus,appellants and ernst young take polar opposite approaches with respect to our jurisdiction to hear the appeal with respect to abstention.
we have examined the question of which version of section is applicable,and have concluded that section d,as amended in,and which,with the minor amendments,the current law,controls this case even though neither party contends that the amendments are applicable.we reach this conclusion because congress enacted the amendments long before appellants initiated their action in the state court 
in considering whether the amendments,and thus current law,are applicable we point out that congress made it clear that the amendments,with certain exceptions not relevant here,shall not apply with respect to cases commenced under title of the united states code before the date of the enactment of this act october.bankruptcy reform act of,b application of amendments,stat,see also historical and statutory notes,effective and applicability provisions stating that the amendments do not apply with respect to cases commenced under title of the united states code before,in re middlesex power equip.marine,cir christo,at.while there has been some discussion in other courts of appeals as to whether a case commenced under title refers to the bankruptcy case or the civil case which was removed,see,a distinction that is critical here as the debtors filed their petitions in and appellants instituted this action in,we need not concern ourselves at length with this question regarding application of the amendments for we already have determined that cases under title as used in section a refers merely to the bankruptcy petition itself,as opposed to proceeding s,which refers to the steps within the case and to any subaction within the case that may raise a disputed or litigated matter.in re combustion eng g,cir.we do not see why cases should have a different meaning in the words cases commenced under title in.b,with respect to the effective date of the amendments.thus,as the amendments do not apply to cases,the bankruptcy case itself,commenced under title before october,they do apply in this proceeding which was instituted after october,and,rather than being a case within the meaning of,b,is a subaction within the bankruptcy case initiated long after that date.
it might be thought from the foregoing analysis that we would conclude that we do not have jurisdiction over this appeal with respect to the bankruptcy court refusal to abstain permissively but do have jurisdiction over its refusal to abstain mandatorily as appeals of decisions not to abstain in proceedings commenced after october,are permitted when mandatory abstention has been refused.indeed,at first glance it would seem that nothing could be clearer as section d provides that only a decision not to abstain in a proceeding described in subsection c,mandatory abstention,is reviewable.
yet there is a special situation here.as we point out below in dealing with the distinction between related to,jurisdiction,and arising under title or arising in a case under title,core jurisdiction,in determining whether the bankruptcy court had final adjudicative power,in this case the bankruptcy court was applying arising in jurisdiction.moreover,section c in providing for mandatory abstention applies only to a proceeding based upon a state law cause of action related to a case under title but not arising under title or arising in a case under title.consequently,it necessarily follows from our holding that this is an arising in case,that there was no possible basis for the bankruptcy and district courts to abstain mandatorily under the amendments or at any time since their enactment.see in re gober,cir mandatory abstention applies only to is,proceedings related to a case under title,but not arising under title,or arising in a case under title.thus,we are not dealing with a decision denying mandatory abstention as no matter how appellants entitled their application for abstention they did not make a motion for abstention coming within section c consequently,notwithstanding appellants efforts to characterize this case as involving mandatory abstention,it is only a permissive abstention case and we do not have jurisdiction over the appeal of the denial of abstention.
we realize that our result differs from that of the court of appeals for the fifth circuit in re southmark,cir,a case on which appellants rely.in that case,the court apparently believed that it should look to the filing date of the bankruptcy petition when determining which version of section applied.see id.at.thus,the court applied the amendments in a case in which the chapter bankruptcy petition was filed in,even though the civil action before the court of appeals was filed in a state court and removed to a federal court in,after the enactment of both the amendments and the amendments and prior to the matter being before the court of appeals in.id.at.the court did not discuss the implications of the amendments but seemed to think that inasmuch as southmark case,evidently meaning its chapter filing,predates the amendments and was filed when decisions not to abstain were reviewable on appeal,id.at,it had jurisdiction.the court reference to the appealability of decisions not to abstain must have been to the amendments as they precluded only appeals of decisions to abstain.
we can not distinguish southmark with respect to jurisdiction over abstention appeals but we will not follow it as we question whether southmark in this respect is consistent with binding precedents it is that a court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision,unless doing so would result in manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary.bradley sch.bd.of richmond,d.we find no justification to disregard this longstanding legal principle and establish an exception wherein a court would look to the date that a debtor or creditor filed the bankruptcy case rather than the proceeding directly in issue in determining which version of section applies.proceedings subject to the abstention provisions are causes of action initiated separately from the bankruptcy case itself and often arise well after the filing of bankruptcy petition,and sometimes,as in this case,even after the assets of the bankruptcy estate have been distributed and the bankruptcy case closed.overall,we can not justify applying the law that existed at the time the debtors filed their bankruptcy petitions and not the law that existed at the time that appellants filed their separate civil action or the law as it currently stands which is materially the same.
in sum,with respect to our jurisdiction we find that we only can review the bankruptcy and district courts decisions relating to subject matter jurisdiction,including the authority of the bankruptcy court to issue final orders we do not have jurisdiction to review their decisions relating to the alleged procedural defects in the removal process and mandatory or permissive abstention.consequently,inasmuch as appellants do not challenge the order dismissing their case on the merits,now that we have set forth the scope of our jurisdiction,the subject matter of our review is quite limited.

iv.discussion 
a.the statutory framework of federal bankruptcy jurisdiction 
as we have indicated in other litigation,b ankruptcy courts fall outside of the constitutional authority of article iii and derive their authority from federal statutes.resorts,at.congress,in turn,has vested limited authority in bankruptcy courts through and,sections within title of the united states code dealing with the judiciary and judicial procedure.id.for the most part,however,title of the united states code governs bankruptcy proceedings.
section describes the jurisdictional boundaries of a district court over bankruptcy cases and proceedings but,by itself,does not vest any authority in the bankruptcy courts.rather,section a states that the district courts shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases under title,and section b states that the district courts shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title,or arising in or related to cases under title.district courts,however,even though they have jurisdiction under subsections a or b,are permitted,in the interest of justice,or in the interest of comity with state courts or respect for state law,to abstain from hearing a particular proceeding arising under title or arising in or related to a case under title.c permissive abstention.additionally,
u pon timely motion of a party in a proceeding based upon a state law claim or state law cause of action,related to a case under title but not arising under title or arising in a case under title,with respect to which an action could not have been commenced in a court of the united states absent jurisdiction under section,the district court shall abstain from hearing such proceeding if an action is commenced,and can be timely adjudicated,in a state forum of appropriate jurisdiction.
c mandatory abstention.
on the other hand,lists the bankruptcy cases and proceedings that may be referred to the bankruptcy courts.absent delegation of authority by the district court,much like the authority in b,which provides for the delegation of certain judicial powers to magistrate judges,section does not permit bankruptcy judges to hear and adjudicate cases in the absence of a reference from the district court.but under section a,e ach district may provide that any or all cases under title and any or all proceedings arising under title or arising in or related to a case under title shall be referred to the bankruptcy judges for the district.as we have indicated,t he district courts power to refer is discretionary,but courts routinely refer most bankruptcy cases to the bankruptcy court.resorts,at internal quotation marks omitted.
section provides for two levels of authority that may be invested in a bankruptcy judge depending upon into which of two categories a case or proceeding falls.the two categories are all cases under title and all core proceedings arising under title,or arising in a case under title,b collectively known as core proceedings and a proceeding that is not a core proceeding but that is otherwise related to a case under title,c proceedings.see combustion eng g,at resorts,at.
the bankruptcy judge determine s,on the judge own motion or on timely motion of a party,whether a proceeding is a core proceeding under this subsection or is a proceeding that is otherwise related to a case under title.b.a correct determination of whether a matter is core or establishes the bankruptcy judge level of authority.with respect to core proceedings congress has provided that bankruptcy judges may hear and determine all cases under title and all core proceedings arising under title,or arising in a case under title,referred under subsection a of this section,and may enter appropriate orders or judgments,subject to review under section of this title.b.sections a and b give jurisdiction to the district courts and the bankruptcy appellate panel should one be established by the judicial council of a circuit and with the consent of all the parties to hear appeals from final judgments,orders,and decrees,as well as from interlocutory orders and decrees under certain circumstances,entered by the bankruptcy courts.
however,the determination that a case is not a core proceeding does not mean that a bankruptcy judge lacks authority with respect to it.rather,
a bankruptcy judge may hear a proceeding that is not a core proceeding but that is otherwise related to a case under title.in such proceeding,the bankruptcy judge shall submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court,and any final order or judgment shall be entered by the district judge after considering the bankruptcy judge proposed findings and conclusions and after reviewing de novo those matters to which any party has timely and specifically objected.
c.additionally,the district court,with the consent of all the parties to the proceeding,may refer a proceeding related to a case under title to a bankruptcy judge to hear and determine and to enter appropriate orders and judgments,subject to review under section of this title.c.
resorts international 
appellants predicate a large part of their case on this appeal challenging the bankruptcy and district courts jurisdiction on our opinion in resorts,so we start with a discussion of that case.in resorts,resorts international and related entities entered into chapter bankruptcy proceedings in.id.at.the following year the bankruptcy court issued an order confirming their second amended joint plan of reorganization the reorganization plan.id.at.
less than one month after the court confirmed the reorganization plan,resorts international and its creditors entered into a final plan and litigation trust agreement creating a litigation trust in which the trustee was assigned claims resorts international held against donald trump and affiliated entities arising from trump leveraged buyout of the taj mahal resort.id.the final plan authorized the trustee to prosecute the claims,with the debtor to provide the first spent in the litigation in the form of an irrevocable letter of credit.nevertheless the proceeds from the suit were to be distributed to certain creditors who were covered under the final plan.id.at.the final plan also required the trustee to retain an independent public accounting firm to provide auditing and services for the trust,and on november,pursuant to this requirement,the trustee retained price waterhouse for this purpose.id.at.on may,the trustee entered into a settlement,that the creditors subsequently approved,with trump in the amount of.id.the proceeds of the settlement became assets of the litigation trust.id.
on april,the trustee filed an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court setting forth accounting malpractice and breach of contract claims against price waterhouse in which the trustee sought disgorgement of price waterhouse fees in excess of paid for accounting services that it performed for the trust,as well as damages.id.the trustee principal allegation was that price waterhouse erroneously reported in its audit reports that certain accrued interest on the litigation trust accounts belonged to the debtor rather than the trust,and that the bankruptcy court relied upon those erroneous reports in a separate suit between the trust and resorts international in deciding on an allocation of the interest earned on the litigation expense account created under the final plan.id.at.resorts international,whose estate no longer existed following the confirmation of the reorganization plan,was not a party to the malpractice action.id.at.
the bankruptcy court held that it did not have jurisdiction over the adversary proceeding which set forth claims and thus dismissed the proceedings.the trustee,however,appealed and the district court reversed,following which the district court certified its ruling for immediate appeal to us under b,and we granted leave to appeal.resorts,at.the case then came on before us to decide whether the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction over the claims.id.we discussed three separate issues in our opinion.
first,we held that courts will give effect to provisions that reorganization plans sometimes include only if there is bankruptcy court jurisdiction under and,as neither the bankruptcy court nor the parties can write their own jurisdictional ticket.resorts,at.in other words,in the absence of statutory federal jurisdiction,retention of jurisdiction provisions in a plan of reorganization or trust agreement are fundamentally irrelevant.id.of course,if there is jurisdiction,we will give effect to retention of jurisdiction provisions.id.thus,we examined the question of whether the dispute fell within the bankruptcy court subject matter jurisdiction.id.
second,we held that the claims at issue were not core proceedings under section b because the proceeding did not invoke a substantive right provided by title or a proceeding that,by its nature,could arise only in the context of a bankruptcy case.id.at.we distinguished the circumstances in resorts from the situation before the court of appeals for the fifth circuit in southmark.in southmark,the debtor filed a malpractice suit against the accounting firm that provided accounting services prior to plan confirmation.resorts,at.the southmark court held that the suit was a core proceeding because the bankruptcy court must be able to ensure that managers of the debtor estate are performing their work conscientiously,and,and supervising professionals bears directly on the distribution of the debtor estate for i f the estate is not marshaled and liquidated or reorganized expeditiously,there will be far less money available to pay creditors claims.id.quoting southmark,at.
in distinguishing southmark we made the following observations 
unlike in southmark,this claim arose confirmation.it does not directly affect the debtor or the liquidation of the estate assets.furthermore,the accounting firm alleged malpractice in southmark implicated the integrity of the entire bankruptcy process.southmark bankruptcy arose out of its involvement in drexel burnham lambert,junk bond investment.southmark,at.southmark sought the appointment of an accounting firm to provide an objective,independent assessment of potential legal claims against.id.unbeknownst to southmark,drexel was one of the accounting firm largest clients.id.at.according to southmark,the accounting firm committed malpractice by failing to satisfactorily investigate potential claims against drexel.id.southmark alleged the accounting firm breach of its fiduciary duty prevented the estate from recovering from drexel.id.at.the accounting firm failure to investigate drexel implicated the core of the bankruptcy process.its alleged malpractice was inseparable from the bankruptcy context.here,price waterhouse alleged malpractice,erroneously reporting that certain accrued interest belonged to one entity rather than to another and committing other errors in auditing and tax advice,even if true,is not a proceeding that could arise only in the bankruptcy context.
resorts,at.
nevertheless,in resorts we went on to indicate that it was unnecessary to resolve whether the case was a core or proceeding for subject matter jurisdictional purposes because w hether a particular proceeding is core represents a question wholly separate from that of jurisdiction.id.quoting in re marcus hook dev.park,cir.it was not necessary to make a core versus determination because as long as a proceeding satisfied the jurisdictional prerequisites to be considered a related to proceeding,the broadest of the potential paths to bankruptcy jurisdiction,it was an extraneous exercise to decide whether the matter was core provided that jurisdiction,and not the bankruptcy court adjudicative authority,was the sole issue before the court.see id.in other words,a determination of whether a matter is core or is unnecessary in an inquiry of whether there is federal jurisdiction over a bankruptcy proceeding,as both categories of cases are within federal jurisdiction and the determination only impacts on the question of whether a bankruptcy court has the authority to enter final judgments and orders under section see id.it was implicit in our holding in resorts that a case is related to a bankruptcy case even if the bankruptcy court could exercise core jurisdiction with respect to it.in this regard,we point out that section c provides that a bankruptcy judge may hear a proceeding that is not a core proceeding but that is otherwise related to a case under title.emphasis added.it seems clear from that language,in particular the inclusion of otherwise,that congress believed that a core case was related to title but that a case can be related to title on a basis other than being a core case.moreover,congress enumeration of core proceedings in section b,in ordinary understanding,lists matters that would be considered related to title cases.
third,we went on to discuss the limits of related to jurisdiction.we first discussed the seminal test for determining the boundaries of related to jurisdiction in pacor,higgins,cir,in which we held that federal courts have related to jurisdiction to hear a proceeding if the outcome of that proceeding could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy.resorts,at.we,however,decided in resorts that application of the pacor test in the context was problematic inasmuch as it is impossible for the bankrupt debtor estate to be affected by a dispute because the debtor estate ceases to exist once confirmation has occurred,as generally the confirmation of a plan vests all of the property of the estate in the reorganized debtor.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
in light of the circumstance that the debtor estate will not exist,and in recognition of the need to confine bankruptcy court jurisdiction to appropriate limits,we recognized a new test to be applied in the context in which the essential inquiry is whether there is a close nexus to the bankruptcy plan or proceeding sufficient to uphold bankruptcy court jurisdiction over the matter.id.at.in other words,a t the stage,the claim must affect an integral aspect of the bankruptcy must be a close nexus to the bankruptcy plan or proceeding.id.at.for instance,we held that m atters that affect the interpretation,implementation,consummation,execution,or administration of the confirmed plan will typically have the requisite close nexus.id.
applied to the facts of the trustee principal allegation was that price waterhouse erroneously reported in its audit reports that accrued interest on the litigation trust belonged to the debtor rather than the held that the proceeding lacks a close nexus to the bankruptcy plan or proceeding and affects only matters collateral to the bankruptcy process.id.at.we explained our decision as follows 
the resolution of the malpractice claims will not affect the estate it will have only incidental effect on the reorganized debtor it will not interfere with the implementation of the reorganization plan though it will affect the former creditors as litigation trust beneficiaries,they no longer have a close nexus to bankruptcy plan or proceeding because they exchanged their creditor status to attain rights to the litigation claims and as stated,the jurisdictional retention plans can not confer jurisdiction greater than that granted under or.
id.we acknowledged that in certain circumstances,accounting errors could have a sufficiently close nexus to the bankruptcy plan or proceeding to warrant exercising related to jurisdiction,but,under the facts of resorts,resolution of the claims will not require a court to interpret or construe the reorganization plan or the trust agreement and t hough the plan and trust agreement provide the context of the case,this bare factual nexus is insufficient to confer bankruptcy jurisdiction.id.at.
c.the decisions of the bankruptcy and district courts 
the bankruptcy court in this case concluded that there was federal jurisdiction because appellants claims aris e in the bankruptcy case as the claims implicate the integrity of the bankruptcy process,and,like the claims in southmark,the claims of professional malpractice were based on services provided during the bankruptcy,under the supervision of,and subject to the approval of,the bankruptcy court.earned capital,at.the bankruptcy court determined that the close nexus test that resorts discussed did not govern this case because resorts is unlike the situation here,where appellants claims are claims against a court appointed professional for work performed during the bankruptcy case.id.further,because the claims are claims arising in the bankruptcy case,the court determined that appellants complaint against ernst young is a core proceeding,and thus,under b,the court had full adjudicative power subject to appellate review by the district court.id.at.
on appeal under,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court opinion and order.specifically,with respect to jurisdiction,it held 
we agree that appellants state court action arises in bankruptcy and that it is a core matter.appellants claims of professional negligence were based on services provided during the bankruptcy,under the supervision of,and subject to the approval of,the bankruptcy court.as such,they implicate the integrity of the bankruptcy process.the state court action challenges the accountants conclusion that the debtor was insolvent,a conclusion endorsed by the bankruptcy court in its confirmation order.for these same reasons,the state court action has a close nexus to the bankruptcy proceedings.
geruschat,at.
appellants challenge two aspects of the decisions of the bankruptcy and district courts relating to subject matter jurisdiction and the bankruptcy court final adjudicative authority.first,they argue that the courts erred in finding that the close nexus test was not applicable under their rationale that the improper conduct alleged in the claims occurred during the bankruptcy proceedings appellants believe that this conclusion was incorrect as they contend application of the close nexus test does not depend on when the malpractice itself occurs.to the contrary,the close nexus test is applicable whenever a state lawsuit is removed to federal court on the basis of a bankruptcy case that is already closed by that point.appellants br.at.second,appellants contend that the bankruptcy and district courts were wrong in concluding that this action was a core proceeding under section b,and thus appellants believe the bankruptcy court did not have the authority to enter final orders under section c.id.at 
after considering the parties arguments,we will affirm the order of the district court and thus,in effect,the order of the bankruptcy court as we conclude that the bankruptcy court had core jurisdiction in this case.the bankruptcy and district courts were not required to address the close nexus test because the test was not applicable in this arising in proceeding.as we discussed in resorts,the close nexus standard only applies for the purposes of determining whether a federal court has jurisdiction over a related to proceeding in the context see resorts,at.appellants seem to believe that any time a party files a case,the close nexus test is triggered.this is plainly not the case.while courts may choose to rely on related to jurisdiction because it is the broadest category of federal bankruptcy jurisdiction when examining their own jurisdiction,it certainly is not incumbent upon them to do so,because,as occurred here,a party may argue and a court may decide that a proceeding falls within one of the narrower categories of jurisdiction,such as arising in jurisdiction,in which case related to jurisdiction and the corresponding close nexus test are not implicated.
we further find that the courts conclusion that there was arising in jurisdiction was correct.c laims that arise in a bankruptcy case are claims that by their nature,not their particular factual circumstance,could only arise in the context of a bankruptcy case.stoe,at.in resorts,in distinguishing the circumstances of the case from those in southmark,we explained in what circumstances and on what legal basis a claim of professional malpractice for work performed during the bankruptcy could support arising in core jurisdiction.see resorts,at.unlike those in resorts,the material facts of the case before us are indistinguishable from those in southmark.
first,in resorts we distinguished the case from southmark because the claims in resorts arose confirmation.see id.here,however,appellants in their complaint allege that their claims,like the claims in southmark,arose inasmuch as the conduct on which they predicate the claims occurred during the bankruptcy process.specifically,their complaint alleges that in reliance upon the negligent work ernst young performed during the bankruptcy,the bankruptcy court wrongly deemed the debtors to be insolvent and caused the liquidation of the estate assets in a manner that contravened the amended plan.
second,in our case,just as was true in southmark,ernst young alleged malpractice implicated the integrity of the entire bankruptcy process and the alleged malpractice was inseparable from the bankruptcy context.resorts,at.the bankruptcy court appointed ernst young to review the debtors financial records and prepare the financial schedules needed for the bankruptcy.according to appellants allegations in their complaint,as a result of the work that ernst young performed during the bankruptcy proceedings and its representations to the bankruptcy court,the bankruptcy court deemed the debtors to be insolvent.this conclusion led to the formation of seven fields,a corporation organized,according to the amended plan,to achieve the goal of full payment of the unsecured,nondischargeable debt due appellants.certainly this aspect of the plan,based at least in part on ernst young representations that the debtors were insolvent,was a significant factor in bringing about the court confirmation of the plan.yet,thereafter,according to the complaint,ernst young represented that seven fields had a large debt,which,according to the complaint is not the case,and seven fields was compelled to sell its properties in a manner that was not in appellants best economic interests,contrary to the amended plan provisions.moreover,the bankruptcy court approved the stipulation between seven fields and ernst young providing for the fees paid to ernst young for its accounting work during the bankruptcy proceedings.at.
the court of appeals for the fifth circuit in southmark explained why this type of misconduct and relationship to the bankruptcy court falls within the arising in jurisdiction of the federal courts 
in this case,the professional malpractice claims alleged against the defendants are inseparable from the bankruptcy context.a sine qua non in restructuring the relationship is the court ability to police the fiduciaries,whether trustees or and other professionals,who are responsible for managing the debtor estate in the best interest of creditors.the bankruptcy court must be able to assure itself and the creditors who rely on the process that managers of the debtor estate are performing their work,conscientiously and.bankruptcy code provisions describe the basis for compensation,appointment and removal of professionals,their standards,and the duties they must perform.see generally.although standards for the conduct of professionals,the breach of which may constitute bankruptcy malpractice,are not comprehensively expressed in the statute,the code need not duplicate relevant,state law.it is evident that a professional dereliction of duty could transgress both explicit code responsibilities and applicable professional malpractice standards.for instance,in billing ravin,greenberg zackin,cir,the professional malpractice allegations included the attorneys failure to comply with court orders and to submit a plan of reorganization to the bankruptcy court.award of the professionals fees and enforcement of the appropriate standards of conduct are inseparably related functions of bankruptcy courts.
supervising the professionals also bears directly on the distribution of the debtor estate.if the estate is not marshaled and liquidated or reorganized expeditiously,there will be far less money available to pay creditors claims.excessive professional fees or fees charged for mediocre or,worse,phantom work also cause the estate and the creditors to suffer a malpractice claim like the present one against professionals inevitably involves the nature of the services performed for the debtor estate and the fees awarded under superintendence of the bankruptcy court it can not stand alone.
southmark,at.other courts of appeals,including this court,have reached similar conclusions.see grausz englander,cir finding that legal malpractice claim against firm for alleged misconduct in bankruptcy case is a claim arising in the bankruptcy case in re ferrante,cir holding that action against trustee for misconduct in administering estate was a core proceeding concerning the administration of the bankruptcy estate see also billing,at,while not directly addressing whether a legal malpractice suit against bankruptcy counsel constitutes a core proceeding as parties agreed that it does we recognized that the malpractice suit mirrors debtors objections to the allowance of attorneys fees,the resolution of which are within the bankruptcy court explicit jurisdiction to award fees for bankruptcy counsel and other supervisory powers as to bankruptcy counsel.
as ernst young points out,
n othing is more important than the integrity of the bankruptcy process t he integrity of the process goes to the heart of the administration of a bankruptcy case.furthermore,few issues are as important in the bankruptcy process as the bankruptcy court conclusion as to the solvency of a debtor.the solvency analysis is the cornerstone of the distribution plan.here,both the integrity of the bankruptcy process and the solvency of the debtors have been drawn into question.
appellees br.at citations omitted.in this regard,we have no doubt that the bankruptcy and district courts correctly found that appellants asserted their alleged malpractice claims in a core proceeding that aris es in the bankruptcy case.
in addition to the reasoning of southmark,we also note that section specifically provides that core proceedings include matters concerning the administration of the estate and other proceedings affecting the liquidation of the assets of the estate.b a and o.such matters are at issue here.appellants allege that ernst young negligence and misrepresentations caused the sale of seven fields assets in a manner that was not in their best economic interests,contrary to the amended plan provisions requiring that seven fields would be managed,improved,developed and sold,where appropriate,to the end that all creditors will eventually achieve maximum returns.app.at.in sum,it is clear to us that a malpractice action against an accountant for misconduct during the bankruptcy on which the bankruptcy judge relied in confirming the plan of reorganization,and in reliance on which the bankruptcy court approved the fees to the accountants,and on which appellants representatives relied to their detriment in selling the assets to pay their claims,in a manner that contravenes the terms of the reorganization plan,constitutes a core proceeding,more specifically a proceeding arising in the bankruptcy,which is subject to federal jurisdiction and the final adjudicative authority of the bankruptcy court 
because we have concluded that the bankruptcy and district courts correctly found arising in core jurisdiction so that the close nexus test did not apply,we need not resolve the issue appellants raise relating to the applicability of the close nexus test in the related to context.we,however,will take this opportunity to address the division among courts in this circuit with respect to this issue that has developed in the wake of resorts.appellants raise the question of whether in cases in which the bankruptcy and district courts can be exercising only related to jurisdiction,the resorts close nexus test applies whenever the complaint is filed or must the conduct also occur to trigger the test in other words,in analyzing a court jurisdiction,is conduct alleged in a complaint that is filed evaluated under the pacor test or the resorts close nexus test 
appellants believe that application of the close nexus test does not depend on when the malpractice itself occurs.rather,in their view,the crucial inquiry is whether the bankruptcy case is closed at the time the claim is removed to it.appellants br.at.accordingly,appellants contend that the test applies whenever there is a action filed,presumably even an original proceeding as distinguished from a removed case which is the situation here.ernst young,on the other hand,argues that the close nexus test under resorts applies only when the alleged wrongdoing took place.appellees br.at.bankruptcy and district courts within this circuit have rendered inconsistent opinions on this point since resorts.compare in re exds,and in re lgi,in which the courts stated the test in terms of when the cause of action arose or the conduct occurred,with jazz photo dreier llp,no.civ,wl,at dec,and in re laroche,in which the courts stated the test in terms of when the cause of action was filed.this division in results makes it important for us to address the issue.
we start this point with a further discussion of pacor,the case that set forth the test used to determine whether a proceeding is related to a bankruptcy that was applied in all circumstances until we established the limitations on the test in the context in resorts.in pacor,john and louise higgins brought a suit in a state court against pacor,a chemical supplies distributor,for injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos contained in pacor products.id.at.pacor filed a complaint in the state court against the asbestos manufacturer.id.subsequently filed chapter bankruptcy proceedings in the southern district of new york.id.pacor then sought to remove the state court case to the bankruptcy court in the eastern district of pennsylvania.the eastern district bankruptcy court remanded the entire case to the state court.on pacor appeal,the district court affirmed with respect to the higgins case against pacor as it held that it was not related to the manville bankruptcy pacor then appealed to us.id.in affirming the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court,we articulated what became the seminal test for determining whether a civil proceeding is related to a bankruptcy 
the usual articulation of the test for determining whether a civil proceeding is related to bankruptcy is whether the outcome of that proceeding could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy an action is related to bankruptcy if the outcome could alter the debtor rights,liabilities,options,or freedom of action either positively or negatively and which in any way impacts upon the handling and administration of the bankrupt estate.
id.at internal citations omitted.
then came resorts.we reiterate that resorts involved a claim for professional malpractice and breach of contract brought against price waterhouse for accounting services performed for a litigation trust formed after the bankruptcy court issued an order confirming the reorganization plan.resorts,at.almost seven years after the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan,the litigation trust brought suit against price waterhouse on account of its services.id.at.we held that the traditional test in pacor,a case involving claims brought,was problematic in the context inasmuch as it is impossible for the bankrupt debtor estate to be affected by a dispute because the debtor estate ceases to exist once confirmation has occurred.id.at.thus,because confirmation of a plan in which all property of the estate is vested in the reorganized debtor eliminates the existence of the estate,there never will be jurisdiction over a dispute under a literal interpretation of the pacor test.id.
in an attempt to balance congress intent to grant bankruptcy courts comprehensive jurisdiction so that they could deal efficiently and expeditiously with matters connected with the bankruptcy estate with the jurisdictional limitations on iii bankruptcy courts,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,we developed the test to be applied a t the stage 
as stated,the jurisdiction of the iii bankruptcy courts is limited after confirmation of a plan.but where there is a close nexus to the bankruptcy plan or proceeding,as when a matter affects the interpretation,implementation,consummation,execution,or administration of a confirmed plan or incorporated litigation trust agreement,retention of bankruptcy court jurisdiction is normally appropriate.
after our present consideration of resorts,we are satisfied that the close nexus test is applicable to related to jurisdiction over any claim or cause of action filed,regardless of when the conduct giving rise to the claim or cause of action occurred.we reach this conclusion because in resorts,though we were dealing with rather than conduct,we focused on the point of time in which the cause of action was instituted whether it was filed in the stage,the context.furthermore,we did not indicate that the test should be confined to situations in which the conduct giving rise to the complaint occurred.moreover,since resorts,we have stated that we use the test to determine whether related to jurisdiction exist s at the stage,stoe,at emphasis added.most recently in in re shenango group,cir,we applied the resorts close nexus test in a related to jurisdictional inquiry over a dispute.additionally,we note that the court of appeals for the ninth circuit,which adopted the close nexus test that we described in resorts,has stated that the test applies when the proceeding arises and applied the close nexus test with respect to claims raised involving conduct.see in re pegasus gold,cir.
importantly,limiting the close nexus test to cases involving only conduct would be inconsistent with our reasoning to depart from pacor in resorts.in resorts,we indicated that our central reason to depart from the pacor test in the context was that there no longer is an estate that can be affected so application of the pacor test was problematic.see resorts,at.the time when the conduct raised in the complaint occurred is of no consequence in this analysis as regardless of whether the conduct was or,there would not be an estate at the stage.for these reasons,we conclude that with respect to related to jurisdiction,the pacor test applies in all disputes raised and the close nexus test applies in all disputes raised,regardless of when the conduct alleged in the complaint occurred 
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we will affirm the district court memorandum order of july,affirming the bankruptcy court order of september,dismissing appellants complaint.
as a matter of convenience we will use the name ernst young when referring to arthur young company.
the complaint uses the words received by but we believe that appellants intended to mean given by or received from.
ernst young raised other defenses that we need not describe.
in appellants opening brief they limit their discussion of our jurisdiction to the following sentence the united states court of appeals for the
