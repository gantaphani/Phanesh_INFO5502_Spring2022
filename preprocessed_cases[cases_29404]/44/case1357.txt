opinion of the court 
we vacated our prior opinion in this appeal and granted panel rehearing to clarify certain issues raised by the appellants in their petition for en banc reconsideration.
appellants,charmaine brown and oral douglas,filed a civil rights complaint against the commonwealth of pennsylvania department of health,the city of philadelphia and two emergency medical technicians,mark stewart and john caffey.litigation arose out of the tragic death of appellants son.the district court granted summary judgment for the city because there was no genuine issue of material fact and concluded that deliberate indifference by city policymakers had not been demonstrated.the district court also granted summary judgment for stewart and caffey because it concluded that the appellants federal claim was barred by a prior state judgment.we will affirm,although for different reasons than given by the district court 
shacquiel douglas,the son of charmaine brown and oral douglas,was at the residence of angela morris,his maternal aunt.while there,shacquiel choked on a grape.morris dialed at and informed the operator that her nephew was choking on a grape.the operator called appellees mark stewart and john caffey,who were emergency medical technicians at engine,fire house at street and ogontz avenue in philadelphia.the operator then informed morris that r escue is gon na come help you.at,morris again called to determine when the emts would arrive.morris was informed that r escue was on the way.at,when the emts still had not arrived,morris placed a third call to the operator and was again told that help was on the way.
stewart and caffey arrived at morris residence at,ten minutes after the initial call had been placed.they transported shacquiel to germantown hospital and tried to restore shacquiel breathing during the trip.once at the hospital,the grape was removed from shacquiel throat.he was then transferred to christopher hospital for children where he died two days later due to asphyxia by choking.
appellants filed a civil complaint in the court of common pleas of philadelphia county against stewart and caffey alleging a state tort cause of action based on the same facts as their federal claim.the court of common pleas granted stewart and caffey motion for summary judgment and dismissed all claims against them.
appellants,in their individual capacities and as administrators of shacquiel estate,next filed a civil rights lawsuit in federal court under against the city of philadelphia,and stewart and caffey in their individual and official capacities count i of the complaint asserts a claim against stewart and caffey for alleged violations of their son life,liberty,personal security,and bodily integrity without due process of law in violation of the fourteenth amendment and for deprivation of their son rights,privileges,and immunities secured by the laws and constitution of the commonwealth of pennsylvania.count ii asserts a claim against the city for violations of the commonwealth constitution and the fourth and fourteenth amendments.the claims arising under the commonwealth constitution and the fourth amendment were dismissed,so only the fourteenth amendment claim remained.
the district court granted the city of philadelphia motion for summary judgment because it found that appellants had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact and because appellants had not shown deliberate indifference by city policymakers.brown city of philadelphia,no,wl,at.july.the district court also granted stewart and caffey motion for summary judgment because it concluded that appellants federal lawsuit against stewart and caffey was barred under principles of claim preclusion by the prior state court judgment.id.at.it is from this order that brown and douglas now appeal.
ii.deprivation of a constitutional right 
the threshold issue presented by any case is whether a plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a deprivation of a right secured by the constitution.see baker mccollan,d.appellants allege that,and the substantive component of the fourteenth amendment due process clause,provide them a cause of action under the federal constitution.
the requirements for establishing a constitutional claim under are clear.the pertinent language of the statute provides that 
every person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom or usage,of any state or territory or the district of columbia,subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law,suit in equity or other proper proceeding for redress.
by its own terms,the statute does not create substantive rights.instead,it only provides remedies for deprivations of rights established elsewhere in the constitution or federal laws.
the initial point of reference for our analysis is deshaney winnebago county department of social services,d.in deshaney,the supreme court addressed a claim brought by a mother and her child under against the county department of social services alleging that the child had been denied due process of law when the department failed to intervene and protect him from the injuries he suffered at the hands of his violent father.the court reaffirmed that our cases have recognized that the due process clauses generally confer no affirmative right to governmental aid,even where such aid may be necessary to secure life,liberty,or property interests of which the government itself may not deprive the individual.id.at.the court instructed 
if the due process clause does not require the state to provide its citizens with particular protective services,it follows that the state can not be held liable under the clause for injuries that could have been averted had it chosen to provide them.as a general matter,then,we conclude that a state failure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the due process clause.
the court also found no duty to protect or rescue in the history of the amendment,noting that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment was intended to prevent government from abusing its power,or employing it as an instrument of oppression.id.at.quoting davidson cannon,d.the clause was intended to protect the people from the state,not to ensure that the state protected them from each other.id.since the state is not constitutionally required by the due process clause to provide protective services,the court found that there can be no liability when the state fails to provide such services,even if it would have prevented the private injury from occurring.id.at.
it is a basic tenet of tort law that although an individual generally has no duty to rescue,once voluntarily undertaken,a rescue must not be performed negligently.see,restatement second of torts.one might infer from the general rule that,although the state is not constitutionally required to provide rescue services,once the state undertakes a rescue,federal constitutional law requires that it do so competently.such an inference,however,incorrectly conflates state tort law and federal constitutional law.the supreme court has repeatedly stated that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment does not transform every tort committed by a state actor into a constitutional violation.deshaney,at.collecting cases.although state tort law might provide a remedy for a state negligent rescue attempt,it neither logically nor legally follows that federal constitutional law must do the same.see berg county of allegheny,cir section is not a source of substantive rights and does not provide redress for common law torts the plaintiff must allege a violation of a federal right.
we have not decided whether the due process clause requires states to provide adequate or competent rescue services when they have chosen to undertake these services.other appellate courts addressing this question have held that states have no constitutional obligation to provide competent rescue services.see salazar city of chicago,cir government generally has no constitutional duty to provide rescue services to its citizens,and if it does provide such services,it has no constitutional duty to provide competent services to people not in its custody.bradberry pinellas county,cir the constitution,as opposed to local tort law,does not prohibit grossly negligent rescue attempts nor even the grossly negligent training of state officers.see also archie city of racine,cir en banc jackson city of joliet,cir.we agree with the reasoning of these decisions and join these circuits in holding that there is no federal constitutional right to rescue services,competent or otherwise.moreover,because the due process clause does not require the state to provide rescue services,it follows that we can not interpret that clause so as to place an affirmative obligation on the state to provide competent rescue services if it chooses to provide them.
iii.exceptions to deshaney general rule 
in deshaney,the supreme court expressed two exceptions to its general rule.it held that there was an affirmative duty to protect when the state by the affirmative exercise of its power so restrains an individual liberty that it renders him unable to care for himself,and at the same time fails to provide for his basic human needs,thereby creating a special relationship.at.the special relationship exception is implicated when the state restrains an individual so as to expose the individual to harm.sargi kent city bd.of,cir a special relationship can only arise when the state restrains an individual.emphasis in original.deshaney also left open the possibility that the state may be liable for constitutionally protected rights,even in the absence of a special relationship with an individual,when the state,through its affirmative conduct,creates or enhances a danger for the individual.at.this danger exception applies when the state,through some affirmative conduct,places the individual in a position of danger.see kallstrom city of columbus,cir.
the special relationship exception is not at issue here.however,the danger exception,permitting liability when the state caused the harm or made the victim more vulnerable to an existing harm,is relevant to our inquiry.this exception was not clearly defined by the court in deshaney,but has been developed by the lower courts based upon the court statement in deshaney that 
w hile the state may have been aware of the dangers that joshua faced in the free world,it played no part in their creation,nor did it do anything to render him any more vulnerable to them.that the state once took temporary custody of joshua does not alter the analysis,for when it returned him to his father custody,it placed him in no worse position than that in which he would have been had it not acted at all the state does not become the permanent guarantor of an individual safety by having once offered him shelter.
we adopted the danger theory of liability in kneipp tedder,cir.to state a claim for a civil rights violation under the danger theory,we held that a plaintiff must show the harm ultimately caused was foreseeable and fairly direct the state actors acted in willful disregard for the safety of the plaintiff there existed some relationship between the state and the plaintiff and the state actors used their authority to create an opportunity that otherwise would not have existed for the third party to cause harm.id.at citing mark borough of hatboro,cir.the relationship required by the third element of this test is different than the relationship in the special relationship exception to deshaney.in the context of the danger theory,the relationship requirement implies that there was contact between the parties such that the plaintiff was a foreseeable victim in the tort sense,and not in the custodial sense because the state has deprived the individual of the liberty necessary to care for himself.id.at.
determining the appropriate lens through which we must view actions in the danger context,though,is a vexing problem.see ziccardi city of philadelphia,cir.the supreme court has specifically pointed out that the due process clause is not implicated by an official negligent act.daniels williams,d.additionally,the court has instructed that deliberate indifference is the necessary standard in order to establish liability of a municipality.city of canton harris,d.i ndefensible passivity,and nonfeasance do not rise to the level of a constitutional violation,middle bucks area vocational technical,cir en banc.in light of these holdings,we have required a plaintiff to show that a state actor acted with deliberate indifference to a known or obvious danger.morse lower merion school,cir.we first explained that there is little difference between the terms deliberate indifference,reckless disregard,or reckless indifference.morse,at.each of these terms requires a state official action that falls somewhere between intent and negligence.id.
in fagan city of vineland,cir fagan ii,sitting en banc we rejected the reckless indifference standard and further defined the substantive component of the due process clause,instructing that it can only be violated when state conduct amounts to an abuse of official power that shocks the conscience.at.the fagan ii litigation involved a police chase that resulted in the serious physical injury to,and death of,civilians.in kneipp,we recognized the somewhat narrow holding of fagan ii,where we held that the fagan ii shocks the conscience standard is limited to police pursuit cases,and accordingly,we are not bound to follow that standard in the case before us which involves the police leaving a drunk woman alone to walk home on a cold night.at.
the same year that we issued our opinion in morse,the supreme court issued its decision in county of sacramento lewis,d.the issue before the supreme court in lewis was whether a police officer violated the fourteenth amendment guarantee of substantive due process by causing death through deliberate or reckless indifference to life in a automobile chase aimed at apprehending a suspected offender.id.at.the court noted the difference between state action that deprives an individual of constitutional rights and state action that is merely tortious or negligent i t should not be surprising that the constitutional concept of conscience shocking duplicates no traditional category of fault,but rather points clearly away from liability or clearly toward it,only at the ends of the tort law spectrum of culpability.id.at.the supreme court held that in such circumstances,only state conduct that is shocking to the conscience will suffice.the supreme court was referring to high pressure situations where state actors must act quickly when it established the shocks the conscience standard in such circumstances.id.at.
in miller city of philadelphia,cir,a social worker allegedly wrongfully removed two children from a parent suspected of child abuse.citing lewis,we held that to establish liability,a state official action must be so or malicious that it shocks the conscience.at.we applied the shock the conscience standard in miller because although a social worker normally did not have to act in a hyperpressurized environments like a prison riot or chase he or she will rarely have the luxury of proceeding in a deliberate fashion.id.at.then,in ziccardi,we stated that our decision in miller mandates a standard at least something more than subjective deliberate indifference in circumstances requiring somewhat urgent state action.ziccardi,at emphasis in original.ziccardi involved a law suit brought by a quadriplegic who alleged that paramedics caused his quadriplegia by mishandling him after an accidental injury.our opinion in ziccardi stopped short of requiring a shocks the conscience standard in all substantive due process cases,however.
we derive from these cases the principle that the shocks the conscience standard should apply in all substantive due process cases if the state actor had to act with urgency.this has been the law for police pursuit cases,see,fagan ii,and,social workers when they are acting with urgency to protect a child,see,mil
