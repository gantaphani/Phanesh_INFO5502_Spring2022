opinion of the court 
karen overall is a faculty member at the university of pennsylvania penn veterinary school.she and her husband brought this action against penn,alleging defamation and fraudulent misrepresentation,among other things.the district court granted summary judgment for penn on all counts,and overall appealed.because the district court incorrectly held that statements made in a private internal university grievance proceeding were and therefore entitled to an absolute privilege against defamation under pennsylvania law,we reverse and remand with respect to overall defamation claim.we affirm on all other counts.
this case stems from the veterinary school failure to hire overall for a newly created faculty position.overall worked for penn in various capacities since.in early,she was serving a appointment as a lecturer in the school department of clinical dcs,where her responsibilities included running a behavioral medicine clinic,teaching,and conducting research.gail smith,a male professor who had taught at penn since the early,became chair of dcs in march.until smith became chair,smith and overall rarely interacted.
once smith became chair of dcs,he and overall developed an amicable relationship.see joint appendix app.at overall admits during a deposition that w e were friends id.at overall writes smith in june we are making incredible progress,but that all your doing,none of mine.id.at overall writes smith in july y ou are actually doing a heroic thinks so.many,many thanks.overall approached smith to discuss her desire to obtain a tenured faculty position,her problems with her residents and staff,and other administrative concerns.this friendship prompted several university insiders to suggest that smith was overall personal champion within dcs.
in april,smith announced that the veterinary school would create five new clinical educator positions on the penn faculty.one of these would be in overall field of expertise,behavioral veterinary medicine although clinical educators are not eligible for tenure,they are typically awarded longer term contracts than lecturers like overall,and the positions are considered more prestigious.based on smith friendship with overall and her apparent interest in the job,many within the department surmised that smith created the position specifically for overall.see app.at.
despite these rumors,smith followed protocol and set up a faculty search committee with five members,three of whom had experience with behavioral veterinary medicine.see app.at.smith charged the committee with the task of picking the best qualified candidate from all the applicants.app.at,smith told the committee that he wanted a real search versus a sham search that simply gave the job to overall.
the committee had the authority to make recommendations,but smith retained the power to ignore or veto any recommendation,with or without cause.see app.at.nevertheless,it is common practice at penn for department chairs to follow the recommendations of their hiring committees.in fact,in some departments,it is apparently considered a sort of administrative suicide for a chair not to follow the faculty advice in hiring.see app.at.overall husband,a penn faculty member for more than years,stated in a deposition that in our department,the chair never would override the decision of the faculty.app.at.overall produced no evidence that any chair has ever overruled a hiring committee in the veterinary medicine department.
upon learning of the new clinical educator position,overall applied and asked smith to put odds on her application.he responded i work it out.app.at.at the time of this discussion,overall was not aware that smith technically had the authority to overrule the search committee decision 
the search committee did not share smith confidence in overall.it unanimously rejected her candidacy twice,first in a may,interim report,and then again in a september,final report.both times,the committee provided reasons for its decision not to recommend overall.it acknowledged her strengths but also cited serious reservations about her history of unsuccessful interpersonal interaction,her questioned integrity,and a poisoned atmosphere which pits karen against her staff.app.at.smith elected not to overrule these recommendations.
over the period of one year,the search committee considered six candidates,five females and one male.its final recommendation was in favor of ilana reisner,a woman.once penn hired reisner for the job that overall desired,smith revoked overall clinical privileges,based on an agreement that they had allegedly made earlier when overall continued working at the clinic,smith confronted her and demanded that she not return.in march,after reports that files were missing from the clinic,padlocks were placed on the clinic door.overall says she was not able to return to the clinic,even to gather her personal belongings.she also alleges that her mail was not forwarded.smith claims that he knew nothing about this.
on november,overall instituted a proceeding under the university faculty grievance procedure,alleging gender discrimination,among other things.smith testified in connection with this grievance,giving unsworn testimony that provided the basis for overall subsequent defamation claims.he made three allegedly defamatory statements.first,he stated that it was common knowledge that overall was represented in publications as having a years before she actually received one.second,he claimed that overall represented numerous articles in her cv as peer reviewed,even though they were allegedly not peer reviewed,as that term is understood in academia.finally,smith suggested that overall misused grant funds earmarked for clinical work.ultimately,the university and smith were found innocent of any wrongdoing.
unsuccessful in her grievance proceeding,overall filed a claim with the pennsylvania human rights commission phrc and with the equal employment opportunity commission.the phrc elected not to take action in her case,issuing a right to sue letter on december overall federal complaint asserted causes of action.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of penn on all counts.overall of pennsylvania,wl.
overall raises four issues on appeal.she maintains that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment in penn favor on the defamation,fraudulent misrepresentation,retaliation,and employment discrimination claims.we address each in turn.
we turn first to the defamation issue.the district court found that all of smith allegedly defamatory remarks took place during penn internal grievance proceedings relating to overall discrimination claims.overall,wl at.quoting binder triangle publ ns,the district court correctly noted that a ll communications pertinent to any stage of a judicial proceeding are accorded an absolute privilege which can not be destroyed by abuse.acknowledging that penn internal grievance proceedings were not actually judicial,the district court held that they were and therefore entitled to the same absolute immunity as regular judicial proceedings.
in reaching this conclusion,the district court relied on the pennsylvania superior court decision in milliner enck,which states 
the judicial proceeding wherein absolute privilege attaches has not been precisely defined in our commonwealth.however,it has been defined to include any hearing before a tribunal which performs a judicial function,including many administrative officers,boards and commissions,so far as they have the powers of discretion in applying the law to the facts which are regarded as judicial or in character.
the district court translated this language into a rule that any proceeding that applies facts to law deserves status.it wrote 
in this case,the purpose of the grievance proceedings was to gather the facts and determine whether those facts supported overall claim for discrimination and harassment.if the facts had supported overall claims,smith would have been disciplined.this application of the facts to overall claims was clearly in character.therefore,the statements made by smith during the grievance proceedings are absolutely pr
