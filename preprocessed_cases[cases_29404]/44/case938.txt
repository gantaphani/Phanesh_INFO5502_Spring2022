john karedes was the manager of a public golf course undergoing renovations in the village of endicott,new york the village.some of the renovations were to be paid for by the village and some by a local charity that hosts a professional golf tournament at the course.it is alleged that karedes invoices sent by contractors who were confused about which entity to bill for what and sent to the village for payment some invoices that were mistakenly issued to the charity.after a financial audit of the village criticized such irregularities among other loose practices,local media coverage of the audit included the report that the village suffered loss by paying invoices directed to it by karedes.
karedes commenced an action in the united states district court for the northern district of new york scullin,pleading claims under new york law for libel against binghamton press company and gannett,owners of the press collectively,the press,and for defamation against the ackerley group,wivt news channel,and wbgh news channel collectively,news channel.karedes appeals from the dismissal of his claims on the pleadings.
the district court granted the motions to by press under rule b and by news channel under rule c on the ground that the reports at issue were substantially true and therefore not defamatory.we conclude that a reasonable jury could find the reports to have defamatory meaning,and to be false.
background 
because karedes claims were dismissed on motions addressed to the pleadings,the following facts are drawn from the complaint and the documents on which it relies.see lentell merrill lynch,cir.
the village retained karedes in to manage its public golf course,the en joie golf club the golf club.the golf club hosts a pga tour event called the open,which is sponsored by the broom county communities charities bccc pursuant to a contract between the village and the bccc.
in,the bccc requested and received village approval for certain golf club improvements that were deemed needed by the pga tour and that bccc undertook to fund.while that project was underway,the village decided to make additional improvements,at its own expense.the village paid by check for materials and services used in its own improvements each such check was drafted by the village treasurer,and approved by the village board of trustees board,on the basis of invoices.all such payments were first reviewed and approved by karedes.
the golf club and the renovations became the focus of public and political controversy.in the period from to,while both the bccc renovations and the village renovations were ongoing,the golf club operated at a loss.in february,after mayor michael colella was sworn in,the village golf advisory committee issued a report entitled john karedes budget information,which stated that between and the golf club was more than million over budget.soon after,the board nevertheless extended karedes management contract,but mayor colella refused to sign it.instead,at the mayor request,the board commissioned an independent audit of the golf club accounting.according to karedes,mayor colella then embarked on a long,continual campaign to destroy karedes reputation and standing in the community by intentionally and repeatedly making false accusations and invited the district attorney to investigate karedes contract.
the audit,which was performed by piaker lyons,was released at a february,public town meeting.the audit identified several problems with the village management of the golf club,including that t he village paid invoices billed to and addressed to another entity.this criticism was supported by the following particulars 
in september,the village of endicott owner and broome county community charities,open contractor entered into an agreement for the reconstruction of the village golf course.pursuant to this agreement,t he village was to incur none of the expenditures associated with the reconstruction except for providing the contractor with engineering services however,during the reconstruction period,it appears that the village paid three vendors over for invoices billed to bccc.
other invoices from two of the vendors discussed above were billed to the village.based on the village of endicott superintendent of public work review of these it appears that the work performed by the vendors is similar to the work indicated in invoices billed to.open and paid by the village.
the village procedures require the village official originating a claim voucher to sign the claim voucher for approval and submit the invoice for approval for payment by the board of trustees.the claim vouchers and related invoices discussed above,with a few exceptions,were approved and submitted for payment approval by the golf department management consultant karedes.however,pursuant to the management consultant agreement,the consultant was to only prepare bills and accounts payable and submit to the village treasurer officer for approval.
the village paid invoices that may not be obligations of the village.
village officials may wish to review all invoices during the audit period to determine if any expenditures were not the responsibility of the village.
the audit also listed i nvoices billed to bccc open and paid by village amounting to and o ther related invoices amounting to,but noted that of those invoices were determined by the village to be the responsibility of the village.finally,the audit concluded that some projects were not sent out for competitive bidding,as a result of which t he village may have overpaid for goods and services,which were not received or received in an unacceptable condition or not related to golf department operations.
kenneth coleman,a piaker lyons auditor,was present at the february meeting to field questions.mayor colella asked about bills that were paid by the village for other people,and coleman assured the mayor that there was no finding that the village paid money owed by anyone else 
let me correct that.i said that those bills were invoiced to and addressed to somebody else but i did not say that those bills were necessarily somebody else bills,and i do want to leave anybody with the impression that we come to that conclusion.in fact,it has been indicated to us that the error was that the bills were not sent back to the vendors and the vendors,had they been sent back,would have corrected them and appropriately sent them to the village of endicott.we are not in a position to pass judgment one way or the other on that,but the record to us is clear that those bills are not in the name of the village and therefore we have treated them as a question of costs.
representatives of the press and news channel witnessed these comments.
karedes claims are based on two reports concerning the audit published shortly after it was released i a february,press article,entitled taxpayers footed open bills and ii a february,news channel broadcast.
at a board meeting on february,one trustee cited the results of the piaker and lyons audit and what i read in the sunday edition of the press and sun bulletin and,based on those sources,made a motion to fire karedes.karedes contract was terminated in march without further deliberation,and karedes he further alleges was subject to public ridicule and scorn following his termination.
karedes filed suit in september.the press moved to dismiss pursuant to rule b,and news channel moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to rule c.the district court granted both motions,ruling insofar as is relevant to this appeal i that the february,article was neither capable of defamatory meaning nor false,and alternatively was protected as a privileged publication under new york civil rights law section,see karedes village of endicott,d and ii that the february,broadcast was neither capable of defamatory meaning nor false,see karedes village of endicott,wl,dist.lexis.
discussion 
we apply a de novo standard of review to the grant of a motion to dismiss on the pleadings,accepting as true the complaint factual allegations and drawing all inferences in the plaintiff favor.demuria hawkes,cir see also tarshis riese,cir.the test for evaluating a motion for judgment on the pleadings is the same as that applicable to a motion to dismiss under fed.civ.proc.b.irish lesbian gay org.giuliani,cir see also demuria,at.because we conclude that karedes has alleged facts that would permit a reasonable jury to find the elements of defamation under new york law with respect to both the february,article and the february,broadcast,we vacate the judgment.
the gravamen of an action alleging defamation is an injury to reputation.the new york court of appeals has defined a defamatory statement as one that exposes an individual to public hatred,shame,obloquy,contumely,odium,contempt,ridicule,aversion,ostracism,degradation,or disgrace,or induces an evil opinion of one in the minds of persons,and deprives one of confidence and friendly intercourse in society.celle filipino reporter,cir quoting kimmerle evening journal,see also robert sack,sack on defamation ed.
for purposes of this appeal,karedes concedes that he was a public figure and that the relevant publications addressed matters of public concern.a public figure claiming defamation under new york law must establish that the statements complain ed of were of and concerning the plaintiff,likely to be understood as defamatory by the ordinary person,false,and published with actual malice.church of scientology int l behar,cir.
of these inquiries,the first two should ordinarily be resolved at the pleading stage,while resolution of the falsity and actual malice inquiries typically requires discovery.see also celle,at whether particular words are defamatory presents a legal question to be resolved by the courts in the first instance.quoting aronson wiersma.however,where the words can be construed as having more than one meaning,only some of which are potentially defamatory,it is for a jury to select among those meanings 
if the words are reasonably susceptible of multiple meanings,some of which are not defamatory,it is then for the trier of fact,not for the court acting on the issue solely as a matter of law,to determine in what sense the words were used and understood.

the new york court of appeals has developed standards that federal courts follow in determining whether a statement or publication is defamatory,celle,at 
first,the court of appeals has repeatedly instructed that courts must give the disputed language a fair reading in the context of the publication as a whole.challenged statements are not to be read in isolation,but must be perused as the average reader would against the whole apparent scope and intent of the writing.
second,courts are not to strain to interpret such writings in their mildest and most inoffensive sense to hold them nonlibelous.a fair reading controls.
finally,the words are to be construed not with the close precision expected from lawyers and judges but as they would be read and understood by the public to which they are addressed.it is the meaning reasonably attributable to the intended reader that controls.

as to actual malice 
despite its name,the actual malice standard does not measure malice in the sense of ill will or animosity,but instead the speaker subjective doubts about the truth of the publication.if it can not be shown that the defendant knew that the statements were false,a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant made the statements with reckless disregard of whether they were true or false.the reckless conduct needed to show actual malice is not measured by whether a reasonably prudent man would have published,or would have investigated before publishing,but by whether there is sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.
church of scientology,at see also masson new yorker magazine,d actual malice should not be confused with the concept of malice as an evil intent or a motive arising from spite or ill will.sack,supra,at actual malice relates to whether the defendant published without believing the truth of the publication.

whether a story is fabricated or is based wholly on an unverified,anonymous source,whether the defendant allegations are so inherently improbable that only a reckless person would have put them in circulation,or whether there are obvious reasons to doubt the veracity of the informant or the accuracy of his reports.

on february,the press reported the results of the golf club audit in a story headlined taxpayers footed open bills.the salient passages of that article are set out at the length necessary to reflect the legally significant context,with emphasis supplied for the passages karedes specifically cites as libelous 
a prominent sidebar outlines how endicott picked up the tab,with photographs of karedes,alexander,and the golf club,and bills addressed to the bccc that were paid by the village at karedes direction with passages projected and blown up.the sidebar calculates that t he vouchers karedes authorized and the village paid cost each man,woman and child in endicott roughly.next to karedes photograph is a squib giving his role some of the vouchers karedes signs are for bills addressed to the open for work that auditors said was supposed to be done by bccc.
the body of the article,running along the sidebar and onto two inside pages,states that the golf club renovations should not have cost taxpayers a dime,but did 
now auditors estimate the village shouldered more than of the cost.it paid to rent backhoes and plant grass.it signed checks to contractors who were pouring concrete and others who were delivering gravel,even though many of the bills were addressed to bccc,which runs the open and had agreed to fund the work.
why endicott paid the bills is unclear.former officials say the payments were authorized by village lawmakers others insist they should never have been paid in the first place.the village records are so sloppy that neither side can say for certain which of them is right.
but how the village paid bills addressed to someone else is no mystery.john karedes,who has a management consultant agreement with the village to run its golf course,signed voucher after voucher that effectively passed the cost on to taxpayers.two of the bills he signed away were addressed to the man who runs bccc,alex alexander.
in the last two years alone,karedes signed more than a dozen vouchers that prompted the village to pay at least worth of bills addressed to the open,a review of endicott financial records shows.
village officials had countless chances to step in and stop the bills from being paid.but a stack of cashed checks and signed invoices shows that they did.
the newspaper gave karedes an opportunity to comment,but he did not help himself much could it have been done better there were obviously some system problems,and i sure improvements could be made but those are system problems.it not just me and it not just the golf course.however,the article observes that 
what the audit does not say is that the common thread among many of what it called the golf course most serious problems is karedes signature.he is the one who asked the village to pay bills addressed to the open and never sought bids to keep the cost down,records show.
the article further reports that the press had examined dozens of bills,vouchers and checks that were singled out by accountants at the auditing firm,and turned up the following 
on one day in may karedes signed away more than in bills addressed to the open.one of the bills was for excavating the bccc promised to do with its own money when it inked its deal to buff the golf course that month,karedes passed along almost in bills addressed to the open 
i n late may and early june of,karedes signed worth of bills with alexander name on them.village paid those bills,too.
taxpayers paid again in june,when in one day,karedes signed a pair of open bills including one bill for seeding grass,work auditors said should have been paid for by bccc.but again,taxpayers were left to pick up the tab.
the article reported on karedes account of what happened 
karedes would not discuss the specifics of the invoices he signed over to the village.but he said much of the work he agreed to pay for was done at the behest of village officials,including former mayor david archer,who viewed bccc work on the golf course as a good opportunity to finish some of the village own renovations.
karedes said it is possible that the contractors,all of whom also were doing work for bccc,addressed invoices meant for the village to the open by mistake.
if there were questions about bills he signed,karedes said,they should have been brought to him by kilbury,whose job it was to review the vouchers and invoices he billed to the village.all of the payments had to be approved by kilbury department and by the board of trustees before the village put a check in the mail.
no checks were written by me,karedes said.i followed the procedures that were given to me in.if i knew a bill was the village,that what i paid.we looked at the job description to see who the work should have been charged to.
he admitted,though,that he never asked endicott attorney or anyone else in the municipal building to clarify what work,if any,he should pay for and what work had to be funded by bccc under its contract with the village.
the district court dismissed karedes libel claim against the press,citing karedes admission that he signed vouchers which were addressed to entities and passed these vouchers along to the village for payment and concluding that the article is not reasonably susceptible to a defamatory meaning because what it says is true.karedes endicott,d at.we conclude that this ruling was error.
defamatory meaning 
the february,article can be read to say that karedes arranged for the village to pay expenses that the village incurred but that were reflected in invoices erroneously directed for payment by bccc.even so,this reading would suggest that karedes conducted his official duties in a casual and irregular way that exposed him to just criticism by the village outside auditors and exposed the village itself to controversy and scandal.this reading would tend to impair karedes reputation,and might cause him to lose his job.but as the district court ruled,all that was true.
however,there is another fair reading of the article as a whole that the audit found karedes responsible for arranging for the village to pay expenses that were the obligation of bccc.the headline of the audit story is taxpayers footed open bills,which conveys an initial impression to the public that the village made gratuitous payments.the same impression is conveyed by the sidebar undertaking to explain how endicott picked up the tab,and it is reinforced elsewhere in the text 
despite the golf course pledge that the renovations would not cost taxpayers a dime,auditors estimate the village shouldered more than of the cost.
according to the story,the audit assigned some or all of the responsibility to karedes 
karedes signed voucher after voucher that effectively passed the cost on to taxpayers.
the vouchers karedes authorized and the village paid cost each man,woman and child in endicott roughly.
some of the vouchers karedes signs are for bills addressed to the open for work that auditors said was supposed to be done by bccc.
karedes signed bills for seeding grass,work auditors said should have been paid for by bccc.but again,village taxpayers were left to pick up the tab.
these passages and others,in the context of a scandal regarding the misappropriation of public funds and the mayor challenges to karedes conduct,may be said to have exposed karedes to public hatred,shame,obloquy,contumely,and odium.celle,at.in particular,karedes alleges a causal link between the february,article and the termination of his contract with the village,as well as instances of public ridicule and scorn.
the article defamatory tendency is not wholly offset by the giving of karedes side of the story.karedes denials and explanations may blunt,but do not correct,the statement that is arguably made and that may be untrue that one finding of an independent audit commissioned by the village was that karedes caused the village to pay large sums on behalf of a private interest.see celle,at if the words are reasonably susceptible of multiple meanings,some of which are not defamatory,it is then for the trier of fact,not for the court acting on the issue solely as a matter of law,to determine in what sense the words were used and understood.internal quotation marks omitted.
a reasonable jury could likewise conclude that the february,article was false.the auditors did not find that karedes caused the village to pay for the bccc expenses.though that inference could be drawn by a reader of the text,it was expressly disclaimed by the auditor in the press conference that it is alleged was attended by the press.
the text of the audit references an agreement for bccc to pay for improvements at the golf course and recites that,p ursuant to this agreement,t he village was to incur none of the expenditures other than engineering costs,without mentioning the funding of additional improvements by the village.a reporter could therefore logically deduce that the village suffered loss from,inter alia,the following audit findings i it appears that the village paid three vendors over for invoices billed to bccc ii invoices from two vendors were billed to the village for work that is similar to the work indicated on the invoices billed to bccc and paid by the village and iii t he village paid invoices that may not be obligations of the village.on the other hand,some passages in the audit indicate that some of the work on the golf course may have been properly allocable to the village i village officials may wish to determine if any expenditures were not the responsibility of the village emphasis added and ii about of the sums paid by the village were determined by the village to be the responsibility of the village.
karedes is entitled to argue,however,that any such ambiguity was dispelled when piaker lyons representative kenneth coleman expressly disclaimed any finding that the village actually paid for expenses that should have been covered by the bccc,let alone that karedes had caused that to happen 
i did not say that those bills were necessarily somebody else bills,and i do want to leave anybody with the impression that we come to that conclusion in fact,it has been indicated to us that the error was that the bills were not sent back to the ve
