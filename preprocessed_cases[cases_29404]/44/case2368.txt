defendant,greyhound lines,appeals from the district court judgment awarding million in compensatory damages to plaintiff,sharon surles,for injuries sustained while a passenger on one of defendant buses.plaintiff cross appeals from the district court orders limiting discovery and granting in part defendant motion in limine to limit the admissibility of prior incident reports.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court in all respects.
background 
substantive facts 
on october,plaintiff was traveling aboard one of defendant buses from michigan to georgia.also aboard the bus,passenger damir igric igric behaved suspiciously,and the bus driver,garfield sands sands,took notice.the bus made a routine stop in horse cave,kentucky,and from there continued toward manchester,tennessee.during this leg of the journey,igric began walking back and forth up to the front of the bus,asking the driver when the bus would stop next every fifteen to twenty minutes or so.at the bus did not have an barrier next to the driver seat.
sands was driving the bus at an approximate speed of to miles per hour when,without warning,igric attacked him from behind with a box cutter,slitting the driver throat.igric then grabbed the steering wheel.although sands struggled to maintain control of the bus and fought with igric to regain the wheel,igric jumped down over the steering wheel and put his whole body over the steering wheel,covering it trying to get the bus over into the median.at sands finally managed to push igric away from the wheel,but lost control of the bus in the process.the bus careened off the road into a ditch.sands survived both the attack and the crash and,exiting the bus,attempted to get help from drivers passing by.plaintiff sustained permanent injuries to her spinal cord in the crash,which left her a paraplegic.igric did not survive.
procedural facts 
on november,plaintiff brought a diversity suit in district court to recover for personal injuries sustained in the accident.during discovery,plaintiff served defendant with a request for production of any and all documents incident reports generated as a result of any other violent episodes which have occurred on a greyhound bus since,as well as all memoranda or other notes of the defendant which concerns sic terrorist activity,criminal conduct,unruly passengers or decorum or conduct on buses,among other things.at plaintiff later brought a motion to compel production.in an order dated december,the district court narrowed the scope of plaintiff requests and,as to the remaining objectionable requests,directed defendant to specifically set forth the degree of the burden imposed at a later time.defendant later made this showing and,on may,the district court further limited plaintiff requests.
following the completion of discovery,on july,defendant filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of prior incidents on its buses,arguing they lack the requisite substantial similarity to be admissible.at the district court granted in part and denied in part defendant motion,providing for the admissibility of incident reports for incidents occurring between october,and october,which involved a passenger assaulting or attempting to assault the driver or grabbing or attempting to grab the driver,the steering wheel or the brakes,on a moving bus.at pursuant to the district court order,plaintiff introduced reports of incidents on defendant buses.
additionally,on july,defendant filed motions in limine to exclude the opinions and testimony of plaintiff proffered expert witnesses under.and daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d.the district court granted the motions only insofar as it barred expert testimony on the foreseeability of the attack,but denied the motions in all other respects,on august.
at trial,defendant elicited testimony on from plaintiff expert,lance watt,that no local,state,or federal regulation required driver shields enclosures in passenger buses,and that no commercial bus lines had installed driver shields as of october.at on this basis,defendant requested a jury instruction on state of the art principles.the district court declined to so instruct the jury.
at the close of trial,which lasted seven days,the jury found for plaintiff,holding defendant liable in negligence and awarding million in compensatory damages,with no award of punitive damages.defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law,arguing that plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence of causation.alternatively,defendant also moved for a new trial on the asserted basis that the district court improperly admitted the prior incident reports,improperly allowed expert testimony,and that plaintiff counsel made improper closing remarks on which the court should have instructed the jury.the district court denied both defendant motion for judgment as a matter of law,and for a new trial,on september.
defendant timely appealed to this court and raises several challenges on appeal.specifically,defendant asserts that the district court abused its discretion in admitting plaintiff proffered experts as qualified and finding their testimony reliable,in admitting prior incident reports into evidence,in declining to instruct the jury on state of the art principles,and in denying its motion for mistrial.defendant further alleges the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law.plaintiff,charging that the district court abused its discretion in limiting the scope of discovery and in granting in part defendant motion in limine to limit the admissibility of the prior incident reports.plaintiff further seeks remand and retrial on the issue of punitive damages,which plaintiff believes would follow from introduction of the additional prior incident reports to show recklessness.
discussion 
plaintiff proffered expertsa.standard of review 
we review a district court decision to admit expert testimony,including its decisions about how to determine reliability and its ultimate conclusion,for abuse of discretion.kumho tire carmichael,d jgr,thomasville furniture,cir.in so doing,we reverse only where the district court renders a manifestly erroneous ruling.joiner,d see also conwood,tobacco,cir finding abuse of discretion where the court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment.
expert testimony qualifications and reliability 
defendant brought motions in limine to prevent plaintiff proffered experts from testifying at trial.the district court granted defendant motion in limine insofar as it excluded expert testimony on the foreseeability of the october,incident,but otherwise denied the motions,finding that plaintiff experts were qualified to proffer testimony and that their testimony was reliable.defendant argues that the district court failed to properly apply the daubert framework to the qualifications of plaintiff proffered experts and the reliability of their testimony and thereby abandoned its daubert gatekeeping role.def.br.at we disagree.
qualification of experts 
the federal rules of evidence provide that expert witnesses may only testify where that testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.as a threshold matter,expert witnesses must be qualified to testify to a matter relevant to the case,and a proffering party can qualify their expert with reference to his knowledge,skill,experience,training or education.id.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding plaintiff expert witnesses,robert martin martin and lance watt watt,qualified.martin boasted a law enforcement background,having worked years with the los angeles police department.in his later years on the force,martin founded a threat management unit which,among other things,dealt with managing violently inclined situations of the mentally ill.at now the of a consulting firm,martin has worked with clients in the transportation industry on threat assessment issues,and has overseen the design of threat assessment systems.in his work in the transportation field,he trained employees on interpersonal human aggression and managing violently inclined employees.at although martin does not have threat assessment experience in the bus industry,the district court qualified martin as an expert in threat assessment.
we can not say with definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in evaluating martin qualifications to testify as an expert.see conwood,at.while not specific to the bus industry,martin background and experience leaves him to assist the trier of fact to make sense of the prior incident reports from the perspective of a specialist in threat assessment.martin general experience further enables him to evaluate the sufficiency of defendant driver training.it is of little consequence to questions of admissibility that martin lacked expertise in the very specialized area of commercial bus line threat assessment.see first.bank ass barreto,cir noting the plaintiff unduly narrow approach to defining the central issue at trial and unfamiliarity with some specific aspects of the subject at hand merely affected the weight and credibility of the testimony,not its admissibility see also smith bmw,cir finding abuse of discretion where the district court excluded testimony of an expert witness qualified in a general field merely because that witness lacked expertise more specialized and more directly related to the issue at hand.
defendant also challenges the qualifications of plaintiff second proffered expert.employed as a forensic engineer,watt received his educational training in a mechanical engineering program.his work experience included time in the transportation sector generally,with a specific focus on buses for a period of several years.in fact,sometime in the early,watt designed an barrier to protect bus drivers from attacks by passengers.at at trial,the district judge qualified watt as a b us and heavy truck engineer.at in view of watt background and considering his personal role in designing an barrier to prevent passenger attacks of bus district court did not abuse its discretion in qualifying watt.
reliability under daubert and its progeny 
we further find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in discharging its daubert gatekeeping function.in daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,the supreme court held that scientific evidence proffered by an expert must be relevant to the task at hand and must rest on a reliable foundation.the supreme court subsequently affirmed that daubert principles apply more generally to all expert testimony admissible under rule in kumho tire carmichael,d.the maxims set forth in daubert and kumho tire have since been incorporated in rule,which now permits qualified experts to proffer their expert opinions where 
the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,
the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and 
the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.
in essence,daubert and its progeny have placed the district courts in the role of gatekeeper,charging them with evaluating the relevance and reliability of proffered expert testimony with heightened care.in discharging that role,district courts possess broad discretion to make admissibility determinations.pride bic,cir.
defendant here challenges the district court reliability determination.daubert itself set forth a list of factors to guide district courts in assessing reliability.daubert,at.however,district courts need not adhere to those enumerated factors,as t he inquiry is a flexible one.id.at.indeed,the law grants a district court the same broad latitude when it decides how to determine reliability as it enjoys in respect to its ultimate reliability determination.kumho tire,at.citing joiner,at.as this court has observed,where expert testimony is involved,the daubert factors may be pertinent,or the relevant reliability concerns may focus upon personal knowledge or experience.barreto,at citing kumho tire,at.see also ellis gallatin steel,cir.the gatekeeping inquiry is and must be tied to the facts of a particular case.kumho tire,at.internal citations omitted.
at trial,watt opined that the october attack on defendant driver could have been prevented if the bus had been equipped with an barrier.watt further testified to the feasibility of designing such a barrier,as he himself had previously done.martin rendered an opinion on the sufficiency of defendant risk management training for drivers,and further opined that the prior incidents suggested the need for a barrier between defendant drivers and its passengers.plaintiff experts did not offer scientific expert testimony rather,their testimony constitutes technical or other specialized knowledge.barreto,at.in this context,the factors enumerated in daubert can not readily be applied to measure the reliability of such testimony.see kumho tire,at.barreto,at.
nevertheless,at the pretrial hearing on defendant motions in limine,the district court achieved its fundamental objective to ensure the reliability and relevancy of that testimony.barreto,at.first,it should be noted that the district court ruled that martin and watts could not proffer their opinions on the issue of foreseeability,noting that anybody can give the opinion that it foreseeable if there have been this many incidents.at at the outset,therefore,the court limited the nature of the experts testimony to exclude commentary unnecessary to aid the jury.additionally,the district court heard arguments from counsel for both sides on the reliability of plaintiff proffered experts,and plaintiff highlighted aspects of the experts personal knowledge and experience as it relates to the opinions they ultimately rendered.although the district court did not explicitly probe the rationale for the proposed expert opinions during the hearing,counsel set forth the basis of the proffered witnesses expertise,and directly linked it to the facts of the case.
moreover,the record indicates that the experts adequately explain ed how th eir experience leads to the conclusion reached,why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion,and how that experience is reliably applied to the facts.see.advisory committee note.in his deposition,watt elaborated on his experience designing driver enclosures for seattle transit buses and testified to viewing line haul buses similar to the bus sands drove in october.watt discussed at some length the effect of installing a driver shield on preventing passenger attacks,linking it expressly to the facts of this case.likewise,in his written declaration,martin details his threat assessment experience at length.he further lists the materials reviewed in formulating his opinion,which include defendant prior incident reports,defendant professional driver guidelines,driver handbook,driver bulletin on emergency operations,the deposition transcript of defendant vice president of risk,as well as the testimony of defendant various other personnel.martin expressly states that his opinions were based on his extensive experience and review of the relevant materials.advisory committee notes w hen a law enforcement agent testifies regarding the use of code words in a drug transaction t he method used by the agent is the application of extensive experience to analyze the meaning of conversations.upon review of the record,we can not say with definite and firm conviction that the district court abused its discretion in finding plaintiff experts reliable,and permitting them to testify.see conwood,at.
ii.admissibility of prior incident reports 
standard of review 
we review a trial court decision to admit evidence,such as the prior incident reports,under an abuse of discretion standard.kumho tire,at.jgr,at.an abuse of discretion occurs when the district court relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact,improperly applies the law,or employs an erroneous legal standard.barner pilkington,cir internal citations and quotations omitted.no error in the admission or exclusion of evidence is ground for reversal unless refusal to take such action appears to the court to be inconsistent with substantial justice.prater sears,roebuck,cir internal citations and quotations omitted.
admitting prior incident reports 
defendant filed a motion in limine to exclude its prior incident reports from evidence.the district court granted defendant motion in part,admitting reports for those incidents occurring between october,and october,which involved a passenger assaulting or attempting to assault or grabbing or attempting to grab the driver,the steering wheel or the brakes,on a moving bus.at defendant argues that the prior incidents detailed in those reports were not sufficiently similar to the october,attack,and thus that the court abused its discretion in admitting any of the reports.again,we disagree 
only prior incidents that are substantially similar to the one at issue will be admissible in evidence.rye black decker,cir citing koloda motors parts,motors,cir.this is so in large part because all evidence deemed admissible by the district court must meet the minimal standards of relevancy articulated in federal rules of evidence and incidents which occurred under similar circumstances or share the same cause can properly be deemed substantially similar.rye,at.the proffering party bears the burden of proof to establish substantial similarity.id.a showing of substantial similarity insures that the evidence meets the relevancy requirements of rules and.see id.at.
in the case at bar,plaintiff sought to introduce evidence of prior incidents on defendant buses to show defendant had been on notice of incidents likely to lead to the kind of injury suffered by plaintiff.plaintiff suffered injury when defendant driver lost control of the bus after being attacked by another passenger on the bus,and after that passenger attempted to take control of the wheel.the prior incidents admitted by the district court were substantially similar to the october,incident because they involved either passenger interference with the bus driver,or a passenger attempt to take control of the bus steering wheel or brakes.those incidents therefore occurred under similar circumstances or share the same cause as the october,incident.see rye,at see also morales american honda motor,cir finding the substantially similar requirement satisfied and accident statistics involving minibikes and small vehicles of the same sort admissible because the vehicles perform a similar purpose citation omitted.
defendant attempts to distinguish the prior incident reports by framing the october,incident with great specificity.defendant notes,in its brief on appeal,that,of the incident reports admitted,only five involved incidents resulting in an accident,and none involved armed passengers attacking and seriously injuring a driver.while other circuits have opted to apply a more relaxed standard of similarity where prior accidents are offered to prove notice,we have neither accepted nor rejected this standard in our controlling precedent.rye,at.however,persuasive precedent in this circuit has found that if a prior occurrence is offered to prove notice,a lesser degree of similarity is required provided the accident would have tended to warn the defendant.bryan emerson,wl,at cir unpublished.the bryan court decline d to adopt any fixed definition of the degree of similarity required before prior accidents or occurrences become relevant.id.although we declined to apply a more relaxed standard of substantial similarity in miller norfolk western railway,we did so because the plaintiffs had offered the evidence to show the actual hazardousness of the crossing itself,not merely notice of such hazardousness,and because the context of collision cases requires a higher degree of similarity for prior accidents to be relevant,wl,at cir.april,unpublished.accordingly,it can not be said that the district court misapplied the law in finding the prior incident reports admissible.
limiting admissibility of prior incident reports 
review for abuse of discretion cuts both ways,and we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in limiting the admissibility of prior incident reports.in her,plaintiff contends that the district court abused its discretion in partially granting defendant motion in limine and limiting the prior incident reports admissible in evidence.we disagree.the requirement of substantial similarity facilitates the exclusion of irrelevant evidence under rules and.the relevance of similar incidents depends in part on their proximity in time to the incident at issue in the case before the court see hicks six flags over,cir no abuse where district court excluded evidence of accidents six years before as too remote notwithstanding plaintiff argument that the evidence would have established how long the defendant had been on notice of the danger jones otis elevator,cir because of the potential prejudicial impact of prior accidents,courts have developed limitations governing their admissibility,including that the prior accident must not have occurred too remote in time.consequently,the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding prior incidents more than four years remote in time.see hicks,at incidents six years earlier too remote sue,at five years too remote jones,at incidents months old sufficiently close.
iii.defendant requested jury instruction on state of the art 
standard of review 
an abuse of discretion standard also applies when we review a trial court decision not to give a requested jury instruction.williams ex rel.hart paint valley local sch,cir.the district court abuses its discretion when it relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact,improperly applies the law,or employs an erroneous legal standard.barner,at.
state of the art jury instruction 
defendant asserts that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury on industry standards,which presumably would have allowed jurors to infer that because no line haul bus company in the country had an barrier installed on its buses,def.br.at,defendant should not be held liable for its failure to install such shields.defendant requested instruction stated 
i charge you that greyhound did not manufacture the bus in question,nor is it in the business of manufacturing buses.however,because plaintiff alleges that greyhound should have installed driver enclosures on its buses,plaintiff is arguing greyhound should be held to the same standards as manufacturer of buses.accordingly,greyhound is entitled to the same defenses that a manufacturer is ordinarily afforded in product liability actions.
i charge you that whether greyhound complied with practices,state of the art,or federal regulations regarding bus design,safety procedures and policies,and safety equipment is a relevant question for you the jury to consider in your deliberations.greyhound compliance with the applicable safety regulations and procedures shall raise a rebuttable presumption that the bus design and safety equipment was not in an unreasonably dangerous condition.
i charge you that a manufacturer is not an insurer of the product it designs,and it is not required that the design adopted be perfect,or render the product accident proof,or incapable of causing injury,nor is it necessary to incorporate the ultimate safety features in the product.hence,a departure from the required standard of care is not demonstrated where it is simply shown that there was a better,safer,or different design which would have averted the injury.
at in support of this request to charge,defendant cited county school system united states gypsum,cir,kerley stanley works,and ann.
a district court commits reversible error in refusing to give a jury instruction at a party request where the omitted instructions are a correct statement of the law the instruction is not substantially covered by other delivered charges the failure to give the instruction impairs the requesting party theory of the case.webster edward jones,cir.tennessee law has not required courts to instruct juries on state of the art principles in the negligence context.rather,such instructions have predominantly been given in products liability cases.see,county sch.gypsum,cir boyd celotex,wl,at cir unpublished abbott am.honda motor,proceeding at trial solely on theory of strict liability.indeed,the two cases and the provision of the tennessee code cited in support of defendant requested instruction concern products liability actions.county sch,at kerley,at wrongful death suit predicated upon the theory of strict liability and negligent design ann.establishing presumptions for products liability actions.
although the plaintiff in kerley asserted both product liability and negligence claims,that case does not squarely support defendant requested instruction.the plaintiff in kerley presented a similar negligence claim inasmuch as she alleged that,had defendant installed a ground fault circuit interrupter on an electrical panel box,her husband would not have been electrocuted when using a drill attached to that box.kerley,at.there,the evidence demonstrated growing use of the device at the time of the accident,but also that the device was not uniformly used nor was it a requirement of the national electrical safety code.id.kerley is clearly distinguishable from the case at hand.first,the court in kerley found the installation safe and attributed the injuries to the negligence of the deceased,the plaintiff husband.id.at.clearly,no negligence can be attributed to plaintiff in this case second,in kerley,the defendant was a subcontractor employing the plaintiff,while here defendant is a common carrier that undertook to transport plaintiff as a passenger.common carriers are bound to the utmost diligence which human skill and foresight can effect,and if injury occurs by reason of the slightest omission in regard to the highest perfection of all the appliances of transportation,the carrier is responsible.louisville nashville hutcherson,wl,at.a district court does not err when it declines to give a jury instruction on industry standards not warranted under existing law of the applicable jurisdiction.see webster,at.defendant has cited no law mandating the requested instruction,nor have we found any.
in point of fact,there is no basis in this record deviating from the generally accepted rule that industry standards may be proven as some evidence of care but are not conclusive on the matter.johnson husky,cir see also cherokee ins.blanch,cir citing easterly advance stores,noting that tennessee courts have recognized the principle that there are precautions so imperative that even their universal disregard will not excuse their omission.the same is true of safety regulations,whether promulgated at the federal,state,or local level.compliance with such regulations or in this case,absence of regulation does not relieve one of tort liability for failure to exercise the highest degree of care.city of elizabethton sluder,see also kerley,at while compliance with standards of the national electric safety code is not conclusive as to defendant negligence,there must be evidence in the record from which the jury could find the minimum standards of the code were insufficient under the facts and circumstances of the case.to the extent that industry standards and compliance with safety regulations may factor into a jury consideration of defendant care in operating its bus line,the district court instructions on the duty of care owed by a common carrier to its passengers permit consideration of such evidence see easterly.at customary practice is not ordinary care it is but evidence of ordinary care.
further,the district court instructed the jury on proximate cause,stating plaintiff must show that her injury was a reasonably foreseeable probability,not just a remote possibility,and that some action within greyhound power more probably than not would have prevented the injury.at plaintiff introduced evidence on the feasibility of driver shields precisely to show the likelihood that some action within greyhound power would have prevented the october,accident,and not in support of a products liability claim hinging on the failure to include such shields in defendant buses 
defendant invokes hutcherson in support of its argument that a state of the art instruction was warranted here.in hutcherson,a passenger sued a railroad company for negligence when he fell out an open vestibule door on a moving train,wl,at.there,the court stated,a carrier of passengers is held to the exercise of the highest degree of care and foresight for the passenger safety.this applies to the selection and use of suitable carriages.id.at.although common carriers undertake that the carriages employed are roadworthy and properly constructed,and furnished according to the present state of the art,id.at,mere compliance with the present state of the art does not suffice to relieve common carriers of liability in negligence.common carriers must exercise of the highest degree of care and foresight for the passenger safety,id.at,and where they fail to do if such exercise requires departure from industry jury may find them liable in negligence.we find no abuse of discretion in the district court refusal to instruct the jury as defendant requested.
iv.defendant motion for mistrial 
standard of review 
we review the district court denial of a motion for mistrial for abuse of discretion.united states atisha,cir.additionally,an abuse of discretion standard applies to appellate review of claims that the district court improperly allowed counsel to make inflammatory or prejudicial remarks during closing arguments.salei am.express travel related,wl,at cir,unpublished.the district court abuses its discretion when it relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact,improperly applies the law,or employs an erroneous legal standard.barner,at.
motion for mistrial 
defendant moved for a mistrial on the ground that plaintiff counsel made purportedly improper remarks during closing arguments.counsel acts inappropriately in attempting to introduce extraneous matters before a jury or,by questions or remarks,endeavor ing to bring before it unrelated subjects during closing arguments at trial.city of cleveland peter kiewit sons,cir.where it finds a reasonable probability that the verdict of a jury has been influenced by such conduct,a district court properly sets the verdict aside,and should declare a mistrial.id.to determine whether improper statements or conduct surreptitiously influence a jury verdict,a court must examine,on a basis,the totality of the circumstances,including the nature of the comments,their frequency,their possible relevancy to the real issues before the jury,the manner in which the parties and the court treated the comments,the strength of the case,whether it is a close case,and the verdict itself.id.
looking first to the nature of the comments,the record reflects that during closing arguments,plaintiff counsel reviewed the compensatory damages sought on plaintiff behalf,placing them in three categories of h er past medical bills,her future medical bills,and the pain and suffering.at speaking about plaintiff future medical bills,counsel stated this is very important.this determines what kind of life plaintiff will live the next years of her life,or if she lives those years.this determines whether she has some quality of life and what level.at defendant,on appeal,cites only part of counsel statement and characterizes it as implying that plaintiff life would be shortened if the jury did not return a verdict in her favor.def.br.at taken in the proper context,however,this statement of plaintiff counsel can hardly be deemed prejudicial.nor does the fact that plaintiff future medical expenses would be covered under michigan insurance laws somehow make it prejudicial.see def.br.at counsel statement did not constitute an attempt to introduce extraneous matters or unrelated subjects to the jury.in fact,this statement was directly relevant to a real issue before the jury in this damages.
moreover,counsel subsequent remarks counteracted any arguably prejudicial tint,as he reviewed several options for the jury to consider in a possible compensatory award for future medical care.as an aid to the jury,counsel chose the lowest estimated cost of future care in his calculations and gave the jury the option to increase that number to provide plaintiff with better care.at defendant counsel made no contemporaneous objections t
