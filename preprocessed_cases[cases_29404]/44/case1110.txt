opinion of the court 
haddrick byrd,a prisoner at sci frackville,filed a pro se complaint under in the middle district of pennsylvania alleging that various pennsylvania department of corrections doc employees violated his eighth amendment rights and were negligent under state law.byrd appeals the district court order granting summary judgment to doc employees stanishefski,jack robinson,and spencer on his eighth amendment claims.byrd also appeals the district court decision to decline reconsideration of its order granting a motion to dismiss for doc employees robert shannon and dorina varner.in addition,byrd appeals the district court decision to decline supplemental jurisdiction over his state law negligence claims.
instead of paying a docketing fee on appeal,byrd filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis ifp.we appointed counsel to act as amicus curiae and address the issue of whether byrd was eligible to proceed ifp.thereafter,we initially determined that byrd was ineligible for ifp status.however,after granting amicus petition for panel rehearing,we have decided to grant byrd request to proceed ifp.as such,we will reach the merits of byrd appeal,and we will affirm the district court order granting summary judgment,along with its decision to decline reconsideration of its previous order,and its decision to decline supplemental jurisdiction over byrd state law claims.
at all times relevant to this appeal,byrd was an inmate at sci frackville.byrd pro se complaint of august,named the following defendants robert shannon,the superintendent of sci frackville stanishefski,the corrections health care administrator at sci frackville jack robinson,the supervising nurse at sci frackville spencer,a nurse at sci frackville and dorina varner,the chief grievance officer for the doc.byrd specifically alleges that these doc employees showed deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs by failing to provide him with prescription eye drops for his glaucoma,thus depriving him of his eighth amendment rights and committing negligence under state law.
the relevant events began in early.on january,byrd indicated to spencer that he was experiencing delays in receiving his prescription eye drops,timolol and travatan.on february,byrd informed shannon that he was still experiencing delays in receiving his eye drops.byrd medical records indicate that he was given one month supply of timolol on both january,and february,and that he was given one month supply of travatan on both january,and february.after receiving one month supply of travatan on march,byrd wrote to stanishefski about the delays.on march,robinson responded on behalf of stanishefski as follows 
we can not give you the eye drops if the pharmacy does not send them to us.also you were on the call out on and did not show up for your drops.you are now on the call out for.
byrd was subsequently given one month supply of both timolol and travatan on the following dates over the next five months april,may,may,june,and july.the prescription for byrd eye drops expired on july.byrd did not notify stanishefski regarding the expiration of his prescription until september.the prescription was renewed on september,and byrd was given one month supply of timolol and travatan the next day.however,byrd experienced further delays.on october,byrd wrote to stanishefski about not being called out to pick up his eye drops earlier that week.robinson responded on behalf of stanishefski as follows 
medical does not give you them.we can only give them to you when the pharmacy ships them to us.i will check what the problem is so to try and avoid this in the future.
byrd,on november,filed a grievance regarding the delays.the grievance named shannon,robinson,stanishefski,and varner,but did not name spencer.robinson responded on behalf of stanishefski as follows 
this a summary of my findings regarding your grievance.your concern is you did not receive your eye drops for glaucoma.a review of your medical record reveals your eye drop medication prescription expired on july.you participate in the program.the permits you to be responsible for your health care needs.you never attempted to access sick call when you knew the eye drops had expired.in addition you were also seen by the optometrist three times since july and never requested eye drops from him.you have an eye condition that will require eye drop medication for the rest of your life.i strongly encourage you to be an active participant in your care.this grievance including monetary requests is denied.
byrd was subsequently given his eye drops on the following dates in november timolol,november travatan,december both,and december both.byrd was seen by an optometrist on the following dates in march,april,july,october,october,november,and december.
byrd filed a complaint in the district court on august.he was granted ifp status on september.the district court,on february,granted defendants motion to dismiss in part,dismissing shannon and varner due to their lack of involvement in byrd medical care.on february,the district court granted the remaining defendants motion for summary judgment.the district court specifically held that byrd failed to exhaust his administrative remedies against spencer and that stanishefski and robinson were not deliberately indifferent to byrd serious medical needs.the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over byrd remaining state law negligence claims 
on april,byrd filed a motion to proceed ifp on appeal.that same day,the clerk office notified byrd that he had three strikes under g and had to file a motion showing that he was in imminent danger of serious physical injury in order to be eligible for ifp status.byrd three potential strikes included two actions that were clearly dismissed for failure to state a claim byrd parris,cv,and byrd city of philadelphia,cv.the other potential strike,byrd gillis,ca.cir.july,was an appeal that was dismissed by this court under e b because it was without merit.in response to the notification by the clerk office,byrd did not file a motion alleging imminent danger instead,he submitted a response on april,arguing that the clerk office made a mistake in determining that he had three strikes.byrd noted that,although he brought two prior actions that were dismissed for failure to state a claim,he did not proceed ifp in those actions.
in the january,order appointing amicus curiae,this court instructed amicus to address whether dismissals of actions and appeals can count as strikes under g or whether only ifp actions and appeals can count as strikes.the court also stated that a micus counsel may wish to address the relevance,if any,of the fact that section e and section g use similar phrasing that varies slightly from the language of.b.
on february,amicus requested to expand the scope of its appointment.specifically,amicus sought leave to address whether this court dismissal of one of byrd previous cases,byrd gillis,cir.july,constituted a strike.on march,this court granted in part and denied in part amicus motion to expand the scope of its representation.the court permitted amicus to argue,with respect to byrd gillis,that when an action is dismissed for a reason that is unclear,that dismissal does not count as a strike.
on march,this panel denied byrd motion to proceed ifp,and thus,did not reach the merits of byrd appeal.amicus petitioned for panel rehearing on march.after granting the petition for panel rehearing on april,we now reconsider our previous decision and reach the merits of byrd appeal.
we have jurisdiction over this matter as an appeal of a final decision of the district court.the district court did not address whether byrd eligibility for ifp status was foreclosed by the three strikes provision of g.we now address the g issue.we will also reach the merits of byrd appeal.
in order to determine byrd ifp eligibility,we must decide whether strikes under g can be accrued in actions or appeals where the prisoner has prepaid the filing fee or whether strikes can only be accrued in ifp actions or appeals.section g,enacted as a part of the prison litigation reform act of plra,states 
in no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under this section if the prisoner has,on or more prior occasions,while incarcerated or detained in any facility,brought an action or appeal in a court of the united states that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous,malicious,or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted,unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.
three of our sister courts of appeals have held that strikes may be accrued in actions or appeals regardless of whether the prisoner has prepaid the filing fee or is proceeding ifp.see burghart corr.of,fed.app x,cir hyland clinton,fed.app x,cir duvall miller,cir.no court of appeals has held that strikes may only be accrued in ifp actions or appeals 
this situation presents an issue of statutory interpretation.our task is to give effect to the will of congress,and where congress will has been expressed in language that has a reasonably plain meaning,that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.negonsott samuels,d see also caraco pharm,novo nordisk,d we begin where all such inquiries must begin with the language of the statute itself.if the language of the statute has a reasonably plain meaning,then our sole function is to enforce the statute language.united states ron pair,d.
in determining whether the language of a particular statutory provision has a plain meaning,we consider the language in the context of the entire statute.robinson shell oil,d stating that statutory interpretation focuses on the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole see also abdul akbar mckelvie,cir en banc interpreting one particular section of the plra,g,in the context of the plra as a whole.the plain meaning of statutory language is not conclusive only when the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of the drafters.ron pair,at.
statutory purpose and legislative history may be referenced only if the statutory language is without a plain meaning,if the statutory language is ambiguous.in re phila.newspapers,llc,cir.statutory language is ambiguous only where it is reasonably susceptible of different interpretations.id.quoting passenger atchinson topeka santa fe ry,d.
here,the statutory language has a reasonably plain meaning an action or appeal is not limited to an ifp action or appeal rather,it refers to both ifp and actions or appeals.the three strikes provision,g,does not make an explicit exception for previous actions or appeals where the prisoner was not granted ifp status.see burghart,fed.app x at plaintiff argues that congress did not intend g to apply to prisoners who had not filed their earlier cases ifp.however,g makes no distinction.hyland,fed.app x at section g does not distinguish between prior in forma pauperis actions and prior actions in which the fee was paid.duvall,at section g does not say,brought an action or appeal in forma pauperis,or brought an action or appeal under this section.
we acknowledge that this court,in santana united states,found the phrase civil actions in another part of the plra to lack a plain meaning,cir interpreting b and holding that the filing fee requirements of the plra with regard to civil actions did not apply to ifp habeas corpus petitions and appeals.this court analysis in santana,however,focused on the unique nature of habeas corpus actions.id.at.in contrast to habeas corpus actions,standard actions are not,in effect,hybrid actions whose nature is not adequately captured by the phrase civil action.id.thus,santana does not compel a conclusion that the phrase an action or appeal in g lacks a plain meaning.
the same can be said for grayson mayview state hospital,wherein this court stated that e,which uses language that closely tracks the three strikes provision of g,is limited to ifp actions or appeals,cir although the language of e does not expressly limit the provision reach to in forma pauperis claims,we believe congress intended it to be so limited.we do not find grayson to be controlling.first,the finding in grayson that e applies only to ifp actions or appeals is dicta it was not necessary to the court holding,which was that the district court was required to grant leave to amend before dismissing a pro se inmate action for failure to state a claim.id.at.second,the grayson court based its finding in part on the fact that any alternative interpretation of e would render similar provisions of the plra superfluous.id.at citing benson,cir i f all actions,whether pursued in forma pauperis or not,are to be screened by the district court pursuant to e,the specific prisoner complaint screening provision,would be rendered largely superfluous.in contrast to e,if g were interpreted to encompass actions and appeals,no other provision of the plra,including,would be rendered superfluous.
finally,we acknowledge amicus argument that the language difference between g and rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure is instructive as to the meaning of an action or appeal.section g,just like the ifp specific provision,e,refers to an action that fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted,while rule b refers to an action that fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.amicus argues that this contrast between may and can indicates that congress used may in g as a signal to reference e dismissals,which occur only in ifp actions and appeals,as opposed to rule b dismissals,which occur in both ifp and actions.although this argument is of some persuasive effect,it does not render the phrase an action or appeal to be without a plain meaning.the bottom line remains that congress could have easily differentiated between ifp and actions or appeals in the language of g,but it did not.if congress had intended to make an exception for cases in g,then it more likely would have explicitly done so,rather than merely using the word may instead of can.
thus,strikes may be accrued in actions or appeals regardless of whether the prisoner has prepaid the filing fee or is proceeding ifp,and byrd previous actions,which were dismissed for failure to state a claim,count as strikes for purposes of g.
amicus argues that,even if byrd actions count as strikes,byrd still has only two strikes,rather than three,because this court dismissal of byrd appeal in byrd gillis,cir.july,under e b does not constitute a strike.we agree.
in byrd gillis,byrd brought suit in the middle district of pennsylvania against prison officials in their individual and official capacities for failing to investigate a false misconduct report against him.cv,slip op.at.as a result of the misconduct report,byrd was placed in the restrictive housing unit for days.id.at.byrd alleged that he was subjected to the denial of due process,equal protection under the law,denial of religious practices,retaliation,malfeasance,and misfeasance.id.at.the magistrate granted the defendants motion for summary judgment and concluded that,except for byrd due process claim regarding his misconduct hearing,byrd failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.id.at.in regard to byrd due process claim,the magistrate judge held that byrd placement in the restrictive housing unit did not implicate a protected liberty interest under sandin conner,d.id.at.additionally,in regard to byrd official capacity claims,the magistrate judge concluded that the prison officials were immune from suit.id.at.byrd state law claims were held to be barred under the eleventh amendment.id.
on appeal,this court held that the magistrate judge properly granted summary judgment.byrd gillis,slip op.at cir.july.the court explicitly agreed that byrd failed to exhaust his administrative remedies,that the alleged conduct did not implicate a protected liberty interest,and that the eleventh amendment barred byrd state law claims.id.at.the court ultimately dismissed the appeal under e b because it was without merit.id.at.
