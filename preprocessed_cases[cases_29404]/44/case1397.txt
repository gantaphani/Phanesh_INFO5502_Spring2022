in this qui tam action under the false claims act the fca,defendant agape senior community,and the other defendants collectively,agape are affiliated entities that operate elder care facilities throughout south carolina the relators,brianna michaels and amy whitesides,are former agape employees who allege that agape fraudulently billed medicare and other federal health care programs for services to thousands of patients services that were not actually provided,or that were provided to patients who were not eligible for them.the united states government was entitled,but declined,to intervene.
to establish liability and damages,the relators sought to rely on statistical sampling.the district court determined,however,that using statistical sampling to prove their case would be improper the statistical sampling ruling.additionally,the court rejected a proposed settlement between the relators and agape,because the attorney general of the united states objected to it.in so doing,the court concluded that the government despite not having intervened in an fca qui tam action possesses an unreviewable veto authority over the action proposed settlement the unreviewable veto ruling.
the district court certified both its statistical sampling and unreviewable veto rulings for these interlocutory appeals under b.we thereafter granted the petitions for permission to appeal submitted to this court by the relators seeking an appeal from both rulings and by agape requesting an appeal from the unreviewable veto ruling only.as explained below,we affirm the unreviewable veto ruling and dismiss as improvidently granted the relators appeal as to the statistical sampling ruling.
the fca,codified at,authorizes a private individual,a relator to initiate and pursue an action in the name of the united states government a qui tam action to seek civil remedies for fraud against the government.see b.pursuant to b,the qui tam action may be dismissed only if the court and the attorney general give written consent to the dismissal and their reasons for consenting.
at the outset of the qui tam action,the relator complaint must be served on the government,filed in camera,and kept under seal for at least sixty days,with no service of process on the defendant until the court so orders.see b.during the period after it receives the complaint,the government may elect to intervene in the qui tam action.id.specifically,before the expiration of the period or any extension thereof under b the government must either a proceed with the action by assuming primary responsibility for the action prosecution,or b notify the court that it declines to take over the action from the relator,who will then have the right to conduct the action.id.b a b.if the government declines to intervene during the initial or extended period,the court may nevertheless permit its intervention at a later date upon a showing of good cause.id.c.
once the government intervenes,the relator retains the right to continue as a party to the action,subject to certain limitations.see c.for example,the government is authorized to settle the action over the relator objection,but only if the court determines,after a hearing,that the proposed settlement is fair,adequate,and reasonable under all the circumstances.id.c b.
when the qui tam action is successful,the relator is entitled to share with the government in the award.see d.the amount of the relator share depends on whether the government intervened in the action.if the government did not intervene,the person bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages.id.d specifying that such amount shall be not less than percent and not more than percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement.
here,the relators served their initial complaint on the government and,on december,filed it under seal in the district of south carolina.the district court extended the government deadline for its intervention decision to march.by its notice of that date,the government declined to intervene but called attention to the provision of b,requesting that the relators and agape solicit the attorney general written consent before asking the court to rule on any proposed dismissal.two days later,on march,the court unsealed the complaint and directed the relators to serve it on agape.
the relators filed their operative second amended complaint on march,and discovery ensued although the relators and agape dispute the exact numbers,they agree that agape admitted more than patients to its facilities in south carolina and submitted more than claims to federal health care programs during the relevant time period.the relators sought to use statistical sampling to prove their case in order to avoid the cost of reviewing each patient chart to identify which claims were fraudulent a task that the relators said would take their experts four to nine hours per patient,at a rate of per hour,potentially totalling more than million.for its part,agape opposed the use of any evidentiary form of statistical sampling.thus,the district court received briefing and conducted a hearing on the issue.by order of march,the court made its statistical sampling ruling that based on the facts of this case,statistical sampling would be improper.see united states ex rel.michaels agape senior,cv,at,ecf the march order.
meanwhile,the relators,agape,and the government had mediated unsuccessfully in november,and the relators and agape had mediated again without the government knowledge in january.the proposed settlement between the relators and agape emerged from the second mediation.relying on b,the attorney general objected to the proposed settlement.the government has not,however,sought permission pursuant to c to intervene in this action,thus standing by its initial decision under b to decline intervention.
in objecting to the proposed settlement,the attorney general protested in part that the settlement amount was appreciably less than million,the government estimate of total damages based on its own use of statistical sampling.the various bases for the attorney general objection were stated and discussed during a series of status conferences conducted by the district court in an effort to determine if this action could be settled 
agape eventually filed a motion to enforce the proposed settlement over the attorney general objection,and the government filed a response opposing that motion.by order of june,the district court rendered its unreviewable veto ruling and thereby sustained the attorney general objection to the proposed settlement.see united states ex rel.michaels agape senior,cv,wl june,ecf the june order.the june order also expounded on the statistical sampling ruling that had been made in the march order.additionally,the june order certified sua sponte both the unreviewable veto and statistical sampling rulings for these interlocutory appeals under b.
the district court prefaced its analysis in the june order with a description of the unique dilemma that it faced 
the government,claiming an unreviewable veto right over the tentative settlement in this case,objects to a settlement in a case to which it is not a party,using as a basis of its objection some form of statistical sampling that this court has rejected for use at the trial of the case.
see june order.in rendering its unreviewable veto ruling,the district court rejected the argument supporting the proposed settlement that the relators and agape jointly advanced in reliance on the ninth circuit decision in united states ex rel.killingsworth northrop,cir.their argument was that,because the government had declined to intervene herein,the attorney general objection to the proposed settlement was subject to the district court reasonableness review.the district court instead agreed with the government as well as the fifth circuit in searcy philips electronics north america,cir,and the sixth circuit in united states health possibilities,cir.that the attorney general possesses an absolute veto power over voluntary settlements in fca qui tam actions.in so ruling,the district court explained that it was adhering to the plain language of b,which provides no limitation on the attorney general authority,and no right of a court to review the attorney general objection for reasonableness.see june order.
nevertheless,the district court noted that,if it did have the authority to review an objection by the attorney general for reasonableness in a case of this nature,a compelling case could be made here that the government position is not,in fact,reasonable.see june order.such a compelling case would include that the relators could be looking at an expenditure of between million and million in pretrial preparation alone for a case that the government values at million.id.at.moreover,as the court observed,although the government has admitted that statistical sampling of the entire universe of claims played a major part in its calculation of the value of this case,it resisted with the court reluctant approval discovery requests seeking specific details about its calculation.id.at.
turning to its earlier statistical sampling ruling,the district court spelled out its rationale for concluding that it would be improper to use statistical sampling evidence to prove the relators case.in sum,the court explained that statistical sampling can be appropriate where the evidence has dissipated,thus rendering direct proof of damages impossible.see june order citing example of fca qui tam action where defendant allegedly defrauded government in moving household belongings of military personnel by artificially bumping weight of shipments that had since been completed.here,however,nothing has been destroyed or dissipated the patients medical charts are all intact and available for review by either party.id.at.
finally,in certifying its unreviewable veto and statistical sampling rulings for these interlocutory appeals,the district court observed that the relators and agape face a trial of monumental proportions,involving a staggering outlay of expenses by the relators and a significant drain of court resources.see june order.the court deemed it to be much more judicially efficient to have a ruling on both of the questions before,rather than after,such a monumental trial.id.echoing the requirements of b,the court also stated that each ruling involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion,and that an immediate appeal may materially advance the ultimate termination of this litigation.id.at.because we granted the relators and agape subsequent petitions for permission to appeal,we possess jurisdiction pursuant to b 
we first assess the district court unreviewable veto ruling.because the interpretation of presents a pure question of law,our review is de novo.see united states ex rel.oberg.higher educ.assistance agency,cir.our focus,of course,is on b,which provides in full 
a person may bring a civil action for a violation of the fca for the person and for the united states government.the action shall be brought in the name of the government.the action may be dismissed only if the court and the attorney general give written consent to the dismissal and their reasons for consenting.
b emphasis added.
the question presented the extent of the attorney general power under b to veto the voluntary settlement of an fca qui tam action in which the government declined to intervene is not one that we have heretofore squarely confronted thus,it is helpful to begin with a discussion of the three courts of appeals decisions debated in the district court united states ex rel.killingsworth northrop,cir.searcy philips electronics north america,cir.and united states health possibilities,cir.
in the killingsworth decision,the ninth circuit determined that b provision is limited by b,which delineates the initial or extended period during which the government may elect to intervene,as well as by c,which authorizes the court to permit later intervention upon a showing of good cause.see at.the killingsworth court ruled that the consent provision contained in b applies only during the initial or extended period.id.thereafter,the government authority depends on whether it has intervened,whether the government or the relator is empowered to control the litigation.id.when the government has not intervened,killingsworth merely permits the attorney general to object with good cause to a proposed settlement and obtain a hearing on whether the settlement is fair and reasonable.id.at cobbling standard from c b,c,and other aspects of.
the ninth circuit resolved in killingsworth that the government position that without intervention the attorney general possesses an absolute right to reject a proposed settlement at any time and for any reason can not comport with the plain language of b b,which affords the relator the right to conduct the action once the government has declined to intervene.see at.according to the court,that is because t he right to conduct a qui tam action obviously includes the right to negotiate a settlement in that action.id.for that proposition,the court relied on d,which provides that if the government has not intervened,the person bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive an amount which the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages.the killingsworth decision emphasized the or settling the claim language of d,propounding that it confirms the relator right to settle the action if the government declines to intervene.see at.
the ninth circuit interpretation in killingsworth of was subsequently rejected by the fifth circuit in its searcy decision and the sixth circuit in its health possibilities decision.unlike the ninth circuit,those latter two courts recognized an absolute veto power over voluntary settlements in qui tam fca suits,see searcy,at,under which a relator may not seek a voluntary dismissal of any action without the attorney general consent,see health possibilities,at.
as the fifth circuit explained in searcy,the language of b provision is as unambiguous as one can expect,and there is nothing in to negate that language plain import.see at.in particular,the searcy court confronted those aspects of utilized in killingsworth b b according the relator the right to conduct the action when the government declines to intervene,and d providing a reasonable amount to the person bringing the action or settling the claim.more specifically,searcy refuted killingsworth pronouncements that the b b right to conduct a qui tam action obviously includes the right to negotiate a settlement in that action,and that d confirms the relator right to settle the action if the government declines to intervene.see killingsworth,at.the searcy court expounded that a relator has conducted an action if he devises strategy,executes discovery,and argues the case in court,even if the government frustrates his settlement efforts.see searcy,at.moreover,the court observed that the government power to block settlements does not mean that the relator will never be the person settling the claim.id.
the searcy court further recognized that relators can manipulate settlements in ways that unfairly enrich them and reduce benefits to the government,including by bargaining away claims on behalf of the united states.see at.section b provision,however,allows the government to resist such tactics and protect its ability to prosecute matters in the future.id.along those same lines,the sixth circuit observed in health possibilities that the power to veto a privately negotiated settlement of public claims is a critical aspect of the government ability to protect the public interest in qui tam litigation.the fca is not designed to serve the parochial interests of relators,but to vindicate civic interests in avoiding fraud against public monies.see at.the health possibilities court underscored that t he location of the consent provision in b immediately after the command that the action be brought in the government name suggests that it is an important component of the government ability to regulate qui tam actions.id.at.
notably,the fifth,sixth,and ninth circuits considered the legis
