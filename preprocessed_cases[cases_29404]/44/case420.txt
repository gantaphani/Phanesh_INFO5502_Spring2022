this is an appeal from a summary judgment in favor of puerto rico defendant municipality,arecibo,its mayor and its director of human resources,in a political discharge suit brought by fourteen employees.plaintiffs are members of the new progressive party npp and the individual defendants are members of the popular democratic party pdp,which was restored to power after the election of.the newly elected mayor,frankie,allegedly facing a formidable municipal financial crisis,instigated the termination of many employees,including the plaintiffs.
plaintiffs complaint,seeking both injunctive relief and damages,invoked,and other federal causes of action,as well as several commonwealth provisions.defendants submitted motions for dismissal and summary judgment supported by statements of municipal officers evidencing not only financial stringency but also implementation of a layoff plan devised in contemplation of such an emergency by the prior mayor,an npp member.the district court accepted the recommendations of a magistrate judge that summary judgment be granted in favor of the defendants.
after reviewing the evidentiary state of the record in search of material issues of fact and noting a series of procedural defaults,we affirm the rulings of the district court rejecting belated requests for discovery and concluding that the record is bereft of any evidence of political animus motivating the discharges.we review the former ruling for abuse of discretion,cir,and the latter de novo,rodriguez american int l ins.of puerto rico,cir.
we first consider plaintiffs complaint,which the district court generously characterized as establishing a prima facie case of discrimination.the complaint described plaintiffs as npp activists,who served as npp officers and delegates on election day in and assisted at rallies and meetings during the campaign.their political beliefs were alleged,in conclusory terms,to be known by defendants.the fourteen plaintiffs were described as holding the following positions carpenter,janitor,driver,clerk,secretary,coordinator,receptionist,and worker.
these allegations may very well describe plaintiffs jobs as protected from politically motivated dismissal,see,guillermo rodríguez,cir employees are protected from employment decisions based on political affiliation,but job terminations are not unconstitutional solely because those affiliated with one political party are disproportionately impacted,cir.
in aponte,cir,plaintiffs were described as playing prominent roles in publicly and vocally supporting a former mayor.even so,we acknowledged that,s tanding alone,even the circumstantial evidence that some plaintiffs were especially conspicuous targets for discriminatory employment action by defendants would give us serious pause.and,even more recently,in family dep t,cir,we affirmed dismissal of a complaint,concluding that even though plaintiff was alleged to be a well known supporter of the npp,had held a trust position under the previous npp administration,and defendant had expressed interest in giving her position to a pdp member,this fell short of evidence that defendant knew of plaintiff affiliation.see also,cir statement of pdp mayor of intent to rid town of npp activists insufficient to generate genuine issue of material fact,cir similar.
we note our doubt concerning whether plaintiffs had truly set forth a prima facie case to emphasize that it is at best not a strong one.their task under the analysis applicable to political discrimination cases was to show that their constitutionally protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor for the adverse employment decision.see,at citing healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.assuming their skimpy showing met this standard,the allegations nonetheless lack any specific information that could bulwark a case for rejecting the genuineness of defendants response that they would have taken the same action regardless of the plaintiff political beliefs,id.referring to the healthy defense.
this sets the stage for the critical assessment of defendants proffered justification.after considerable jousting by the parties over service of process and plans for discovery,the court set the date of may,for a status conference.a few days before that date,defendants filed a motion for summary judgment with a statement of uncontested material facts and a motion to dismiss.unaccountably,plaintiffs counsel did not attend the may conference.
this was only the beginning of missed cues.plaintiffs responded on may to the motion for summary judgment only by requesting an extension of time beyond the customary ten day limit to june to oppose the motions.that date passed without any effort to secure a further extension,or to conduct discovery,and without any statement of opposition or opposing statement of material facts,as required by local rules.accordingly,on july,the court referred the case to the magistrate judge for a report and recommendation,which was to be considered unopposed.under the applicable local rule,facts in a statement of material facts,if supported by record citations,are deemed admitted unless properly controverted.see e.
three weeks later,on august,plaintiffs counsel filed a motion for reconsideration of the order of reference.we have looked in vain for any support for such a motion except an appeal for sheer mercy.counsel averred that it was foreseeable that plaintiffs would need additional time beyond june to conclude the discovery but did not explain why preventive anticipatory action was not attempted.counsel had coordinated the tentative deposition of defendant mayor hernández but the undersigner calendar sic during the months of june and july of prevented to do so.finally,the request plaintiffs deserve an opportunity to conduct further discovery it was our mistake not to request an additional extension of time to oppose said motion.
counsel perhaps deserves high marks for candor,but to ask us to find that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to grant this motion is to ask us to use this sad case to make very bad law.counsel for arecibo appropriately calls our attention to justice harlan thought in link wabash railroad k eeping this suit alive merely because plaintiff should not be penalized for the omissions of his own attorney would be visiting the sins of plaintiff lawyer upon the defendant,d emphasis in original.now,if ever,are the teachings of such cases as resolution trust north bridge,cir,pertinent.there,we called attention to the safety valve of.f,which gives a party with an authentic need the opportunity to buy more time to mount an opposition to summary judgment.id.at.but we emphasized that invoking the rule required due diligence both in pursuing discovery before the summary judgment initiative surfaces and in pursuing an extension of time thereafter.id.in addition to due diligence,we added 
when,as is often the case,the reason for a requested extension relates to incomplete discovery,the party explanation must take a special form it should show good cause for the failure to have discovered the facts sooner it should set forth a plausible basis for believing that specified facts,susceptible of collection within a reasonable time frame,probably exist and it should indicate how the emergent facts,if adduced,will influence the outcome of the pending summary judgment motion.
in this case,there was no diligence exercised during the three months of may,june,and july after the motion for summary judgment surfaced.and not only was no good cause shown for failure to have discovered facts sooner,but there was no indication of plausibly hoped for specified facts and the feasibility of their timely collection.we therefore have no alternative but to conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reconsider and grant belated discovery.the magistrate judge therefore properly considered the defendants statement of uncontested material facts as unopposed and,consequently,conceded to be true.
thus guided,the magistrate judge first noted the sworn statement of arecibo finance director stating that as of the beginning of mayor hernández ad
