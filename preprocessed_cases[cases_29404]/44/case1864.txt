erma mccoy,a former lieutenant with the shreveport police department spd,appeals from the district court dismissal of her employment discrimination suit against the city of shreveport the city.we affirm.
facts proceedings 
erma mccoy,a black female,worked for the spd as a permanent police officer from december until her retirement in december.mccoy attained the rank of lieutenant in february.in july,mccoy filed a grievance with spd internal affairs bureau iab alleging that a subordinate officer,sergeant ed jackson,who is white,harassed her by twice throwing paper in her face and by repeatedly entering her office only to stare at her and laugh in mocking derision.as mccoy grievance involved allegations of workplace harassment,spd also forwarded it to the personnel department of the city for its separate review.both the city and spd concluded that sergeant jackson conduct did not constitute harassment,and city personnel recommended that both sergeant jackson and mccoy be counseled about workplace horseplay.
the following month,captain rick walker,mccoy supervisor,informed her that her harassment complaint had not been substantiated and cautioned her against future workplace horseplay.when she received this news and caution,mccoy became extremely upset and questioned the thoroughness with which the spd and the city had investigated her complaint.captain walker told mccoy that she could speak to the chief of police if she was dissatisfied with the way the investigation had been conducted.she declined,however,then began crying uncontrollably,reportedly telling captain walker that she knew it would come back this direction,this way and that the reason why we have violence in the workplace and that if they not going to take care of it,then i take care of it.mccoy denies making this statement but admits that she was in an emotional state and acknowledges telling captain walker that she would not take this lying down.mccoy also remembers captain walker being present later when she told a fellow black lieutenant,who had inquired why mccoy was so upset,that we are not officers,we are not sergeants or lieutenants,but rather we are black officers black sergeants,and black lieutenants,and each time we move up,we become less.mccoy eventually asked to be relieved of duty so that she could see her doctor about the emotional distress she was experiencing.
captain walker consulted with two spd lieutenants who had witnessed mccoy reaction,and decided that,out of concern for mccoy safety and possibly that of others,he should retrieve her gun before she left the police station.mccoy surrendered her gun before leaving work.captain walker then informed spd assistant chief charlie owens of the events surrounding mccoy departure.owens indicated his belief that,because captain walker had taken mccoy gun,he effectively had placed her on administrative or departmental leave.owens instructed captain walker to have mccoy sign the paperwork necessary to process an administrative leave.the next morning,captain walker went to mccoy home,had her fill out the necessary forms,and retrieved her badge.
at some time during the next month,iab reclassified mccoy leave as extended sick leave.captain walker was informed that his and assistant chief owens designation of mccoy leave as administrative leave was a mistake.mccoy was paid her full salary throughout her leave.
in december,mccoy informed the spd that she had decided to retire at the end of the month.she stated that,despite her admiration for the spd leadership and her general desire to continue serving as a police officer,her health considerations would not allow her to go on under the circumstances.specifically,she mentioned concerns about constantly having to face ed jackson,constantly having to look behind my back,constantly having to come in and explain why i did certain things as a lieutenant doing my job.at the time that mccoy submitted her retirement letter,her doctor had not yet released her to return to work,and she still had several months of paid sick leave accumulated.
mccoy filed suit in louisiana state court in august,alleging that the city had discriminated against her on grounds of race and sex and had retaliated against her,both acts allegedly taken in violation of title vii,the first amendment,and louisiana law,and intentionally caused her emotional distress,in violation of louisiana civil code article.the city removed the case to the district court on federal question jurisdiction.the federal court eventually granted summary judgment in favor of the city on mccoy discrimination and retaliation claims,because,inter alia,she had suffered no adverse employment action and the conduct of which she complained was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute a hostile work environment and her louisiana tort claim,because she could not show conduct by the spd that met the legal standard for intentional infliction of emotional distress.mccoy timely filed her notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo summary judgment is proper only when the movant can demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law 
mccoy title vii claimsa.applicable title vii 
assuming a plaintiff has exhausted his administrative remedies he may prove a claim of intentional discrimination or retaliation either by direct or circumstantial evidence.we analyze cases built on the latter,like this one,under the framework set forth in mcdonnell douglas green under that framework,the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination,which requires a showing that the plaintiff is a member of a protected group was qualified for the position at issue was discharged or suffered some adverse employment action by the employer and was replaced by someone outside his protected group or was treated less favorably than other similarly situated employees outside the protected group to establish a prima facie case of retaliation,the plaintiff must establish that he participated in an activity protected by title vii his employer took an adverse employment action against him and a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action 
if the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing,the burden then shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate,nondiscriminatory or nonretaliatory reason for its employment action the employer burden is only one of production,not persuasion,and involves no credibility assessment if the employer meets its burden of production,the plaintiff then bears the ultimate burden of proving that the employer proffered reason is not true but instead is a pretext for the real discriminatory or retaliatory purpose to carry this burden,the plaintiff must rebut each nondiscriminatory or nonretaliatory reason articulated by the employer 
adverse employment action 
the district court based its summary judgment dismissal of mccoy race and sex discrimination and retaliation claims on her inability to demonstrate that she suffered a legally actionable adverse employment action.without proving such an action,mccoy can not make the necessary prima facie cases of discrimination or retaliation mccoy argues on appeal that the court erroneously failed to recognize that the city took adverse employment actions both by creating a hostile work environment that caused her constructive discharge and taking her gun and badge and placing her on administrative leave.
constructive discharge 
a constructive discharge occurs when the employer makes working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable employee would feel compelled to resign.in determining whether an employer actions constitute a constructive discharge,we examine the following relevant factors 
demotion reduction in salary reduction in job responsibilities reassignment to menial or degrading work badgering,harassment,or humiliation by the employer calculated to encourage the employee resignation or offers of early retirement that would make the employee worse off whether the offer were accepted or not 
this inquiry is an objective,reasonable employee,test under which we ask whether a reasonable person in the plaintiff shoes would have felt compelled to resign.
even considering the summary judgment evidence here in the light most favorable to mccoy,we are satisfied that a reasonable employee in her position would not have felt compelled to resign.mccoy was not demoted,suffered no reduction in salary,and was paid in full for the entirety of her leave.she was relieved of her job responsibilities,but only at her own request,and spd never indicated that she would not be reinstated to her previous position when cleared medically to return to work.she was not reassigned to menial or degrading work,and she never received an offer of early retirement.the only actions taken by the spd in connection with this matter were counseling mccoy against workplace horseplay and retrieving her badge and gun and placing her on administrative leave.these actions,when viewed in the context of the circumstances surrounding them,were not calculated by spd to encourage mccoy resignation and do not meet the established standard for a constructive discharge 
mccoy does allege that she suffered badgering and harassment by sergeant jackson and that spd and the city permitted it to go unchecked.such unremediated harassment may create a hostile work environment and cause a constructive discharge,but only if it is severe or pervasive and create s an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive.whether an environment is hostile or abusive depends on the totality of the circumstances,including factors such as the frequency of the conduct,its severity,the degree to which the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating,and the degree to which the conduct unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.
sergeant jackson conduct,even though undoubtedly offensive to mccoy,consisted of little more than occasional boorish remarks and childish horseplay.the district court correctly held that such conduct was not sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment moreover,at the time mccoy chose to retire,sergeant jackson had already left the spd and posed no continuing threat to mccoy mental or level of comfort.mccoy also acknowledged in her retirement letter that she respected and admired the chief of police and that,but for her health concerns,she would look favorably on the prospect of returning to work for the spd.based on the summary judgment record before us,we are convinced that mccoy retired voluntarily,not as the result of a constructive discharge.as no reasonable employee in mccoy position would have felt compelled to resign,she was not constructively discharged.
ii.administrative leave 
mccoy also contends that the spd took an adverse employment action against her when captain walker retrieved her gun and badge and placed her on administrative leave.we have historically held that,for all title vii claims,a dverse employment actions include only ultimate employment decisions such as hiring,granting leave,discharging,promoting,or compensating.under this standard,the district court properly held that placing mccoy on paid administrative or not an adverse employment action in the recent case of burlington northern santa fe railway white,however,the supreme court abrogated our approach in the retaliation context in favor of the standard used in the seventh and circuits,which defines an adverse employment action as any action that might well have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.we must therefore analyze the effect of burlington northern on this case.
mccoy discrimination claims 
in burlington northern,the court expressly limited its holding to title vii retaliation claims 
the underscored words in the substantive provision hire,discharge,compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,employment opportunities,and status as an employee explicitly limit the scope of that provision to actions that affect employment or alter the conditions of the workplace.no such limiting words appear in the provision.given these linguistic differences,the question here is not whether identical or similar words should be read in pari materia to mean the same thing.rather,the question is whether congress intended its different words to make a legal difference.we normally presume that,where words differ as they differ here,congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.
there is strong reason to believe that congress intended the differences that its language suggests,for the two provisions differ not only in language but in purpose as well.the provision seeks a workplace where individuals are not discriminated against because of their racial,ethnic,religious,or status.the provision seeks to secure that primary objective by preventing an employer from interfering through retaliation with an employee efforts to secure or advance enforcement of the act basic guarantees.the substantive provision seeks to prevent injury to individuals based on who they are,their status.the provision seeks to prevent harm to individuals based on what they do,their conduct.
thus,purpose reinforces what language already indicates,namely,that the provision,unlike the substantive provision,is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms and conditions of employment 
even though our precedent recognizing only ultimate employment decisions as actionable adverse employment actions remains controlling for title vii discrimination claims and therefore continues to justify summary judgment dismissal of mccoy discrimination claims her retaliation claims requires a closer look northern.
mccoy retaliation claims 
mccoy contends that,by retrieving her gun and badge and placing her on administrative leave,spd took actions that might well dissuade a reasonable officer from filing a charge of discrimination.mccoy characterizes those actions as the functional equivalent of a discharge,because they remove the essence of being a police officer.the city,on the other hand,contends that spd actions,when viewed in context,do not meet the standard set forth in burlington northern.specifically,the city points out that mccoy voluntarily requested leave,made troubling statements that raised legitimate safety concerns,and was paid throughout her leave.as such,insists the city,actions like spd should not dissuade a reasonable police officer in mccoy situation from making a discrimination complaint.
in burlington northern,the court recognized that arguably adverse employment actions must be viewed in context in this case,the record makes clear that mccoy did ask to leave work to see her doctor acting on her doctor attempted to return to work.there is no evidence that spd would have placed her on administrative leave had she been able to continue working,or that spd would have refused to reinstate her had she sought to return to work after her leave.the record also makes clear,however,that mccoy did not volunteer to surrender her gun and badge and did not designate her own leave as administrative spd made those decisions and took those actions on its own.as mccoy contends that those actions and not her leave generally constitute the adverse employment action in this case,we do not regard her initial voluntary request for leave as foreclosing her retaliation claim.
we are satisfied that mccoy troubling statements have no bearing on whether spd actions constitute an adverse employment action.in the next step of the mcdonnell douglas framework,such statements could affect our assessment of spd motive for its actions,but they are irrelevant to our consideration whether mccoy being placed on administrative leave meets the burlington northern standard for an adverse employment action.
similarly,the mere fact that mccoy was placed on paid administrative leave does not necessarily mean that she did not suffer an adverse employment action.police officers are typically placed on administrative leave,frequently with pay,when they are under investigation or as discipline for wrongdoing.in such cas
