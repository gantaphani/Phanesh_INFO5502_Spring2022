appellee pbm products,llc pbm filed this action pursuant to the lanham act,a,against appellant mead johnson company,llc mead johnson alleging that mead johnson distributed more than million mailers that falsely claimed pbm baby formula products were inferior to mead johnson baby formula products.after a jury found that mead johnson had engaged in false advertising,the district court issued an injunction prohibiting mead johnson from making similar claims.on appeal,mead johnson presents three clusters of issues whether the district court erred in its dismissal of mead johnson counterclaims whether the district court abused its discretion in its admission of expert opinion testimony and evidence of prior litigation between the parties and whether the district court erred or abused its discretion in issuing the injunction.we have fully considered all of the issues presented,and we reject appellant contentions.accordingly,we affirm.
pbm produces,generic,infant formula.mead johnson produces baby formula products under the brand name enfamil,including a standard formula,a formula with proteins,and a formula with added rice starch.both companies use the same supplier for two key nutrients docosahexaenoic acid dha and arachidonic acid ara which are important to an infant brain and eye development.mead johnson calls these nutrients by their brand name lipil,while pbm uses their generic label lipids.both companies use the same level of the lipids.as a result,pbm includes a comparative advertising label on their formula that states,compare to enfamil.
the parties are familiar combatants on the lanham act battlefield.for example,in,mead johnson distributed brochures and notepads to patients in pediatricians offices stating that formula did not have sufficient calcium or folic acid.pbm sued and obtained a restraining order prohibiting mead johnson from making similar statements.pbm products,mead johnson,wl.april.the parties settled that dispute.see pbm products,llc mead johnson,d.then,in,mead johnson distributed a chart to physicians stating that formula did not contain beneficial nucleotides.pbm sued and,again,the parties settled.id.at.
the instant engagement began in,when mead johnson distributed a mailer directly to consumers as part of a new advertising campaign.the mailer focused on mead johnson enfamil lipil infant formula and expressly compared it to store brands.the mailer was distributed to million consumers across the country between june and april.the target audience consisted of parents of two to old infants.the mailer cited studies that compared mead johnson current formula with an older version of the same formula and concluded that the addition of the lipids resulted in improved eye and brain development.specifically,the mailer contained the following statements 
it may be tempting to try a less expensive store brand,but only enfamil lipil is clinically proven to improve brain and eye development.
before you try a store brand of formula,remember that a full year of enfamil lipil goes a long way to nourishing the dreams you have for your little one.
all infant formulas are not the same enfamil lipil formulas offer expert recommended levels of dha and ara.
enfamil lipil unique formulation is not available in any store brand.
there are plenty of other ways to save on baby expenses without cutting back on nutrition.
store brands may cost less,but enfamil gives your baby more.when it comes to nutrition and development,you want a product you can rely on.
in addition,the mailer displayed a checklist stating that enfamil lipil is p roven to result in iq scores similar to breastfed babies and p roven to enhance visual development,while indicating that the store brand does not.finally,the mailer provided a graphic of a duck showing a comparison of visual sharpness where one half of the graphic,captioned with lipil,was clear and the other half of the graphic,captioned without lipil,was blurry.
in april,pbm sued mead johnson alleging false advertising in violation of the lanham act,a a and b,and commercial disparagement.the district court denied pbm request for a temporary restraining order.pbm products mead johnson,wl.may.mead johnson filed counterclaims against pbm alleging breach of contract,defamation,false advertising,and civil contempt.mead johnson defamation counterclaim was based primarily on a press release issued by pbm ceo paul manning declaring that mead johnson lies about baby formula again.mead johnson false advertising counterclaim alleged that labels on pbm products conveyed several implied messages comparing pbm and mead johnson formulas.mead johnson breach of contract and civil contempt counterclaims related to the prior litigation between the parties.
prior to trial,the district court granted pbm summary judgment on mead johnson defamation counterclaim.pbm products mead johnson,d.the district court reasoned that false advertising is substantially synonymous with lying.as such,the district court found the statement in the press release to be substantially true and therefore a bar to the defamation counterclaim.id.
the district court also denied mead johnson motion for summary judgment on pbm claims.pbm products mead johnson,wl at.the court reasoned that laches did not apply because the mailer was significantly different from mead johnson prior advertising.the court reasoned that because the mailer made stronger and more direct arguments related to the efficacy of store bought infant formula than prior ads and had a new tone and point that was absent from prior campaigns,it was sufficiently different so that laches did not apply.id.at.
also prior to trial,the district court denied mead johnson motion to exclude the testimony of two pbm experts,joseph ridgway and douglas schoen.pbm products mead johnson,wl.ridgway conducted a survey showing consumers received two implied but false messages from the mailer.similarly,schoen conducted a survey showing that the mailer would dissuade consumers from purchasing store brand formula.for both surveys,mead johnson argued that the methods used were unreliable and that the surveys failed to sample the proper group because they included parents of infants older than the targeted olds.the district court rejected both arguments and concluded that while the survey sample may not exactly match the audience that received the disputed advertisement,it is a sufficiently close approximation of the recipient pool.id.at.
during discovery,pbm limited its case to the literal and implied false claims communicated by the mailer.specifically,the claims in question by the time of trial were two express statements contained in the mailer and two implied statements.the two express statements were mothers who buy store brand infant formula to save baby expenses are cutting back on nutrition compared to mead johnson enfamil and only enfamil has been clinically proven to improve infants mental and visual development.the two messages implied by the mailer were enfamil contains two important fatty acids,dha and ara,and pbm store brand formulas do not and enfamil has been clinically tested and shown to be superior to pbm formula with respect to brain and eye development in infants.
at trial,the district court permitted pbm to introduce evidence concerning the parties prior litigation.specifically,the court admitted testimony about the prior false and misleading advertisements and the fact the parties settled the prior litigation.however,the court excluded evidence regarding the settlement amounts.
at the close of mead johnson case on its lanham act counterclaims,the district court granted pbm motion for judgment as a matter of law and dismissed the claims based on statute of limitations,laches,and deficiencies in the merits.pbm products mead johnson,wl.march.the district court concluded that the statute of limitations barred mead johnson false advertising claim concerning pbm routine and gentle formula for all ads prior to may.pbm products mead johnson,wl,at.for allegations concerning ads for routine and gentle formula products issued after may,the court concluded that laches barred mead johnson false advertising counterclaim.id.at.as to mead johnson false advertising claim regarding pbm rice starch formula,the district court concluded mead johnson failed to prove falsity or loss causation.id.at.
on november,the jury returned a general verdict on pbm claim,finding that mead johnson engaged in false advertising in violation of the lanham act and awarded pbm million in damages.on december,the district court issued an injunction without making any of the findings required by ebay mercexchange.after a challenge by mead johnson,the district court stayed the injunction to permit full briefing.after briefing and a hearing,the district court issued a new injunction,which enjoined all four advertising claims,including the express claim that only enfamil lipil is clinically proven to improve brain and eye development.the district court concluded that the injunction applies to all advertising or promotional material or statements going forward.pbm products mead johnson,wl,at.march.mead johnson timely appealed.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to.
we first address mead johnson contention that the district court erred in rejecting its defamation counterclaim and its lanham act counterclaims as a matter of law.
mead johnson argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of pbm on mead johnson defamation claim.we review de novo whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment,viewing the facts and drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to mead johnson.georgia pacific consumer products von drehle,cir.summary judgment is proper only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and pbm is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a celotex catrett,anderson liberty lobby.
under virginia law,a defamation plaintiff first must show that a defendant has published a false factual statement that concerns and harms the plaintiff or the plaintiff reputation.hyland.raytheon tech,chaves johnson.
the district court found the statement mead johnson lies about baby formula again was substantially true because false advertising is substantially synonymous with lying.mead johnson claims that the ordinary meaning of a lie implies a deliberate intent to deceive or an intentional untruth.appellant br.at citing random house webster unabridged dictionary.mead johnson asserts that it is possible to violate the lanham act absent any intentional falsehoods.thus,mead johnson asserts that the district court wrongly concluded that false advertising is substantially synonymous with lying.we disagree.
the meaning of the word lie includes to tell an untruth or to speak or write falsely.black law dictionary,ed.mead johnson did not dispute that it distributed false statements concerning pbm formulas on prior occasions.accordingly,the statement is substantially true.in addition,the statement,read in context,makes clear that the lies referred to prior false advertising.consequently,summary judgment was warranted.
the district court also disposed of mead johnson lanham act counterclaims as a matter of law it granted pbm motion for judgment at the close of all the evidence.we review de novo awards of judgment as a matter of law.navy fed.credit union,cir.a judgment as a matter of law is proper when,without weighing the credibility of the evidence,there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the proper judgment.singer dungan,cir.a district court laches determination is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.id.
the lanham act prohibits the false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact,which in commercial advertising or promotion,misrepresents the nature,characteristics,qualities,or geographic origin of his or her or another person goods,services,or commercial activities.a b.thus,a plaintiff asserting a false advertising claim under the lanham act must establish that 
the defendant made a false or misleading description of fact or representation of fact in a commercial advertisement about his own or another product the misrepresentation is material,in that it is likely to influence the purchasing decision the misrepresentation actually deceives or has the tendency to deceive a substantial segment of its audience the defendant placed the false or misleading statement in interstate commerce and the plaintiff has been or is likely to be injured as a result of the misrepresentation,either by direct diversion of sales or by a lessening of goodwill associated with its products.

for liability to arise under the false advertising provisions of the lanham act,the contested statement or representation must be either false on its face or,although literally true,likely to mislead and to confuse consumers given the merchandising context.fleet smithkline beecham consumer healthcare,cir.where the advertisement is literally false,a violation may be established without evidence of consumer deception.cashmere camel hair,at.but if a plaintiff theory of recovery is premised upon a claim of implied falsehood,a plaintiff must demonstrate,by extrinsic evidence,that the challenged advertisements tend to mislead or confuse consumers.johnson johnson merck consumer pharm.smithkline beecham,cir see also abbott labs.mead johnson,cir a court may find on its own that a statement is literally false,but,absent a literal falsehood,may find that a statement is impliedly misleading only if presented with evidence of actual consumer deception.
in analyzing whether an advertisement is literally false,a court must determine,first,the unambiguous claims made by the advertisement,and second,whether those claims are false.scotts,at quoting novartis consumer health johnson johnson merck consumer pharmaceuticals,cir.a literally false message may be either explicit or conveyed by necessary implication when,considering the advertisement in its entirety,the audience would recognize the claim as readily as if it had been explicitly stated.id.
further,as courts have long held,it is proper to use the analogous state limitations period for lanham act suits because the act provides no express statute of limitations.see reed united transp.union,conopco,campbell soup,cir hot wax,turtle wax,cir jarrow formulas,nutrition now,cir.in virginia,the analogous state limitations period is two years.a unlimited screw prods.malm.as a result,the district court concluded that since mead johnson filed its counterclaim on may,mead johnson counterclaims concerning pbm routine and gentle formulas that accrued before may,are by limitations,and mead johnson counterclaims concerning pbm routine and gentle formulas that accrued thereafter were barred by laches.wl.
the district court conclusion that the statute of limitations barred mead johnson false advertising claim concerning pbm routine and gentle formula for all ads issued prior to may,was proper.mead johnson filed its counterclaim on may.therefore,claims that accrued before may,are by the two year statute of limitations.the district court found that pbm first made the compare to enfamil claim for its routine product no later than and for its gentle product in.as such,the statute of limitations barred mead johnson counterclaim for advertisements published before may.
as for allegations concerning advertisements for products published after may,the district court application of laches regarding pbm routine and gentle products is neither guided by erroneous legal principles nor based upon a clearly erroneous factual finding.brown nucor,cir.
estoppel by laches generally applies to preclude relief for a plaintiff who has unreasonably slept on his rights.see brittingham jenkins,cir.in other words,laches bars false advertising claims where a defendant is prejudiced by a plaintiff unreasonable delay in bringing suit after the plaintiff knew of the defendant violation.what a burger of virginia whataburger of corpus christi,texas,cir because the lanham act does not include a limitations period,courts use the doctrine of laches to address the inequities created by a trademark owner who,despite having a colorable infringement claim,allows a competitor to develop its products around the mark and expand its business,only then to lower the litigation boom.see also mccarthy at laches is a good defense if plaintiff long failure to exercise its legal rights has caused defendant to rely to its detriment by building up a valuable business around its trademark.when a false advertising plaintiff files suit outside of the statute of limitations,both elements of laches unreasonable delay and prejudice are strongly presumed.see eeoc v.the great atlantic pacific tea,cir finding that once the statute of limitations has expired,the defendant enjoys the benefit of a presumption of inexcusable delay and prejudice.
here,mead johnson delay was unreasonable because mead johnson knew about the compare to claim since at least when the parties were involved in trademark litigation over a label that contained the exact same claim.as the district court noted,the unreasonable delay prejudiced pbm because of pbm continued use of the advertisement on all of its formulas in over a dozen retail stores for years.indeed,by alleging that pbm has been unjustly enriched by over million as a result of the compare to ads,mead johnson must concede that permitting this suit to go forward would enable it to benefit from its own unreasonable delay.wl,at.see jarrow formulas nutrition now,cir we hold that the presumption of laches is triggered if any part of the claimed wrongful conduct occurred beyond the limitations period.to hold otherwise would effectively swallow the rule of laches,and render it a spineless defense.
finally,the district court did not err in granting judgment as a matter of law on mead johnson lanham act counterclaim concerning pbm rice starch formula advertisements.mead johnson claimed that the compare to ad impliedly communicated the false message that the performance of pbm products have been tested and verified as equivalent to mead johnson counterpart formula.to support its claim,mead johnson offered the testimony of ravi dhar,who conducted two consumer surveys.however,dhar assumed that respondents who stated same meant identical,even though he admitted that some respondents who thought the products were nearly the same would have chosen same instead of different.wl,at.as the district court concluded,t estimony at trial showed that the ingredients of the parties products are very similar,but not identical,and that it is likely that the nutritional value of the parties products is nearly the same.id.because the surveys failed to account for the actual allegations in the case,they failed to provide the required evidence of falsity.
similarly,the district court concluded that mead johnson failed to show that other alleged false statements were actually false.as to the allegations that the compare to language impliedly communicated that the products had been tested against each other,pbm marketing director testified that the products have,in fact,been tested against each other.id.at.in addition,mead johnson alleged that pbm label stated its gentle formula contains partially broken down whey protein but presented no evidence to suggest otherwise.as a result,the alleged implied message could not be proven false.
in any event,even if pbm compare to messages were false,the district court correctly concluded that mead johnson can not prove that the compare to language caused any damages.see xoom imageline,cir holding that in order to recover damages under the lanham act,plaintiff must prove that there was a violation,that plaintiff has been damaged,and that there is a causal connection between the violation and those damages.the fatal flaw in mead johnson economic information was that its expert assumed that every sale pbm made was attributable to the compare to statement on the product.as a result,mead johnson failed to show that it suffered damages that were caused by the statement.
we now turn to mead johnson contention that the district court erred by admitting expert survey evidence and evidence of prior lanham act litigation between the parties.the exclusion or admission of evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion.schultz capital int l,cir see also old chief united states.a court has abused its discretion if its decision is guided by erroneous legal principles or rests upon a clearly erroneous factual finding.brown nucor,cir.
pursuant to federal rule of evidence rule,expert testimony is admissible if it will assist the trier of fact and is based upon sufficient facts or data,the product of reliable principles and methods,and the principles and methods have been applied reliably to the facts of the case.as the supreme court has explained,evidence is admissible under rule if it rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant.daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals.because expert witnesses have the potential to be both powerful and quite misleading,the court must ensure that any and all scientific testimony is not only relevant,but reliable.cooper smith nephew,cir citing westberry gislaved gummi ab,f d,cir and daubert,at,see also richmond med.ctr.for women herring,cir under federal rule of evidence rule expert testimony must be both relevant and reliable.
a lanham act plaintiff asserting an implied falsehood claim must establish that the advertising tends to deceive or mislead a substantial portion of the intended audience.scotts united industries,cir.that fact is typically shown by the use of consumer surveys.while there will be occasions when the proffered survey is so flawed as to be completely unhelpful to the trier of fact and therefore inadmissible,such situations will be rare.ahp subsidiary holding stuart hale,cir.usually,objections based on flaws in the survey methodology are properly addressed by the trier of fact.see also,citizens fin.group,citizens bank,cir finding that survey technical unreliability goes to weight not admissibility clicks billiards,sixshooters,cir same pediamed pharm,breckenridge,d,same mccarthy,the majority rule is that while technical deficiencies can reduce a survey weight,they will not prevent the survey from being admitted into evidence.
here,mead johnson contends that the surveys conducted by schoen and ridgeway,pbm consumer experts,were inherently unreliable and irrelevant,and their testimony should have been excluded because they both surveyed the wrong universe of respondents.a universe is that segment of the population whose perceptions and state of mind are relevant to the issues in the case.mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.a survey of the wrong universe will be of little probative value in litigation.id.we are persuaded that in this case,while the survey sample may not exactly match the audience that received the advertisement,it is a sufficiently close approximation of the recipient pool to be admissible.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the expert testimony.
schoen conducted his survey by presenting an online survey to a group of participants located by a third party.the survey participants were to ensure that they were new parents or expecting a baby in the next six months,were open to considering purchasing infant formula,were not participating in the women,infants,and children nutrition program,and were or would be the primary or shared decision maker in choosing infant formula brands.
the ridgway survey was based on interviews conducted among four groups of consumers,two of which were exposed to the disputed advertisement and two of which were exposed to a control mailer that contained similar,but more accurate statements about mead johnson infant formula.all participants were new and expectant mothers.after viewing either the disputed advertisement or the control advertisement,participants dialed a toll free number and were questioned about the material.
the district court concluded that while mead johnson has pointed out numerous ways in which it would have conducted ridgeway survey differently,its arguments do not demonstrate that the methods used were not of the type considered reliable by experts in ridgway field.pbm products mead joh
