wireless makes three arguments on appeal the district court erred when it ordered the city to act upon wireless permit applications within sixty days of the judgment the district court erred when it held that the city was not required to apply the zoning ordinances in effect at the time wireless filed its applications for building permits and the district court erred when it held that a violation of the tca does not give rise to a cause of action under.
for the reasons explained below,we reverse the district court order instead the district court should issue appropriate injunctive relief compelling the city to grant wireless the requested permits.we affirm the district court dismissal of wireless claims in light of the supreme court recent decision in city of rancho palos verdes abrams,d.

on january,the chattanooga city council city council passed a resolution which declared a moratorium on the issuance of building permits for communication towers in certain zones effective until march,the purpose of the moratorium was to allow for consideration of amendments to the provisions of the zoning ordinance for communication towers in the cited zones by the city council,due to concern that the ordinances failed sufficiently to protect the public welfare.joint appendix at.a second resolution was passed on february,extending the moratorium until april.

as a result of the amendments to the zoning ordinances,all of wireless applications were rendered defective in various ways such that they did not qualify for issuance of the permits.wireless asserts that the city never served it with any type of written documentation signaling either the approval or denial of its applications.the city concedes that its only communication with wireless regarding the allegedly applications was a telephone call on march,between perry mayo mayo,the city employee primarily responsible for processing applications,and wireless.during this phone call,mayo informed wireless that the applications could not be approved absent a special exceptions permit.appellees br.at at mayo dep.at.mayo believed that the applications were therefore on hold at this point,and accordingly,took no further action.at mayo dep.at.wireless never took the steps necessary to cure the defects in its applications by satisfying the new requirements and taking the applications before the variance board
