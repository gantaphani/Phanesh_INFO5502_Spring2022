defendant john rosa was the president of the citadel during the time period relevant in this case.in april,his office received a phone call from the father of a former camper,who reported that a counselor at the summer camp later identified to be reville had molested his son in.rosa did not report the complaint to law enforcement and instead,the does contend,took steps to conceal the allegations.the does argue that rosa actions allowed reville to continue his abuse of doe and doe during the summer of.
the does brought suit against rosa under,alleging that rosa had violated an affirmative duty to protect them under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of rosa on the ground that rosa had no duty to protect the does from a preexistent danger.for the reasons explained below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the citadel is a public military college in charleston,south carolina.from to,it operated the citadel summer camp for young children,employing current and former citadel cadets to serve as staff and camp counselors.the citadel housed the camp counselors on campus in rooms near the campers.in,the citadel learned that a former cadet named michael arpaio had sexually abused campers while working as a camp counselor from through.several victims sued the citadel based on arpaio abuse and collected damages 
camper doe allegations 
on april,rosa office received a phone call from the father of a former citadel summer camp camper camper doe,unrelated to the plaintiffs and not a party in this case.rosa was not present that day,and his administrative assistant referred the call to the citadel general counsel,mark brandenburg.
when brandenburg returned the call,camper doe father asked whether brandenburg was calling on behalf of president rosa,because the family did not want anything to fall through the cracks.the father told brandenburg that camper doe had been sexually abused by a counselor known as skip while attending the citadel summer camp in.skip had allegedly shown camper doe pornography and masturbated with him and showered with the campers.the father also identified a second camper who was similarly victimized.brandenburg then spoke on the phone with camper doe himself,who explained that skip abused him and other campers in this way for over a year.
brandenburg reviewed camp records for the and years and found that camper doe description matched a counselor named louis skip reville,who had been a citadel cadet from to.reville had worked as a camp counselor at the citadel summer camp during the summers of to and as a tutor in the citadel writing center from august until sometime in april.
brandenburg called reville at the writing center on april,the day after talking with camper doe father.according to reville,brandenburg arranged to meet with him and rosa executive assistant,colonel trez.at the meeting,brandenburg and colonel trez told reville about camper doe accusations,all of which he denied.they explained to reville that from the citadel standpoint their main concern was to protect the institution and that during their investigation he should lay low and stay off the campus.
the does suggest that brandenburg then terminated reville employment at the writing center,but reville time records as a citadel tutor indicate that he last worked at the writing center on april,four days before camper doe father called the citadel.see.similarly,a form that reville supervisor at the writing center completed on march,lists the effective date of reville resignation as april.the conflict between reville testimony that he was at the writing center when he received brandenburg call on april,and the contradictory employment forms is not resolved in the record,but we must credit the does account for summary judgment purposes.
brandenburg also met with the former director of the citadel summer camp,jennifer garrott,on april,who disclosed that reville had been asked to leave his prior job at a prep school.in addition,garrott told brandenburg that in the summer of,she caught reville in his barracks room alone with a camper rubbing icy hot on the camper leg,which is against camp policy forbidding counselors from being alone in a room with campers a terminable offense.
brandenburg reported back to rosa by may,about his investigation of the allegations against reville.the does contend that brandenburg memorialized his and president rosa intentions to conceal the camper doe complaint in a may,email,appellant br,and quote a portion of the email that states,i am hopeful that by conducting an investigation on behalf of the school,no formal investigation criminal or civil will occur.however,the does appear to take the email out of context as it was written to provide a background explanation to a potential witness in advance of an interview by brandenburg.further,the does offer no evidence that rosa was aware of the contents of the email or ever saw it.
on july,brandenburg went to dallas,texas to personally speak to camper doe and his parents.during the interview,which was recorded and transcribed,camper doe provided a detailed account of the abuse,including that it happened to about five other boys.asked whether he reported the complaint to law enforcement,camper doe replied,well,i mean,i talked to you,and most of all,the thing i want the most is just to make sure that reville does have a chance to do this to anyone else.camper doe later testified,i would have absolutely reported it to police had i known that the citadel did.
at the close of the july interview,camper doe father mentioned that the citadel had not accepted camper doe for admission as a cadet.he stated that the citadel had been part of the root cause of camper doe problems and by admitting him could be part of the root cause to fix him.the father considered this a very inexpensive way for the citadel to say,do you know what we fix our own.
b.the alleged cover up 
the does contend that rosa deliberately conspired to conceal the allegations by camper doe against reville,compls.jennifer shiel,an administrative assistant who worked in rosa office,testified that president rosa was in charge of a conscious effort to cover up or conceal the report of sexual abuse.she testified that rosa used the term close hold,which she interpreted to mean that only people that needed to know about it were supposed to know about it.further,shiel testified that brandenburg and rosa had nearby offices and met on business at least three times a week.brandenburg was deferential to rosa and there was no way that brandenburg would have done something on his own without running it past rosa first.
the does posit that rosa ignored policies of both the citadel and its summer camp that required him to report the camper doe claim to the citadel public safety department,compls.see also serious incidents,memorandum,directing that when criminal activity involving someone affiliated with the citadel as a suspect or victim occurs,the first member of the citadel community learning of the occurrence is responsible for reporting it to the public safety department summer camp official camp policies regarding sexual misconduct issues,mandating that r egardless of validity of the violation,any sexually inappropriate conduct reports concerning any camper or employee of the camp will be turned over to the citadel public safety department.shiel testified that rosa made sure that did not happen.
the does also assert that rosa violated the citadel employee misconduct policy by allowing reville to resign his position at the writing center and to leave with a clean record,compls.according to the does,the citadel policy forbids expunging molestation findings from an employee record or terminating an investigation in exchange for the employee resignation.the does,however,offer no evidence that rosa expunged findings from reville record.
the does also point to multiple policies they contend required rosa to report sexual assault or harassment to the college title ix coordinator,compls.see also sexual assault crisis intervention policy,sexual harassment,general procedures for conducting formal investigations of sexual harassment.in addition,the does allege rosa violated title ix requirement for an impartial investigation of sexual abuse by leaving the investigation to the citadel general counsel brandenburg and its insurer,the south carolina insurance reserve fund.see.
in addition to failing to report the camper doe allegations or initiate a proper investigation,the does contend that rosa actively concealed the allegations.for example,in october,the camper doe complaint was omitted from a list of possible litigation files kept in the citadel general counsel office.in,camper doe name appeared in the list with the description alleged sexual abuse at summer camp,but the entry was annotated as being against arpaio,not reville.the does argue that this is evidence of president rosa cover up and that an accurate file,listing reville name,would have notified the south carolina budget and control board that potential liability extended beyond the arpaio sex abuse complaints.appellant br.
as further evidence of a,the does point out that the citadel did not include the camper doe complaint in the crime statistics that it was required to keep under the clery act.see f.the clery act requires schools to report statistics of crimes that are reported to local police agencies or to a campus security authority during the three most recent calendar years.according to the does,rosa effectively prevent ed the trigger of any duty to report pursuant to the clery act by withholding camper doe complaint from law enforcement.appellant br.see also,compls.
the does also assert that the citadel further hid the camper doe allegations by withdrawing a challenge to reville application for unemployment benefits.on june,the south carolina employment security commission found reville eligible for unemployment benefits due to job loss from the citadel,and on june,the citadel filed a notice of appeal to challenge that decision.however,on july,four days after brandenburg met with camper doe in dallas,the citadel withdrew its appeal of reville unemployment benefits.reville testified that he believed the citadel withdrew the challenge because brandenburg and colonel trez did not want to have anything to do with him as far as any kind of confrontation or anything.
finally,in june and september,brandenburg appeared with rosa before the citadel board of visitors to provide information on camper doe allegations against reville.the does argue that brandenburg gave such minimal detail on the issue that the board could not understand the true nature of the complaint.according to a investigative report commissioned by the citadel,the board assumed,based on what they were told,that it was an insurance defense and civil claim matter,and believed from what they were told that this was the case of a father displeased with his son unsuccessful application for admission to the college.
reville abuse of the does 
reville met doe in the summer of,about two years before camper doe father called rosa office.doe had just finished grade,and reville was a volunteer coach for his youth basketball team,which held practice at the prep school where reville worked.at some point,reville invited doe to his home to help with yardwork and began sexually abusing him shortly thereafter.reville testified he abused doe at least times in and three,four times a week in.
reville became increasingly close with doe and his family,and during doe grade year,reville was invited by the doe family to move into their home as a caregiver for doe and his younger brother,doe.reville then increased his abuse of doe and also began to abuse doe.the consisted of sexual games,oral sex,physical touching,and from three to four times a week to nearly daily between the summer of through early.in april,prior to learning about camper doe allegations,reville was abusing doe approximately two to three times a week and doe three to four times a week.
after meeting with brandenburg and colonel trez on april,reville briefly curtailed his sexual abuse of the does.however,he heard nothing further from the citadel or law enforcement and,taking the silence as news that he was not going to get in trouble,reville resumed the abuse before the end of may.by that time,reville was no longer working at the writing center and used his additional free time to abuse the does more frequently.the abuse ended by august,when the doe family moved to atlanta.
after leaving his employment at the writing center,reville returned to the citadel several times,to speak to the honor committee and incoming freshman,and in to attend the unveiling of the remodeled honor court.finally,in october,mount pleasant,south carolina police arrested reville,apparently based on separate allegations of child sexual abuse.at that time,camper doe april allegations against reville came to light.
legal proceedings 
the does filed two complaints against rosa one each for doe and doe on march,in the district of south carolina,which were later amended.the amended complaints assert a substantive due process violation under,as well as two other claims that the district court dismissed.in effect,the does allege that rosa caused their abuse during the late spring and early summer of by covering up the camper doe complaint and thereby allowing reville to remain a respected member of the community,compls.
on june,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of rosa in both cases.the district court concluded that the supreme court holding in deshaney winnebago county department of social services,bars the does claim because rosa can not be said to have created a danger which already existed.by the time rosa learned of the camper doe complaint,reville had been abusing the does for nearly two years and this abuse had occurred wholly independent of any act or involvement of rosa.the does therefore c ould not demonstrate that rosa created or substantially enhanced the danger which resulted in their tragic abuse at the hands of reville.id.
the does timely appealed their respective orders,and we have jurisdiction over their consolidated appeal under.

iii.discussion 
on appeal,the does argue that they have established a triable cause of action against rosa under for the abuse that occurred after the camper doe allegation.they contend rosa alleged conduct constituted affirmative acts which created,or at least increased,the risk of their later abuse by reville.the does central argument is that the district court erred in applying the danger doctrine when it concluded that rosa was not liable because reville had already been abusing the does long before the camper doe complaint.
a.the state created danger doctrine 
section imposes liability on state actors who cause the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution.under established precedent,these constitutional rights include a fourteenth amendment substantive due process right against state actor conduct that deprives an individual of bodily integrity.see,hall tawney,cir.accordingly,state actions that result in sexual abuse of children can be actionable under.see doe taylor indep.sch,cir addressing a student constitutional right to bodily integrity in physical sexual abuse cases stoneking bradford area sch,cir recognizing liability for school administrators actions in adopting and maintaining a practice,custom or policy of reckless indifference to instances of known or suspected sexual abuse of students by teachers.
state actor liability,however,is significantly limited as the supreme court explained in deshaney winnebago county department of social services.in that case,a child mother brought a action against a social worker and other local officials on behalf of her child,who had been beaten and permanently brain damaged by his father.the mother alleged that the state officials failed to remove the child from his father custody,despite repeated reports and evidence of the father abuse,and that failure to act deprived the child of a liberty interest in violation of his due process rights.id.at.
the supreme court rejected deshaney asserted federal constitutional cause of action because 
nothing in the language of the due process clause itself requires the state to protect the life,liberty,and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors.the clause is phrased as a limitation on the state power to act,not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and security.it forbids the state itself to deprive individuals of life,liberty,or property without due process of law,but its language can not fairly be extended to impose an affirmative obligation on the state to ensure that those interests do not come to harm through other means.nor does history support such an expansive reading of the constitutional text.like its counterpart in the fifth amendment,the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment was intended to prevent government from abusing its power,or employing it as an instrument of oppression.its purpose was to protect the people from the state,not to ensure that the state protected them from each other.
id.at citations omitted.in establishing a brightline rule regarding due process causes of action involving the danger doctrine,the court concluded that because the due process clause does not require the state to provide its citizens with particular protective services,it follows that the state can not be held liable under the clause for injuries that could have been averted had it chosen to provide them.id.at.
the supreme court noted,nonetheless,that state actor liability might attach in two narrow circumstances.the first exception arises when the state takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will.id.at sometimes referred to as the or exception.for example,individuals confined in a penal institution or mental hospital are due certain protections by the state during the time of confinement because 
when the state takes a person into its custody and holds him there against his will,the constitution imposes upon it a corresponding duty to assume some responsibility for his safety and general.the affirmative duty to protect arises not from the state knowledge of the individual predicament or from its expressions of intent to help him,but from the limitations which it has imposed on his freedom to act on his own behalf.
the does do not contend that their asserted cause of action can be sustained under the state custody exception.
the second exception,implicit in deshaney,gives rise to the danger doctrine and is at issue here in deshaney,the supreme court observed that w hile the state may have been aware of the dangers that the child faced in the free world,it played no part in their creation,nor did it do anything to render him any more vulnerable to them.id.at emphasis added.under th o se circumstances,the state had no constitutional duty to protect the child.id.thus,when the state itself creates the dangerous situation that resulted in a victim injury,the absence of a custodial relationship may not be dispositive.pinder,at.
the leading case in the fourth circuit on the danger doctrine is pinder,where pinder,the mother of three children,brought a action against a police officer who had responded to a report of domestic violence at her home.id.at.her,pittman,had broken into pinder home,assaulted her,and threatened to kill her and her three children.pinder told the investigating officer that pittman also had threatened her in the past and had just been released from jail for the attempted arson of her home.fearing that pittman could return to harm her or her children,she asked the officer whether she could safely return to work that evening.the officer assured her that pittman would be incarcerated overnight on assault charges and could not be released until the county commissioner became available for a hearing in the morning.with that assurance,pinder went to work that evening leaving her children at home.
instead of the assault charge,the officer filed lesser charges against pittman,and he was released from custody that night.pittman then returned to pinder home after she had gone to work and set it on fire.pinder children were sleeping inside,and all three died of smoke inhalation.
pinder then brought a due process claim against the police officer.lacking a custodial relationship with the state,she sought to invoke the danger doctrine by alleging that the officer assurances of pittman overnight detention were affirmative misconduct by a state actor that increased the danger to her children.id.at.we concluded,however,that pinder could not sidestep the broad rule in deshaney by characterizing her claim as one of affirmative misconduct by the state in creating or enhancing the danger,instead of an omission.id.
we reasoned that if pinder theory was correct,every representation by the police and every failure to incarcerate would constitute affirmative actions,giving rise to civil liability.id.such a rule could not survive scrutiny under deshaney 
no amount of semantics can disguise the fact that the real affirmative act here was committed by pittman,not by officer johnson.as was true in deshaney,the state did not create the danger,it simply failed to provide adequate protection from it.in both cases,t he most that can be said of the state functionaries is that they stood by and did nothing when suspicious circumstances dictated a more active role for them.thus,like deshaney,pinder case is purely an omission claim.
id.at citation omitted.in light of deshaney,the officer lacked a clearly established duty under the due process clause to protect pinder or her children and was therefore entitled to qualified immunity.id.at.
under the narrow limits set by deshaney and pinder,to establish liability based on a danger theory,a plaintiff must show that the state actor created or increased the risk of private danger,and did so directly through affirmative acts,not merely through inaction or omission.put another way,state actors may not disclaim liability when they themselves throw others to the lions,but that does not entitle persons who rely on promises of aid to some greater degree of protection from lions at large.pinder,at.
rosa liability 
given the clear rule under deshaney and pinder,we conclude that the does can not make a danger claim against rosa.as the district court found in granting summary judgment,the does claim fails because they can not demonstrate that rosa created or substantially enhanced the danger which resulted in their tragic abuse at the hands of reville.j.reville began abusing the does in and,two years before rosa could have been aware through the camper doe complaint that he was a pedophile.quite simply,rosa could not have created a danger that already existed.armijo wagon mound pub,cir.
nor did rosa create or increase the risk of the does abuse specifically during the early summer months of,as the does posit.as horrific as the abuse of the does by reville was,nothing transpired between them and reville in the summer of that had not been ongoing for two years unrelated to any action by rosa.as deshaney makes clear,allowing continued exposure to an existing danger by failing to intervene is not the equivalent of creating or increasing the risk of that danger.the father abuse in deshaney was
