background 
the facts of this case are set forth in detail in the district court opinion.frappier countrywide home loans,cv,wl,at.we briefly reiterate them here only as necessary to provide context for the issues on appeal.
frappier resides in southwick,massachusetts.in june,he and his wife purchased his mother house the property with a mortgage from countrywide.in the years that followed,frappier took out multiple mortgages to finance home improvements,initially with his wife and later in his own name after the couple divorced.frappier remarried and took out an additional mortgage with his second wife.when that marriage ended in march,the divorce agreement required frappier to either sell the property by july,or refinance the mortgage in his own name by august.frappier was unable to sell the property,and he failed to refinance by the august deadline.
to cure his breach of the divorce agreement,frappier applied for a loan from countrywide on september.the loan for which he applied was a stated income loan,otherwise known as the fast and easy loan program.under the terms of this loan program,applicants would be approved if one had a credit score at or above,verified employment,and a value of less than eighty percent.documentation of assets and income was not required,but applicants had to personally verify under criminal penalty that the information they provided was accurate.the loan officer testified that frappier stated his monthly income as,but frappier claims he reported a lower income figure.
countrywide,following its normal underwriting process,determined that frappier had met the requirements for the fast and easy loan program.at the closing,frappier signed the application,which listed his income as a month,and swore under criminal penalty that the information in the application was accurate.he also executed a borrower certification,which certified that he had provided accurate information regarding his income and assets.countrywide issued the loan in october october loan.
on november,three weeks after the closing of the october loan,frappier applied to countrywide for a home equity loan in the amount of countrywide approved this loan as well,and it closed on december,december loan.
thereafter,frappier made the scheduled payments on the october loan for fifteen months in,he changed jobs,but his new employer let him go.around the same time,frappier faced unusually high expenses for home heating bills and repairs to his truck.he also suffered from an illness that hospitalized him for a day and kept him out of work for some time.that winter,frappier attempted again to sell the property,but he was not successful.because he was unable to make payments on his loan,countrywide foreclosed on the property.
ii.procedural history 
frappier filed a complaint in suffolk superior court on may,alleging claims of unjust enrichment count i,relief count ii,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing count iii,unfair and deceptive acts in violation of massachusetts general laws chapter count iv,and negligence count v.all of the claims arise from frappier contention that countrywide used improper tactics to draw him into loan agreements that the mortgagor knew he would be unable to satisfy.
after removing the case to federal court,countrywide moved for summary judgment on all counts.frappier opposed the motion and filed a for summary judgment.frappier argued at this stage that the court should consider both the october loan and the december loan together as the basis for his claims,although the complaint made no mention of the december loan.the district court granted countrywide motion on all counts.
on appeal,the first circuit reversed in part.with respect to the december loan,the court held that 
countrywide argues that the attack on the december loan is an independent claim for a different transaction essentially forfeited because frappier did not mention the december second home mortgage or any facts pertaining to it in his complaint.this is correct and a new transaction can not be asserted for the first time at summary judgment.however,the district court might on remand allow an amendment to the complaint.
frappier countrywide home loans,cir.despite allowing for the possibility of an amendment to the complaint,the first circuit nevertheless held that certain claims failed as a matter of law,affirming the dismissal of the negligence and relief claims in their entirety and the covenant claim as it related to the december loan.it vacated the dismissal of the covenant claim as it related to the october loan,however,and it vacated the dismissal of the unjust enrichment and claims in their entirety.
on remand,frappier filed a motion to amend the complaint,seeking to include allegations about the december loan.the court denied the motion on december.on march,countrywide filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings with respect to the breach of good faith and fair dealing claim count iii and to strike frappier jury demand.the district court granted the motion in both respects.on april and,the court held a bench trial on the remaining claims unjust enrichment count i and violations of chapter count iv.it entered judgment in favor of countrywide on both counts.after the trial,frappier filed a motion under federal rule of civil procedure for amended or additional findings of fact,or,in the alternative,for a new trial under rule.the court denied that motion and frappier appealed.
iii.analysis 
on appeal,frappier challenges the denial of his motion to amend,his request for a jury trial,and his motion for amended factual findings or a new trial.he also challenges the district court judgment on the pleadings resolving count iii in countrywide favor.after careful consideration,we find no grounds for reversing any of the district court decisions.
denial of motion to amend 
on october,frappier moved to amend his complaint to include allegations related to the december loan.the district court denied the motion on the grounds of undue delay and undue prejudice.we review a denial of a motion to amend for abuse of discretion.watson deaconess waltham,cir.
the district court did not err,much less abuse its discretion,in this instance.as the district court noted,the proposed amendment came over two years after the initial complaint was filed and a year after the district court ruled on the summary judgment motions.nothing prevented frappier from pursuing this amendment earlier.as the borrower,frappier certainly had sufficient information about the december loan to allege claims related to that transaction at the outset of litigation,and he very likely could have amended his complaint,had he wished to do so,prior to summary judgment.
the district court correctly decided that the timing of the amendment constituted undue delay.p rotracted delay,with its attendant burdens on the opponent and the court,is itself a sufficient reason for the court to withhold permission to amend.steir girl scouts of the usa,cir.the district court was also correct that the amendment would unfairly prejudice countrywide,given the likelihood that the amendment would require additional discovery.see id.particularly disfavored are motions to amend whose timing prejudices the opposing party by requiring a of discovery internal quotation mark omitted.thus,we affirm the denial of the motion to amend
