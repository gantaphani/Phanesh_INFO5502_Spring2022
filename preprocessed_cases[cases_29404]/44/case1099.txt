this appeal comes to us from multidistrict litigation case number mdl,otherwise known as the asbestos mdl,involving asbestos cases from around the country,pending before judge robreno in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.the district court,overseeing several thousand asbestos cases,dismissed the claims of twelve pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure based on with the district court administrative order ao.specifically,judge robreno determined that the plaintiffs submissions were fatally flawed in that they failed to include specific histories of plaintiffs exposure to asbestos.plaintiffs contend on appeal,as they did in the district court,that ao did not impose this requirement,and urge,alternatively,that even if it did,under a proper balancing of the factors we outlined in poulis state farm fire and casualty company,cir,dismissal with prejudice was not warranted.for the reasons discussed below,we will affirm the district court dismissal of the twelve cases at issue.
background 
the present cases as well as several thousand others were transferred to the eastern district of pennsylvania in as a result of a centralization of all cases,as ordered by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation.see in re asbestos prods.liab.litig.no.vi.the panel found that centralization would best serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and promote the just and efficient conduct of this litigation.id.at.mdl once included more than plaintiffs and more than eight million claims.app.at.by the time judge robreno inherited the mdl in,thousands of cases had been settled or otherwise resolved.judge robreno has been diligently overseeing the progress and resolution of the remaining cases since then.
to streamline the litigation of the thousands of cases in mdl,the original ao was issued in by district judge giles.id.at.the purpose of ao,specifically,was to assist the district court in managing the large number of cases and the complex issues involved in the litigation to allow meritorious cases to move to trial or settlement properly and to avoid unnecessary burdens on defendants by requiring plaintiffs to provide certain medical and exposure information at the outset of the case.id.at,n judge robreno,with the assistance of dedicated magistrate judges,has continued to oversee discovery and pretrial procedures,allowing meritorious claims to advance and weeding out unsupported claims.see generally mark behrens,cooley rev,describing the progress in mdl and judge robreno efforts with respect to discovery,and the dismissal of fraudulent claims,especially where there were fabricated doctors diagnoses.
in september,soon after mdl was assigned to him,judge robreno issued an amended ao.app.at.amended ao required plaintiffs to submit,inter alia,medical reports upon which the plaintiff now relies for the prosecution of the claims as if to withstand a dispositive motion.id.at.specifically,amended ao required that 
each plaintiff asserting a claim based upon an alleged malignancy shall submit to the court a copy of the medical diagnosing report or opinion upon which the plaintiff now relies for the prosecution of the claims as if to withstand a dispositive motion.
each plaintiff asserting a claim based upon an alleged injury or condition shall submit to the court a copy of the medical diagnosing report or opinion upon which the plaintiff now relies for the prosecution of the claim as if to withstand a dispositive motion.
each report or opinion submitted hereunder shall be based upon objective and subjective data which shall be identified and descriptively set out within the report or opinion.
id.at emphasis in original 
finally,amended ao hereafter ao provided that t he court may dismiss pursuant to b the cases of any plaintiffs who fail to comply with the requirements set forth.id.at.
november order 
on november,judge robreno issued an order dismissing cvlo cases for failure to comply with ao november order.app.of those cases dismissed,nineteen were dismissed for failure to provide sufficient ao reports with respect to exposure history and cases were dismissed for failure to show an impairment.id.at.in the november order,judge robreno referred to the six poulis factors that a court should consider before dismissing a case pursuant to rule b.id.at.
although the plain language of ao does not state that plaintiffs must provide a complete exposure history,the district court based its dismissal of cases that failed to include such information on the language in ao that emphasizes that plaintiffs should submit medical diagnosis or opinions based on medically accepted principles and practices,and based on statements from reputable medical organizations that require occupational and environmental exposure history when screening for diseases.id.at.accordingly,the district court required ao submissions to comply with generally accepted medical standards that call for information regarding duration,intensity,time of onset,and setting of exposure to asbestos.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
furthermore,the district court interpreted ao to require the medical evidence presented by plaintiff to contain a diagnosis of a symptomatic disease.id.at.the district court therefore dismissed claims that were supported by ao submissions that included only diagnoses of pleural plaques and pleural thickening.id.at.
rule b motions to dismiss and march order 
a series of rule b motions to dismiss the cases before us on appeal were filed between october,and december,in which defendants argued that considering the district court november order the claims must be dismissed for failure to comply with ao plaintiffs submitted briefs in opposition to defendants motions,arguing that ao did not require complete exposure history,and alternatively,that dismissal was not warranted under poulis.at no point did plaintiffs offer supplemental ao submissions with more complete exposure histories.
after defendants submitted their motions to dismiss and plaintiffs filed their opposition,the district court issued an order on march,the district court dismissed arendt,brix,and burzynski for failure to show an asbestosrelated disease.app.at.the district court also dismissed arendt and brix as to defendant general electric because plaintiffs failed to serve the ao submissions on it.id.at.the district court dismissed stafford,michels,ostrand,wright,zerbel,hansen,morris,repischak,and duffey for failing to provide a sufficient history of asbestos exposure.id.at.in the march order,the district court adopted its reasoning in the november order,and also noted that w ithout evidence of an exposure history for each plaintiff and a medical diagnosis that allows defendants and the court to sort through,for example,which plaintiffs allegedly were exposed to whose asbestos at which locations,the litigation of thousands of cases could not go forward.id.at.
plaintiffs timely appeal followed.plaintiffs advance two arguments on appeal that the district court incorrectly held that plaintiffs ao submissions were deficient and that the district court erred in dismissing plaintiffs cases with prejudice under rule b for failing to comply with ao.
ii.standard of review 
we review a district court interpretation of its own orders with deference,particularly in the mdl context.see,gibbs frank,cir we review a district court interpretation of its own order for abuse of discretion.in re fannie mae sec,observing,in mdl,that d istrict judges must have authority to manage their dockets,especially during a massive litigation such as this,and we owe deference to their decisions whether and how to enforce the deadlines they impose 
we review the district court dismissal pursuant to rule b for an abuse of discretion.emerson thiel college,cir.
iii.discussion 
we note at the outset that these cases were transferred to the eastern district of pennsylvania as a result of the centralization of all cases by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation.the goal of the multidistrict litigation process is to promote the just and efficient conduct of civil actions involving one or more common questions of fact that are pending in different districts.a see also in re phenylpropanolamine ppa products liability litigation,cir observing that when similar cases are coordinated for pretrial purposes,those cases are more likely to proceed toward resolution on the merits with less burden and expense overall than if each were litigated separately.
to that end,judge robreno has been diligently overseeing pretrial procedures in the cases since he inherited this mdl in,including issuing administrative orders to streamline discovery.while the specific form of mdl proceedings does not alter the substantive rights of the litigants,it has nonetheless caused courts of appeals to acknowledge the increased burden imposed on judges handling these cases,and to consider these demands in applying the abuse of discretion standard,as we discuss more fully below.
we also note that dismissal with prejudice is a drastic remedy and we must be assured that it was not ordered arbitrarily.the history of the proceedings leading up to dismissal,as discussed above,is therefore very important.
compliance with ao 
complete exposure history 
plaintiffs expended much of their energy before the district court urging that the district court interpretation of ao,as set forth at length in its november order,was incorrect for requiring a complete exposure history.they continue to press this argument on appeal.plaintiffs insist that ao did not require a complete exposure history rather,plaintiffs contend that indicating the nature and duration of a claimant work,as well as general allegations of exposure history,should suffice.see,app.at discussing plaintiff barry wright,who worked primarily as a painter in the state of illinois between the years of and and has a history of having been exposed to asbestos and asbestos dust during the above mentioned period.
the language of ao is broad.while this broad language could support other interpretations including the one urged by plaintiffs we see no reason not to defer to the district court interpretation of ao that requires plaintiffs submissions to include asbestos exposure history.see directv,leto,cir noting that we normally give great deference to a court interpretation of its own orders see also negron almeda santiago,cir explaining that district court orders are of considerable import and that a reviewing court can comb relevant parts of the record to discern the authoring court intention united states davis,cir we defer to the district court interpretation its own case management order because the district court was uniquely positioned to explain the meaning of its own pretrial order.
in this case,the district court resolved any ambiguity as to the requirements of ao in its november order.as detailed in the november order,the district court believed that ordering plaintiffs to submit a medical diagnosing report or opinion that was based upon objective and subjective data which shall be identified and descriptively set out within the report or opinion,app.at,meant that plaintiffs must include exposure history so as to comply with generally accepted medical standards that call for information regarding duration,intensity,time of onset,and setting of exposure to asbestos,id.at.indeed,the district court specifically noted in its november order that accredited health organizations require exposure history in screening for and diagnosing diseases.for instance,as noted by the district court,the association of occupational and environmental clinics stated that a n appropriate screening program for lung diseases includes properly chosen and interpreted chest films,reviewed within one week of screening a complete exposure history symptom review standardized spirometry and physical examination.id.at emphasis in original citation omitted.additionally,the american thoracic society noted that i t is essential to take a comprehensive occupational and environmental history when disease is suspected.the occupational history should emphasize occupational and environmental opportunities for exposure that occurred about years and more before presentation.id.at.
accordingly,based on the language in ao that requires plaintiffs to submit medical diagnoses or opinions based on objective and subjective data,as well as statements from reputable medical organizations that emphasize the importance of exposure history,the district court interpreted ao submissions to include exposure history although the broad language of ao could support different interpretations,it does not strike us as an abuse of discretion especially given the district court experience overseeing these proceedings to require a complete occupational and environmental exposure history when disease is suspected.id.in re usa commercial mortg,app x,cir indeed,in light of its experience overseeing these proceedings,the district court is entitled to broad deference in interpreting whether the provisions of its own orders have been satisfied.presumably,the thousands of other ao submissions for cases pending in the mdl are supported by more detailed,and thus satisfactory,exposure histories.
plaintiffs arguments before us track those they made before the district court,and they fare no better here.plaintiffs do not deny that their ao submissions lack exposure history.rather,they focus their argument on insisting that ao did not require what the district court said it did,advancing an argument relegated to the last pages of their brief on appeal that dismissal was not warranted and that they should be permitted to amend their submissions.however,plaintiffs could have supplemented their submissions to comply with the district court requirements at any time during the several months before the district court issuance of its march order.no amendments were attached to their responses to defendants b motions,nor were amendments ever filed.three months later,the district court,consistent with its prior order,entered the march order dismissing these cases.
because we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion by interpreting ao to require a complete exposure history,and because plaintiffs ao submissions do not include complete exposure histories,plaintiffs argument fails.
asbestos related disease 
the district court also dismissed the arendt,brix,and burzynski cases for failure to show an disease as required by ao.the district court specified the meaning of disease in its november order.after surveying state law and doctrinal trends,the district court concluded that plaintiffs whose ao submissions showed only pleural plaques and pleural thickening,but no disease or cognizable injury did not satisfy the requirements of ao.app.at.rather,to satisfy ao,the medical evidence presented by plaintiff must contain a diagnosis of a symptomatic disease.id.
on appeal,plaintiffs do not argue that the district court erred in its interpretation of ao in this regard in fact,they concede that the ao submissions in the brix and burzynski cases did not demonstrate diagnosis of a symptomatic disease.however,plaintiffs argue that the ao submission in arendt did,in fact,show such a diagnosis.
the ao submission in arendt included one chest scan that suggested bilateral apical pleural thickening and small pleural effusion.id.at.this was,evidently,the only medical record submitted in connection with the ao submission.id.at.while plaintiff made other submissions to the ikon repository that included arguably more thorough diagnosing information,id.at,these documents were not included in plaintiff ao submission.
because,as the district court concluded in its november order,pleural thickening does not satisfy ao requirement of showing an disease,and plaintiff ao submission discusses only pleural thickening,the district court did not err in concluding that plaintiff ao submissions in arendt,brix,and burzynski were deficient 
dismissal with prejudice 
in an apparent last ditch argument,plaintiffs urge that the district court erred in dismissing plaintiffs cases with prejudice because it did not properly consider the poulis factors.as stated above,we review dismissals under rule b for abu
