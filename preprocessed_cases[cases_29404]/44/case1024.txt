orlando,through his grandmother,plaintiff robin shade,claims that at both housing facilities he was exposed to paint containing more than lead by weight.this exposure was confirmed in blood tests conducted in july and april and has forced orlando to undergo hospitalization and various medical treatments,including two courses of chelation therapy.evidence adduced at trial supported orlando assertion that lead poisoning has also caused a variety of enduring physical and mental defects he has difficulty with language,performs poorly in age,he was still in third exhibits the physical symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,a condition often associated with lead poisoning.
danny,orlando younger brother,also claims that he was exposed to lead poisoning,but only at the second section housing location at dixwell avenue.his medical records tell a story similar to orlando,including chelation therapy and extensive testing.like his brother,danny suffers from delayed language abilities,which in his case have required special education beginning in preschool,and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms.according to their treating physician,both boys can expect to suffer the consequences of the alleged lead poisoning for the foreseeable future.
procedural history 
in,robin shade filed suit in the united states district court for the district of connecticut on behalf of her grandchildren,the minor plaintiffs.she asserted a claim against hanh,alleging that it had deprived orlando and danny of federal statutory rights provided to them under the paint poisoning prevention act lpppa,which,inter alia,obligates local housing authorities like the hanh to inspect and provide for the removal of lead paint hazards in section housing.
shade also asserted supplemental claims against john yost and john diduca,the landlords of davenport avenue and dixwell avenue,respectively.these claims were grounded in theories of negligence and negligence per se predicated on yost and diduca alleged violations of the connecticut unfair trade practices act and other connecticut statutes addressing hazards.
in june,twelve of the causes of action asserted in the complaint were tried before a jury.on june,after closing arguments,the district court,at the defendants request,instructed the jury that it should apportion compensatory damages among the defendants and gave the jury a verdict form calling for individually calculated damages against each responsible party.the next day,the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs on each cause of action.in accordance with the verdict form,the jury answered a number of interrogatories indicating its findings and calculations of damages.
the jury apportioned the damages as follows.orlando received a total of in compensatory damages.of that amount,was apportioned against hanh for the davenport avenue apartment,while was apportioned against yost for the same property was attributed to hanh for the dixwell avenue property,and was apportioned to diduca for that housing unit.danny received for his injuries at the dixwell avenue apartment,of which was apportioned to hanh and to diduca.
after the jury was dismissed,the defendants filed motions for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to.b and in the alternative for a new trial under.in a ruling dated august,the court denied the defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law but granted a new trial limited solely to the issue of damages.the court agreed with the defendants that the jury judgment was inconsistent and improper because the jurors followed the court incorrect instructions to apportion damages among the defendants.the court reasoned that the jury had erred because it had awarded each plaintiff two different awards to be paid by the defendants separately as compensation for a single injury,when it should have calculated one sum as compensation for each plaintiff injury at each property and awarded that amount jointly and severally against the responsible defendants.
the new trial on damages began on january.it consisted primarily of the conflicting assertions of the parties experts as to what had caused the minor plaintiffs alleged injuries.at the conclusion of the trial,the jury was instructed on the law of joint and several liability and returned a verdict of zero damages,finding that both minor plaintiffs had failed to show that exposure to lead was a substantial factor in causing their injuries.the court entered judgment accordingly.
shortly thereafter,the plaintiffs filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to,arguing that the outcome of the second trial represented a miscarriage of justice because it was inconsistent both with the finding of liability in the first trial and with medical evidence presented at the second.
the district court denied that motion on april,holding that the jury properly resolved the question of damages by weighing the credibility of each party expert,both of whom the court found qualified to testify on the issue of lead poisoning.
the plaintiffs timely appealed the original grant of the defendants motion for a new trial and the denial of their motion for a third trial.
