opinion of the court 
this matter is before the court on armstrong worldwide industries,awi appeal of the district court decision to deny confirmation of awi bankruptcy reorganization plan.in its decision,the district court concluded that the plan could not be confirmed because the distribution of warrants to awi equity interest holders over the objection of the class of unsecured creditors violated the absolute priority rule,as codified in b b.awi filed a timely appeal,contending that the issuance of warrants does not violate the absolute priority rule,and an equitable exception to the absolute priority rule applies.for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
facts and procedural history 
awi designs,manufactures,and sells flooring products,kitchen and bathroom cabinets,and ceiling systems.due to asbestos litigation liabilities,awi and two of its subsidiaries filed for chapter bankruptcy in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware on december.the united states trustee for the district of delaware appointed two committees to represent awi unsecured creditors the official committee of asbestos personal injury claimants apic,and the official committee of unsecured creditors ucc.the bankruptcy court appointed dean trafelet as the future claimants representative fcr.
after holding negotiations with apic,ucc,and fcr,awi filed its fourth amended plan of reorganization the plan and amended disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court in may.under the plan,awi creditors were divided into eleven classes,and awi equity interest holders were placed into a twelfth class.relevant to this appeal are class,a class of unsecured creditors class,a class of present and future personal injury claimants and class,the class of equity interest holders who own awi common stock.app.at.the only member of class is armstrong worldwide,awwd,the parent company of awi,which is in turn wholly owned by armstrong holdings,holdings.classes and hold equal priority,and have interests senior to those of class.app.at.all three are impaired classes because their claims or interests would be altered by the plan.
the plan provided that awi would place approximately billion of its assets into a trust for class pursuant to g.app.at.class members would be entitled to an initial payment percentage from the trust of of their allowed claims.app.at.meanwhile,class would recover about of its billion in claims.app.at.the plan would also issue new warrants to purchase awi new common stock,estimated to be worth to million,to awwd or holdings class.if class rejected the plan,then the plan provided that class would receive the warrants.app.at.however,the plan also provided that class would automatically waive receipt of the warrants,which would then be issued to awwd or holdings class.
the bankruptcy court set september,as the deadline for voting on the plan and for the parties to object to the plan confirmation.because the plan would distribute property to awi equity interest holders without fully paying off the unsecured creditors claims,all impaired unsecured creditor classes were required to approve the plan under a.if any impaired class objected to the plan,then the plan could only be crammed down if it was fair and equitable to the objecting class.see b.
ucc represented all of the classes of unsecured creditors,including class,during the negotiations that led to the plan.although ucc initially approved of the plan in may,it later filed a conditional objection to the plan confirmation on september,based on the greater potential distribution to creditors that would result if federal asbestos legislation was passed namely,the fair act,and the possible applicability of the absolute priority rule,as codified in b,if the plan was not accepted by all classes.
as indicated in its conditional objection,ucc reservations about the plan were prompted in part by the proposal of the fair act,which was reported out of the senate judiciary committee in july if passed,the fair act would remove personal injury claims from the courts and absolve asbestos defendants of liability in return for mandatory contributions to a federally supervised trust.app.at.awi contribution to the fair act trust was estimated to range from to million,far less than the billion it would put in trust for the class asbestos claimants under the plan.thus,if the fair act passed,approximately billion could be freed up for distribution among awi other creditors,including the class of unsecured creditors.
in response to ucc concerns about the fair act,the bankruptcy court extended the final deadline for voting to october.app.at.to accept the plan,class members holding at least fifty percent of the number of claims and of the amount of the claims would need to vote for the plan.see c.although of class claim holders voted for the plan,only of the amount of the claims voted to accept the plan.app.at.as a result,class rejected the plan.classes and accepted the plan,but class acceptance was rescinded under the plan due to class rejection.app.at.
following a hearing on november and,the bankruptcy court recommended confirmation of the plan to the district court in its december,proposed findings and conclusions.app.at.the bankruptcy court found that the absolute priority rule,as codified in section b of the bankruptcy code,was satisfied because the warrants were distributed to the holder of equity interests because of the waiver by class,citing in re genesis health ventures,bkrtcy,and in re spm,cir.in addition,the bankruptcy court found that ucc had waived its right to object to the plan when it entered into a consensual plan encompassing the plan provisions.app.at.because the plan included a channeling injunction under section g of the bankruptcy code,the district court was required to affirm the bankruptcy court proposed findings and conclusions before the plan could go into effect.app.at.
ucc filed objections to the bankruptcy court proposed findings and conclusions with the united states district court for the district of delaware.the district court held a hearing on the objections on december,and issued a memorandum and order on february,denying confirmation of the plan.the district court found that the issuance of warrants to the equity interest holders violated the absolute priority rule,and no equitable exception to the absolute priority rule applied.in re armstrong world.
awi now appeals the district court decision,and is joined by appellees apic and fcr,who jointly submitted a brief adopting and supporting awi arguments.
discussiona.jurisdiction 
this court has jurisdiction to hear appeals of all final decisions of the district courts.emphasis added.bank germain,d.in bankruptcy cases,finality is construed more broadly than for other types of civil cases.in re marvel entm t group,cir.because bankruptcy proceedings are often protracted,and time and resources can be wasted if an appeal is delayed until after a final disposition,our policy has been to quickly resolve issues central to the progress of a bankruptcy.see in re owens corning,cir.we consider four factors to determine whether a district court decision in a bankruptcy case is final the impact on the assets of the bankruptcy estate the need for further on remand the preclusive effect of a decision on the merits and the interests of judicial economy.see id.citing buncher official comm.of unsecured creditors of genfarm.iv,cir.
although appellee ucc contends that we can not hear this appeal because it involves an interlocutory order rather than a final order,we find jurisdiction after considering the above four factors.first,the district court denial of confirmation will likely affect the distribution of assets between the different creditor classes.see buncher,at.second,the issue presented here requires no additional.third,this appeal would require us to address a discrete question of law that would have a preclusive effect on certain provisions of the plan.lastly,practical considerations in the interests of judicial economy require that we hear this appeal now.because we find jurisdiction under,we will not address whether we also have jurisdiction under d.
standard of review 
we review the district court decision using a de novo standard for conclusions of law,and a clearly erroneous standard for findings of fact.in re pws holding,cir.whether a reorganization plan violates the absolute priority rule is a question of law.see in re johnston,cir.
confirmation of a reorganization plan 
confirmation of a proposed chapter reorganization plan is governed by.a court will confirm a plan if it meets all of the requirements set out in section a.only one of these requirements concerns us in this appeal,and that is the requirement that the plan be consensual,with unanimous acceptance by all of the impaired classes a.if the plan is not consensual,a court may still confirm as long as the plan meets the other requirements of section a,and does not discriminate unfairly,and is fair and equitable as to any dissenting impaired class.b see bank of am.trust sav.ass lasalle,d hereinafter lasalle.the latter type of confirmation is also called a cram down,as the court can cram a plan down over the objection of an impaired class.see generally kenneth klee,all you ever wanted to know about cram down under the new bankruptcy code,am.
the absolute priority rule 
the issues in this case require us to examine the fair and equitable requirement for a cram down,which invokes the absolute priority rule.the absolute priority rule is a judicial invention that predated the bankruptcy code.it arose from the concern that because a debtor proposed its own reorganization plan,the plan could be too good a deal for that debtor owners.lasalle,at.in its initial form,the absolute priority rule required that creditors be paid before the stockholders could retain equity interests for any purpose whatever.id.quoting pac.ry.boyd.emphasis added.
the absolute priority rule was later codified as part of the fair and equitable requirement of b.under the statute,a plan is fair and equitable with respect to an impaired,dissenting class of unsecured claims if it pays the class claims in full,or if it does not allow holders of any junior claims or interests to receive or retain any property under the plan on account of such claims or interests.b b i ii lasalle,at.
at the heart of this appeal is the plan provision that distributes warrants to awi equity interest holders class through class in the event that class rejects the plan.appellant awi argues that this provision does not violate the absolute priority rule because legislative history and historical context indicate that the rule does not prohibit the transfer of warrants to the equity interest holders under the current circumstances case law establishes that class can transfer part of its distribution under the plan to another claimant and the plan did not give the warrants to class on account of its equity interests.we address each of these contentions in turn.
interpreting the absolute priority rule 
first,awi suggests that this court should apply a flexible interpretation of the absolute priority rule based on its legislative history and historical context.because the absolute priority rule is now codified as part of the bankruptcy code,we will interpret it using standard principles of statutory construction.we begin by looking at the plain language of the statute.see united states ron pair,d.if the meaning is plain,we will make no further inquiry unless the literal application of the statute will end in a result that conflicts with congress intentions.id.at.in such a case,the intentions of congress will control.id.
awi contends that application of the absolute priority rule would be contrary to congress intentions because the rule was designed to prevent the squeezing out of intermediate unsecured creditors.see in re wabash valley power ass n,cir citing pac.ry.emphasis added.awi supports its claim with floor statements by representative don edwards and senator dennis deconcini,key legislators of the bankruptcy code.see begier,d considering these remarks as persuasive evidence of congressional intent.these statements indicate that a senior class will not be able to give up value to a junior class over the dissent of an intervening class unless the intervening class receives the full amount,as opposed to value,of its claims or interests.cong.rec.remarks of edwards on,and remarks of deconcini on,respectively emphasis added.awi argues that this language demonstrates that the absolute priority rule was not meant to apply to the situation before us because class is not an intervening or intermediate class,and is not being squeezed out by class transfer of warrants to class under the plan.
the absolute priority rule,as codified,ensures that the holder of any claim or interest that is junior to the claims of an impaired dissenting class will not receive or retain under the plan on account of such junior claim or interest any property.b b ii.the plain language of the statute makes it clear that a plan can not give property to junior claimants over the objection of a more senior class that is impaired,but does not indicate that the objecting class must be an intervening class.
we find that the plain meaning of the statute does not conflict with congress intent.the legislative history shows that section b was at least designed to address situations where a senior class gave property to a class junior to the dissenting class.other statements in the legislative history of section b,however,appear to apply the statute more broadly.for example,the house report for,the bill that was eventually enacted,states that section b codifies the absolute priority rule from the dissenting class on down,at,reprinted in.despite amendments to the original version of,the house report has been considered an authoritative source of legislative history for section b.see cong.rec.remarks of edwards on,and remarks of deconcini on,respectively t he house report remains an accurate description of confirmation of section b.in addition,the floor statements of representative edwards and senator deconcini do not rule out the possibility that an impaired class may object to a class distribution of property to a junior class.see id.as long as senior creditors have not been paid more than in full,and classes of equal claims are being treated so that the dissenting class of impaired unsecured claims is not being discriminated against unfairly,the plan may be confirmed if the impaired class of unsecured claims receives less than cents on the dollar or nothing at all as long as no class junior to the dissenting class receives anything at all.as a result,we will apply the plain meaning of the statute.under this reading,the statute would be violated because the plan would give property to class,which has claims junior to those of class.this finding does not end our consideration of this appeal,as awi makes further arguments regarding exceptions to the absolute priority rule.
transfers of bankruptcy distributions between creditors and equity interest holders 
second,awi contends that class may distribute the property it will receive under the plan to class without violating the absolute priority rule.awi derives this result from application of the rule,which is based on a line of cases where creditors were allowed to distribute their proceeds from the bankruptcy estate to other claimants without offending section b.see spm,permitting senior secured creditors to share bankruptcy proceeds with junior unsecured creditors while skipping over priority tax creditors in a chapter liquidation genesis health,at,allowing senior secured lenders to give up a portion of their proceeds under the reorganization plan to holders of unsecured and subordinated claims,without including holders of punitive damages claims in the arrangement,and allocate part of their value under the plan to the debtor officers and directors as an employment incentive package in re mcorp,permitting senior unsecured bondholders to allocate part of their claim to fund a settlement with the fdic over the objection of the junior subordinated bondholders.
the district court rejected this argument,and found that the line of cases was distinguishabl
