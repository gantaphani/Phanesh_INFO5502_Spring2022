background 
according to her amended complaint,steury marketed cardinal signature edition infusion device signature pump to various hospitals,including hospitals operated by the veterans administration,from march,until her termination on september.the signature pump is an electronic device that regulates the rate at which intravenous fluids flow into patients.steury alleges that the signature pump has a dangerous defect that can cause air bubbles to accumulate and ultimately release into a patient intravenous line,potentially resulting in serious injury or death.steury alleges that cardinal sold signature pumps to the veterans administration from until august,at which time cardinal suspended production,sales,repairs,and installation of the signature pump after certain devices were recalled by the food and drug administration for a separate problem.
steury alleges that she first became aware of the defect in the signature pump in october.steury asserts that mark diluciano,a pediatric anesthesiologist at children hospital of akron,informed susan springman,another alaris employee,that a signature pump had injected air into his patient intravenous line,and that a similar problem had been reported at children hospital of philadelphia.on may,steury allegedly met with john snow alaris area manager and nurses from children hospital of akron to discuss concerns about the signature pump.according to steury,snow discredited a nurse report of an infant mortality related to an intravenous air bubble.steury asserts that she and various other alaris employees again discussed the defect during a conference call on may,and at a meeting on may.
in june,snow allegedly informed steury that alaris had temporarily suspended shipments of signature pumps while it reviewed the defect,but nonetheless directed steury to continue marketing the signature pump.steury asserts that she was told to expect a final answer from snow within days.attached to steury complaint suggest that children hospital of akron continued to raise concerns about the signature pump between june and september.on september,alaris terminated steury employment.according to steury,she would have completed filling a major order of signature pumps by the veterans administration hospital of ohio only five days later.
steury sued cardinal on may,for alleged violations of the fca and a number of similar state statutes.the united states filed a notice of declination to intervene pursuant to b b on january.on november,before cardinal answered,steury filed an amended complaint.the amended complaint again raised claims under the fca and similar state statutes.in addition to the above factual allegations,steury amended complaint asserts,in relevant part 
a claimant submits a false or fraudulent claim within the meaning of the fca when he submits a claim for payment to the government for products that contain defective parts.
by accepting payment from the federal government or one of its agencies for the se infusion pumps,cardinal health knowingly misrepresented that the se infusion pumps were safe,reliable,and.
a false certification occurs when the government has conditioned payment of a claim upon the certification of compliance with,for example,a contract provision,regulation or statute.the claimant submits a false or fraudulent claim within the meaning of the fca when he or she falsely certifies compliance with that contract provision or statute.these certifications can either be express or implied.
an implied false certification theory occurs when a claimant submits a false claim without expressly certifying compliance with a contract provision,statute,regulation,or governmental program.liability is imposed on the premise of breach of contract or an implied responsibility,not a financial loss.
cardinal health is obligated to provide safe,reliable,and products,which perform to their specifications,to the government.by delivering and receiving payments for the se infusion pumps,cardinal health is impliedly certifying compliance with the terms of its contract with the government for the products.
cardinal moved to dismiss steury complaint on february,and the matter was referred to a magistrate judge.on august,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation finding,inter alia,that steury allegations of fraud did not satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of rule b and thus failed to state a claim under rule b.the magistrate judge recommended that steury complaint be dismissed without prejudice to the filing of an amended complaint within ten days,if this recommendation is adopted.both parties filed timely objections.on september,after de novo review,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation in full.on the same day,the district court entered a final judgment dismissing steury action.in bold letters,the district court confirmed that this is a final judgment.steury filed a timely notice of appeal on october.
