in this factually complicated case,plaintiff lisa mills was arrested and had her home searched in knox county,kentucky,incident to a charge of selling a marijuana cigarette to a teenager.the police apparently concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the case and the charge against her was later dropped.after her arrest,plaintiff was searched for contraband at the knox county jail.although the search was conducted by female jailers,she alleges that at one point during the search a male jailer passed by and saw her bare breasts during the search.she brought suit pursuant to against various officials in both their individual and official capacities,connected with the city of barbourville,the barbourville police department,knox county and the knox county jail,claiming that her constitutional rights were violated when the police searched her residence and arrested her pursuant to a defective warrant obtained through a faulty affidavit and a male jailer saw her bare chest during the search at the jail after her arrest.
plaintiff moved for summary judgment,and defendants made for summary judgment.before judgment was entered,plaintiff moved to dismiss a number of the defendants the motion was granted and these defendants were dismissed with prejudice.the district court awarded summary judgment to the remaining defendants and plaintiff moved to alter or amend the judgment.that motion was denied and plaintiff timely appealed.on appeal,plaintiff named knox county jailer preston smith as a party,despite the fact that he was dismissed below with prejudice as a result of plaintiff own motion.plaintiff also names several entities as parties to her appeal that were not named parties to the proceeding below the city of barbourville,the barbourville police department,knox county,and the knox county jail.we presume that naming these governmental entities as parties on appeal arises because plaintiff sued the city and county officials in their official capacities.
for the reasons set forth below,we reverse summary judgment for defendants officer michael broughton and police chief johnny smith of the barbourville police department because the search warrant used in this case does not establish any link between the place to be searched and any criminal activity and hence lacks probable cause.we agree with the district court that the facts in the record do not create a dispute of material fact giving rise to a constitutional violation regarding the search at the jail.
facts pertaining to the search of mills home and her subsequent arrest 
plaintiff first claim pertains to the allegedly faulty warrants that resulted in the search of her home and her arrest in violation of the fourth amendment.the parties relating to this claim are the city of barbourville,the barbourville police department,officer michael broughton and police chief johnny smith,although only the two officers were named,in both their individual and official capacities,in the complaint.
on march,a security officer at knox central high school informed the barbourville city police department that three of its students,leo cox,mike reynolds,and clayton moore,had skipped school and smoked marijuana.the three students were taken to the police station and questioned after being read their rights pursuant to miranda arizona,d.
according to separate statements signed by the boys,they collectively formed the intent to purchase a marijuana cigarette.cox told the other two that he knew where to get one.he took five dollars from moore,and told moore and reynolds to wait by a fence near union college.moore and reynolds stated that cox walked to the housing projects located on minton drive,and returned a few minutes later with the cigarette specifically,one boy said five minutes later,the other said fifteen.according to cox statement,he went to the housing projects located on north allison he knocked on a door and a woman by the name of lisa who has blonde hair open ed the door and told him to come in.cox asked her if she had a joint to sell and she said yes and went upstairs,returning a few minutes later with a marijuana cigarette.cox paid her five dollars for the cigarette and left.statement of leo cox,dated,at 
officer michael broughton of the barbourville police department,a defendant,prepared the statements of cox and moore,and officer robert brown,who was dismissed as a defendant and whose dismissal was not appealed,prepared reynolds statement.officer broughton claims that after taking the statements,he and defendant police chief johnny smith drove to the housing project with cox,and cox pointed out plaintiff residence on north allison avenue.broughton dep.at,at.they then returned to the station,where officer broughton prepared an affidavit for the search of plaintiff home and one for an arrest warrant.he then met with judge john knox mills no relation to plaintiff,who signed the warrants.
that afternoon,officer broughton and chief smith executed the warrants at plaintiff home.other officers were present,but broughton and smith conducted the search.they allegedly ransacked her home,damaging some of her personal property in the process.they found no drugs in the search,but did find what they termed drug paraphernalia rolling papers and plastic baggies.according to plaintiff,the baggies were in her son closet she claims they were for her son baseball and basketball cards,while the rolling papers were found on her dresser she claims they belonged to her deceased father,who used to smoke homemade tobacco cigarettes.they arrested plaintiff and took her to the knox county jail.the allegations giving rise to the separate claim concerning the conduct of the jailers will be recited below.
on march,officer broughton brought leo cox back in for another interview.broughton claims he reinterviewed cox of his own initiative in case i missed something.broughton dep.at,at at.according to officer broughton and officer brown,who was also present,cox began to cry and told them he had received a death threat that cox believed related to his statement against plaintiff.id.at,at.officer broughton then prepared another statement that cox signed saying that cox had lied about buying the marijuana from lisa mills,that he never bought any marijuana from her or went to her apartment,and that he made up the allegations in the statement he had signed on march.statement of leo cox,dated,at.
after cox recanted his statement,the course of the investigation and prosecution against plaintiff is unclear from the record before us.while a dispute exists as to whether plaintiff criminal case was ever presented to the grand jury,it is clear that no criminal charges arising out of the sale of the marijuana were pursued against plaintiff.
two years later,in may,plaintiff obtained an unsworn written statement by cox and witnessed by his mother,elaborating on his earlier recantation from march.statement of leo cox,dated may,at.in the statement,cox claims he bought the drugs from a friend named mills again,no relation to plaintiff who lived in the same housing project as plaintiff.he also claimed that false statements about plaintiff were pushed upon him during questioning by officer broughton.id.he says he was asked during his initial questioning if the last name of the person he brought the drugs from was mills.he said he did not know last name at the time but thought it would be harmless to agree.i mean,he was giving me an escape route.cox went on to state that to this day i do know where lisa mills lived and that he still did know what lisa looked like.id.
subsequent events have not clarified the situation.three months after plaintiff arrest,an mills was arrested for selling drugs.the police recovered drugs from his apartment,which plaintiff claims is directly on the other side of the fence from where reynolds and moore waited for cox,while her apartment was not within sight from the place where the two boys waited for cox.the person who could shed light on the situation,leo cox,was not deposed for this lawsuit and plaintiff counsel has stated her inability to find him.
facts pertaining to the search of plaintiff at the knox county jail 
plaintiff also claims that her constitutional rights were violated when a male deputy jailer saw her bare breasts during a search at the jail.plaintiff brings her claim against knox county,the knox county jail,knox county jailer johnny smith,and jail employees ray campbell,sonja warren and angel no relation to plaintiff.plaintiff was booked at the knox county jail at around on march.deputy jailers angel,who was newly hired and in training at the time,and sonja warren,the jail cook and employee who occasionally helped with other tasks,took plaintiff into a shower area or room to search her for contraband.plaintiff alleges,though the point is disputed,that there was no door to the room.for purposes of review,we will view the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff and assume that there was no door to the shower area.although the parties disagree as to whether to call the search a,at one point the jailers instructed plaintiff to raise her shirt and pull her bra up and out from her body so that any contraband hidden in her bra would fall out.plaintiff was not forced to remove her pants or to take her shirt or bra completely off.the jailers claim that although they do not search everyone taken into custody in this manner,it is routine for an inmate arrested on a drug charge in order to search for contraband.
plaintiff alleges that while she was standing with her shirt and bra up and bare chest exposed,male jailer ray campbell walked by the room.she claims that he saw her exposed chest and stopped and stared before continuing down the hall.she says that he did not turn his body or shoulders toward her or say anything,and she can not remember the expression on his face,but she claims that he did not move on or immediately look away from and stared at her.lisa mills dep.at,at.she did not say anything to him,to the women jailers searching her,or to anyone else at the jail about the incident at the time,but claims that she burst into tears,was distraught,and suffered mental injury from the experience.
campbell denies being at the jail at that time.some jail records,including pay records,indicate that his shift ended at that day.however,at some point he signed an incident report regarding plaintiff dated march,and plaintiff uncle claims that campbell was one of the jailers who escorted her back to the clerk office after the search.for purposes of review,we will view the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff and assume that campbell was present at the jail that afternoon and saw plaintiff bare breasts during the course of the search.
in order to prevail on a section claim,a plaintiff must establish the violation of a constitutional right by a person acting under color of state law.adickes kress,d street corrections of,cir.state officials are protected by qualified immunity that shields them from civil damages as long as their actions could reasonably have been thought consistent with the rights they are alleged to have violated.anderson creighton,d.
discussion of the barbourville claims 
we must determine whether plaintiff fourth amendment rights were violated as a result of the search of north allison avenue.plaintiff challenges both the underlying validity,as well as the sufficiency,of the allegations in the affidavit underlying the search warrant.she contends that the affidavit was not supported by probable cause and,further,that a reasonable officer in officer broughton or chief smith position would have known there was not probable cause for issuance of the warrant,rendering the application for and execution of the warrant a violation of a clearly established right.specifically,plaintiff asserts that there was no probable cause for the warrant because the affidavit supporting the warrant was either deliberately false or made with reckless disregard for the truth and the affidavit was insufficient because it failed to connect the place to be searched with any criminal activity and police failed to corroborate allegations made by leo cox in his statement,which served as the basis for the affidavit and warrant,or to ensure his reliability as a witness.also,though not named as parties below,on appeal plaintiff makes a claim against the city of barbourville and its police department.
the district court found that the affidavit provided probable cause to issue a warrant for the search of plaintiff home and that,even absent probable cause,defendants broughton and smith were entitled to qualified immunity because they reasonably believed the warrants were supported by probable cause.we reverse and remand because the affidavit supporting the search warrant for plaintiff home was not supported by probable cause and a reasonable officer in officer broughton and chief smith positions should have known that there was not probable cause to conduct the search.
officer broughton and police chief smith 
the fourth amendment states that the right of the people to be secure in their houses against unreasonable searches shall not be violated,and no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause,supported by oath or affirmation,and particularly describing the place to be searched const.amend.iv.in order to secure the right of privacy to people in their homes,the home may not be invaded by the government unless the search warrant establishes a relationship or link between the home and criminal activities.this is one of the reasons general searches are forbidden and only searches limited to a place are allowed.the warrant,or the attached affidavit,must establish the link so that there is probable cause to believe that the instrumentalities of criminal activity will be found there.in the present case,the warrant does not establish that link.
the affidavit supporting the search warrant issued for north allison avenue contained only the following statements in support of probable cause to search the location 
a ffiant received information from a male juvenile that lisa mills had sold the male juvenile a marijuana cigarette for five dollars.
a ffiant conducted the following independent investigation on the ist day of march a male juvenile gave a signed written statement to officer broughton stating that he had purchased a marijuana cigarette for five dollars from lisa mills.
at the unsworn statement of the male juvenile leo cox referred to in the affidavit was not attached to it nothing is stated about why north allison is being searched.
to determine whether probable cause exists to search a particular place,the magistrate asks whether given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.illinois gates,d accord united states murphy,cir quoting united states shamaeizadeh,cir.probable cause is generally defined as a sufficient quantum of evidence to convince a reasonable person that a crime has been committed and that fruits of the crime are likely to be present.black law dictionary ed.we must therefore assess whether the state judicial officer had a substantial basis for finding that the affidavit presented to support the warrant established probable cause to believe that the evidence would be found at the place cited.see united states shields,cir.in evaluating the issuing magistrate probable cause determination,we apply a flexible totality of the circumstances approach,which permits us to evaluate the particular facts of each case.gates,at.sufficient information must be presented to the magistrate to allow that official to determine probable cause his action can not be a mere ratification of the bare conclusions of others.id.
our review of whether this affidavit provides probable cause to search plaintiff home must begin with the fact that the affidavit did not mention that cox had purchased the marijuana at that location.the underlying affidavit neither connects the searched residence to any illegal activity nor states that a person engaging in illegal activity away from the residence lives at the searched residence.the affidavit contains no statement or other evidence that the male juvenile leo cox actually observed contraband on the premises of the place to be searched,no statement or evidence that plaintiff lisa mills,the person named in the affidavit as the one from whom cox purchased the marijuana cigarette,lives at north allison avenue,nor any other statement or evidence that ties plaintiff to the place to be searched.the affidavit does not indicate that officer broughton or chief smith performed any investigation to determine whether plaintiff lived at north allison avenue.although the officers claim that they took cox in a car and he identified north allison avenue as the residence from where he purchased the drugs,there is no indication that this knowledge was passed on to the magistrate.the officers independent knowledge,without some explanation in the affidavit,is insufficient to allow the magistrate to find probable cause that drugs would be found at north allison avenue.simply put,the affidavit does not provide the required nexus between the place to be searched and lisa mills.see united states carpenter,cir en banc united states helton,cir united states van shutters,cir noting that verification that defendant actually lived at the searched residence should have been included in the affidavit.
the district court found that qualified immunity shielded the named defendants from any liability for the searches.the doctrine of qualified immunity provides that government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.harlow fitzgerald,d.whether qualified immunity applies to an official actions is a question of law that we reviews de novo.see daugherty campbell,cir citing mitchell forsyth,d.
plaintiff fourth amendment right was violated by the deficient affidavit supporting the warrant.although officers are entitled to rely on a warrant for immunity in a section action claiming illegal search,if the warrant is so lacking in indicia of probable cause that official belief in the existence of probable cause is unreasonable,qualified immunity is not appropriate.malley briggs,d ruby horner,wl,cir.june,ahlers schebil,cir.in malley,the plaintiffs alleged that a police officer caused them to be arrested unconstitutionally by presenting to a judge a complaint and supporting affidavit that failed to establish probable cause.malley,at.the supreme court rejected an argument that a police officer who had been sued for making an allegedly unconstitutional arrest should be conclusively deemed entitled to immunity as long as an independent magistrate had issued a warrant for the arrest.the court subscribed to an objective reasonableness test where the warrant application is so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence unreasonable the shield of immunity will be lost.id.at.citation omitted.
under an objective reasonableness test,the officers will not be immune if,on an objective basis,it is obvious that no reasonably competent officer would have concluded that a warrant should issue but if officers of reasonable competence could disagree on this issue,immunity should be recognized.id.at.the proper inquiry,therefore,is whether a reasonably competent investigator armed with officer broughton and chief smith knowledge and experience could have believed that probable cause existed to search north allison avenue.because the officers presented absolutely no information in the affidavit presented to the magistrate indicating that the place to be searched was connected to lisa mills,either through a sworn statement that cox had identified the residence as the place of the drug purchase or through independent investigation corroborating that it was the home of lisa mills,the affidavit was so lacking in indicia of probable cause that official belief in the existence of probable cause is unreasonable.
claim against the city of barbourville and the barbourvile police department 
we first note that neither the city of barbourville nor the barbourville police department were named in the complaint below.plaintiff did sue officer broughton and chief smith in their official capacities,however,and we will presume that plaintiff is simply recasting her claim against the two police officers in their official capacities as claims against the governmental entities.monell dep t of soc,d.
generally,a governmental entity can not be held liable solely because it employs a tortfeasor,under a respondeat superior theory.governmental entities may be liable under section only for their formal official acts and policies,and also,under some circumstances,for practices so permanent and well settled as to constitute established custom.id.quoting adickes kress,d.in monell,the supreme court held that municipalities may be sued for damages under when the action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement,ordinance,regulation or decision officially adopted and promulgated by the body officers.id.at.a governmental entity will not,however,be held vicariously liable under for the random,unauthorized acts of its employees.id.at.
to succeed under this theory,therefore,plaintiff was required to show that the unlawful search resulted from an official policy or practice of the city or police department.plaintiff attempts to make out a failure to train argument by contending that the city of barbourville and the barbourville police department are responsible for the allegedly unconstitutional searches because the defendants claimed that the amount of evidence gathered in support of these warrants was typical of their practices.she argues that if the officers believe this amount of evidence is sufficient,their training and the policies of the department must be deficient.however,plaintiff acknowledged that the officers receive their initial training at one of the best law enforcement schools in the nation,trans.of pretrial conf.at,at that they receive at least some training on probable cause,her own expert,terry cox,has no concerns with the training of the barbourville officers on probable cause,id.at,at and she has no evidence that the city or department were ever put on notice that more training was needed.id.at,at.in sum,to the extent we may entertain plaintiff failure to train claim against the city of barbourville and its police department at all,the claim is without merit.
discussion of the knox county jail claims 
defendants warren,rogers and campbell 
plaintiff section claim against several of the knox county jailers arises from the claim that defendant ray campbell viewing of her bare breasts amounted to an unreasonable search.the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on the ground of qualified immunity.
in bell wolfish,d,the supreme court held that routine strip searching of pretrial detainees was not a per se violation of the fourth amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.in articulating the balancing test applicable to such searches,the court stated 
the test of reasonableness under the fourth amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application.in each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion,the manner in which it is conducted,the justification for initiating it,and the place in which it occurred.
plaintiff had been arrested on a drug charge and she concedes it was reasonable to search her for contraband under the circumstances.plaintiff claim appears to go to the location where she was searched,a shower area or room without a door,which she argues did not provide sufficient privacy to keep others,particularly members of the opposite gender,from seeing her.plaintiff argues that she should not have been searched in an open area and in front of campbell.trans.of pretrial conf,at mills dep.at,at.we will assume for purposes of this review that the shower area did not have a door,as plaintiff alleges.
