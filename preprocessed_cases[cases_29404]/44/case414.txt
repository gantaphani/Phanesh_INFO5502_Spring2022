background 
we recount and,for purposes of this appeal,accept as true the allegations in estades complaint see rockwell cape cod,cir.
in september,estades sought and began to receive psychiatric treatment from doctor luis canepa canepa,an employee and director of first option,at the facilities of first option.her treatment was provided pursuant to the puerto rico health reform plan the plan,which was enacted to ensure that medically indigent residents of puerto rico receive quality medical care.see laws ann.
in accordance with the plan,the puerto rico health insurance administration the administration,an instrumentality of the government of puerto rico,was created to implement a health insurance system for the medically indigent.see id.as a means to fulfill its primary purpose,the administration was given the authority to contract with private health insurance carriers to arrange for the provision of medical care to indigents see id.the carriers were then to hire medical professionals,and it was these professionals who were to provide the care.acting under the plan,the administration contracted with triple s,a private health insurance carrier,and triple s,in turn,contracted with first option and canepa 
between september and april,canepa treated estades on a regular basis.he diagnosed her as suffering from depression and prescribed for her a variety of medications.in april,estades mental health worsened and canepa began discussing her condition with her son,leonardo velazquez estades velazquez.
on may,after consulting with canepa,velazquez brought estades to cpc hospital,rather than to his house,where estades thought that he was taking her.upon arriving at cpc hospital,estades expressed a desire to leave.however,she was forcibly restrained,injected with medication,and placed in a secluded room.that same day,canepa sent a letter to cpc hospital in which he assured the hospital that it would soon receive written authorization for estades commitment.
velazquez,acting pursuant to puerto rico law law,laws ann.et,then filed a petition with the court of first instance for san juan,puerto rico,the local trial court,requesting that it authorize estades involuntary hospitalization.see id.in puerto rico,an individual can be involuntarily committed only pursuant to a court order.see id.one or more appellees also filed documents with the court of first instance in support of velazquez petition.see id.
estades remained involuntarily committed at cpc hospital for a period of nineteen days during that time,she alleges that she was secluded from other patients,physically restrained,injected with medication against her will,physically assaulted by an employee of cpc hospital,and physically and emotionally mistreated by other hospital employees.at the end of the nineteen days,and as a condition of her discharge,estades claims that she was coerced into agreeing that her commitment had been voluntary.
following her discharge,estades brought this action against first option,canepa,cpc hospital,and a number of private physicians who had interacted with her during her hospitalization.in the complaint,estades asserted federal and state causes of action,including a claim,against each appellee.the federal counts were dependent on the viability of the claim.on appellees motion,the district court dismissed the federal counts,based on its finding that estades had failed to allege sufficient facts to establish that appellees were state actors and,thus,subject to suit under.the district court determined that estades could not show state action under any of the following three tests we have employed to decide whether a private party should be treated as a state actor the state compulsion test,the action test,and the public function test.then,acting pursuant to c the district court refused to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims and,consequently,dismissed the entire action 
estades appeals the dismissal of her claim and the resulting dismissal of her claim and state law claims.of course,if the claim was subject to dismissal,then the district court had the authority to dismiss the claim,as well as the state law claims.see c.therefore,we must decide whether the district court erred in dismissing the claim.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court dismissal of estades claim de novo.rockwell,at.
section provides a remedy for deprivations of rights secured by the constitution and laws of the united states when that deprivation takes place under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state lugar edmondson oil,d quoting.therefore,a plaintiff claiming a violation must allege that a person or persons acting under color of state law deprived him of a federal constitutional or statutory right.see rockwell,at.if the plaintiff fails to allege facts sufficient to establish either the deprivation of a federal right or that the defendant or defendants acted under color of state law,then the claim is subject to dismissal.
here,there is no dispute that estades,in asserting that she was involuntarily committed,alleged the deprivation of a federal right.see,harvey harvey,cir holding that an individual who is involuntarily committed is deprived of his constitutional right to liberty.the disagreement is over whether she alleged facts sufficient to establish that appellees,private individuals and entities,acted under color of state law when they participated in her involuntary commitment.for appellees to have acted under color of state law,their actions must be fairly attributable to the state.lugar,at.in other words,it must be fair to characterize them as state actors.see id 
it is o nly in rare circumstances that private parties can be viewed as state actors.harvey,at.we have employed the following three tests to determine whether a private party fairly can be characterized as a state actor the state compulsion test,the action test,and the public function test.rockwell,at see perkins londonderry basketball club,cir.the district court considered each of these tests on the assumption that,were any of them met,the state action requirement would be satisfied.the parties accepted this approach,and therefore,we follow it as well.
under the state compulsion test,a private party is fairly characterized as a state actor when the state has exercised coercive power or has provided such significant encouragement,either overt or covert,that the challenged conduct must in law be deemed to be that of the state.blum yaretsky,d.the action test provides that a private party can be held to be a state actor where an examination of the totality of the circumstances reveals that the state has so far insinuated itself into a position of interdependence with the private party that it was a joint participant in the challenged activity.bass parkwood,cir internal quotation marks omitted first alteration in original see perkins,at.and,in accordance with the public function test,a private party is viewed as a state actor if the plaintiff es
