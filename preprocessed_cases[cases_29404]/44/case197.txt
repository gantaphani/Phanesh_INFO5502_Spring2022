background 
are the administrator of the estate and the surviving children of jason goncalves,who was killed in an automobile accident that resulted when josimar pereira,the driver of a vehicle in which goncalves was a passenger,attempted to flee pawtucket,rhode island police officers.asserting federal constitutional and state tort claims arising out of this incident,the plaintiffs filed suit in rhode island state court against the officers,the city of pawtucket,the pawtucket police department ppd,and the city police chief in his official capacity.the defendants removed to federal court pursuant to.subsequently,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment in part,dismissing the plaintiffs constitutional claims.the court denied the plaintiffs motion to remand the remaining state law tort claims against the individual officers,and the matter went to trial.
during their case in chief,the plaintiffs sought to establish that the officers were reckless in their decision to initiate and continue their pursuit of pereira and in failing to comply with ppd policy concerning pursuits 
as to the first claim,officers christopher lombardi and richard laforest testified that on the friday afternoon of august,they were patrolling a section of pawtucket in a marked police cruiser.lombardi was driving.during their patrol,the officers received a radio dispatch advising them to be on the lookout for a suspect in two recent armed robberies in nearby providence.the broadcast provided a physical description of the suspect and his vehicle,a teal,sedan with a temporary license plate in the rear window.
when shortly thereafter the officers caught sight of an automobile matching this description,they sought to get a look at the vehicle driver.as lombardi conducted a turn to be able to do so,however,the car sped away.it accelerated to the end of the street,turned onto a crossroad without stopping at a stop sign,and proceeded to pass other vehicles by straddling the yellow lines separating the oncoming traffic lane.
the officers testified that,with their suspicion seemingly confirmed by this behavior,they activated the cruiser lights and siren and attempted to catch up to the vehicle.the suspect sped through the rush hour traffic of downtown pawtucket at varying speeds of up to sixty to seventy miles per hour,disobeying traffic signals in the process.the officers testified that although they,too,exceeded the posted speed limit of miles per hour,sometimes by at least fifteen miles per hour,they stopped or slowed down at every intersection.as a result,they testified,they were unable to get within feet of the vehicle and even lost sight of it for thirty seconds of the pursuit.
after approximately two minutes had elapsed and miles had been covered,and with the officers trailing to feet behind,the driver of the teal vehicle ran a red light at high speed and collided with another car in the intersection.the occupants of the teal vehicle were thrown from the vehicle upon impact.it was not until lombardi and laforest reached the scene of the accident and saw the vehicle occupants for the first time that they realized that neither the driver,josimar pereira,nor the passenger,jason goncalves,matched the physical description of the robbery suspect given in the radio dispatch.
the plaintiffs hoped to cast doubt upon this version of events with the testimony of pereira,who,they claimed,would testify that the officers were within two car lengths of his vehicle for the entirety of the chase.the plaintiffs sought to admit pereira testimony in deposition form,arguing that because he was imprisoned at the time of trial,federal rule of civil procedure a c permitted admission of his deposition in lieu of live testimony when the district court rejected the plaintiffs contention that pereira was unavailable within the meaning of the rule notwithstanding that he could be made to appear for live testimony,the plaintiffs moved for a continuance to secure his presence.noting that the issue had been previously discussed during the course of proceedings,the district court denied this request.as a result,the officers account of the chase itself remained uncontroverted.
testimony relating to whether departmental pursuit policies were followed was,however,somewhat less.the pawtucket police manual of procedures describes the circumstances under which officers may engage in a high speed pursuit defined as a pursuit in excess of fifteen miles per hour over the posted speed limit and imposes procedures to be followed in the event that such a pursuit is undertaken.the plaintiffs probed whether the officers complied with two of those requirements,in particular.
the first is the requirement that responding officers and their shift supervisors assess the value of apprehending the fleeing operator in relation to the potential dangers of doing so,to ensure that a pursuit is justified in its inception and continuation the policy lists several factors to consider when conducting that assessment,including the amount of vehicular and pedestrian traffic,location,weather conditions,road surface conditions,time of day,the officers knowledge of the road and surrounding area,the performance capabilities of the pursuit vehicle and the vehicle being pursued,and any other potentially hazardous conditions known to the officer.when questioned by the plaintiffs about whether he had taken these factors into account in deciding to initiate and continue the pursuit,laforest admitted that he had not.lombardi,who was driving the cruiser,stated that he was aware of the factors.he,however,was not asked whether he had considered them.
the second relevant policy requirement,aimed at supervisor oversight,calls for officers to notify the dispatcher as soon as is practicable that a pursuit has commenced,and to provide ongoing updates about location,speed,and attendant circumstances as the pursuit unfolds.the officers testified that laforest notified dispatch of the pursuit as soon as the cruiser lights and siren were activated and provided updates every ten to fifteen seconds thereafter.this account was called into question,however,by the testimony of lieutenant daniel mullen,the supervising officer at the time of the event who monitored the radio transmissions from his cruiser,and robert langlois,the police dispatcher.both mullen and langlois recalled receiving only two radio transmissions the initial call and notification of the accident only seconds later.mullen indicated that the time that elapsed between the transmissions was of such short duration that he had no opportunity to assume control of the pursuit.langlois noted that there was a second dispatcher,but that he himself responded by radio only twice.
without more,the plaintiffs rested.as they did so,they voluntarily dismissed their negligence and the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law on the sole remaining claim of recklessness.the defendants asserted that the evidence did not support a finding that the officers conduct in initiating and carrying out the chase evinced a reckless disregard for the safety of others,while the plaintiffs focused their response on the theory that the evidence established a violation of the pawtucket pursuit policy,which they claimed constituted evidence of recklessness sufficient to submit the case to a jury.the defendants contested not only these assertions but also the underlying assumption that the pursuit policy applied at all.
the district court granted the rule a motion.without definitively determining whether the officers had been engaged in a pursuit such that the departmental pursuit policy applied,the court concluded that no reasonable jury could find that the officers had acted with reckless disregard for the safety of others notwithstanding any violation of the policy.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,the plaintiffs challenge the district court denial of their motion to remand the action to state court,the preclusion of pereira testimony,and the climactic grant of the defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law.we address these points in turn.
supplemental jurisdiction 
the plaintiffs first argue that the district court should not have retained jurisdiction over this matter once the federal claims were decided against them on summary judgment.they assert that we should review the district court denial of their motion to remand de novo and conclude that the district court erred.neither the standard of review nor the result is warranted.
to be sure,there are instances in which we review a district court denial of a motion to remand de novo,such as when the motion challenges the existence of a federal claim upon which federal jurisdiction is predicated.see biw deceived local,indus.union of marine and shipbuilding workers of america,iamaw dist.lodge,cir.once a case is properly before a federal district court,however,that court has broad authority to retain jurisdiction over pendant state law claims even if the federal claim is later dismissed.roche john hancock mut.life ins,cir in a case,the termination of the foundational federal claim does not divest the district court of power to exercise supplemental jurisdiction but,rather,sets the stage for an exercise of the court informed discretion.citing c authorizing but not requiring a district court to decline adjudication of lingering claims after it has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.in determining whether to retain jurisdiction on such an occasion,the court must take into account considerations of judicial economy,convenience,fairness to the litigants,and comity.id.at.in the end,though,its decision is a pragmatic and one that we review only for abuse of discretion.id.
the district court decision here to retain jurisdiction over the plaintiffs state law claims after dismissing the federal claims fell squarely within the realm of its discretion.at the time of the plaintiffs motion to remand,the case had passed through every phase of litigation but trial.moreover,the court had already determined many substantial questions of state law at summary judgment.under such circumstances,the interests of judicial economy and fairness weighed in favor of retaining jurisdiction.we therefore conclude that the district court appropriately exercised its discretion.
precluded testimony 
the plaintiffs next take issue with rulings by the district court that prevented them from admitting the testimony of josimar pereira.they argue that the district court erred first in denying use of pereira deposition testimony under federal rule of civil procedure a c and then in refusing to grant a continuance to secure pereira live testimony.we disagree on both counts.
deposition testimony 
rule a c allows for the admission of a witness deposition testimony in lieu of live testimony where the court finds that the witness can not attend or testify because of age,illness,infirmity,or imprisonment.a c.there is no dispute that although pereira was imprisoned,he could have been made available to testify at trial by means of a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum.the plaintiffs nonetheless sought to admit pereira deposition,contending that pereira imprisonment rendered him ipso facto unavailable within the meaning of the rule.
while ordinarily we review a district court refusal to admit deposition testimony for abuse of discretion,daigle maine medical center,cir,the parties disagreement here centers not on the application of rule a c but on its interpretation.in such circumstances,de novo review is appropriate.in re pharm.indus.average wholesale price,cir citing nepsk,town of houlton,cir.
in interpreting a formal rule of procedure,our starting point is the language of the rule itself.downy bob disc.furniture holdings,cir citations omitted.we interpret this language with due regard to its ordinary meaning and the context in which it is found.in re pharm.indus.average wholesale price,at citations omitted.
a plain,common sense reading of rule a c illustrates the weakness in the plaintiffs position.the rule requires as a prerequisite to the admission of deposition testimony that the court find that the witness can not attend or testify because of one of the enumerated conditions.a c emphasis added.by its terms,then,the rule does not permit the use of deposition testimony where the age,illness,infirmity,or imprisonment of a witness provides no basis to conclude that the witness is unable to provide live testimony.moreover,this reading makes sense as a practical matter.it would be startling to suggest that deposition testimony should be substituted,based on nothing more than merely citing a witness age or asserting that a witness was ill,without establishing why age or illness presented a genuine barrier to live testimony.similarly,a credible claim can not be made that pereira should be excused from testifying in person without establishing that his imprisonment prevents him from doing so.
contrary to the plaintiffs suggestion,another section,a b,supports rather than undermines this conclusion.rule a b allows admission of deposition testimony where the witness is more than miles from the place of hearing or trial.a b.we have held that so long as this distance criterion is satisfied,the admissibility of deposition testimony under the aegis of rule a b is not contingent upon a showing that the witness is otherwise unavailable.daigle,at.critically,however,rule a b does not contain the requirement that the court find that the witness can not attend or testify because of distance.compare.a c,with.a b.one therefore can not simply graft our interpretation of rule a b onto rule a c indeed,in order to give any effect at all to the difference in the construction of these two provisions,we must reject the plaintiffs attempt to do so.united states menasche,it is our duty to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute quotation omitted.
in sum,the district court was correct to reject the plaintiffs construction of federal rule of civil procedure a c and to refuse to admit pereira deposition where it had found that he was,in fact,available for live testimony.
motion to continue 
the plaintiffs argue that even if pereira was not unavailable for the purposes of federal rule of civil procedure a c,the district court should have granted their request for a continuance so they could procure pereira live testimony through a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum.they characterize their request as for a continuance of roughly an hour,noting that they made the request around,and the court was scheduled to recess at.they further emphasize that because the jury was set to return the following morning to deliberate,the continuance would not have resulted in keeping the jury empaneled for an additional day.
district courts enjoy broad discretion in managing their dockets,and we review a denial of a motion for a continuance for abuse of that discretion only.macaulay anas,cir.in conducting this review,we look primarily to the persuasiveness of the trial court reasons for refusing the continuance and give due regard not only to the factors which inform that court ruling but also to its superior point of vantage.united states ottens,cir.the burden is on the aggrieved party to demonstrate that in refusing the continuance,the district court exhibited an unreasonable and arbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay.united states rodríguez durán,cir quoting united states rodriguez marrero,cir.
the plaintiffs have not met this high burden.the record indicates that opposing counsel had made known its objection to the admission of pereira deposition testimony and the issue was discussed at the final conference.although the record does not disclose the content of those discussions,this much is known they prompted the plaintiffs to speak to legal counsel at the correctional institute at which pereira was imprisoned to determine whether pereira could be made to appear by means of a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum.despite confirming that this was indeed a possibility,the plaintiffs opted not to pursue it,choosing instead to rely on their proposed interpretation of rule a c.moreover,they did so notwithstanding that they had ample opportunity prior to trial to resolve the issue and,if necessary,to obtain a court order to secure pereira presence.we see no abuse of discretion in the district court decision to deny the plaintiffs request for a continuance to remedy the foreseeable and easily avoidable predicament that resulted when they lost their gamble.see united states saccoccia,cir r elevant factors in our analysis may include such things as the extent to which the movant has contributed to his perceived predicament.
judgment as a matter of law 
the plaintiffs last assignment of error concerns the entry of judgment as a matter of law.we review such dispositions de novo,based on an examination of the evidence and inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in the light most hospitable to the nonmoving party.fashion house,k mart,cir citing wagenmann adams,cir.in conducting this review we do not pass upon the credibility of witnesses,resolve evidentiary conflicts,or evaluate the weight of the evidence.id.citing wagenmann,at.withdrawing a claim from the jury is appropriate only if the evidence,viewed from this perspective,compels a result as to which reasonable minds could not differ.id.
where,as here,a federal court exercises supplemental jurisdiction over a state law claim,state law supplies the rule of decision.hoyos telecorp commc ns,cir.to recover under rhode island law,the plaintiffs bore the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence the standard elements of a tort claim a legally cognizable duty owed by a defendant to a plaintiff,a breach of that duty,proximate causation between the conduct and the resulting injury,and the actual loss or damage.olshansky rehrig.inasmuch as the defendants were alleged to have been engaged in the pursuit of an alleged violator of the law and activated their lights and siren during the pursuit,they can be held liable in tort only if their conduct constituted a reckless disregard for the safety of others.see laws.in other words,the plaintiffs were required to prove that the defendants conducted themselves in such a manner as to demonstrate a heedless indifference to the consequences of their action.roberts kettelle.
the district court concluded that no reasonable jury could find that the plaintiffs had satisfied this burden.highlighting uncontradicted testimony that the officers stopped or slowed down at every intersection,and never closed within feet of pereira vehicle,the court found that the evidence compelled the conclusion that they did not exhibit reckless disregard for the safety of others in balancing their simultaneous duties to investigate the vehicle matching the description in the radio broadcast and to avoid undue risk of harm to innocent bystanders in the process.
on appeal,as at the close of evidence in the district court,the plaintiffs challenge rests primarily on alleged violations of the ppd pursuit policy.the plaintiffs assert that under rhode island law,a pursuit policy violation is evidence of recklessness sufficient to submit the question of breach of a duty of care to a jury,and the evidence presented at trial could support a jury finding that the officers violated their department pursuit policy by failing to consider the various factors required to assess the dangerousness of the pursuit relative to the potential advantage of apprehending the suspect and by failing to notify their shift lieutenant of the pursuit as soon as practicable the argument fails.
the plaintiffs rely on seide state,in which the rhode island supreme court vacated a judgment granted as a matter of law in favor of police officers who had engaged in a lengthy and dangerous chase of a fleeing car thief that resulted in the death of an innocent bystander.in seide,testimony established that the officers pursued the thief who prior to the officers intervention had driven safely and within the speed limit for more than thirty minutes as he disregarded traffic signals,drove through downtown providence erratically,swerved at police cruisers,struck objects,repeatedly exited and reentered major highways,reached speeds of approximately ninety miles per hour,and endangered the safety of the police officers and the driving public.id.at.
the court held,inter alia,that this evidence could reasonably lead to the conclusion that the officers failure to terminate the chase sooner despite the obvious risks that it posed was in reckless disregard for the safety of others.id.noting that the plaintiff had also alleged that the defendants were reckless by virtue of their failure to comply with their department pursuit policy,the court,without further elaboration,briefly indicated that a violation of a pursuit policy could serve as evidence of recklessness.id.at emphasis added.it is this last statement which serves as the foundation of the plaintiffs appeal in this case.
seide,however,is not as definitive as the plaintiffs claim.to begin,the court quite understandably did not say that any violation of a pursuit policy necessarily constitutes evidence of recklessness,regardless of how remote the connection between the purported violation and the alleged risk.although the court sensibly observed that a pursuit policy may serve as a standard against which a jury could measure officer conduct,the specific holding in seide was limited to the determination that the violation of the policies at issue in that case could serve as evidence of recklessness.id.that is not the same as saying that any pursuit policy violation creates an issue for the jury.
a violation of the requirement to engage in a particular decisional calculus or to notify and update the dispatch center of the status of the pursuit does not necessarily equate to recklessness.and,in any event,the plaintiffs evidence of the former violation was starkly deficient although officer laforest acknowledged that he did not consider the relevant factors,the driver,officer lombardi,was never asked whether he considered them.
in the main,pursuit policies are designed to guide officers,not to create an independent source of liability.see,courville on behalf of vincent city of lake charles,so d,we find that a violation of departmental pursuit policies is not negligence per se.norris zambito,a violation of voluntarily adopted safety policies is merely some evidence of negligence and does not conclusively establish negligence.citations omitted saarinen kerr,a violation of this policy,if in fact it occurred,would be an important,although not dispositive,factor in determining whether the defendant had acted recklessly.the ultimate issue,in other words,is not lack of compliance with pursuit policies,but recklessness.
while the plaintiffs peg their showing of recklessness mostly on the mere existence of alleged policy violations,they also argue albeit in lackluster and conclusory fashion that,regardless of the department policies,the officers decision to continue the pursuit was reckless conduct in light of the attendant circumstances.this argument cuts closer to the substantive heart of the issue,and while the plaintiffs presentation of the claim risked forfeiture,we consider it separately on the merits.
the gist of the matter is this that for the police to chase a suspect for a considerable period at very high speed,trying to box him in and bring him to a halt with hastily erected roadblocks surrounded by innocent drivers as the suspect travels the wrong way on a divided highway,does present a jury issue as to recklessness,see seide,at but the present case is quite different and does not.by the police account which was the only version available to the jury
