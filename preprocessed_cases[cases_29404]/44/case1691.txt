background 
plaintiff lisa learmonth was seriously injured in a car accident at the intersection of mississippi state highways and.the collision involved learmonth car,which she was driving,and a sears,roebuck and company sears van driven by james mcclelland,a sears employee.sears contested both liability and damages at trial.
the primary factual dispute as to liability was which driver was traveling on highway,which runs north and south,and which driver was traveling on highway,which runs east and west at that juncture.the question was a critical one,as there is a stop sign on highway no stop sign on highway the intersection where the accident took place.therefore,whoever was driving on highway had the.both drivers claimed that the other had been traveling east on highway and had run the stop sign at the intersection,causing the collision.
eight fact witnesses testified in connection with the liability issue,including learmonth and mcclelland.learmonth,who suffered head trauma from the collision,testified that she did not remember the accident itself,but that she had been heading north on highway to pick up her mother that day and had called her mother from a town south of the intersection on highway.phone records verified that learmonth called her mother about fifteen minutes before the accident occurred.mcclelland testified that he completed a service call at the home of bud dees,a north of the intersection on highway,and was driving south on highway when learmonth car entered his path.at trial,he testified that he could not remember what time he left dees home,but in earlier depositions he testified that he left around.the accident occurred around sears submitted an affidavit stating that it was unable to locate any information or records,electronic or otherwise,regarding the service calls,deliveries,or repairs made by mcclelland on the day of the accident,and it was thus unable to confirm mcclelland whereabouts on the day of the accident.
one eyewitness testified that he saw the sears van run the stop sign.two other witnesses placed learmonth traveling north on highway near the time of the accident one of those witnesses stopped to render aid at the scene until emergency personnel arrived.three witnesses,including mcclelland,testified that the vehicles came to rest in the northeast quadrant of the intersection.one witness,however,placed the sears van in the northeast quadrant and learmonth car in the northwest quadrant.
several witnesses testified about mcclelland actions immediately following the accident.two witnesses stated that he ran towards or into the woods near the intersection,with one of those witnesses testifying that he walked over there like he was throwing something.that same witness stated that the dude acted like he was going to take off from the scene.another witness did not see mcclelland run toward the woods,but testified that he was pacing near the woods and never approached learmonth car or tried to help learmonth.mcclelland testified that he ran away from the van because he thought it was on fire.he further testified that he returned to retrieve his cell phone when he saw that the van was not on fire that he called his supervisor and not because another person was already calling and that he did not approach learmonth car because emergency personnel were on the way.
two accident reconstruction experts also testified at length concerning liability.learmonth expert opined that,based on the measurements taken of the damage to the vehicles and assuming that their final resting place was in the northeast quadrant,learmonth car was struck while traveling north on highway by the larger sears van traveling east on highway.in his view,it was not plausible that both vehicles would come to rest in the northeast quadrant of the intersection if the larger van,traveling south,struck the car at a high rate of speed when the car ran a stop sign traveling east.instead,the van would have pushed the car to the south side of the intersection.sears expert testified that there was not enough physical evidence to determine the sequence of events or the cause of the collision.
learmonth was seriously injured in the accident,suffering,among other things,traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness multiple fractured bones in her pelvic area which required a permanent screw a broken collarbone acute anemia and puncture wounds and lacerations to her face and shoulder.she was hospitalized for five days after the accident,confined to a wheelchair for two months,and on crutches for several weeks after that.her fractures have healed,but learmonth testified at trial that she continues to experience chronic pain in her lower back and pain from nerve damage in her left leg.she receives epidural steroid injections one to three times a year for pain alleviation,and will continue to do so for the next ten to fifteen years.she testified that the injections provide some relief for her leg pain,but very little relief for her back pain.
learmonth also presented evidence that she suffered from short and memory loss,headaches,blackouts,and depression,although not all of these ailments were documented in her medical records.her testified that the learmonth ensuing physical and emotional the cause of their divorce.evidence was also offered of learmonth decreased capacities for housecleaning,playing with her son,and taking care of herself.
learmonth has held three jobs since the at a restaurant,selling clothes at a retail store,and working as a bank teller.she left the restaurant because she could not perform the tasks required due to physical and emotional problems her injured collarbone prevented her from lifting the server trays over her head,as required,while the emotional problems manifested themselves in frequent crying.she left her retail job because it entailed too much standing,and left the teller job on her doctor recommendation due to the pain she experienced from sitting and standing for long periods of time.
at the conclusion of the trial,the jury found sears liable for learmonth injuries and awarded her million in compensatory damages.the verdict on its face did not divide the award into separate categories,but the parties agree that the total award can be divided as follows approximately million for lost earnings in past and future medical expenses and approximately million in damages.
sears moved for a new trial,arguing that learmonth counsel made improper comments during opening and closing statements,that the district court admitted improper evidence at trial,and that the jury verdict was so exaggerated that it reflected bias,passion,and prejudice.sears moved in the alternative for remittitur on the grounds that the award exceeded both the bounds of reasonable recovery for injuries of the type learmonth sustained,as well as mississippi statutory cap of million on damages,ann.b supp.learmonth argued,for her part,that section b violates the mississippi constitution.
the district court denied sears motion for a new trial,but rejected learmonth challenge to the constitutionality of section b and remitted the damages award to million.this appeal and followed.
ii.discussion 
motion for new trial 
sears argues that the district court erred in denying a new trial based on improper comments made by plaintiff counsel during the opening and closing statements,and the admission of irrelevant and prejudicial evidence at trial.a new trial will not be granted based on trial error unless,after considering the record as a whole,the court concludes that manifest injustice will result from letting the verdict stand.we will reverse the trial court denial of a motion for a new trial only when there is a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.foradori harris,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
improper comments by plaintiff counsel

sears objects to the following statements,listed in the order in which they were made at trial 
sears roebuck has gone on about their business making money.
i not going to say what happened concerning the missing service records from mcclelland laptop.but i know,let me tell you,we live in a society where business can be cold and cruel and they do what they need to to survive.we know that.
and to me,that sun standing still referring to mcclelland testimony that he left bud dees home at but could not explain what he was doing before the accident occurred almost two hours later keeps him from being credible altogether with me.
well,number one,i do believe that he did know where he was referring again to mcclelland testimony about the time gap.i believe he made up that story about story.
does a credible person jump out of a car and run into the woods now,you may not believe he did.but cleveland does know anybody from adam house cat,happened to be standing out there and saw him run off to the woods.candy nance saw him running around everywhere.the patrolman said he did,but the patrolman did get there until eight or ten minutes after the accident.by then,he was back.that one way to judge mcclelland credibility,i think.
and believe you me,some of this testimony would be undisputed if there was any way to dispute it.i can promise you that.somebody would have been here to dispute it,because their resources are far more powerful than ours.
and i talked to you about all the injuries that this woman had.man,how much more banged up can you get than to have all the bones broken and everything how much more banged up can you get and what do they say oh,she was all right in three months.well,they could have had her examined by their own doctor if they had wanted.
you know,there is such a contrast between bud dees and candy nance.i mean,i think candy nance is a great person.do ask me what i think of bud dees,because i ca use that kind of language.
and you know,everything is relative.whether something is big or little,it relative.it depends.to me or somebody else maybe,that just so much money.but what if you were in lisa place you know 
sears objection to the comments concerning witness,and not properly preserved for appeal because sears neither objected to them during trial,nor raised them before the district court in proceedings.accordingly,we review those statements for plain error only and will reverse only if necessary to preserve a party substantial rights.see.whitehead,at.we have held that it is permissible for an attorney to make statements that indicate his opinion or knowledge of the case if the attorney makes it clear that the conclusions he is urging are conclusions to be drawn from the evidence.united states thompson,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.statements and may fall within this description,whereas statements and are more questionable.nevertheless,we do not find that the statements were so erroneous as to affect sears substantial rights.indeed,the weight of the evidence showed an unexplained lapse of time between mcclelland leaving dees home at and the accident at,a key issue regarding liability given that dees home is on highway just a quarter of a mile north of the intersection where the collision took place.
the parties dispute whether we should consider comments and.the district court sustained sears objection to those comments at trial,stating that they were matters outside of the record,but sears did not identify them in its briefing until its reply brief in support of its motion for a new trial.we need not decide the issue,however,because even if we consider those comments together with the other remaining comments,they do not rise to a level of manifest injustice requiring reversal.
sears argues that learmonth counsel used improper arguments in statements,and.a argument is any impassioned and prejudicial plea intended to evoke a sense of community loyalty,duty and expectation.westbrook,at.such an argument often invokes the parties relative popular appeal,identities,or geographical locations to prejudice the viewpoint of the jury against an corporation.guaranty serv.am.emp rs ins,cir.sears also asserts that learmonth counsel argued a fact not in evidence in statement and used an improper golden rule argument in statement.a golden rule argument suggests that the jury place themselves in the plaintiff position and do unto him as they would have him do unto them.whitehead,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
we agree with sears that these comments were improper,but the impropriety was effectively cured by the court sustainment of sears objections to each of the statements at trial,as well as by the court jury charge,which instructed the jury that i n deciding the facts of this case you must not be swayed by sympathy or bias or prejudice or favor as to either party that corporations and individuals have equal standing in the community and that the lawyers arguments are not evidence.moreover,the failure of defense counsel to seek a mistrial suggests that any lingering prejudice from the improper comments was minimal.united states,cir.the district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in denying sears motion for a new trial on the basis of these improper comments.
admission of improper evidence 
testimony as to mcclelland conduct 
we review a district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.abner kansas city so,cir.sears argues that testimony pertaining to mcclelland conduct should have been excluded as irrelevant under federal rule of evidence,or,in the alternative,as unfairly prejudicial under rule.sears motion in limine to exclude this evidence was sufficient to preserve the issue for appeal,even absent objection at trial.see mathis exxon,cir.
evidence that is not relevant is inadmissible under rule.relevant evidence is that which has any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.the central issue as to liability at trial was which driver,learmonth or mcclelland,was traveling east on highway and failed to stop at the stop sign.to the extent that mcclelland testimony on his conduct immediately following the he ran into the woods,threw something into the tree line,failed to render any assistance to learmonth,or told another witness that there was nobody in learmonth from that of other witnesses,it could render less credible his testimony as to his conduct.and as stated above,mcclelland whereabouts immediately before the accident was a critical question as to liability in this case.
nor is this evidence unfairly prejudicial such that it should have been excluded under rule.rule requires that the probative value of the evidence must be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice before the court may exclude the disputed evidence.baker can.cent.rr,quoting fed.evid.unfair prejudice is not satisfied by evidence that is merely adverse to the opposing party.id.quoting brazos river auth.ge ionics,cir.while the jury may have had a negative reaction to the fact that mcclelland did not approach learmonth car or attempt to help her,the jury was equally free to believe mcclelland testimony that he did not offer assistance because someone else at the scene had already called,and because emergency personnel were on the way.and the by the jury could mistakenly decide liability based on a misapprehension that mcclelland was impaired and was acting to conceal some illegal substance was countered by evidence offered by sears at trial that mcclelland did not appear to be impaired,and by the fact that no physical evidence was ever produced to support the lone witness testimony that something had been thrown into the tree line.the jury was also free to consider all the other testimony offered at trial regarding liability.we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in determining that the danger of unfair prejudice did not substantially outweigh the probative value of this evidence.
finally,sears argues that evidence of mcclelland conduct was inadmissible under rule b,which provides that specific instances of the conduct of a witness,for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness character for truthfulness may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.this argument,which was not raised below,is in any event without merit because rule b limits only the use of evidence designed to show that the witness has done things,unrelated to the suit being tried,that make him more or less believable per se.united states fusco,cir emphasis added.here,as we have explained,mcclelland conduct is directly related to the suit being tried,and this argument is therefore inapposite.
demonstration of learmonth injury 
sears also argues that learmonth improperly demonstrated her injury in front of the jury.sears presented a video during learmonth showing her walking normally at the neshoba county fair a few months prior to trial.after testifying,learmonth returned twice to the courtroom,walking pretty slowly and limping noticeably,an action the district court characterized as tantamount to testimony that at least some of the jury observed.this action was brought to the parties attention by the district court during a conference in chambers.the court commented,however,that if you had any response to that,i would do anything about it but it just an unfortunate occurrence and it does need to happen again.
sears argues that the prejudicial effect of this demonstration was obvious and incurable.yet,as learmonth notes,sears did not raise any concerns about the demonstration during the conference in chambers,request to recall learmonth to the stand,or request that any other curative actions be taken.accordingly,our review is for plain error only.foradori,at.
in the overall context of the trial,we find that the plaintiff demonstration did not affect sears substantial rights.learmonth gait would have been readily observed by the jury when she entered and exited the courtroom to testify.simeon smith son,cir holding that counsel comments on plaintiff use of cane did not require a new trial,because t he jury no doubt had observed plaintiff hobbled gait as he took the witness stand and a ny additional impact on the jury as it watched plaintiff walk to the chalkboard was not seriously prejudicial.furthermore,the jury was free to credit the video evidence presented by sears,which showed learmonth walking in a normal manner.we therefore conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying a new trial on this basis.
excessiveness of the jury award 
sears next contends that the million award for lost earning capacity and the million remittitur award for damages were contrary to the great weight of the evidence and so exceed the bounds of reasonable recovery that a new trial or remittitur is required although the verdict did not distinguish the amount of the jury award for each category of learmonth damages,the district court the parties do not the award was comprised of for past medical expenses,for future medical expenses reduced to net present value,and for loss of earning capacity,with the remaining constituting damages the district court reduced the damages to million pursuant to mississippi statutory cap on damages,ann.b.
in a diversity case,we apply the new trial or remittitur standard according to the forum state law controlling jury awards for excessiveness.foradori,at citing gasperini ctr.for humanities,d.our review under that standard is for abuse of discretion only,id.at,and w e must give the benefit of every doubt to the judgment of the trial judge.id.at quoting gasperini,at internal quotation marks omitted.
mississippi statutory standard for granting a new trial or remittitur provides,in relevant part 
the supreme court or any other court of record in a case in which money damages were awarded may overrule a motion for new trial or affirm on direct or cross appeal,upon condition of an additur or remittitur,if the court finds that the damages are excessive or inadequate for the reason that the jury or trier of the facts was influenced by bias,prejudice,or passion,or that the damages awarded were contrary to the overwhelming weight of credible evidence.
ann.supp.we therefore review the testimony and exhibits presented to the jury at trial to determine whether the district court abused its discretion in determining that the damages awarded were not contrary to the overwhelming weight of credible evidence.
loss of earning capacity 
learmonth presented evidence to support a determination of a one hundred percent loss of earning capacity.her pain management physician determined that learmonth had reached the point where she can no longer hold down a job,and that he planned to take her off of work due to the severity of her symptoms including the mechanical back pain and the nerve injury pain in her left leg or lower extremity.these injuries affect her ability to work because she can not sit or stand for any long periods of time.he also opined that learmonth was a reasonable candidate for disability and that she would be restricted from work indefinitely.
learmoth vocational rehabilitation counselor also testified that she would not be able to return to competitive employment,based on the fact that there were no jobs that would meet her limitations in sitting and standing.and although sears repeatedly emphasized that there were no limitations on learmonth pursuing her education and thereby increasing her employment potential,her vocational counselor pointed out that any further education learmonth obtained would not increase her tolerance for sitting and standing,and was thus irrelevant to the limitations that kept her from working.
sears relies heavily on the fact that no doctors have placed any physical restrictions or limitations on learmonth,and that her treating physician said that he would not restrict her from performing jobs within her functional capacity and pain limitations.sears points out that learmonth worked at three different jobs after the accident under the care of her doctors.although learmonth did work at three jobs,it is undisputed that she had to leave all three jobs because of her physical and emotional pain and discomfort.learmonth restaurant employer testified that she could not physically perform waitressing duties,which involved carrying heavy loads,and that she was emotionally unable to perform the lighter work of hostessing.learmonth described real bad pains in her lower back associated with the sitting and standing in her job as a bank teller,even though she was allowed to alternate sitting or standing as often as she liked.learmonth supervisor at the bank testified that learmonth constantly readjusted her position,trying to get comfortable,and her doctor ultimately advised her to stop working there because of her discomfort.learmonth also testified that she could not continue her retail job because of the constant standing and an inability to sit down at the job site.she has to lay down several times a day to help with the pain,and she takes a wide variety of medication on a daily basis.
based on the assumption that learmonth could not sustain competitive employment,and that she had suffered a fifty percent reduction in her ability to perform household services for herself and her family,learmonth expert economist opined that the net present value of her futur
