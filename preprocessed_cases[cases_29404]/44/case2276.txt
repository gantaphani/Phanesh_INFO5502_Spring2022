delores hartman hartman and deborah rice rice appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of great seneca financial corporation great seneca and javitch,block rathbone,llp javitch.hartman and rice both had accounts with providian national bank on which they allegedly owe money.providian sold their accounts to unifund ccr partners,who sold the debts to great seneca.with the help of its attorneys javitch,great seneca attempted to collect on the defaulted debts by filing collection complaints against hartman and rice in ohio state court.in each of those complaints,great seneca and javitch asserted that a copy of the debtor account was attached to the complaint.in each case,the document that great seneca and javitch attached as an account resembled a statement but had been generated on great seneca behalf.
hartman and rice filed separate actions in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio arguing that great seneca and javitch violated the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa by representing,in their complaints,that the document generated on great seneca behalf was a statement of the debtor account.the district court determined that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether this behavior violated the fdcpa and granted great seneca and javitch motions for summary judgment in each case.hartman and rice appeal these judgments.
we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment and remand the cases for proceedings consistent with this opinion.we also remand the question of whether great seneca should remain a party to this litigation,given its asserted voluntary dissolution.

rice great seneca fin,d,
in october,javitch filed civil complaints in state court against hartman and rice on behalf of great seneca.the complaint filed against hartman read as follows 
there is due the plaintiff from the defendant upon an account,the sum of.
a copy of the said account is attached hereto as exhibit a.
hartman ex.a to am.compl.the language of the complaint filed against rice is identical except that the amount owed is different.javitch attached a financial document called exhibit a to each of the complaints.in each case,exhibit a was prepared by great seneca law firm and resembles a typical statement.hartman ex.b to am.rice ex.b to am.compl.in both cases,the document heading indicates that exhibit a was produced by great seneca.the document includes the debtor address and a space for her to change her address.it also contains an account number and indicates a new balance,for hartman and for rice,due now.hartman ex.b to am.rice ex.b to am.compl.below this general account information are boxes for credit limit,credit available,amount past due,statement closing date,and a summary of transactions.the document also states that great seneca is the assignee of unifund which is,in turn,the assignee of providian.hartman and rice answered the complaints against them and served discovery.great seneca then dismissed the actions against hartman and rice without prejudice.
after the actions against them were dismissed,hartman and rice each filed an action in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio alleging that great seneca and javitch violated the fdcpa.hartman and rice argued that great seneca and javitch acted in a false,deceptive,or misleading manner when they represented that exhibit a,generated by great seneca,was an account statement.hartman and rice also alleged that this behavior violated the ohio consumer sales practices act ocspa.in both cases,the plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment,and the defendants moved for summary judgment.the united states filed briefs as an intervenor because great seneca and javitch challenged the constitutionality of the fdcpa.because of the similarity of the two cases,the district court judge in deciding hartman case adopted his rice opinion.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of great seneca and javitch in both cases because it concluded that,as a matter of law,the least sophisticated consumer would have not have been confused or misled by the representation that exhibit a was an account statement.additionally,the district court found that,even assuming that there was an issue of material fact,great seneca and javitch were protected by the fdcpa bfe defense.
hartman and rice appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of great seneca and javitch.hartman and rice first argue that great seneca and javitch representation that exhibit a to the complaints was a copy of the debtor account was false in violation of and.second,they argue that presenting exhibit a,which facially resembled a statement,as a copy of the debtor account was deceptive and misleading in violation of and and an unfair means of debt collection under.finally,hartman and rice assert that the bfe defense does not protect great seneca and javitch because this defense does not apply to mistakes of law and because great seneca and javitch have not shown that they are entitled to the defense.hartman and rice also appeal the dismissal of their ohio claims,but concede that these claims stand or fall with their claims.great seneca and javitch respond that their behavior did not violate the fdcpa and that in any event,they are entitled to the bfe defense.additionally,great seneca and javitch urge us to uphold the district court judgment on the alternate grounds that this application of the fdcpa is unconstitutional.

violation of the fair debt collection practices act 
hartman and rice assert that great seneca and javitch behavior violates three provisions of the fdcpa,which provides that a debt collector may not use any false,deceptive,or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt,which prohibits t he use of any false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer and,which provides that a debt collector may not use unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt.we have explained the concerns and standards applicable to fdcpa claims as follows 
congress enacted the fdcpa to eliminate abusive,deceptive,and unfair debt collection practices.a.when interpreting the fdcpa,we begin with the language of the statute itself.schroyer frankel,cir.as this court has noted,the fdcpa is extraordinarily broad,crafted in response to what congress perceived to be a widespread problem.frey gangwish,cir.courts use the least sophisticated consumer standard,an objective test,when assessing whether particular conduct violates the fdcpa.harvey great seneca fin,cir.this standard ensures that the fdcpa protects all consumers,the gullible as well as the shrewd.kistner law offices of michael margelefsky,cir quotation marks and citations omitted.nonetheless,the standard also prevents liability for bizarre or idiosyncratic interpretations of collection notices by preserving a quotient of reasonableness and presuming a basic level of understanding and willingness to read with care.id.at quotation marks and citations omitted.

ohio law requires that w hen any claim or defense is founded on an account or other written instrument,a copy of the account or written instrument must be attached to the pleading.ohio civ.d.the ohio courts have explained this requirement as follows 
it is elementary that in an action on an account,a plaintiff must set forth an actual copy of the recorded account.the records must show the name of the party charged and must include the following 
a beginning balance zero,or a sum that can qualify as an account stated,or some other provable sum 
listed items,or an item,dated and identifiable by number or otherwise,representing charges,or debits,and credits and 
summarization by means of a running or developing balance,or an arrangement of beginning balance and items which permits the calculation of the amount claimed to be due.
arthur parenteau,ohio app d,internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
because great seneca and javitch sued hartman and rice in ohio state court,they were subject to this requirement.in attempting to comply with this requirement,great seneca and javitch did two things which form the basis of hartman and rice current claims.first,the complaints alleged that hartman and rice owed great seneca money on an account and that a copy of the said account is attached hereto as exhibit hartman ex.a to am.rice ex.a to am.compl.second,great seneca and javitch attached to each complaint,as exhibit a,a document which had been generated at great seneca behest.as described above,these documents facially resembled statements but were not actually copies of the providian accounts on which hartman and rice were sued.instead,these documents contained general information about the debt that had been transferred electronically from providian to unifund and then to great seneca although these documents showed a final balance due,they did not contain a listing of debits and credits that had been made throughout the life of the account.hartman and rice assert that great seneca and javitch representation that exhibit a was a copy of the account on which they were being sued is false,deceptive,misleading in violation of and and is an unfair means of collecting a debt in violation of.
determining whether great seneca and javitch representations regarding exhibit a were false would require us to decide what account means under ohio law.however,because we conclude that hartman and rice have raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether great seneca and javitch representations were misleading or deceptive,we hold that summary judgment is inappropriate regardless of whether the designation of exhibit a as an account was false.though exhibit a identifies great seneca as an assignee of unifund,and unifund as an assignee of providian,the document on the whole looks like a statement issued by great seneca.see kistner law offices of michael margelefsky,llc,cir based on these conflicting aspects of the letter,we conclude that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to margelefsky,but we will not go to the other extreme either by granting summary judgment to kistner.instead,a jury should determine whether the letter is deceptive and misleading.exhibit a contains no information that would enable a consumer to determine what had been charged to or paid on this account,or when the debt was accrued.the only language in the document indicating that great seneca is a debt collector is the word assignee,a legal term that would not necessarily help the least sophisticated consumer understand the relationships between the parties listed.at this stage of litigation,hartman and rice do not need to establish that exhibit a would definitely mislead the least sophisticated consumer.instead,they need only show that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether exhibit a would mislead the least sophisticated consumer.given the fact that the document appears to be a recent bill,which it is not,and with few indications to the contrary,there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether this document would mislead the least sophisticated consumer.accordingly,summary judgment is improper 
summary judgment is also improper on hartman and rice state claims under the ocspa the district court concluded that great seneca and javitch did not make false or deceptive representations and that hartman and rice ocspa claims should therefore be dismissed.for the reasons discussed above,hartman and rice have sufficiently alleged that great seneca and javitch representations were misleading and deceptive.accordingly,their ocspa claims should not have been dismissed.see kistner,at the district court also granted summary judgment to margelefsky on kistner ocspa claims.judgment on these claims was predicated on the court conclusion that the collection letter did not make any misrepresentations,nor was it deceptive in any way,and therefore did not violate the fdcpa.kistner presented no independent evidence for her ocspa claims,and the district court therefore saw no reason not to grant summary judgment to margelefsky on those claims.because we have concluded that summary judgment on the fdcpa claims was improperly granted,kistner ocspa claims must be remanded to the district court for reconsideration.similarly,because hartman and rice claims were dismissed based on the district court conclusion that great seneca and javitch representations were not deceptive or misleading,summary judgment on those claims is improper.
defense of bona fide error 
the fdcpa provides a defense which states that 
a debt collector may not be held liable in any action brought under this subchapter if the debt collector shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.
c.this court recently held that this defense applies to mistakes of law as well as to clerical errors.jerman carlisle,mcnellie,rini,kramer ulrich lpa,cir.to qualify for the bona fide error defense,a debt collector must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation was unintentional the violation was a result of a bona fide error and the debt collector maintained procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.id.at.
in each case,the district court found that even if summary judgment was not proper because of a genuine issue whether the least sophisticated consumer would be confused or misled,great seneca and javitch had established that they were entitled to the bfe defense.the district court based this finding on its conclusion that great seneca had no intent to mislead or misrepresent,that great seneca has exhaustive procedures in place to verify financial information associated with debts,that great seneca hired a law firm to manage its portfolio,and that javitch relied on great seneca representations and did not believe that calling exhibit a an account was prohibited by the fdcpa.contrary to the district court conclusion,great seneca and javitch have not established that they qualify for the bfe defense.taking the facts in the light most favorable to hartman and rice,we believe that great seneca and javitch have not shown that the violation was unintentional.indeed,hartman and rice assert that great seneca and javitch made exhibit a look like a statement in order to avoid ohio law.nor have great seneca and javitch shown by a preponderance of the evidence that they maintained procedures intended to avoid the type of error that occurred.the error made by great seneca and javitch was a mistake of law they represented that exhibit a was an account in a manner that could be found to be misleading or deceptive.however,great seneca and javitch arguments fail to address the procedures that they had in place to avoid this type of error.before the district court,great seneca and javitch extensively detailed the process of the electronic transfer of debts to show that the amount they alleged was actually the amount owed.procedures meant to ensure that the amount of a debt is properly verified are not at issue in these cases,as hartman and rice do not now dispute the underlying debts.one of javitch managing partners stated that he believed that ohio law permitted the use of a document like exhibit a in a creditor claim.this statement suggests that the violation was unintentional,but it does not detail any procedures that great seneca or javitch used to ensure that mistakes of law did not occur.great seneca and javitch presented no evidence that they perform ongoing fdcpa training,procure the most recent case law,or have an individual responsible for continuing compliance with the fdcpa.see jerman,at.
taking the facts in the light most favorable to hartman and rice,we believe that great seneca and javitch have not shown by a preponderance that the violation was unintentional or that they employ procedures meant to avoid mistakes of law that could cause fdcpa violations.therefore,the district court erred in its conclusion that great seneca and javitch are entitled to dismissal at the stage of this litigation on the ground that they have established the bfe defense.whether great seneca and javitch can establish the elements of the bfe defense by a preponderance of the evidence is an issue that may be explored further as the litigation proceeds on remand.
constitutionality of the fdcpa 
in the district court,great seneca and javitch argued that the complaints that they filed in state court were protected by the first amendment and that the fdcpa is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad when applied to pleadings that are not baseless the united states intervened to address these arguments.
great seneca and javitch argue that they are immune from suit based on statements made during judicial proceedings and that permitting such suits as brought here under the fdcpa would violate their constitutional right to petition granted in the first amendment.similarly,great seneca and javitch urge us to use the doctrine to limit the application of the fdcpa.the ninth circuit has explained that u nder the rule of statutory construction,we must construe federal statutes so as to avoid burdening conduct that implicates the protections afforded by the petition clause unless the statute clearly provides otherwise.sosa directv,cir.however,there are various indications that the first amendment and any privilege that applied to statements made during judicial proceedings do not foreclose the current actions.
first,the supreme court conclusion in heintz jenkins,d,indicates that the fdcpa is intended to burden even when they are engaged in litigation.an unpublished opinion of this court recently considered the constitutionality of the fdcpa and concluded 
with respect to litigation immunity,javitch maintains that t he right to petition under the first amendment has been construed by courts to afford qualified immunity to lawyers engaged in litigation ja emphasis added,and,at the same time,l awyers possess an absolute privilege under common law concerning statements they make which are reasonably related to and made in the course of judicial proceedings,and are likewise absolutely immune from suit for claims which are based on such statements.ja emphases added.accepting these propositions as true as applied to javitch would,of course,undercut heintz the supreme court held that the act applies to attorneys who regularly engage in activity,even when that activity consists of litigation.at.emphasis added see also.javitch does not dispute that it regularly engage s in activity.see heintz,at.so any discussion of litigation immunity as applied to lawyers in general those who do not regularly engage in activity is of no help to javitch.the supreme court has already said that lawyers,in their function as debt collectors,are covered by the act.
gionis javitch,block rathbone,llp,cir unpublished.given the supreme court detailed analysis and clear conclusion in heintz that the fdcpa does apply to activity,we believe that gionis correctly concluded that the first amendment does not shield lawyers engaged in litigation from fdcpa liability.see heintz,at.the opposite conclusion,that the first amendment prohibits fdcpa suits based on statements made during judicial proceedings,would negate the supreme court holding that the fdcpa does apply to lawyers engaged in litigation.heintz,at.emphasis added.most of the other circuits that have considered this question have reached the same conclusion.sayyed wolpoff abramson,cir all circuits to consider the issue,except for the eleventh,have recognized the general principle that the fdcpa applies to the litigation activities of attorneys who qualify as debt collectors under the statutory definition.
heintz did not consider,however,whether the application of the fdcpa to statements made during judicial proceedings would violate the constitution.even assuming that the first amendment provides some protection from fdcpa suits based on conduct and statements during litigation,we believe that the first amendment would not protect the conduct at issue in this case.the supreme court has explained that the petition clause of the first amendment does not provide an absolute right to petition.mcdonald smith,d.instead,the petition clause protects legitimate petitioning but not sham petitions,baseless litigation,or petitions containing intentional and reckless falsehoods.id.at.in the context of defamation suits,the supreme court has explained that there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact.n
