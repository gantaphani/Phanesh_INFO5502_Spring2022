in this appeal,the plaintiffs challenge the district court dismissal of their complaint,brought under,for failure to state a claim upon which relief might be granted.after careful consideration of the briefs and the record,we conclude that the most recent incident described in the complaint was not actionable that the earlier incidents fell outside the limitations period and,therefore,that the district court properly dismissed the complaint.
background 
beginning in,the commonwealth of puerto rico embarked on a process of privatizing its extensive network of public health facilities.that effort provides the backdrop for this litigation.
on november,centro medico del turabo,turabo medical center partnership,hospital interamericano de medicina avanzada de humacao,and joaquín rodríguez garcía rodríguez filed a civil action against carmen feliciano de melecio the commonwealth secretary of health.the complaint charged that,between and,the secretary had refused to grant certificates of necessity and convenience required to develop certain medical facilities at two of the plaintiffs hospitals denied them permission to transfer a license from one hospital to another,and awarded contracts for the purchase,lease,administration of various public health facilities to entities not affiliated with the plaintiffs.the complaint further alleged that these acts and omissions were discriminatory,transgressed due process,denied the plaintiffs the equal protection of the laws,and were taken in retaliation for the plaintiffs exercise of their first amendment rights,their persistent challenges to various of the secretary actions in the local courts.the suit sought both damages and injunctive relief to redress these alleged constitutional harms.
the secretary filed a motion to dismiss,arguing,inter alia,that the statute of limitations had run.the plaintiffs rejoined that the described incidents comprised an interrelated series of constitutional violations,one of which occurred within the limitations period,and,thus,that the continuing violation doctrine salvaged all of their claims.the district court disagreed and granted the motion to dismiss.see centro medico del turabo feliciano de melecio,d.
in pertinent part,the district court concluded that the complaint,on its face,demonstrated that the plaintiffs were aware as early as of the need to assert their rights in response to the secretary actions,but nevertheless failed seasonably to invoke section.see id.at.the court then focused on the one timeous incident described in the secretary contractual assignment of the caguas regional hospital crh to the control of a medical school,escuela de ciencias medícas san juan bautista san juan bautista,in july of concluded that the circumstances there were neither sufficiently similar to those underlying the claims to justify treating it as a continuation of the earlier episodes nor independently sufficient to ground a cognizable constitutional claim.see id.at.this appeal ensued.
discussion 
in this venue,the plaintiffs argue that the grant to san juan bautista of the right to administer crh was one in a series of discriminatory actions taken against them by the secretary that the incident falls within the limitations period and that the events underlying the claims are so substantially related to that incident that the entire series of claims should be deemed timely filed under the continuing violation doctrine.we limn the standard of review,chart the contours of the pertinent legal landscape,and then turn to the plaintiffs argument.
standard of review 
the court below dismissed the plaintiffs action for failure to state a claim under.b.we review that determination de novo,adhering to the same criteria that bound the lower court.in re colonial mortg.bankers,cir.the tools of this trade include the complaint,documents annexed to it or fairly incorporated into it,and matters susceptible to judicial notice.rodi new eng.sch.of law,cir.
in a civil rights case,there is no heightened pleading standard.educadores puertorriquenos en accion hernandez,cir.therefore,a district court charged with the adjudication of a motion to dismiss under rule b must apply the notice pleading requirements of.a.rivera rhode island,cir educadores,at.a complaint satisfies that standard if it contains a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.a,and give s the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiff claim is and the grounds upon which it rests,conley gibson,d.
in measuring a complaint against this benchmark,a reviewing court must assume the truth of all facts and indulge all reasonable inferences that fit the plaintiff stated theory of liability.colonial mortg.bankers,at.still,such a court is not bound to credit bald assertions,unsupportable conclusions,periphrastic circumlocutions,and the like.aulson blanchard,cir.
once the court has performed this tamisage,dismissal for failure to state a claim will be appropriate if the pleadings fail to set forth factual allegations,either direct or inferential,respecting each material element necessary to sustain recovery under some actionable legal theory.berner delahanty,cir quoting gooley mobil oil,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we will affirm a dismissal only if it is transparently clear that the complaint,in light of the facts alleged,engenders no viable theory of liability.educadores,at blackstone realty llc fdic,cir.
under this rubric,it is sometimes permissible to grant a motion to dismiss based on an affirmative defense,such as the statute of limitations.that happens when the pleader allegations leave no doubt that an asserted claim is.lachapelle berkshire life ins,cir.this is the test that we apply here.
the limitations period 
section creates a private right of action for redressing abridgments or deprivations of federally assured rights cox hainey,cir mcintosh antonino,cir.because it does not contain a limitations period,a federal court adjudicating a section action must borrow the forum state general statute of limitations for personal injury actions.owens okure,d nieves mcsweeney,cir.in puerto rico,the limitations period for injuries to the person is one year.see laws ann.accordingly,that term applies here.see municipality of caguas,cir,cir.
puerto rico limitations period begins to run one day after the date of accrual.see,cir per curiam.the accrual date,however,is determined in accordance with federal law,at.in a section case,a claim ordinarily accrues when the plaintiff knows,or has reason to know,of the injury on which the action is based.see also puerto rico,cir noting that a claim accrues when facts supportive of a civil rights action are or should be apparent to a reasonably prudent person similarly situated citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the plaintiffs do not dispute that they knew,or had reason to know,of their injuries immediately following the occurrence of each of the various incidents.it is likewise undisputed that the only claim of injury that falls chronologically within the limitations period is the claim relating to the secretary july transfer of administrative responsibility over crh to san juan bautista.the plaintiffs nevertheless seek to salvage their earlier claims by bringing them under the umbrella of the continuing violation doctrine.to that end,they allege that the crh contretemps was part of a serial violation 
under the serial violation branch of the continuing violation doctrine,a plaintiff may link a number of discriminatory acts emanating from the same discriminatory animus,even though each act constitutes a separate wrong.see provencher cvs pharmacy,cir jensen frank,cir.if the plaintiff can forge that link and can also show that at least one act in the series occurred within the limitations period,the suit may be considered timely as to all the acts.see lawton state mut.life assur,cir kassaye bryant,cir.
in order for the serial violation theory to apply,the act that falls within the limitations period must itself constitute an actionable violation.lawton,at common sense teaches that a plaintiff can not resuscitate acts,said to be discriminatory,by the simple expedient of linking them to a,barred act.ruiz,cir refusing to apply the serial violation theory when the plaintiff had failed to show that the timely acts were separate and actionable violations mack great atl.pac.tea,cir stating that the plaintiff retain s the burden of demonstrating that some discriminatory act transpired within the appropriate time frame.it follows inexorably that if the plaintiffs have failed to state an independently actionable claim based on the crh incident,they can not rely on that incident to anchor the rest of their claims each of which arose out of events that occurred well prior to november,earliest day within the limitations period.consequently,we examine that claim before proceeding further.
the july incident 
in their complaint and their brief,the plaintiffs have proposed,without meaningful elaboration,that the assignment to san juan bautista of the right to administer crh affairs contravened their due process,equal protection,and first amendment rights.we address each of these suggested bases for liability.
procedural due process.the plaintiffs have made a general suggestion that the secretary failure to award them the right to purchase,lease,or manage crh violated due process.to the extent that they hope to maintain a procedural due process claim,they must first point to a protected liberty or property interest.bd.of regents roth,d the requirements of procedural due process apply only to the deprivation of interests encompassed by the fourteenth amendment protection of liberty and property.there is no liberty interest implicated here so the plaintiffs claim stands or falls,in the first instance,on the existence of a constitutionally protected property interest.
in order to establish a constitutionally protected property interest,the plaintiffs must identify a legitimate claim of entitlement to the property in claim of entitlement created and defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.id.at.for this purpose,an abstract need or desire or a unilateral expectation are not sufficient to cement a constitutionally protected interest.id.
the plaintiffs allege that,on two occasions,they wrote to the secretary to express an interest in purchasing,leasing,or managing crh.that is not enough they have wholly failed to identify any legally cognizable property interest in acquiring a right to purchase,lease,manage,or otherwise participate in the privatization of crh.puerto rico law governing the department of health authority to grant contracts for the privatization of health care facilities dispels any doubt.the statutory scheme not only explicitly allows the secretary to award such contracts to medical schools without following the usual bidding protocol but also directs that she prefer such institutions.see laws ann.these statutes make it pellucid that the plaintiffs had no legally cognizable right to vie for the crh contract on an equal footing with san juan bautista,let alone an entitlement to have that contract awarded to them rather than to a medical school.the short of it is that the plaintiffs had nothing more than a unilateral desire to secure a stake in crh privatization.the frustration of such a subjective desire is a far cry from the deprivation of a constitutionally protected property interest.for this reason,the plaintiffs procedural due process claim fails.
substantive due process.next,the plaintiffs contend that the secretary awarding of a contract to san juan bautista was a rbitrary,capricious,unfounded,and discriminatory,thus violating their right to substantive due process.this contention rings hollow.
the fourteenth amendment protects against deprivation of life,liberty,or property without due process of law.see const.amend xiv.the substantive component of this guarantee guards against certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.daniels williams,d.in the substantive due process context as in the procedural due process context,a plaintiff,as a condition precedent to stating a valid claim,must exhibit a constitutionally protected interest in life,liberty,or property.see washington glucksberg,rivera,at macone town of wakefield,cir.as explained above,see supra part ii c,the plaintiffs have failed to identify such an interest.consequently,their substantive due process claim founders.
equal protection.the plaintiffs asseverate that the secretary grant of the crh contract to san juan bautista denied them a fair shake in the potentially lucrative process of privatization of public health facilities,in violation of the equal protection clause.this asseveration is frivolous.the plaintiffs failed,even when pressed at oral argument,to position their claim within the familiar equal protection framework they have not claimed membership in a protected class or demonstrated that other entities,similarly situated,were treated differently concerning the award of hospital contracts.their inability to identify these doctrinal rudiments is fatal to their equal protection challenge.see barrington cove.hous.mortg.fin,cir hennessy city of melrose,cir gilbert city of cambridge,cir.
first amendment.the plaintiffs claim is that the award of the crh contract to an unrelated entity was part of a punitive campaign to retaliate against them for availing themselves of commonwealth court remedies following the secretary denial of their applications for certain hospital permits.the supreme court has made it plain that even though a person has no right to a valuable governmental benefit and even though the government may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons,there are some reasons upon which the government may not rely.perry sindermann,d.the exercise of first amendment rights is among the constitutionally proscribed reasons for the denial of a government benefit.id.thus,we have recognized,as a general matter,that c laims of retaliation for the exercise of first amendment rights are cognizable under.powell alexander,cir.
it is an open question,however,whether first amendment retaliation claims presented by disappointed bidders or applicants for new government contracts are cognizable.in board of county commissioners umbehr,d,the court held that first amendment protections extend to independent contractors alleging termination or prevention of automatic renewal of government contracts in retaliation for the exercise of the freedom of speech.on that basis,the court held that a person so situated could state a valid cause of action under section.see id.at.in so holding,the justices emphasize d the limited nature of their decision,which concerned only the termination of a commercial relationship with the government,and,accordingly,declined to address the possibility of suits by bidders or applicants for new government contracts who can not rely on such a relationship.id.at.
following umbehr and a closely related decision recognizing similar protections for independent contractors alleging politically motivated discrimination,see truck,city of northlake,d,we have acknowledged this uncertainty,observing that t he next area of contest appears to revolve around those who wish for the first time to bid for government contracts.prisma zona exploratoria calderon,cir.in prisma zona,however,we found it unnecessary to resolve that question,see we have the same luxury today.
even assuming,for argument sake,that an entity that has no preexisting contractual relationship with the commonwealth can state a claim under section for an allegedly retaliatory denial of a bid,we nevertheless find that the plaintiffs have failed to state a valid retaliation claim because they have not identified any action taken against them by the secretary in connection with the privatization of crh,whether in the form of an actual denial of a bid or an improper refusal to consider an application.to the contrary,the secretary,in accordance with her authority under laws ann,never issued an invitation for bids.consequently,the plaintiffs status does not rise to that of disappointed bidders,and the grant of the crh contract to san juan bautist
