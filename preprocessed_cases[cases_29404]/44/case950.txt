background 
this action concerns a knee injury that marcic,a seaman,suffered on may,while working for reinauer transportation companies and associated entities.reinauer.marcic alleges that during the night of may,while he was working on the barge rtc,owned by reinauer,he was injured when a fan in the engine room blew a small piece of metal into his eye.the next morning,marcic,noticing that his eye was inflamed,sought transportation to the shore for medical attention.he boarded the tug boat stephen reinauer,also owned by defendants,which reached port facilities in delaware city,delaware,and tied up next to the austin reinauer,another vessel owned by defendants.the position of the two vessels was such that marcic was required to cross a small gap between the deck of the stephen reinauer and the deck of the austin reinauer in order to reach the dock.marcic claims that he attempted to step from the rail of the stephen onto the rail of the austin.as he stepped onto the austin rail his foot slipped,and he fell,allegedly injuring his right knee.
marcic commenced this action in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york on may.alleging that defendants were negligent in failing to paint the rail of the austin with paint containing a additive,such as sand or gravel,which would have prevented plaintiff foot from slipping,marcic asserted claims for damages under the jones act,and general maritime law unseaworthiness principles.marcic also asserted the right as a seaman under general maritime law to recover maintenance during the period of his disability.the parties consented to trial before magistrate judge cheryl pollak.
on august,the jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants on marcic unseaworthiness and jones act claims and in favor of marcic on his claim for maintenance,awarding him.defendants moved for an order reducing the jury maintenance award to,calculated at the rate of fifteen dollars per day,which defendants contend was required by the collective bargaining agreement cba between plaintiff union and reinauer.marcic disputes defendants interpretation of the cba,asserting that it sets fifteen dollars as the minimum daily maintenance amount but sets no maximum.the district court granted defendants motion by order of october,holding that ammar united states,cir,decided the same day as the jury verdict,required the court to defer to the maintenance amount set by the cba,and entering an order reducing the jury maintenance award to.
marcic timely appealed,claiming entitlement to a new trial on his unseaworthiness and jones act claims.marcic also seeks restoration of the jury maintenance award,asserting that the district court interpretation of the cba was erroneous.we reject marcic claim for a new trial,but agree that the district court interpretation of the cba was erroneous.

marcic claimed entitlement to a new trial 
marcic claims entitlement to a new trial on two grounds.first,marcic alleges that reinauer counsel made numerous improper and prejudicial comments to the jury at trial.second,marcic challenges the court exclusion on hearsay grounds of testimony he proffered as to a deck hand alleged admission,immediately after the fall,that the austin rail had been painted with paint not containing a additive.
counsel allegedly improper comments to the jury 
marcic contends that he is entitled to a new trial because d efense counsel repeated appeals to prejudice through accusations of plaintiff litigiousness,misstatements of evidence,screaming at witnesses,expression of personal opinions as to witnesses credibility and the merits of plaintiff case,were blatantly improper and the trial fairness and integrity were compromised.appellant br.at.as noted above,we review this claim for abuse of discretion where marcic objected contemporaneously to the district court purported errors,and for plain error where he did not.in either case a party seeking a new trial on the basis of opposing counsel improper statements to the jury faces a heavy burden,as r arely will an attorney conduct so infect a trial with undue prejudice or passion as to require reversal.reilly natwest markets group,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in particular,where the jury verdict finds substantial support in the evidence,counsel improper statements will frequently be de minimis in the context of the entire trial.see pappas middle earth condo.ass n,cir.here,the jury verdict was supported by evidence that the rail of the austin had,in fact,been painted with paint.
marcic recites an extensive litany of alleged improprieties on the part of reinauer counsel.he relies principally on three categories of allegedly improper statements assertions allegedly suggesting that plaintiff was litigious alleged misstatements of the evidence and statements expressing counsel personal opinion or tending to inflame or impassion the jury.
comments allegedly suggesting plaintiff was litigious 
marcic complains that three series of questions by reinauer counsel while marcic improperly prejudiced him by suggesting to the jury that he was litigious.first,counsel asked a series of questions suggesting that marcic chose to seek medical care through his employer rather than his health insurance provider in order to bolster his lawsuit by documenting the character of his injury.second,counsel asked a series of questions suggesting that marcic filled out the personal logs that he kept as part of his job duties in a manner calculated to bolster his lawsuit.last,counsel asked a series of questions of marcic eliciting information regarding a previous job injury over which counsel suggested marcic had previously consulted a lawyer and considered suing reinauer.marcic objected to each of these exchanges.marcic also complains about counsel references to questions and answers during his closing.
a trial court has a duty to prevent charges of litigiousness if they are likely to result in undue prejudice that is not substantially outweighed by their probative value.here,reinauer counsel repeatedly suggested that the instant case was fraudulent and brought for a financial motive and inquired into plaintiff previous injury and into whether plaintiff previously contemplated a lawsuit but counsel at no time expressly charged marcic with being litigious or bringing previous lawsuits.compare outley,at noting that counsel characterized plaintiff as perpetual litigant and emphasized in closing that he was no stranger to litigation.questions about marcic decision not to utilize his health insurance,or about his manner of filling out his personal log book,raise no implication that plaintiff was litigious.instead,the implication was that plaintiff had a financial motive to lie about his accident.a claim for money damages does create a financial incentive to be untruthful,and it was not improper for opposing counsel to invoke this incentive in an attempt to impeach plaintiff.with regard to questions about marcic previous injury and consultation with a lawyer,there were only a handful of questions suggesting a single previous consultation with a lawyer,in the course of a trial and taking up only a few pages in the over trial transcript.in the context of the entire trial,and given the evidentiary support for the jury verdict,the probative value of these questions,even if improper,was not so outweighed by any potential prejudice as to entitle marcic to a new trial.see pescatore,at holding district court abused its discretion by referring twice itself and allowing plaintiff to refer several times to defendant wilful misconduct,but holding statements,made during jury trial,insufficiently prejudicial to require new trial.
alleged misrepresentations of the evidence 
marcic complains of numerous instances of what he characterizes as misstatements of the evidence by reinauer counsel.almost all of these were made during reinauer summation,and marcic objected only once during summation.therefore,all but one of these claims of error are reviewed only for plain error.furthermore,almost all of the statements marcic relies on were statements suggesting that marcic or his witnesses lied or that their testimony was unbelievable.such statements were not statements of the evidence at all,but were rather argument calling on the jury to draw inferences from the evidence.a district court is entitled to give attorneys wide latitude in formulating their arguments.reilly,at.it was certainly not plain error to allow counsel to present these arguments to the jury.
marcic sole objection during closing was to reinauer suggestion that marcic may have actually fallen after slipping on the deck,not the rail,of the austin.again,this statement was not improper as the district court noted in overruling marcic objection,it was merely a suggestion of an inference that the jury can conclude from the evidence particularly,it explained and reconciled evidence suggesting both that marcic fell and that the rail was painted with paint.
marcic complains also of one question during reinauer of plaintiff vocational expert.reinauer counsel asked whether the witness had seen a document signed by leon finkelstein on september,releasing marcic to full duty effective december.marcic argues that this misstated the evidence because finkelstein had previously testified during redirect examination that he thought he had only found plaintiff fit to work at a gas station,not on a boat.however,during by reinauer,finkelstein had agreed that there were no restrictions placed on his ability to return to work.the document signed by finkelstein itself states that john marcic is able to return to work as of.in light of the record,reinauer counsel did not misstate the evidence.
marcic finally complains that during summation,reinauer counsel,after stating that marcic had chosen not to seek a boat steering job,added,i submit to you it is not a strenuous job.marcic argues that this statement was improper because t here was no testimony concerning the job requirements of the steering job.appellant br.at.marcic failed to object to counsel statement,and we are not persuaded that this single statement,even if improper,made during reinauer summation,which spans pages of the trial transcript,caused such prejudice as to affect the integrity of the trial.
counsel expression of personal opinion and inflammatory commentary 
marcic complains of numerous instances in which he alleges that reinauer counsel improperly expressed his personal opinion.some of these are instances in which counsel merely suggested that witnesses were lying or had a motive to lie,or argued in favor of certain inferences from the evidence.marcic does,however,point to certain rather inflammatory statements,some of which were framed as personal opinion.for example,at one point during summation counsel stated that this case,i think the overall view of it,from my p er spective,in my humble judgment,is that this case is nothing short of think this case represents an example of what a group of people with absolutely no regard for the truth or the sanctity of the court system or the imposition that they had imposed on people like yourself can do when money is at stake t his case is just a disgusting affront to what should occur in a courthouse.later,counsel stated that he had listened to the testimony of marcic medical expert in a state of disbelief that someone would tell such outrageous lies under oath.counsel also stated that the testimony of marcic medical expert was as silly a thing as i have seen in a case,i ca imagine anything sillier,and stated that he thought it was sad that marcic would waste the time and money of the court and jurors on his case.in addition to these few specific instances of improper statements of opinion,marcic suggests that by arguing that practically every single statement by every single one of his witnesses was a lie,by commenting repeatedly on the ease with which marcic witnesses lied and the low regard in which they appeared to hold the truth,and by characterizing marcic case as frivolous,and a joke,reinauer counsel crossed the line between permissible fair comment on the evidence and improperly prejudicial and inflammatory commentary.marcic has a statements by reinauer counsel were certainly hardly commendable.greenway,at.
however,these statements were not so inflammatory or so unsupported by the record as to affect the integrity of the trial and entitle marcic to a new trial.in the case principally relied on by marcic,koufakis carvel,cir,this court ordered a new trial where counsel repeatedly used slanderous and baseless epithets,see at recounting counsel numerous references to the mafia,reference to defendant as top leader of the mafia in a business way,characterization of case as pitting unscrupulous rich against deserving poor,and references to defendant as liar,faker,phony,and perjurious,and engaged in personal attacks on opposing counsel during summation,see at recounting counsel comparison of opposing counsel to goebbels,and suggestion that opposing counsel thought jurors were stupid.see also fineman armstrong world,cir affirming district court order granting defendants a new trial where plaintiffs counsel characterized defendants witnesses as liars and perjurers,repeatedly relied on facts not in evidence,and engaged in repeated personal attacks on opposing counsel during summation.
the comments by reinauer counsel do not rise to the level of what has been held to be so prejudicial as to require a new trial.not every improper or poorly supported remark made in summation irreparably taints the proceedings only if counsel conduct created undue prejudice or passion which played upon the sympathy of the jury,should a new trial be granted.matthews cti container transport int l,cir.while counsel certainly suggested that marcic and his witnesses were willing to lie to make money,counsel did not engage in personal attacks on opposing counsel,nor did he utilize epithets or slurs,or appeal to the jury regional,economic,or other prejudices.see pappas,at,ordering new trial on basis of counsel repeated references,despite numerous sustained objections,to fact that defendant was from out of state koufakis,at relying in part on counsel characterization of case as one which pitted a little and virtuous man of modest resources against a powerful and unscrupulous man with untold wealth.to the extent that reinauer counsel statements were improper,they were not objected to,and occurred in the context of a summation spanning pages of trial transcript,at the end of a trial in which voluminous evidence was introduced that sufficed to support the jury verdict.see pappas,at finding improper comments prejudicial in light of thin evidentiary support for jury verdict.
allegedly improper exclusion of evidence 
marcic argues that he is entitled to a new trial due to the allegedly erroneous exclusion on hearsay grounds of testimony he proffered as to a deck hand alleged admission,immediately after marcic fall,that the rail of the austin
