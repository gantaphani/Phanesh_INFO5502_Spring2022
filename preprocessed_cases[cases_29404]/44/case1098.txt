opinion of the court 
this appeal requires us to determine whether personal injury causes of action arising from the alleged wrongful conduct of a debtor corporation,asserted against a corporation on a mere continuation theory of successor liability under state law,are properly characterized as generalized claims constituting property of the bankruptcy estate.we conclude that they are,and will,therefore,affirm the order of the district court.
in august of,aaroma holdings llc aaroma,duane street,llc,purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of emoral,emoral,polarome international,a manufacturer of diacetyl,a chemical used in the food flavoring industry.at the time of the transaction,the parties were aware of potential claims against emoral arising from exposure to diacetyl,although those individuals who came to be known in this litigation as the diacetyl claimants or the diacetyl plaintiffs herein,diacetyl plaintiffs apparently had never themselves been employed by emoral.the asset purchase agreement specifically provided that aaroma was not assuming emoral liabilities related to the diacetyl litigation,and that it was not purchasing emoral corresponding insurance coverage.app.at.
when emoral filed for bankruptcy protection in june of,disputes arose between the bankruptcy trustee the trustee and aaroma,including,for example,the trustee claim that emoral sale of assets to aaroma constituted a fraudulent transfer.on september,the trustee and aaroma entered into a settlement agreement the agreement resolving the claims.as part of the agreement,aaroma agreed to pay and take certain specific actions,and the trustee agreed to release aaroma from any causes of action that are property of the debtor estate as of the date of the agreement.id.at.
at a hearing before the bankruptcy court regarding approval of the settlement,the diacetyl plaintiffs objected to the releases contained in the agreement to the extent that those releases might bar them from bringing claims against aaroma,as a successor to emoral,for personal injuries related to diacetyl.a representative for the trustee stated its view that the diacetyl plaintiffs successor liability claims against aaroma do not belong to the estate and that the trustee,therefore,ca release them.id.at.counsel for aaroma argued,however,that whether or not the diacetyl plaintiffs causes of action were property of the estate and therefore covered by the release was not an issue before the bankruptcy court at that time.id.at.ultimately,the parties added the following language to the order approving the settlement to address concerns expressed by the diacetyl plaintiffs nothing contained in this order or in the aaroma settlement agreement will operate as a release of,or a bar to prosecution of any claims held by any person which do not constitute estate released claims as defined in the aaroma settlement agreement.id.at.by order of october,the bankruptcy court approved the settlement.the ultimate question,however,of whether the diacetyl plaintiffs causes of action constituted estate released claims,as defined in the agreement,was not resolved.
the diacetyl plaintiffs filed individual complaints against aaroma in the superior court of new jersey see,id.at alleging personal injury and product liability claims and asserting that aaroma was a mere continuation of emoral and,therefore,liable.id.at.in april,aaroma filed in the bankruptcy court a motion to enforce court order approving settlement with bankruptcy trustee and compelling dismissal of state court actions,arguing that the diacetyl plaintiffs claims were barred by the agreement language as to release.the diacetyl plaintiffs opposed the motion,arguing that it was the understanding of the parties that their claims were not released under the agreement.id.at.they cited,for example,the statement made on behalf of the trustee during the hearing before the bankruptcy court prior to the approval of the settlement that their claims do not belong to the estate and that the trustee,therefore,ca release them.id.in the motion to enforce the order approving the settlement,however,the trustee did not take a position,stating that it was an issue of law for the bankruptcy court to determine.id.at.
following oral argument,the bankruptcy court,in a lengthy opinion,denied aaroma motion,holding that the diacetyl plaintiffs personal injury causes of action were not property of the estate because the diacetyl plaintiffs alleged a particular injury not generalized injury suffered by all shareholders or creditors of emoral.id.at.the bankruptcy court stated that while successor liability has been imposed derivatively,this court finds that the underlying injury that is alleged to be the basis and premise of the state court actions is personal harm to the individual plaintiffs and that emoral has not suffered any personal harm nor have the creditors as a general whole.id.
aaroma appealed to the district court,and the district court reversed,emphasizing that the diacetyl plaintiffs had no cause of action against aaroma which,it was not disputed,neither manufactured nor sold diacetyl except on a successor liability theory.id.at.the district court held that the cause of action for successor liability was a generalized claim belonging to the estate because the facts giving rise to the cause of action were not specific to the diacetyl plaintiffs but common to all creditors,and because,if the diacetyl plaintiffs were to succeed in establishing that aaroma constituted a mere continuation of emoral,this would benefit the creditors of emoral generally.id.at.it stated 
t he potential liability of aaroma to the diacetyl plaintiffs does not arise out of the alleged misfeasance of aaroma as to these creditors individually but rather out of its alleged continuation of the general business operation of the actual alleged wrongdoer,emoral.put slightly differently,for purposes of determining whether the cause of action belongs to the estate,the critical distinction between the personal injury claim against emoral and the successor liability claim against aaroma is that establishing the former would benefit only the allegedly injured diacetyl plaintiffs whereas establishing the latter that aaroma is the mere continuation of emoral and thus should be charged with all its liabilities would benefit creditors of emoral generally.
id.at.accordingly,the district court reversed and remanded to the bankruptcy court for entry of an order consistent with the district court opinion.the diacetyl plaintiffs now appeal,arguing that they have standing to assert their personal injury causes of action against aaroma,and that the district court erred in conflating these claims with their successor liability theory.
we have jurisdiction to review the order of the district court pursuant to d and.the district court had jurisdiction to review the bankruptcy court decision pursuant to a.we exercise the same standard of review as the district court when it reviewed the original appeal from the bankruptcy court,and,thus,review the bankruptcy court factual findings under a clearly erroneous standard and exercise plenary review over legal issues.in re rodriguez,cir quoting in re handel,cir.
the basic legal framework applicable to this case is not in dispute.after a company files for bankruptcy,creditors lack standing to assert claims that are property of the estate.bd.of trustees of teamsters local pension fund foodtown,cir.the estate,as defined in the bankruptcy code,includes all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.a.this includes causes of action,which are considered property of the bankruptcy estate if the claim existed at the commencement of the filing and the debtor could have asserted the claim on his own behalf under state law.foodtown,at.in order for a cause of action to be considered property of the estate,
the claim must be a general one,with no particularized injury arising from it.on the other hand,if the claim is specific to the creditor,it is a personal one and is a legal or equitable interest only of the creditor.a claim for an injury is personal to the creditor if other creditors generally have no interest in that claim.

a cause of action that is property of the estate is properly pursued by the bankruptcy trustee because it inures to the benefit of all creditors.this promotes the orderly distribution of assets in bankruptcy,and comports with the fundamental bankruptcy policy of equitable distribution to all creditors that should not be undermined by an individual creditor claim.koch refining,at.as the second circuit has held,when examining common claims against the debtor alter ego or others who have misused the debtor property in some fashion,where a claim is a general one,with no particularized injury arising from it,and if that claim could be brought by any creditor of the debtor,the trustee is the proper person to assert the claim,and the creditors are bound by the outcome of the trustee action.paul fire marine ins,at.
to determine whether the diacetyl plaintiffs cause of action against aaroma constitutes property of emoral bankruptcy estate,we must examine the nature of the cause of action itself.while the diacetyl plaintiffs focus on the individualized nature of their personal injury claims against emoral,we can not ignore the fact,and fact it be,that their only theory of liability as against aaroma,a third party that is not alleged to have caused any direct injury to the diacetyl plaintiffs,is that,as a matter of state law,aaroma constitutes a mere continuation of emoral such that it has also succeeded to all of emoral liabilities.
the parties do not dispute that under both new jersey and new york state law an acquiring company is generally not liable for the debts and liabilities of the selling company simply because it has succeeded to ownership of the assets of the seller,except in limited circumstances.lefever hovnanian.one exception to the general rule against successor liability is where the purchasing company is a mere continuation of the seller.id.to establish liability based on a mere continuation theory,as the diacetyl plaintiffs seek to do against aaroma,a plaintiff must establish that there is continuity in management,shareholders,personnel,physical location,assets and general business operation between selling and purchasing corporations following the asset acquisition.ramirez amsted.
the diacetyl plaintiffs fail to demonstrate how any of the factual allegations that would establish their cause of action based on successor liability are unique to them as compared to other creditors of emoral.likewise,they fail to demonstrate how recovery on their successor liability cause of action would not benefit all creditors of emoral given that aaroma,as a mere continuation of emoral,would succeed to all of emoral liabilities.thus,the diacetyl plaintiffs cause of action against aaroma is general rather than individualized.see foodtown,at.
although we have not before squarely addressed this issue,other courts applying new york and new jersey law have held that state law causes of action for successor liability,just as for alter ego and causes of action,are properly characterized as property of the bankruptcy estate.in in re keene,for example,plaintiffs alleged that they had claims for injuries against keene,the debtor corporation,and brought various lawsuits against certain defendants,alleging that keene wrongfully transferred assets to those defendants which prevented plaintiffs from collecting damages from keene.at.invoking successor liability,plaintiffs argued that by acquiring the assets of keene,defendants also assumed the liabilities.the court,applying new york law with respect to successor liability,held that plaintiffs causes of action constituted property of the estate 
t he remedy against a successor corporation for the tort liability of the predecessor is,like the piercing remedy,an equitable means of expanding the assets available to satisfy creditor claims.the class action plaintiffs that invoke it allege a general injury,their standing depends on their status as creditors of keene,and their success would have the effect of increasing the assets available for distribution to all creditors.
id.at.accordingly,the court held that the successor liability causes of action should be asserted by the trustee on behalf of all creditors.
likewise,in in re buildings by jamie,the court,applying new jersey law,concluded that a debtor individual creditors lacked standing to bring an alter ego cause of action seeking recovery from defendants,because that cause of action constituted property of the bankruptcy estate.it held that because new jersey law permits a corporation to pierce its own veil and because recovery on the alter ego claim would benefit the estate as a whole the cause of action was properly characterized as a general claim as to which the trustee alone has standing as representative of the estate.at.the court discussed our holding in phar mor,coopers lybrand,cir,in which we observed that it may seem strange to allow a corporation to pierce its own veil,since it can not claim to be either a creditor that was deceived or defrauded by the corporate fiction,or an involuntary tort creditor.id.however,we recognized that,in new jersey and in other states,piercing the corporate veil and alter ego actions are allowed to prevent unjust or inequitable results they are not based solely on a policy of protecting creditors.id.thus,because a cause of action is based upon preventing inequity or unfairness,it is not incompatible with the purposes of the doctrine to allow a debtor corporation to pursue a claim based upon such a theory.id.
as we observed in phar mor,so,too,here it may seem strange to hold that a cause of action for successor liability against aaroma is property of emoral bankruptcy estate.as a practical matter,it is difficult to imagine a factual scenario in which a solvent emoral,outside of the bankruptcy context,would or could bring a claim for successor liability against aaroma.see buildings by jamie,at similarly acknowledging in the context that from a practical standpoint,principals of a solvent debtor will not be compelled to pierce the veil of the very entity they use as a conduit for their personal business,as this would effectively extinguish their limited liability and expose them to the personal liability that the corporate form is employed to avoid.
just as the purpose behind piercing the corporate veil,however,the purpose of successor liability is to promote equity and avoid unfairness,and it is not incompatible with that purpose for a trustee,on behalf of a debtor corporation,to pursue that claim.see phar mor,see also baker state bank,discussing successor liability and holding that it requires a fact specific and equitable analysis walensky jonathan royce int l,holding that the doctrine of successor liability exists to protect against inequities.as in keene and buildings by jamie,the diacetyl plaintiffs cause of action against aaroma would be based on facts generally available to any creditor,and recovery would serve to increase the pool of assets available to all creditors.therefore,the district court appropriately classified that cause of action as a generalized claim constituting property of the estate.see also in re oodc,llc,holding that the bankruptcy trustee had standing to pursue successor liability claims because the claims were general and common to all creditors,noting that most other courts have found that the trustee in bankruptcy has standing to bring successor liability or alter ego suits on behalf of all creditors.
the diacetyl plaintiffs concede that there is no relevant caselaw directly supporting their position that individual personal injury claims asserted on a successor liability theory should not be considered property of the bankruptcy estate.they attempt to distinguish keene and related caselaw,however,by drawing a distinction between,on one hand,a successor liability claim as a primary cause of action,and,on the other hand,successor liability as an equitable remedy to satisfy an individual damage claim.we are not aware of any applicable legal authority drawing such a distinction and,indeed,we note that any cause of action asserting successor liability necessarily contemplates some underlying damage or liability for which the claimant is seeking recourse from a third party.
the diacetyl plaintiffs also argue that foodtown supports their position because we held in that case that a pension fund claim against third party affiliates of a debtor employer did not constitute property of the debtor bankruptcy estate.see at.their reliance on foodtown is misplaced.in foodtown,a plaintiff pension fund sought to recover million in erisa withdrawal liability owed by the debtor to the pension fund by bringing an alter ego claim and claims for breach of fiduciary duty against third parties.the cause of action at issue,however,did not constitute a general claim for successor liability based on a mere continuation theory,but instead a specific claim for liability pursuant to erisa.we observed in foodtown that w ith regard to alter ego liability in cases involving claims to pension benefits protected by erisa there is a federal interest supporting disregard of the corporate form to impose liability.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,crucial to our holding in foodtown was the fact that the cause of action did not arise until after the debtor bankruptcy filing,and thus could not be considered property of the estate.we distinguished the cause of action in buildings by jamie,which was based on a general injury suffered by a corporate debtor prior to its bankruptcy filing from the cause of action in foodtown,which ar ose from a statutorily imposed withdrawal liability that occurred after the filing of the bankruptcy petition.id.at.the diacetyl plaintiffs cause of action is distinguishable from the claim in foodtown for the same reason.
because the diacetyl plaintiffs cause of action for successor liability against aaroma belongs to the bankruptcy estate,it falls within the estate released claims within the meaning of the agreement between the trustee and aaroma.the district court,therefore,properly reversed the bankruptcy court denial of aaroma motion to enforce the order approving the settlement,and we will affirm the order of the district court.we recognize that,in so doing,we leave the diacetyl plaintiffs,who allege that they have suffered serious personal injuries resulting from exposure to a harmful chemical,albeit not at the hands of aaroma,with no apparent recourse against aaroma.we note,however,that our holding has no bearing on any remedy the diacetyl plaintiffs may be seeking directly against emoral in the bankruptcy proceeding or against any of the numerous other defendants the diacetyl plaintiffs have named in the actions pending in the superior court of new jersey.
i agree with the bankruptcy court that the diacetyl plaintiffs claims against aaroma constitute individualized claims belonging to the diacetyl plaintiffs themselves.because the majority instead concludes that such claims are generalized claims belonging to the bankruptcy estate,i must respectfully dissent.
it is undisputed that creditors lack standing to assert claims that are property of the estate.bd.of trs.of teamsters local pension fund foodtown,cir.a cause of action or claim,in order to be considered property of the estate,must be a general one,with no particularized injury arising from it.id.at quoting paul fire marine ins.pepsico,cir.w here a claim is a general one,with no particularized injury arising from it,and if that claim could be brought by any creditor of the debtor,the trustee is the proper person to assert the claim,and the creditors are bound by the outcome of the trustee action.majority opinion at quoting paul,at see also id.at quoting foodtown,at.on the other hand,if the claim is specific to the creditor,it is a personal one and is a legal or equitable interest only of the creditor.id.
because the diacetyl plaintiffs claims against aaroma could not be brought by any creditor of the debtor,they constitute individualized claims belonging to the diacetyl plaintiffs themselves and not to the debtor or the bankruptcy estate.initially,it is uncontested that the underlying personal injury claims against emoral are individualized in nature.in fact,personal injury and product liability causes of action under state law represent quintessential examples of an individualized claim,a personal claim that is a legal or equitable interest only of the creditor.id.the majority insists that we can not ignore the fact that the diacetyl plaintiffs only theory of liability as against aaroma,a third party that is not alleged to have caused any direct injury to the diacetyl plaintiffs,is that,as a matter of state law,aaroma constitutes a mere continuation of emoral such that it has also succeeded to all of emoral liabilities.id.at emphasis omitted.nevertheless,the court also can not ignore the claims or allegations underlying this theory or remedy of successor liability.as the bankruptcy court explained in its thorough and ruling,the underlying injury that is alleged to be the basis and premise of the state court actions is personal harm by exposure to diacetyl by the individual plaintiffs or harm to the individual plaintiffs.the successor liability theory alleged by the diacetyl plaintiffs is inextricably tied to and can not be considered separate or apart from their underlying personal injury and product liability allegations.because the diacetyl plaintiffs underlying allegations are clearly individualized in nature,their claims against aaroma which seek to hold this third party liable for their alleged injuries as the mere continuation of emoral must also be considered as individualized claims.in short,any creditor of the debtor could not allege that the third party should be held responsible on this specific theory of successor liability for injuries allegedly suffered as a result of exposure to a product made and sold by the debtor itself.for instance,a trade creditor of the debtor could not make such a claim.
i believe that the prior case law,beginning with our own ruling in foodtown,weighs in favor of this approach to the diacetyl plaintiffs claims.
in foodtown,a plaintiff pension fund sought to recover million in erisa withdrawal liability owed by the debtor twin to the pension fund by bringing an alter ego claim and claims for breach of fiduciary duty against third parties.majority opinion at.this court determined that twin withdrawal liability is not property of the estate because the claim did not arise until after the filing of the bankruptcy petition.foodtown,at footnote omitted.we,however,did not stop there.on the contrary,we went on to conclude that t he claim for withdrawal liability is also not a legal or equitable interest of the debtor,philadelphia marine trade ass n int l longshoremen ass pension fund comm r of internal revenue,cir we note that this portion of the opinion is an alternative holding,not a dictum where a decision rests on two or more grounds,none can be relegated to the category of obiter dictum.quoting woods interstate realty.in doing so,the foodtown court specifically focused on the creditor underlying withdrawal liability allegations,referring,for example,to twin withdrawal liability and appellees evasion of withdrawal liability.foodtown,at.the alleged evasion of liability,in turn,did not injure either twin or the creditors in general 
in this case,the injury is not insolvency stemming from appellees actions.here,the injury is the appellees evasion of withdrawal liability.withdrawal liability is not owed to twin rather,it is owed to the pension fund.because the liability is owed only to the fund,the claim is personal to the appellant.moreover,absent a general creditors interest,a trustee can only collect money that may be owing to the bankrupt entity.here,there is no general creditors interest in the statutorily imposed withdrawal liability owed to the fund.rather,the action to recover the withdrawal liability has the character of an action for damages flowing from an alleged illegality against the fund.the alleged illegality may have caused other inj
