factual and procedural background 
this dispute began in december of after a louisiana parish court rendered a money judgment against ballard in favor of machine products manufacturing company,the judgment creditor.at some point,ballard became indebted to the judgment creditor,presumably on a preexisting account.to collect on that balance,the judgment creditor filed a suit against ballard for an open account.the judgment creditor was represented by attorneys percy and wall collectively the attorneys,both in the employ of the pujol law firm.the judgment in favor of the judgment creditor was as follows ballard was liable for,plus interest from september,the date of demand,until the debt was paid reasonable attorney fees fixed at of the principal and interest and all costs of the proceedings.when ballard failed to pay the judgment,percy filed a motion for a judgment debtor rule.ballard was summoned to appear in the state district court before judge marilyn lambert on april,at.when ballard failed to appear for the hearing,judge lambert,upon request of wall,ordered a bench warrant in the amount of,approximately the same amount ballard owed on the judgment ballard admits that he knew of the court hearing,but forgot to appear until that day.ballard states that when he remembered,he immediately called percy.he then spoke with percy and told him of the situation and also requested percy advice as to what he should do concerning his tardiness.ballard asserts that percy informed him of the bench warrant and the bond and advised him that he would have to pay the bond to avoid being jailed.ballard then called his attorney who instructed him to go immediately to the court.when ballard arrived at the courthouse around,he went immediately to the clerk office and was directed to judge lambert chambers.ballard spoke with judge lambert and asked her what he could do to rectify the situation.judge lambert instructed him to wait in the hall while she left to make a telephone call to the pujol law firm.ballard asserts that after thirty or forty minutes,judge lambert returned and informed him that she had talked with the pujol law firm,and that percy told her that he does not want to release the bond.judge lambert then informed him that y ou are going to have to pay to keep out of jail.ballard maintains that he then asked judge lambert whether he could use a bail bond or a property bond to cover the bond,but judge lambert informed him that he could use neither,and that he would have to pay the in cash.when ballard could not meet the bond,judge lambert instructed police in the hallway to take him into custody.ballard was taken to the ascension parish jail and incarcerated until the next morning.from there,he was transferred to the parish prison.while in the jail annex,ballard called his wife,patricia ponthier.after speaking with ballard,ponthier called percy.according to ballard,percy told ponthier that she would have to come up with or ballard would stay in jail until the next court date.the complaint indicates that ponthier asked percy,can you put someone in jail for not paying a debt percy responded,yes,that the law.
ballard asserts that ponthier then called judge lambert office,and while speaking with judge lambert secretary,ponthier asked whether there was anything else that could be done to get her husband out of jail.ballard asserts that the secretary responded,no,that the way judge lambert does it,judge lambert combines the debt and court costs together and it has to be cash for the whole amount and it had to be paid to ryland percy.
ballard states that on the following day,ponthier was able to borrow from her son.after obtaining the money,ponthier went to percy office.ponthier asked percy secretary whether ballard would be released from jail if she paid the money.after conferring with percy,percy secretary told ponthier,in percy presence,just give me the money,i can call the jail and he will be released.ponthier,in accord,gave the secretary the money,and stood by while she counted it.the secretary then gave ponthier a receipt for,as well as a copy of a letter signed by percy,informing the clerk of court that this would close the case and the judgment was satisfied.
ballard alleges that percy secretary then telephoned the jail and requested ballard release.he was released at approximately on the day of that request.on april,a notation was made in the state district court record,per melanie ryland percy office do issue 
ballard did not pursue an appeal through the state courts concerning his complaints about the judgment debtor rule procedure in judge lambert court.instead,ballard filed this suit under in federal court,claiming federal constitutional violations.ballard complaint specifically alleges that the defendants deprived him of his liberty without due process of law by conspiring to operate a debtor prison.his claim further states that judge lambert had no jurisdiction to operate a d ebtor p rison for judgment debtors who did not appear timely for court appearances and that s ince d ebtor p rison has been forbidden in louisiana.ballard further asserted that the proper penalty under louisiana law for failing to pay a debt at a judgment debtor rule is to order a rule to show cause hearing for contempt after proper notice is given.
in response to the allegations in ballard complaint,judge lambert filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to.b,contending she was entitled to absolute judicial immunity from the claims in ballard suit because s he was merely setting a bond for a bench warrant that involved a hearing of which she was the presiding judge.the attorneys also filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to.b,arguing that they were not state actors within the meaning of.
in opposition to the defendants motions,ballard contended that judge lambert was not entitled to judicial immunity because she acted beyond the scope of her jurisdiction when she ordered him jailed until he paid the debt.he also contended that the attorney defendants were state actors under because they conspired with judge lambert to operate a debtor prison.ballard sought compensatory and exemplary damages,as well as attorney fees for the deprivation of his civil rights.ballard also requested a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from operating a d ebtor p rison and incarcerating debtors until they pay debts.
the district court granted the defendants motions to dismiss.the court first determined that judge lambert was acting within her judicial capacity,and thus,was entitled to judicial immunity when she issued the bond accompanying the bench warrant for ballard failure to appear the court similarly concluded that the attorneys were also entitled to dismissal because they were not state actors as required for a claim under.this appeal by ballard ensued.

discussion 
judicial immunity 
ballard argues that judge lambert is not entitled to judicial immunity because she had no jurisdiction to imprison him until he paid the debt to percy,the judgment creditor attorney.although ballard claim is under,his complaint takes the tone of a challenge to judge lambert application of louisiana judgment debtor rule procedure pursuant to article of the louisiana code of civil procedure.on appeal,ballard asserts that the district court judgment dismissing his claim against judge lambert on the grounds of judicial immunity must be reversed because the judge exceeded the scope of her authority under article.based on our reading of ballard complaint,taken in the light most favorable to ballard and giving due consideration to ballard heightened burden in the face of the judge absolute defense of judicial immunity,we can not conclude on this appellate record that ballard has stated a claim upon which relief could be granted on this issue.
judicial immunity is an immunity from suit and not just from the ultimate assessment of damages.mireles waco,d.although unfairness and injustice to a litigant may result on occasion,it is a general principle of the highest importance to the proper administration of justice that a judicial officer,in exercising the authority vested in him,shall be free to act upon his own convictions,without apprehension of personal consequences to himself.id.at.citation omitted.judicial immunity is not overcome by allegations of bad faith or malice and applies even when the judge is accused of acting maliciously and corruptly.id.at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted emphasis added.it is the judge actions alone,not intent,that we must consider.malina gonzales,cir.notwithstanding the aforementioned,judicial immunity can be overcome in two sets of circumstances a judge is not immune from liability for nonjudicial actions,actions not taken in the judge judicial capacity and a judge is not immune for actions,though judicial in nature,taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction.mireles,at.citations omitted.
in determining whether a judge acted outside the scope of his or her judicial capacity,the first set of circumstances articulated in mireles,a district court is required to consider four factors to discern whether a judge actions are in fact judicial in nature 
whether the precise act complained of is a normal judicial function whether the acts occurred in the courtroom or appropriate adjunct spaces such as the judge chambers whether the controversy centered around a case pending before the court and whether the acts arose directly out of a visit to the judge in his official capacity.
malina,at citation omitted.these factors are broadly construed in favor of immunity.id.
in the instant case,the district court,in analyzing whether judge lambert was entitled to judicial immunity summed up ballard allegations against the judge as follows 
ballard failed to appear before the court for an examination of judgment debtor.judge lambert ordered a bench warrant for the arrest of ballard and fixed the bond amount at cash,approximately the amount owed by ballard.ballard could not post the cash bond and was incarcerated until it was met.
in concluding that these allegations satisfied the four factors set out in malina,the district court determined that it was a normal judicial function for judge lambert to issue a bond accompanying a bench warrant for ballard failure to appear at the judgment debtor rule,judge lambert issued the bond in her courtroom,the controversy centered around a case pending before judge lambert,and judge lambert was acting in her official capacity as a judge.
with regard to the second set of circumstances articulated under mireles,the district court determined that judge lambert had subject matter jurisdiction over the civil matter involving ballard and had acted within her jurisdiction as a state district court judge.the district court commented that ballard argument centers on how judge lambert procedurally erred in issuing the bench warrant for his arrest after failing to appear before the court,and that ballard should have taken that issue up on state appeal,rather than having filed suit personally against judge lambert.
on this appeal,however,ballard argues that his complaint did not merely allege that judge lambert erroneously issued a bench warrant and bond.he argues instead that his complaint alleged the following additional assertions judge lambert imprisoned him because he could not produce cash judge lambert secretary informed ponthier,ballard wife,that the only way ballard would be released from jail was if he paid percy the ballard was in fact released from jail after paying percy cash and after percy secretary called the jail requesting his release percy subsequently informed the clerk of court that the case against ballard could be closed and that the money judgment against him had been satisfied and a bench warrant for his arrest was not issued after percy secretary made the request.
ballard argues that his complaint alleged that judge lambert imprisoned him until he paid his debt,in violation of his constitutional rights.ballard points out that if the he paid simply represented a bond,as judge lambert contends,then based on.code civ.providing that a bond is paid to clerk of the trial court in which the proceeding was brought,he would have been required to pay the clerk of court the money.instead,he states that he was required to pay percy,his creditor attorney,the amount owed in order to be released from jail.
taking the allegations that were not addressed by the district court as true,the question in the instant case becomes whether judge lambert is nonetheless entitled to judicial immunity.see malina,at.under the first malina factor,whether the precise act complained of is a normal judicial function,this court examine s the nature and function of the act,not the act itself.id.at quoting mireles,at.ordering the police officers to arrest and imprison ballard and requiring ballard payment of a money judgment are clearly acts normally performed by a judge.see mireles,at.state judge direction to court officers to bring a person before him was a normal judicial function malina,at issuing a sentence is a general judicial function.judge lambert actions occurred in the courthouse,specifically in the hallway near her chambers.the controversy centered around a case pending before her.the judge actions arose directly out of ballard visit to her in her official capacity.therefore,the second,third,and fourth malina factors have also been met.see malina,at.
the question now becomes whether judge lambert conduct was in complete absence of all jurisdiction.mireles,at.although judge lambert actions may have been judicial in nature,she is not entitled to immunity for those actions if her actions were taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction.see id.where a court has some subject matter jurisdiction,there is sufficient jurisdiction for immunity purposes.malina,at citation omitted.if judge lambert merely acted in excess of her authority,she is still protected by judicial immunity.id.citation omitted.
judge lambert,as a state district court judge,has original jurisdiction over all civil and criminal matters,e xcept as otherwise authorized by the louisiana constitution.see.const.art.v.the matter involving ballard was a civil suit on an open account.the particular hearing requested by the creditor was a judgment debtor rule.see.code civ.proc.allowing creditor the right to examine the judgment debtor.ballard petition alleges that after failing to appear timely for the judgment debtor rule,judge lambert imprisoned him until he paid the judgment creditor the money owed.
despite ballard assertions alleging that judge lambert arrested and imprisoned him because he did not pay his debt,the record clearly reveals the contrary.as we have previously stated,the law does not allow ballard to overcome judge lambert judicial immunity by asserting mere allegations of bad faith or malice.the record shows that judge lambert issued the warrant for ballard failure to appear as ordered by the judgment debtor rule.when ballard arrived at judge lambert chambers,the warrant was still outstanding,along with the bond requirement.ballard urges this court to conclud
