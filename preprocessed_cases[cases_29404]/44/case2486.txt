this appeal arises from a diversity action brought by the,annette rush,following her son fall from a railcar owned and operated by the,illinois central railroad company.the challenges the district court denial of her motion for new trial following a jury verdict awarded in favor of.she advances four arguments on appeal the district court erroneously admitted into evidence at trial the prior statements of two witnesses and audio recordings of those statements the jury erred in not finding liable under tennessee lookout statute the jury disregarded the trial court instruction to presume the child incapable of negligence as required under tennessee law and the district court erred in denying the motion for new trial because the verdict was against the clear weight of the evidence.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
ii.background 
switching operation 
conducts a switching operation in memphis,tennessee.during the switching operation,employees hook and unhook railcars a process know as coupling to a locomotive engine.the locomotive engine then delivers the railcars to nearby destinations.
a three person crew performs the switching operation.an employee referred to as a brakeman physically couples and uncouples the railcars at each stopping point.the locomotive engineer operates the engine along the rail line.the conductor oversees the entire switching operation.all three employees are responsible for the safety of the crew and passersby.see trial transcript,volume i at,trial transcript,volume ii at,trial exhibits,
johnathan rush fall and the investigation 
johnathan rush rush and several reed reed age,doyle lockett lockett age,darrell moore age,and justin moore moore age encountered the switching operation on november.while the subsequent events are in dispute,it is uncontroverted that rush,moore and reed began playing near a train.at some point during these activities,rush fell under the train and sustained injuries that ultimately required a amputation of his left leg.
within several hours of the accident,tom martin martin,a risk manager and railroad police officer for,interviewed lockett,moore and moore as to the earlier day events.each interviewee purportedly informed martin that rush fell while attempting to jump onto a moving train.martin these statements and later transcribed the interviews hereinafter the interview transcript.see,vol at tr.exs.
the underlying action 
annette rush,as the natural mother and next of kin of johnathan rush,filed a diversity action against in the united states district court for the western district of tennessee alleging common law negligence and violations of tennessee lookout statute.code ann.the matter proceeded to trial whereby the parties presented widely divergent accounts of the events giving rise to the accident.as the issues raised in this appeal turn on an examination of the conflicting evidence presented to the jury,we shall recount that evidence in detail.
the witnesses 
the called lockett as her first witness.lockett testified on direct examination that he and a group of friends encountered an abandoned,vol.i at,and parked,vol.i at,train while walking from the home of his grandfather.he further testified that rush and two other young men climbed the side ladder of the train railcar.see,vol.i at.according to lockett,the train began to move without warning,and two of the young men jumped off of the railcar.see,vol.i at.rush,however,appeared too scared to jump off,vol.i at,and soon fell from the ladder.
on,the following colloquy occurred between counsel for and lockett 
do you remember after this accident that a police officer,a female police officer,sergeant halfacre,came to your home along with martin over there 
not that i recall.
q.you do recall that 
i recall a police officer bringing me home,not no woman though.
do you remember that sergeant halfacre and martin talked to you with your aunt present 
okay.do you remember that you told,in the presence of your aunt,that you told martin and sergeant halfacre of the memphis police department that you were playing around the train yard when johnathan got hurt,and that you saw johnathan running alongside the train to get on,do you remember telling them that 
vol.i at.counsel for immediately attempted to play the audio recording of lockett statement.the district judge,however,interrupted the and instructed defense counsel to first confront lockett with the interview transcript 
counsel for handed the interview transcript to lockett.after lockett silently read the writing,counsel for enquired,is that correct what you said on the afternoon of this accident,november the of,is that correct,vol.i at.lockett responded,yes,sir,vol.i at.
lockett then read the transcript aloud whereby the jury heard his prior statement that johnathan was running alongside the train,vol.i at tr.ex.lockett further testified,however,that rush was not running along side the train,the train was moving,vol.i at.counsel for lockett prior statement from the interview transcript and enquired why did you tell martin on the afternoon of the accident that johnathan was trying to run alongside the train,vol.i at.lockett responded,i just misunderstood the question,i guess,vol.i at.
on examination,counsel for the queried whether lockett observed rush running alongside the train trying to jump on.see,vol.i at.lockett again responded in the negative and repeated his testimony that the train was stopped when rush began playing on the railcar.see,vol.i at.
the called moore as her next witness.moore echoed lockett testimony that the train was parked and stopped when rush began playing on the railcar,vol.i at.moore further testified that he never observed rush running alongside the train.see,vol.i at.
on,moore denied any memory of meeting with martin and a memphis police department officer.see,vol.i at.counsel for handed moore the interview transcript however,the writing did not refresh moore recollection of the interview.see,vol.i at.counsel for did not pose any further questions to moore.
the successively called as witnesses each member of switching crew.the locomotive engineer,william knight knight,and the brakeman,basil white white,each testified that they did not observe any persons near the railroad tracks on the date of rush accident see,vol.i at.knight additionally testified that it was his practice to sound the train bells and horn prior to initiating any movement of engine although,he did not recall his specific behavior on the date of rush fall.see,vol.i at.the train conductor,christopher giannini giannini,likewise testified that it was the switching crew practice to sound the bells and horn before moving along the rail line.see,vol.ii at.giannini could not remember,however,whether the bells and horn sounded prior to rush fall.see,vol.ii at.giannini went on to testify that on the date of the accident he observed two males,between the ages of eight to eleven years old,standing approximately fifteen feet away from the moving locomotive engine.see,vol.ii at.giannini expressed his belief that the young males were standing at the side,far enough that they did pose any hazard to us,vol.ii at.
jimmy calvin scott scott,testifying as an expert in the area of railroad operations and safety opined that when giannini observed two young males near the railroad tracks,the switching crew should have stopped the train and attempted to remove the children from the tracks.see,vol.i at.scott further opined that there lacked any evidence that the switching crew sounded the bells or horn prior to rush accident see,vol.i at.scott concluded that these omissions constituted violations of internal safety regulations.see,vol.i at.
the concluded her proof with rush testimony rush testified that he encountered a still train while returning from the home of lockett grandfather.see,vol.ii at.he further testified that his purpose for climbing on the train was to ride it home,vol.ii at.however,the train began to move without warning,see,vol.ii at,and rush got scared,vol.ii at.his leg then slipped off,vol.ii at,and he fell under the train.rush concluded his direct testimony by informing the jury that he recalled lying in the rocks near the railroad tracks bleeding,bleeding,vol.ii at.
martin audio recording of the statements made by lockett and moore 
prior to commencing its,informed the district court that it intended to introduce into evidence martin audio recordings of the interviews.the repeatedly objected on grounds that these prior statements were hearsay.see,vol.i at.she further objected on the basis that had not properly authenticated the audio recordings.see,vol.i at.the district court enquired as to purpose underlying request to play the audio recordings.see,vol.i at.counsel for responded 
i asked each one of the young men lockett and moore what you were doing out there.and to my surprise these young men said that the train was not moving and that johnathan had climbed on the train.
and in each of these statements the young men,doyle lockett and justin moore,say that johnathan rush was running alongside the train trying to catch hold of it.
and that contradicts the sworn testimony of johnathan,these do,taken the afternoon of the accident.
but as i said,i was surprised when they walked into the courtroom here all of sudden it is the same as johnathan,so that the sole purpose.
at the request of the,the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing regarding the outside of the jury presence.martin testified during the hearing that he recorded lockett and moore statements several hours following the accident.see,vol.i at.martin further testified that he could not independently identify the voices on the audio recordings.see,vol.i at see also,vol.i at without the identification of the names as i spoke to them,i could have just listened to their voice and not heard their name and told you who it was.in light of this testimony,the district court determined that the statements were admissible for the limited purpose of impeaching the testimony of lockett and moore see,vol.i at.accordingly,the district court ordered to introduce into evidence only those parts of the pertaining to moore and lockett purported prior inconsistent statements.because the jury would be permitted to review the admitted exhibits during their deliberations,the district court ordered to erase all other statements found on the.
the witnesses 
called martin as its first witness.martin briefly recounted the factual circumstances giving rise to his interviews of lockett and moore.at defense counsel instruction,martin played the audio recordings of the interviews during which the jury heard moore prior statements that none of the young men ever climbed onto the railcar and that johnathan fell while running alongside the train see tr.ex.the jury again heard lockett prior statement that johnathan was running alongside the train in an effort to catch it home.see tr.ex.
called jim tyson tyson,a trailer operator,as its second and final witness.tyson testified that,on the date of rush accident,he was awaiting in his trailer for the train to pass through an intersection when he observed a group of young men walking alongside of the stopped train.see,vol.i at.tyson recalled that after the train began to move,two of the young men came knocking at his window yelling that their friend had been involved in an accident.see,vol.i at.tyson informed the jury that he called for an ambulance to assist the injured young man.see,vol.i at.
the jury verdict and the post trial proceedings 
the district court subsequently instructed the jury on the applicable law and standards to be employed in rendering a verdict.neither party objected to the jury instructions.
the jury returned a verdict in favor of.the thereafter moved for a new trial pursuant to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure raising multiple evidentiary issues and challenging the jury verdict.the district court denied the motion and entered judgment in favor of.
the instant appeal ensued.
iii.law and analysis 
evidentiary issues 
the first assertion on appeal is that the district court erroneously permitted defense counsel to lockett and moore with the interview transcript.the further asserts that the district court erred by permitting the jury to hear the audio recordings of those interviews.
we review a district court contested evidentiary determinations for an abuse of discretion see beck haik,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs where the district court clearly erred in its judgment after weighing the relevant factors,improperly applied the correct law,or inappropriately used the wrong legal standard.shanklin norfolk ry,cir.
the threshold question to be considered when confronted with an evidentiary challenge on appeal is whether an evidentiary error occurred during the trial.see beck,at.if so,then we examine the proceedings in their entirety in the light of the proofs at trial,to determine whether the errors affected substantial rights.id.quoting kotteakos united states.we must have a fair assurance that the trial outcome was not altered by error in order to affirm the judgment.schrand federal pacific,cir.
whether an evidentiary error occurred when defense counsel lockett and moore with a transcript of the interviews 
the contends that the district court erroneously permitted defense counsel to lockett and moore with the interview transcripts.counters that it utilized the interview transcripts to refresh the witnesses memory pursuant to rule of the federal rules of evidence.
rule of the federal rules of evidence authorizes a party to refresh a witness memory with a writing so long as the adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced at the hearing,to inspect it,to the witness thereon,and to introduce in evidence those portions which relate to the testimony of the witness.fed.evid.the propriety of permitting a witness to refresh his memory from a writing prepared by another largely lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.see united states faulkner,cir citations omitted.
proper foundation requires that the witness recollection to be exhausted,and that the time,place and person to whom the statement was given be identified.when the court is satisfied that the memorandum on its face reflects the witness statement or one the witness acknowledges,and in his discretion the court is further satisfied that it may be of help in refreshing the person memory,the witness should be allowed to refer to the document.
united states,cir quoting goings united states,cir quotation marks and added emphasis omitted.upon establishing the proper foundation,counsel will typically offer the witness the writing to inspect,and will show a copy of the writing to the opposing parties.jack weinstein margaret berger,weinstein federal evidence a i joseph mclaughlin,ed hereinafter weinstein federal evidence citations omitted.the best practice is for the trial court to have the witness silently read the writing and then to state whether the writing has refreshed his or her recollection.id.
the of moore 
the assertion that defense counsel improperly utilized the interview transcript to refresh moore recollection warrants little attention.moore repeatedly testified that he did not remember meeting with martin following the accident.see,vol.i at.having exhausted moore memory during,defense counsel presented moore with the interview transcript.after moore silently read the writing,the district court posed the following questions 
q.now justin,looked at it,having read it,do you recall now whether or not you had a conversation and made any statements to anyone about this accident 
no,because 
okay.now statement that he just handed you does refresh your recollection about whether or not you gave an interview to sergeant halfacre and martin.
no,because back then we did call him johnathan,i did know his name back then,his real name.
vol.i at.defense counsel promptly concluded the.
no evidentiary error occurred during the attempt to refresh moore memory.defense counsel established a proper foundation by repeatedly inquiring whether moore recalled meeting with martin following the accident.see shoupe,at finding that counsel established a proper foundation under rule where counsel properly used leading questions to establish the time,place and person to whom the witness had allegedly made his prior,unsworn statements.the subsequent procedures employed by the district court were consistent with the mandates of rule.indeed,the district court intervened in the to ensure that the inadmissible contents of the writing were not presented to the jury furthermore,defense counsel terminated the when it appeared that the transcript failed to refresh moore memory accord weinstein federal evidence a iii if,after consulting a writing used to refresh recollection,the witness memory is not revived,rule is inapplicable.thus it would be error for the trial court to admit into evidence testimony about a matter included in the writing if the witness had no recollection of the matter after viewing the writing.we therefore find no evidentiary error arising from the attempt to refresh moore memory with the interview transcript.
the of lockett 
we reach a different conclusion regarding the attempts to refresh lockett memory of the interview.as with the of moore,defense counsel attempted to exhaust lockett memory by posing leading questions regarding the time,date and place of the interview.lockett repeatedly responded that he did not remember meeting with martin.defense counsel,however,did not attempt to immediately refresh lockett memory of the meeting with the interview transcript.instead,defense counsel posed the following question 
okay.do you remember that you told,in the presence of your aunt,that you told martin and sergeant halfacre of the memphis police department that you were playing around the train yard when johnathan got hurt,and that you saw johnathan running alongside the train to get on,do you remember telling them that 
while we have authorized the use of leading questions to establish a witness lack of memory as to a particular event,we have cautioned that the trial court may abuse its discretion when otherwise inadmissible evidence is introduced to the jury through the guise of refreshing a witness recollection.see shoupe,at w e find no precedent sanctioning the recitation in the presence of the jury of extended unsworn remarks.rule c of the federal rules of evidence provides that a jury trial shall be conducted to prevent inadmissible evidence from being suggested to the jury by any means,such as asking questions in the hearing of the jury.fed.evid.c.the advisory committee note to rule c indicates that the rule proceeds on the supposition that a ruling which excludes evidence in a jury case is likely to be a pointless procedure if the excluded evidence nevertheless comes to the attention of the jury.fed.evid.c,advisory committee notes.defense counsel question demonstrated that he failed to understand the impropriety of attempting to refresh lockett recollection by incorporating into his question the otherwise inadmissible contents of the.e,that johnathan was running alongside the train to get on.
lockett subsequent testimony exacerbated the potential evidentiary error caused by defense counsel improper question.after silently reading the interview transcript lockett testified that his memory was refreshed and that the writing accurately reflected his prior statements.see,vol.i at.he then read aloud from the interview transcript whereby the jury heard his prior statement that johnathan was running alongside the train trying to get on.see,vol.i at tr.ex.however,rule requires a witness whose memory has been refreshed to testify from his present recollection,rather than to merely restate the contents of the writing see shoupe,at i f a party can offer a previously given statement to substitute for a witness testimony under the guise of refreshing recollect,the whole adversary system of trial must be revised.internal quotation and citation omitted faulkner,at c aution must be exercised to insure that the document is not used to put words into the mouth of the witness.see also weinstein federal evidence rule is intended to curb the false memory that might occur when a witness who purports to testify based on a refreshed recollection merely parrots the contents of the writing.citing hall american bakeries,cir.
it is the witness present refreshed opposed to the contents of the writing used to refresh is the substantive evidence of the matter at issue.see united states humphrey,cir citing faulkner,at.while defense counsel ostensibly utilized the writing to refresh lockett present recollection of the interview,the query posed following lockett silent review of the writing targeted only whether the interview transcript accurately recounted lockett prior,court statements.see,vol.i at is that correct what you said on the afternoon of this accident,november the of,is that correct.remarkably,defense counsel did not enquire whether the interview transcript refreshed lockett recollection of the matter at issue namely,the interview.defense counsel instead instructed lockett to read,in the presence of the jury,the prior,unsworn statements contained in the interview transcript.we thus reach the inescapable conclusion that defense counsel impermissibly utilized the guise of refreshing recollect,shoupe,at,to place before the jury lockett prior,statements regarding the manner in which rush fell from the train.
it follows that defense counsel attempt to use lockett out of court statements as substantive evidence of the manner in which the accident occurred is governed by the rules of evidence addressing the use of hearsay.hearsay is a statement,other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing,offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted,fed.evid.c,which is not admissible except as provided by the federal rules of evidence,fed.evid.contends on appeal that lockett prior,out of court statements were admissible pursuant to the recorded recollection hearsay exception of rule.see final br.of appellee at.
misplaces its reliance on the recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule.rule allows a document to be read to the jury as a past recollection recorded if the witness once had knowledge about the facts in the document the witness now has insufficient memory to testify about the matters in the document and the document was recorded at a time when the matters were fresh in the witness mind and the document correctly reflects the witness knowledge of the matters.united states smith,cir citing united states porter,cir.under application of the recorded recollection exception,the interview transcript served to stand in the place of lockett insufficient memory of the accident.however,lockett provided detailed and lengthy testimony at trial regarding the events prior to,during,and immediately following the accident.it therefore would be erroneous to conclude that lockett had insufficient memory to testify about the matters in the interview transcript.indeed,concedes in its brief that lockett had sufficient memory of the accident.see final br.of appellee at in the case of doyle lockett,the witness only read his statement to the jury after stating it refreshed his collection.accordingly,the past recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule is wholly inapplicable to lockett prior statements regarding the accident.
we likewise reject attempts to invoke the residual exception to the hearsay rule.rule provides,in pertinent part 
a statement not specifically covered by rule or but having equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness,is not excluded by the hearsay rule,if the court determines that a the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact b the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts and c the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence.
fed.evid.this rule explicitly requires that the evidence must have equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness as compared to evidence admitted under the other hearsay exceptions contained in rules and.fed.evid.see united states barlow,cir.in addition,as stated by the rule,the evidence admitted must go to a material fact,must be more probative than any other evidence that reasonably could have been procured,and its admission must support the general purposes of the rules of evidence and the interests of justice.united states darwich,cir quoting fed.evid.
has made no showing,and the district court made no finding,that lockett prior statement,as introduced through the reading of interview transcript,meets the requirements of rule,including that the statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts and that the general purposes of these rules and the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence.fed.evid.this is of particularly import in light of the detailed testimony provided by lockett at trial.simply,has failed to demonstrate that the proffered evidence is more probative than the evidence and testimony properly presented at trial.see united states laster,cir.the residual hearsay exception therefore is of no recourse to.
having considered and rejected assertions that the district court properly admitted lockett prior statements into evidence pursuant to rule and various exceptions to the hearsay rule,we turn to the argument advanced for the first time on appeal that did not introduce the statements with the intention of proving that johnathan rush was actually running alongside the train when he was injured,the d efense merely offered the statements to impeach the testimony of lockett.see final br.of appellee at.it is that where the contents of the writing used to refresh a witness memory include prior statements of that witness that are inconsistent with the witness present testimony,the prior statement may be introduced to impeach the witness.see shoupe,at weinstein federal evidence if the witness continues to lack memory of the matter,or to insist on a different version of the matter,the party may wish to use the prior statement as impeachment.here,purportedly sought to impeach lockett direct testimony that he never saw anybody running to get on the back of the train,vol at,with his statement that johnathan was running alongside the train trying to get on,vol.i at.rule of the federal rules of evidence authorizes the impeachment of a witness by use of a prior inconsistent statement.see fed.evid a.indeed,our review of the record reveals that notwithstanding present invocations of rule and multiple hearsay exceptions,defense counsel attempted to use lockett prior statement for impeachment purposes.while improper under rule,defense counsel question which incorporated the prior statement is a traditional means of confronting a witness with a prior inconsistent statement.the district court instruction to confront the witness with the transcript,vol.i at,indicates that the district court perceived defense counsel as targeting inconsistencies between lockett prior statement and testimony at trial.although unnecessary under the current version of rule,defense counsel took the additional step of revealing the prior inconsistent statement to lockett during and afforded lockett with the opportunity to explain the apparent inconsistency.see,vol.i at see also united states mccall,cir quoting the advisory committee note to rule which provides,in pertinent part the traditional insistence that the attention of the witness be directed to the statement on is relaxed.
the issue is whether the jury considered lockett prior,statements introduced properly for impeachment purposes or mistakenly as substantive evidence of the circumstances surrounding rush accident.rule of the federal rules of evidence provides when evidence which is admissible as to one party or for one purpose but not admissible as to another party or for another purpose is admitted,the court,upon request,shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly.fed.evid.the text of the rule does not clearly require the trial court to give the instruction at the same time the jury is exposed to the evidence.see united states chance,cir.t he phrase is admitted may reasonably be interpreted to require simply that the trial court give the requested instruction during final instructions.chance,at citation omitted.
it is undisputed that the did not request a limiting instruction at the time lockett prior inconsistent statement was introduced into evidence.it is further undisputed that the did not object to the jury final instructions.the likewise does not challenge the jury instructions on appeal.
as the failed to request a limiting instruction,we review the matter for plain error.see chonich wayne county community college,cir fed.civ.d.it is plain error for the court not to give an instruction limiting consideration by the jury of an statement for impeachment purposes.see united states lester,cir united states dye,cir united states barnes,cir.t he danger against which such an instruction is meant to guard is that the jurors will use prior statements introduced solely to impeach a declarant as substantive evidence.united states kohrs,cir.
while the suggested during oral argument that the district court did not provide the jury with a limiting instruction regarding lockett prior inconsistent statements,our review of the limited record provided by the parties indicates that the jury received the following charge during their final instructions you must consider whether the witness testified inconsistently while on the witness stand,or if the witness said or did something or failed to say or do something at any time that is inconsistent with what the witness said while testifying.see jury instructions,filed with the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit on march.having the benefit of hindsight and defense counsel explanations as to the rationale underlying his introduction of the evidence,we are of the view that the district court should have provided an instruction to the jury at the time lockett statements were introduced into evidence which limited the evidence to impeachment and cautioned the jury against considering the evidence as an account of the manner in which rush fell from the train.we further find that the district court should have provided a final instruction that expressly identified lockett inconsistent statements and indicated that they were to be considered for impeachment purposes only nonetheless,we do not conclude that it was plain error as the district court did provide the jury with a general credibility instruction which addressed prior inconsistencies in a witness statements.the instruction correctly stated the applicable law,albeit without any specific reference to lockett statements.as we are compelled to find that jurors follow their instructions,see penry johnson,d,we conclude that the final instructions provided to the jury directed them to consider lockett prior inconsistent statements solely for impeachment purposes and thereby reject the assertion that the jury impermissibly considered lockett statements as substantive evidence of the accident.therefore,no evidentiary error occurred during lockett testimony.
whether it was evidentiary error to admit into evidence the of the interviews 
the asserts that the district court committed evidentiary error by admitting into evidence the of the interviews.following an evidentiary hearing,the district court determined that the were admissible extrinsic evidence of the witnesses prior inconsistent statements.
rule b provides that the impeaching party may produce extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement if the witness is afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the same and the opposite party is afforded an opportunity to interrogate the witness thereon fed.evid.b.the foundational prerequisites of rule b require only that the witness be given an opportunity,at some point,to explain or deny the prior inconsistent statement and that the opposing party be given the opportunity to examine the statement.see fed.evid.b united states foster,cir.
the contends that the district court erroneously admitted the into evidence because failed to establish an evidentiary foundation.the further contends that failed to properly authenticate the.
addressing the matter of authentication,rule a provides that authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.fed.evid.a.the rule also states,by way of illustration,that the testimony of a witness that the item is what it purports to be is sufficient authentication under the rule.see fed.evid.b.furthermore,identification of a voice over a telephone can be authenticated by opinion based upon hearing the voice at any time under circumstances connecting it with the alleged speaker.fed.evid.b.requisite familiarity can be acquired either before or after the particular speaking which is the subject of the identification.fed.evid,advisory committee notes.
properly authenticated the.martin provided extensive testimony regarding the time and manner in which he recorded the post accident statements.see,vol.i at.while the relies heavily on testimony that martin could not identify the voices on the tape without using the transcript,a review of the reveals that lockett and moore each identified themselves by name prior to recounting their versions of the accidents.moreover,our comparison of the interview transcript prepared by martin to the reveals an accurate transcription which identifies moore and lockett as the speakers.accordingly,we find that the district court properly concluded that the were authentic.
we similarly dismiss the assertion that did not establish a proper foundation for introducing the of moore statements.the contends that failed to confront moore with the purported inconsistent statements during.we addressed a similar argument in mccall,noting that while it was advisable for the impeaching party to confront the witness with the purported inconsistency during,a sufficient opportunity to explain or deny under rule existed where the impeached witness could be called on rebuttal.id.at.the district court adopted this view in addressing the objection 
well,obviously when your in the trial you can put on your proof and he can put on his proof,you will get the opportunity to do rebuttal even if i let the tape in and somebody can explain something,you can do that on rebuttal,so that not the big issue.
vol.i at.as the has failed to advance any argument as to whether moore was unavailable for recall as a rebuttal witness,we conclude that her claims challenging the of moore statements are without merit.
we reach a separate conclusion with regard to the introduction of the statements of lockett.we long have held that when a witness admits to making a prior inconsistent statement,extrinsic proof of the statement is inadmissible.dilley chesapeake ohio ry,cir see also united states greer,cir holding taped statement in direct conflict with trial testimony excludable where on witness admitted making statement united states sisto,cir holding that proof of prior inconsistent statement may be elicited by extrinsic evidence only if witness on cross examination denies making it.as discussed supra,lockett admitted that the interview transcript of the accurately reflected his prior statements.see,vol.i at.consequently,extrinsic evidence of lockett prior statements was unnecessary.
moreover,lockett earlier reading of the prior statements to the jury causes greater concern.rule b address only when extrinsic proof of a prior inconsistent statement is inadmissible it says nothing about the admissibility of such evidence.a district court may exercise its discretion to exclude such evidence when its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,or misleading the jury,or by considerations of undue delay,waste of time,or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.see fed.evid.impeached lockett testimony with prior inconsistent statements during.lockett read these prior inconsistent statements to the jury.we find that it was evidentiary error to admit extrinsic and cumulative evidence of lockett prior inconsistent statements under such circumstances.
whether the erroneous admission of lockett statements affected substantial rights 
having found evidentiary error at trial,we must address whether the district court admission of lockett statements affected the substantial rights of the.see beck,at.we conclude that it does not.
the gravamen of the claims was that the switching crew exhibited negligence in the operation of the train.responded with various,that rush was a trespasser.the threshold question for the jury therefore was whether the switching crew used ordinary care in the operation of the train.see chattanooga station harper.
notwithstanding the various and conflicting accounts of the accident,the evidence addressing alleged negligence was relatively straightforward.before the jury was the testimony of all three members of the switching crew.the three members each testified that it was their custom and practice to sound the horn and bells prior to commencing any movement of the train.however,no member of the switching crew could recall if the bells and horn sounded prior to rush accident.two members of the switching and not remember seeing children near or around the train on the date of the accident,while the train seeing two young men standing approximately fifteen feet away from the railroad tracks,see,vol.ii at.moore and lockett each testified that they played near the train while rush and two other young men climbed alongside the stopped railcar.rush similarly testified that he climbed on the train side ladder while the train was stopped.all three young men testified that they did not hear any bells or horn prior to the train commencing movement.an expert witness,scott,reviewed this testimony and opined that the switching crew breached the ordinary standard of care by failing to stop the train upon the appearance of children near the track.scott further testified that there lacked any evidence that the switching crew actually sounded the horn and sounded the bells.
in light of the foregoing evidence,there lacks any indication that the erroneous admission of lockett statements would substantially affect the jury determination of negligence on the part of switching crew.had impeached lockett testimony during.the danger in admitting further cumulative and extrinsic evidence of lockett prior inconsistent statement was that the jury would give undue weight to the testimony or consider the prior inconsistent statement as substantive evidence.however,the inconsistency established through the as to whether lockett was running alongside the train or climbing on the side ladder at the time of the accident is irrelevant to the issue of whether the switching crew acted in a negligent manner.indeed,under each account,rush person was on the side of the train either on a ladder or on foot prior to the accident.the issue of whether rush was running alongside the train tends to address the issue of comparative issue the jury did not have the opportunity to address in light of their finding of no negligence on the part of.specifically,the jury signed and returned a verdict form which read do you find the defendant to be at fault see.the jury responded no.see.as a result,the jury addressed the questions posed on the verdict form pertaining to the fault.
accordingly,we conclude that while it was evidentiary error for the district court to admit into evidence the of lockett prior statements,the error did not affect the substantial rights of the parties.therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion.
negligence per se 
the second assertion on appeal is that violated tennessee lookout statute.code ann,and thereby committed negligence per se.the advances two specific assertions the district court erred by not finding negligence per se as a matter of law and that the jury erred in failing find negligent per se.
tennessee law provides 
every railroad company shall keep the engineer,fireman,or some other person upon the locomotive,always upon the lookout ahead
