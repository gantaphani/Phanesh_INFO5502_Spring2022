opinion of the court 
introduction 
after larry squires was injured in a motor vehicle accident,his automobile insurer allstate property and casualty insurance company allstate filed an action in the district court seeking a declaratory judgment that it was not obligated to pay uninsured motorist um benefits to squires under his policy.subsequently,in response to allstate motion,the court granted it a judgment on the pleadings on march,as it held that squires injuries did not arise out of ownership,maintenance or use of an uninsured auto as his policy required for allstate to be liable to him for um benefits.for the following reasons,we will reverse.
ii.facts and procedural history 
on october,squires was driving his pickup truck on state highway in beaver county,pennsylvania when he was injured after swerving to avoid an approximately square cardboard box lying in the middle of his lane.the parties to this action are uncertain as to how the box came to be left on the road but,for purposes of its motion in the district court,allstate stipulated that an unidentified vehicle dropped the box following the accident,allstate,after rejecting squires claim for um benefits,filed this action and squires responded with counterclaims for breach of contract and insurance bad faith under.ann.west allstate then moved for judgment on the pleadings and for dismissal of the counterclaims.
squires policy provides,in relevant part 
w e allstate will pay damages to an insured person squires for bodily injury which an insured person is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured auto.bodily injury must be caused by accident and arise out of the ownership,maintenance,or use of an uninsured auto.
app.at.the policy language tracks the pennsylvania motor vehicle financial responsibility law mvfrl,which requires that insurers offer um benefits in motor vehicle liability insurance policies the mvfrl provides for uninsured motorist coverage as follows 
uninsured motorist coverage shall provide protection for persons who suffer injury arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle and are legally entitled to recover damages therefor from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles.
ann.b west.the mvfrl defines uninsured motor vehicle to include,inter alia 
an unidentified motor vehicle that causes an accident resulting in injury provided the accident is reported to the police or proper governmental authority and the claimant notifies his insurer within days,or as soon as practicable thereafter,that the claimant or his legal representative has a legal action arising out of the accident.
although squires insurance policy unlike the mvfrl does not include unidentified motor vehicles in its definition of uninsured auto,see app.at,allstate did not dispute and the district court,quite reasonably in view of section,assumed that the unidentified vehicle was an uninsured motor vehicle for purposes of the court coverage analysis accordingly,the sole issue that the court decided was whether an accident caused by a box which fell from an uninsured motor vehicle can be attributed,as a matter of law,to the ownership,maintenance or use of an automobile.app.at.the court answered this question in the negative,concluding that there is um coverage for policies containing the arising out of language only when a vehicle and not some other object such as the box was the instrumentality causing the a ccident.app.at.accordingly,on march,the court granted allstate motion for judgment on the pleadings,denied its motion to dismiss the counterclaims as moot,and dismissed squires counterclaims as moot.squires timely appealed.

iv.discussion 
the parties agree that pennsylvania law governs our interpretation of squires policy and thus the extent to which it provides coverage,and therefore we apply pennsylvania law on this appeal.under pennsylvania law,
the interpretation of a contract of insurance is a matter of law for the courts to decide.in interpreting an insurance contract,we must ascertain the intent of the parties as manifested by the language of the written agreement.when the policy language is clear and unambiguous,we will give effect to the language of the contract.

as the district court recognized,the sole question in this case is whether under the policy and pennsylvania law squires accident should be regarded as having arisen out of ownership,maintenance,or use of an uninsured auto.we note that to the extent the state highest court has not addressed the precise question presented,we must predict how that court would resolve the issue.wayne moving storage of,sch.dist.of,cir alterations and citations omitted.in doing so,
we must look to decisions of state intermediate appellate courts,of federal courts interpreting that state law,and of other state supreme courts that have addressed the issue,as well as to analogous decisions,considered dicta,scholarly works,and any other reliable data tending convincingly to show how the highest court in the state would decide the issue at hand.

we start,however,with the pennsylvania supreme court case of manufacturers casualty insurance goodville mutual casualty,in which that court held that c onstrued strictly against the insurer,arising out of in an insurance policy means causally connected with,not proximately caused by.but for causation,a cause and result relationship,is enough to satisfy this provision of the policy.id.at.this formulation of arising out of is now in pennsylvania,and has been applied in various insurance law settings,both when interpreting insurance policies and assessing issues arising by operation of statutes,even though some of the cases applying the formulation do not cite goodville.see,tuscarora wayne mut.ins.kadlubosky,assessing a commercial general liability insurance policy roman mosaic tile aetna cas.and sur,same smith united servs.auto.ass n.super applying the goodville formulation to an uninsured motorist policy provision erie ins.exch.eisenhuth,automobile insurance policy.accordingly,squires at this time only need have alleged adequately that the unidentified vehicle use was a cause of his injuries 
in making our analysis we are aware that pennsylvania intermediate appellate courts quite broadly have indicated that if injuries are caused by an instrumentality or external force other than the motor vehicle itself,the vehicle will not be regarded as having contributed to the cause of the injuries pursuant to the arising out of language.see lucas raso am.mfrs.ins.for example,in lucas raso the superior court of pennsylvania held in a workers compensation subrogation action that an employee injuries did not arise from the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle when the employee slipped in a pothole as she was approaching her car.accordingly,a provision of the mvfrl.ann.west,that bars subrogation claims in cases arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle did not preclude the workers compensation insurance carrier that had paid benefits to the employee from subrogating to the recovery on the employee claims for damages arising from the fall.id.at.the court acknowledged that while the employee was at the time of her fall,she has failed to establish the necessary nexus between her injury and the use of the vehicle,observing that the employee had offered no connection to link her fall to the use of her vehicle other than her claim that she was en route to enter it.the facts illustrate that it was not the act of entering her vehicle which caused the fall,and there was no other vehicle involved to break the chain of entry.id.
the superior court employed reasoning similar to that of lucas raso in smith united services automobile ass n,a case on which the district court in this case heavily relied.in smith a boy was riding his bicycle on a road as a tractor pulling a hay wagon passed by him.as the vehicles were passing,a boy riding in the wagon threw hay in the bicycle rider face,causing him to crash into a tree and suffer serious injuries.smith and his parents sued their automobile liability insurer seeking uninsured motorist coverage,but the court held that the injuries were not caused by a vehicle,but rather by the intentional act of a third party,the passenger,throwing hay.id.at.accordingly,the court held that b ecause we are unable to discern any causal connection between the vehicle and the injury,the injury can not be said to arise from the ownership,maintenance,or use of the vehicle,and therefore the plaintiffs were not entitled to uninsured motorist benefits under their policy.id.
relying on smith,the district court rejected squires claim for coverage as it concluded that the determinative fact is that the instrumentality causing the underlying accident was a box not a vehicle.app.at.we think,however,that smith is distinguishable from this case,and,when faced with a set of facts similar to those here,the pennsylvania supreme court would hold that squires accident arose out of the ownership,maintenance,or use of an uninsured auto.as squires points out,smith concerned the intentional intervening act of a third party a person throwing hay from the back of a vehicle.hence,in line with goodville emphasis on causation in fact,the smith court held that it is clear that the injury was not caused by the vehicle,but by the boy intentionally throwing hay in smith face.smith,at.the court noted that it had interpreted the phrase maintenance and use of a motor vehicle to mean the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle as a vehicle,including,incident to its maintenance or use as a vehicle,occupying,entering into,or alighting from it.id.quoting camacho nationwide ins,emphasis in original.in squires case,in contrast to the incidental involvement of the vehicle in the boy injury in smith,we will infer that the unidentified vehicle directly was involved in the accident as it was transporting the box as cargo a common use for many types of vehicles traveling on a roadway.see.ann.west motor vehicle code definitions section defining vehicle as e very device in,upon or by which any person or property is or may be transported emphasis added.thus,when the unidentified vehicle dropped the cardboard box,it had more than an incidental involvement in the situation that gave rise to squires injuries.see alvarino allstate ins,rather,the accident was a direct consequence of the use of the vehicle for its intended purpose,for as is sometimes said in another context,things fall off the truck.
we have examined the four cases on which smith principally relied but find them to be easily distinguishable from this case as they all concerned intervening actions in situations in which the injuries sustained were not attributable to common uses of a vehicle.see roach port auth.of allegheny,holding that a bus passenger who was injured as a result of a fight between two other passengers did not establish the requisite causal connection between the maintenance and use of a motor vehicle and the injuries alvarino,a d at holding that a passenger who was bitten by a dog chained inside a van did not suffer injuries arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle,because the motor vehicle was merely the place where injuries were sustained camacho,at holding that injuries sustained by driver sitting in car caused by an explosive device that was thrown from another vehicle did not arise out of the use of the other vehicle schweitzer aetna life and cas,denying coverage for a claimant who was pulled from her vehicle and assaulted,because neither she nor her assailant was acting in the role of motorist,and an assault by an armed assailant upon the driver of a car is not the type of conduct that is reasonably identifiable with the use of a car internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also ohio cas.grp.of ins.bakaric,refusing to interpret an incident where a husband shot his wife in the face in the front seat of a car as one arising from the use of a motor vehicle eisenhuth,at holding that injuries suffered by a vehicle passenger as the result of a gunshot did not satisfy goodville standard for arising out of day state farm mut.ins,holding that injuries sustained in a fistfight between two drivers did not arise out of the ownership,maintenance,or use of a vehicle for purposes of assessing uninsured motorist coverage.
in support of its position,allstate points to our decision in underwriters insurance liberty mutual insurance,cir.in underwriters,robert hipl parked his car at a nursing home in preparation for a business meeting.as he exited his vehicle,hipl slipped on grease that had come from the nursing home kitchen and then coated a section of the parking lot.id.at.in the process,he struck his back on the car door and was injured.id.after hipl employer workers compensation carrier paid him benefits,it asserted that it had acquired a subrogation lien on the proceeds of a action hipl brought against the nursing home and other defendants.id.following the settlement of the action,the defendants insurers sought to invalidate the lien under the provision of the mvfrl involved in lucas raso that bars a workers compensation insurer right of subrogation to recover benefits from an insured tort recovery if the injuries arose from the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle.id.we applied goodville formulation of arising out of,but,noting that every incidental factor that arguably contributes to an accident is not a but for cause in the legal sense,see berry sugar notch borough,we cited smith and several similar intermediate appellate court cases and concluded that a pennsylvania court would not hold that hipl injuries arose out of the use of his car based on the particular facts of the case.id.at.
underwriters clearly is distinguishable from this case.we first observe that while,as here,something physically external to a vehicle caused the injuries in underwriters as the grease that directly caused hipl to fall emanated from a nearby building,the procedural posture of our case requires us to consider that the cardboard box that caused the accident was dropped on the road by an unidentified and thus uninsured vehicle.consequently,there is a stronger factual causal connection here between the injuries sustained and the ownership,maintenance,or use of an automobile than the connection between the injuries and the vehicle in underwriters.in underwriters we recognized how attenuated the causal connection was between the injury and the vehicle for in reaching our result we relied on the analogous case of lucas raso,which reasoned
