in this diversity malpractice action,the appellants claim that their son,suffered catastrophic injuries during and immediately following his birth because of the negligence of appellee,antonio,the obstetrician who performed delivery.after the plaintiffs presented their to a jury,the district court granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of.the court concluded that the plaintiffs evidence was insufficient to establish two elements of a medical malpractice claim a departure from the relevant standard of care and a causal relationship between the departure and the harm to their son.
on appeal,the plaintiffs argue that the district court committed reversible error when it made several evidentiary rulings that resulted in the exclusion of expert testimony.because we agree that the district court improperly limited the testimony of one of the plaintiffs experts,carolyn crawford,we vacate the judgment for and remand for further proceedings.
background 
consistent with the applicable standard of review for a judgment as a matter of law,we recite the relevant facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.see energynorth natural gas,century indem,cir.defendant,antonio was plaintiff dilma physician during her pregnancy with and attended at his birth.visited on at least seven occasions for prenatal care during her pregnancy.she was expected to deliver on or around june.
on may,arrived at hospital auxilio mutuo in active labor.when her labor did not progress over the next few hours,she received intravenous pitocin,a drug used to increase the frequency of contractions,her water was artificially broken,and an epidural anaesthetic was begun.when was fully dilated,an attempt was made to use vacuum extraction to deliver.that attempt was unsuccessful.eventually delivered by cesarean section.
after the delivery,required the transfusion of four units of blood.she remained hospitalized until may.was in critical condition when he was delivered.he remained in intensive care until august,when he was discharged to another hospital where he continued to receive treatment for brain damage and physical abnormalities.current prognosis is bleak.he has permanent brain damage and has been diagnosed with cerebral palsy.due to organ damage,he must be fed through a tube in his abdominal wall.those conditions are not expected to improve over time.
on may,brought this suit in federal district court along with her husband,michael pietri pozzi,on behalf of themselves and collectively the plaintiffs,alleging that medical malpractice by and hospital español auxilio mutuo de puerto rico caused catastrophic injury to early in the litigation,the plaintiffs reached a confidential settlement with the hospital and its insurer,admiral insurance company.
the plaintiffs remaining malpractice claims against alleged,specifically,that departed from the standard of care by,among other things,failing to elicit a comprehensive obstetrical history from,failing to estimate fetal weight and to enter it into the delivery record,attempting a delivery by vacuum extraction,failing to use an internal fetal heart monitor,and failing to timely call for a delivery.the plaintiffs claimed that those deviations from the standard of care resulted in profound damage to,as well as respiratory failure,sepsis,asphyxia and seizures.they further alleged that they have suffered emotional anguish as a result of the trauma to,and that,due to their limited economic resources,has not been able to receive sufficient medical care or therapy.
b.the trial 
trial by jury began on may.the plaintiffs proposed to call three medical expert witnesses as part of their.one of those experts,an obstetrician,failed to appear because of illness,and the trial court ruled that his deposition testimony could not be admitted into evidence in his absence.when the plaintiffs called their next two medical experts,a specialist in and a neurologist,the court limited the testimony of each one,ruling that the doctors were not qualified to offer testimony on either the appropriate standard of care for an obstetrician in position,or on the issue of whether any deviations from the standard of care caused the injuries to 
predictably,when the plaintiffs had finished presenting their case,the court had to grant motion for judgment as a matter of law.without the testimony of their missing expert and with their two remaining medical experts precluded from testifying on the standard of care and causation,the plaintiffs did not have enough evidence to support their claims.
although the plaintiffs contest all of the abovementioned evidentiary rulings on appeal,we focus here on the court ruling that the plaintiffs expert in neonatal and perinatal medicine,carolyn crawford,would not be permitted to offer testimony on the standard of care and causation.as we explain,that erroneous ruling alone requires a new trial.
elements of medical malpractice 
this diversity suit is governed by the substantive law of puerto rico.see marcano rivera turbado med,cir.in puerto rico,as in many jurisdictions,in order to prevail on a medical malpractice claim,a party must establish the duty owed an act or omission transgressing that duty and a sufficient causal nexus between the breach and the harm.id.citation omitted.in the context of medical malpractice actions,the puerto rico supreme court has explained that a physician duty is to offer his or her patient that medical care,attention,skill,and protection that,in the light of the modern means of communication and education,and pursuant to the current status of scientific knowledge and medical practice,meets the professional requirements generally acknowledged by the medical profession.santiago otero méndez.to prevail,a plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence both that the standard of care was not met,and that the failure to meet an acceptable standard caused the harm.id.in order to determine the applicable standard of care in a medical malpractice action and to make a judgment on causation,a trier of fact will generally need the assistance of expert testimony.see sociedad espanola de auxilio mutuo y beneficiencia de,cir citing municipality of san juan,cir lama boras,cir.
admission of expert testimony 
the admission of expert testimony is governed by federal rule of evidence.rule requires that expert testimony be based upon sufficient facts or data,the product of reliable principles and methods,and that the witness apply the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.we have described the trial judge as the gatekeeper in applying rule admissibility criteria.gaydar sociedad instituto y planificacion familiar,cir.the judge must decide whether the scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge the expert offers will assist the trier better to understand a fact in issue.id.quoting united states alzanki,cir.the judge must ensure that an expert testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.united states mooney,cir quoting daubert merrell dow.as part of its inquiry,the trial court must determine whether the putative expert is qualified by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education,to offer testimony.mitchell united states,cir citation omitted.we have explained,however,that t he proffered expert physician need not be a specialist in a particular medical discipline to render expert testimony relating to that discipline.gaydar,at.
in mitchell,we held that an expert,an internist with a specialty in hematology and oncology,was qualified to opine on the standard of care that should have been met by a gastroenterologist performing a colonoscopy.at.similarly,in gaydar,we found that the mere fact that an expert was not a gynecologist does not mean that he was not qualified to give expert testimony regarding the plaintiff pregnancy.at.
although credentials such as board certification in a particular medical specialty may indicate that an expert opinion is entitled to greater weight,such certification has never been held a prerequisite to qualification as an expert medical witness.alvarado weinberger,cir per curiam.indeed,we have noted that it would be an abuse of discretion to exclude testimony that would otherwise assist the trier better to understand a fact in issue,simply because the expert does not have the specialization that the court considers most appropriate.gaydar,at citing holbrook lykes,cir finding an abuse of discretion when the trial judge prohibited physician specializing in internal medicine from opining on plaintiff cancer because he was not an oncologist.
crawford credentials 
carolyn crawford is a specialist in pediatrics and neonatal and perinatal medicine.the pretrial order specified that the plaintiffs would call her as an expert in neonatology regarding her review of the pertinent records,the standards of care within her field of expertise applicable to this case,the defendants departures from such standards,about condition and the causal relationship between said condition and the defendants departures.upon motion,the parties conducted a daubert inquiry outside the presence of the jury into crawford credentials.see daubert.at that hearing,crawford was asked to elaborate on her qualifications,which we summarize here.
after obtaining her medical degree,crawford completed a pediatric residency followed by a fellowship in medicine.she is board certified in medicine.as a specialist in medicine,crawford deals with problems during pregnancy,labor,and delivery that a ffect the baby.she served for several years as the medical director of the southern new jersey perinatal cooperative.in that role,she developed a statewide educational program called perinatal emergencies.her team presented a standard of care,that is the appropriate thing to do in such a situation.for instance,with fetal monitoring,that when uterine hyper stimulation occurs,that you did a number of things.you turn off the pitocin.you give fluids,oxygen,change position.subsequently,we recommended that terbutaline,which is a uterine relaxation drug,be considered to relax the uterus,allow better blood flow and oxygen to the fetus and that the patient be evaluated for a timely delivery.
crawford has written chapters for several published medical books.most relevantly,she authored a chapter on fetal asphyxia,which covers the administration of pitocin,and a chapter entitled,differential diagnosis of respiratory distress,which was intended to help physicians understand when they have a baby that was breathing or a baby that had breathing problems how to differentiate what the cause of those were.
although crawford does not perform,she has served as a consultant in deliveries and set the wheels in motion when she determined that a was indicated.thus,she can identify the problems and prepare the patient.she has been trained to identify ominous patterns on a fetal monitor and to evaluate whether the patient is likely to be able to deliver quickly vaginally or whether a cesarean section will be needed.she also conducts peer review evaluations of unexpected outcomes after delivery.such review involves taking into account the obstetrical care,the obstetrical nursing care,the delivery care,the neonatal management.crawford has previously been qualified to testify on departures from the standard of care in obstetrics in both state and federal cases.
d.the decision to limit crawford testimony 
after hearing the evidence outlined above,the district court issued an order precluding crawford from providing her opinion as to obstetrical standards of care,departures from these standards,or causation in this case.the court agreed with argument that because crawford experience and training is not in obstetrics and gynecology,she can not provide expert testimony regarding the alleged departures in the standards of care committed by defendant,an.citing crawford lack of board certification in obstetrics and gynecology and her statement that it is typically an who makes the final decisions regarding a woman in labor,the court ruled that crawford would not be permitted to testify as to the events that occurred before and during the cesarean section,and that she could not provide any testimony pertaining to the cause of injuries.crawford proceeded to testify only about medical conditions and the testing that he underwent immediately following his birth.
we review a trial court decision to admit or exclude expert testimony for abuse of discretion.gaydar,at.a district court enjoys substantial discretion to decide whether to admit or exclude relevant expert testimony.mitchell,at.as we described above,the judge task is to ensure that the expert testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.mooney,at quoting daubert,at.in carrying out this responsibility,the trial court must bear in mind that an expert with appropriate credentials and an appropriate foundation for the opinion at issue must be permitted to present testimony as long as the testimony has a tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.an unduly restrictive review of the relevant expertise of a physician is incompatible with what we have characterized as a liberal standard of relevance.mitchell,at quoting daubert,at noting that rule basic standard of relevance is a liberal one.
in light of these standards,we conclude that the district court abused its discretion when it refused to permit crawford to testify on the relevant standard of care and causation.the court mistakenly relied on crawford lack of board certification in obstetrics and gynecology to preclude her from testifying.in its opinion and order granting motion for judgment as a matter of law,the court explained 
crawford testified that she was not in,and that she had no privileges to administer p itocin to a patient or to perform a cesarean section.she further testified that although she serves as a consultant at births,it is the who actually delivers the baby and makes the final decisions regarding the delivery.
accordingly,the court rule s that crawford testimony be limited to exclude any testimony regarding standards of care,departures from standards of care,and causation.
the court thus found that because crawford herself is not certified to administer pitocin or perform,she would not be qualified to opine on the alleged departures from the standards of care committed by,an.
that logic is flawed.the dispositive question is not whether an expert is board certified in a particular medical specialty.rather,the rules of evidence require that the judge admit expert testimony relevant to the disposition of the case when it will assist the trier of fact in understanding a fact in issue and rests on a reliable foundation.see.mooney,at gaydar,at.
crawford credentials easily meet and,indeed,surpass the standard for admissibility of expert testimony.she is in,and practices,perinatal and neonatal medicine.as enumerated above,she has published book chapters that deal with the administration of pitocin.she has served as a consultant at deliveries and has recommended that be performed.she conducts peer review evaluations that involve taking into account the obstetrical and delivery care that a patient is given,and she has worked on guidelines for responding to perinatal emergencies.she has scientific,technical,and other specialized knowledge that will assist the trier better to understand a fact in issue.gaydar,at citation omitted.her knowledge rests on a reliable foundation,mooney,at,her medical education and many years of experience in the field.her testimony is relevant to the task at hand.id.indeed,without crawford testimony on causation and the standard of care,the plaintiffs were unable to present evidence on two elements of their case.
trying to defend the district court ruling on a different ground,argues that,whether or not she was properly credentialed to serve as an expert,crawford testimony was correctly excluded because the plaintiffs did not disclose her prior to the trial as an expert in the appropriate standard of care and causation.in making this argument,attempts to analogize the district court limitation on crawford testimony in this case to the district
