background 
i.the medical malpractice action 
on may,david weinstock was born at huntington hospital the hospital and suffered severe and permanent brain damage resulting from inadequate intake of oxygen.lawrence horn,the attending obstetrician,had diagnosed fetal distress and performed an emergency cesarean section when he realized that david was not receiving enough oxygen in the womb.upon delivery,david was resuscitated by the attending anesthesiologist,because there was no pediatrician present in the delivery room.following the delivery,horn sent david to the nursery,believing incorrectly that the hospital had called a pediatrician to attend to david there.horn did not himself contact a pediatrician,nor did the hospital.in fact,a pediatrician was not called until a nurse became concerned over david labored breathing and other signs of continued respiratory distress in the nursery.as a result,david was not seen by a pediatrician until forty minutes after his difficult birth david injuries left him unable to walk or talk and with no possibility of improvement.at the same time,psychological testing revealed that david was highly intelligent with amazing conceptual abilities.
on december,the weinstock family weinstocks commenced a medical malpractice action in the new york state supreme court,suffolk county,against horn and the hospital.the claims against horn were,inter alia,that he failed to evaluate the signs of fetal distress and fail ed to notify the pediatrician of david condition and status.in february,prior to trial,the weinstocks settled with horn for million.
the claims against the hospital were,inter alia,that it fail ed to properly oxygenate david fail ed to make sure that there was a pediatrician in attendance at the delivery and failed to have rules and regulations in place to ensure that proper pediatric staff was available.the litigation against the hospital was controlled by healthcare underwriters mutual insurance company healthcare which had issued a million primary insurance policy.new england insurance company new england was responsible for million in excess coverage.healthcare retained robert lapping lapping to defend the malpractice action.the healthcare policy required that the hospital consent to the settlement of any claims.
healthcare never made a settlement offer on behalf of the hospital at any time prior to or during the malpractice litigation.healthcare apparently refused to entertain settlement because it contended i that horn was responsible for calling a pediatrician,and ii that david injuries occurred before birth.at the same time,healthcare was aware early on of weaknesses in the case,which included the hospital failure to have any written rules and regulations specifying who was responsible for contacting a pediatrician,and expert opinion that david injuries occurred immediately prior to his birth at the time when he and his mother were in the care of both the hospital and horn.
before the weinstocks settled with horn in february,their settlement demand to the hospital was,only of healthcare policy limit following the settlement with horn,the weinstocks raised the amount demanded of the hospital to million.on june,to trial and while the weinstocks settlement demand to the hospital was still england sent healthcare the first of five bad faith letters demanding that healthcare offer its policy limit to settle with the weinstocks,and warning that the case possessed enormous verdict potential given the profound brain damage david had suffered and the hospital failure to have a pediatrician present during the cesarean section delivery and immediately thereafter.
healthcare allowed the malpractice action to proceed to trial on july,with the hospital as the sole defendant.on july,during the plaintiff case,the weinstocks raised their settlement demand from million to million.at about that time,the trial judge,reversing an earlier ruling,allowed the weinstocks rehabilitation expert,joseph carfi,to testify that the cost of david lifetime care would be million.plaintiffs economist,kershner,projected million in total economic damages.at this point,lapping believed that the best the hospital could expect in the event of a plaintiffs verdict was that the jury would award million in damages and apportion of the liability to the hospital and to horn.
at the conclusion of the plaintiffs case,the weinstocks raised their settlement demand to million,the total amount of coverage available under the combined limits of the healthcare and new england policies in addition to the bad faith letters sent by new england,on july,the hospital also sent a bad faith letter to healthcare demanding settlement t his case will be difficult to win and the exposure far exceeds the limits of insurance coverage we purchased a decade ago.healthcare remained unmoved.
the trial resumed on august,with the presentation of the defense case.on that date,horn testified,based in part upon his written notes,that he expected that someone from the hospital would have called a pediatrician before the emergency cesarean section and that,when he sent david to the nursery,he believed a pediatrician had already been called by the hospital.horn acknowledged that it is generally the attending obstetrician responsibility to call the pediatrician.on august,on,leonard rosenzweig,the hospital pediatric expert,conceded a departure from medical procedure by the hospital in not starting david on an drip until the pediatrician arrived in the nursery,although he also testified on redirect that this departure was not likely to have caused david injuries 
on september,the jury returned a verdict for the weinstocks in the amount of million,or million of which was attributed to horn and or million of which was attributed to the hospital.thereafter,the case settled for million.of this amount,healthcare paid million its policy limit and new england paid million.
ii.the bad faith action 
on march,new england sued healthcare in the district court based upon diversity jurisdiction alleging that healthcare had the opportunity and the obligation to settle the weinstock action within the primary policy limit of million both prior to and during the malpractice trial and that its refusal to do so constituted bad faith new england sought to recover million,plus interest.
the bad faith action was tried before a jury beginning in november.at the close of new england direct case,healthcare moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure fed.the district court denied the rule motion,concluding that it would be a jury question whether the hospital would have consented to settle if asked to consent.trial transcript tr.at.the court also noted that there is evidence in this case,much evidence,that the hospital representative was never consulted,and that he would seriously have considered consenting,if he had been asked to consent he went along with healthcare recommendation they never asked him to consent to anything.tr.at the court further stated,i think there is enough evidence on clear liability for the jury.tr.at.
healthcare moved again for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence.once again,the district court denied the motion,this time stating,i am not the jury i t is not a case where there can be but one conclusion that reasonable jurors would reach.no reasonable juror would be compelled to accept the view of healthcare in this case.tr.at emphasis added.the trial court also reasoned that whether huntington hospital would have consented had a timely settlement opportunity been afforded it,is a question for the jury to decide.tr.at.
during the charge conference preceding jury deliberations,the district judge initially informed counsel that he intended to instruct the jury,inter alia,that new england bore the burden of proving that the hospital liability was clear at a time that healthcare had an opportunity to settle the case within its policy limit,according to its reading of the leading new york bad faith case,pavia state farm mut.auto.ins.new england objected,arguing persuasively that pavia established a multifactor test to be considered by the jury in determining an insurer bad faith and did not require a preliminary or threshold showing of clear liability.prior to summations and prior to charging the jury,the district court advised counsel that it had reconsidered its earlier thinking about clear liability,stating 
the new york pattern jury instructions make no mention whatsoever of clear liability every court which has addressed the bad faith analysis since pavia has cited the probability of success on the issue of liability as one aspect of the multifactor balancing test t he court has found no case since pavia in which a court held that a finding of clear liability was given conclusive or totally dispositive weight as my original jury instructions would give it accordingly,after a review of all the cases and the pattern jury instructions approved expressly by the new york court of appeals,the court finds that the likelihood of success on the issue of liability or the probability of a plaintiff verdict in the underlying case,as set forth in the new york pattern jury instructions,is the correct statement of the law.
tr.at emphasis added.
the district court directed the jury to determine whether healthcare acted in gross disregard of new england interests in reaching its decisions not to settle.tr.at it relied upon the new york pattern jury instructions pji and did not employ its clear liability theory in its jury charges 
an insurer can not be compelled to concede liability and settle a questionable claim simply because an opportunity to do so is present.however,in deciding whether to settle or try the case defendant healthcare was required to view the situation as it would if there were no policy limit applicable to the weinstock claim and it alone was liable for the entire amount of the weinstock claim and to weigh the probabilities and reach a judgment which did not grossly disregard new england interests.
in determining whether the defendant healthcare acted in bad faith in deciding not to settle the weinstock claim,you will consider all of the facts and circumstances existing at the time the decisions were made.
these facts and circumstances include the probability,in light of the evidence that it appeared would be presented to the jury,that the jury would find in favor of the weinstocks against the huntington hospital the evidence concerning injuries and damages in the prior trial that would be presented to the jury and the probability that a verdict,if in favor of the weinstocks would be in an amount which exceeded the healthcare one million dollar policy limit 
tr.at emphasis added.the district court distributed a verdict sheet to the jury which directed jurors to evaluate new england claim during two time periods,from february when horn settled with the weinstocks to july,the date the hospital demanded in writing that healthcare settle the case,and from july,to september,the date the jury returned its verdict in favor of the weinstocks on december,the jury returned a verdict in favor of new england and against healthcare with respect to both time periods.
after the verdict was announced,healthcare renewed its twice denied application for judgment as a matter of law.the district court denied this application orally from the bench.in so doing,the court determined that it was for the jury to decide whether healthcare conduct amounted to bad faith and whether the insured lost an actual opportunity to settle.the court emphasized that healthcare had not made a single settlement offer despite five bad faith letters from new england and one from the hospital and stated that it could think of a combination of circumstances which could cause a bigger verdict and a more certain verdict.tr.at the court posed the following rhetorical question how could any hospital where there is a prima facie case and the hospital is all alone in the case,how could any hospital win that case tr.at.
on january,healthcare filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to.and,in the alternative,for a new trial pursuant to.on june,the district court,in a written decision,reversed the jury verdict in favor of new also reversed its own three previous rulings.surprisingly,the court reintroduced its notion of clear liability after the jury had spoken and held that new england was required,but had failed,to prove two elements to succeed on its bad faith claim 
first,that there was a time when the liability in the weinstock action was is,all serious doubts as to the hospital liability were removed.second,that healthcare lost an actual opportunity to settle the claim within its million policy limit,at a time after liability became clear.
new england ins.healthcare underwriters mut,d,new england.the district court described clear liability as the point in time when all of the carrier defenses to liability were exhausted,id.at,adding that clear liability refers to the consideration of the liability only namely,whether it is clear that the hospital departed from accepted medical practice in its treatment of the injur ed party.id.at.clear liability did not,according to the district court,include other elements that would persuade a jury to return a verdict in favor of the plaintiff,such as sympathy for david or any other factors id.at.
the district court determined that,
as a matter of law,new england failed to prove that the liability was clear at any point from january,when settlement negotiations apparently commenced,until june,sic,at the end of the plaintiffs case therefore,there could not be responsibility on the part of healthcare for bad faith in failing to make an offer during this period of time.
id.at.the district court also determined that,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to new england,a reasonable jury could find that the hospital liability became clear on august,when the hospital witness,rozenweig sic,admitted that the hospital departed from accepted medical practice by not starting an id.but the court also decided that,on august,the weinstocks settlement demand was either million or million,and the evidence was unclear,equivocal,and speculative as to whether the weinstocks would have settled the case for million at that time id.
discussion 
healthcare motion for judgment as a matter of law 
we review de novo a district court grant of judgment as a matter of law,harris niagara mohawk power,cir,applying the same standard that the district court was required to apply,fletcher,cir.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only where a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.a.the court must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,and it may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.reeves sanderson plumbing,d see also chylinski stores,cir samuels air transp.local,cir song ives,cir.a court may not set aside a verdict unless the evidence is such that,without weighing the credibility of the witnesses or otherwise considering the weight of the evidence,there can be but one conclusion as to the verdict that reasonable persons could have reached.this is me,taylor,cir quoting cruz local union,int l of workers,cir 
in this diversity jurisdiction case,we look to the law of new york state.see albert loksen,cir celle filipino reporter enters,cir merrill lynch interfunding,argenti,cir.
the law of bad faith 
the law pertaining to bad faith claims in new york is and is premised upon principles of agency,because insurers typically exercise complete control over the settlement and defense of claims against their insureds,they may fairly be required to act in the insured best interests.pavia,at.insurers owe a duty to their insureds under new york law to act in good faith when deciding whether to settle a claim,and may be held liable for breach of that duty.pinto,at.an insurer duty to act in good faith is owed also to excess insurance carriers.see pavia,at,paul fire marine ins.united states fid.guar,see also fed.ins,d at.the duty of good faith reflects the inherent conflict between the primary insurer desire to settle the claim for as little as possible and the excess insurer desire to avoid a judgment exceeding the primary policy limit.see smith accident ins.a primary insurer discharges its duty of good faith by giving as much consideration to the excess carrier interests as it does to its own.see pinto,at pavia,at.
bad faith may only be found where the insurer acts in gross disregard of the excess carrier interests,not where the insurer is merely negligent.see pinto,at pavia,at.gross disregard means a pattern of behavior evincing a conscious or knowing indifference to the probability that an insured would be held personally accountable for a large judgment if a settlement offer within the policy limits were not accepted.id.at,emphasis added.bad faith does not require a sinister motive.id.at.
in assessing gross disregard,the jury must first consider and balance a number of medical and factors,including,among others,the plaintiff likelihood of success on the liability issue in the underlying action,the potential magnitude of damages and the financial burden each party may be exposed to as a result of a refusal to settle.id.at.other factors indicative of bad faith include the insurer failure to properly investigate the claim and any potential defenses thereto,the information available to the insurer at the time the demand for settlement is made,and any other evidence which tends to establish or negate the insurer bad faith in refusing to settle.id.at,see also pinto,at smith,at.
the jury must also determine whether a causal connection exists between the insurer bad faith once established and the loss of an actual settlement opportunity.t he plaintiff in a action must show that the insured lost an actual opportunity to settle the claim at a time when all serious doubts about the insured liability were removed.pavia,at,internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also pinto,at employers mut.cas.key,cir fed.ins,d at.
the new york court of appeals has approved a multifactor approach to bad faith along with pji which is the same instruction used by the district court here in formulating its jury charges.see smith,at,pavia,at.new york state court decisions,as well as decisions of this court,consistently have employed a multifactor test.see pinto,at no pat formula applies to the wide variety of fact patterns that occur,or readily resolves whether an insurer acted in good faith a number of factors must be evaluated.citation omitted vecchione amica mut.ins,dep t ansonia assocs.pub.serv.mut.ins,dep t redcross aetna cas.sur,dep t see also fed.ins,d at noting that a multifactor analysis determine s if there is a high probability that the excess insurer would be subject to personal liability because of the insurer actions,and whether the excess verdict reasonably could have been predicted.
we find that the district court correctly presented the law governing new england bad faith cause of action to the jury by properly explaining gross disregard,by utilizing pji which instructed the jury to analyze new england claim and healthcare actions under a multifactor approach tr.at,and by appropriately instructing the jurors to assess causation by determining whether,if they found bad faith,healthcare acted in bad faith at a time or times when it had an actual opportunity to settle the weinstock action for an amount within the primary policy limit.tr.at.
clear liability 
because we agree with the legal standards applied by the district court in charging the jury,we necessarily disagree with the clear liability language reintroduced by the district court in deciding healthcare application for judgment as a matter of law.as noted,clear liability was specifically rejected and abandoned by the district court in the charge conference with the following correct observation 
every court which has addressed the bad faith analysis since pavia has cited the probability of success on the issue of liability as one aspect of the multifactor balancing test there is no case since pavia in which a court held that a finding of clear liability was given conclusive or totally dispositive weight 
we believe that references by some courts to liability being clear is a loose shorthand for a bad faith finding and is used,if at all,in the context of assessing causation following and not during the multifactor bad faith inquiry see united states fid.guar.copfer,the insured claim for additional damages resulting from the insurer alleged bad faith must be rejected,however,since there was no showing whatsoever that the insured lost an actual opportunity to settle the negligence claim against him within the coverage limits of his policy by reason of the insurer purported bad faith.see also employers mut.cas,at a n insurer is liable under new york law only if the bad faith prejudiced an actual opportunity to settle within the coverage limits of the insurer pavia,at,at a time when all serious doubts about the insured liability were removed,an actual opportunity to settle must have been lost vecchione,at,confirming that a bad faith plaintiff must show that the policyholder lost an actual opportunity to settle the claim at a time when all serious doubts as to liability were removed ansonia,at,determining that a trier of fact could certainly conclude that the intransigence of the insurer deprived plaintiff of a legitimate opportunity to compromise the action within the limits of the available coverage at a point when there remained no doubt as to liability reifenstein allstate ins,dep t where it is alleged that an insured lost an actual opportunity to settle the negligence claim against him within the coverage limits of his policy by reason of the insurer purported bad faith,he states a cause of action against the insurer to recover the excess judgment.neither pavia passing reference to liability being clear nor passing mention of the phrase by other courts supports the imposition of a threshold requirement of clear liability in a bad faith cause of action 
legally sufficient evidence of bad faith 
the evidence adduced at trial was legally sufficient to sustain the jury finding of bad faith.reasonable jurors could have determined that the hospital was at least partially responsible for delay in david pediatric care and that,because david was not seen by a pediatrician until approximately minutes after his birth,his respiratory distress continued and caused additional brain damage.confusion on the part of horn may well have arisen from the hospital failure to have in place any clear,written rules as to who was responsible for calling a pediatrician a reasonable jury could also have concluded that the hospital was at fault for not having a pediatrician available during and immediately after david cesarean delivery.lapping testified that the issue that we fought the case over was whose responsibility was it to have a pediatrician in the delivery room.tr.at.and,a reasonable jury could have concluded that it would have been enormously difficult for the hospital to prevail on its medical defense s,that the hospital nurses provided the appropriate care until the pediatrician arrived and that the infant injuries were caused in utero.appellees br.at 
a reasonable jury could also have found the weinstocks were likely to succeed against the hospital based upon the profoundly disturbing nature of david injuries and the hospital unenviable position as the sole remaining defendant at trial following horn settlement.melito opined that,because horn settled before trial,the hospital defense was a very,very hard defense to go on with a infant when you are the only defendant in the case.it made it a very,very hard case to win.tr.at 
a reasonable jury also could have found that the hospital potential damages were enormous and that healthcare was aware that damages could very well exceed the million combined policy limits.carfi testified that david lifetime medical care would cost million,and kershner projected million in total economic damages.during the pretrial phase of the malpractice action,lapping informed healthcare that he could conceive of a verdict being affirmed in this case,and curry made a note in healthcare claim file about an million verdict in a similar case of a very intelligent child trapped in a completely d y sfunctional body.
there was legally sufficient evidence that new england with million in coverage at stake,not healthcare with million in coverage at stake,could bear the financial brunt of a big plaintiffs verdict.new england very first bad faith letter to healthcare on june,stated that refusal to settle this case within the million primary policy limit would unnecessarily expose not only new england umbrella policy but also huntington hospital uninsured assets above the million limits of the new england policy.the august,letter from new england reminded healthcare that s ettlement discussions obviously can not go forward unless and until healthcare makes its million primary policy limit available.the august,letter from new england was similarly direct new england is willing to engage in settlement negotiations and to offer significant amounts above the million primary policy limit in an attempt to settle the case.however,new england is being impeded by healthcare failure to make its million policy limit available.we therefore once again demand that healthcare do so.
there were additional factors presented to the jury which pointed to healthcare bad faith,including healthcare refusal to make any settlement offer to the weinstocks prior to or at any time during the malpractice action,despite a written demand from the hospital,its insured,and five written demands from new england,its healthcare failure to inform the hospital of an early settlement offer and healthcare failure to investigate properly the weinstock claim 
the district court reversal of the jury verdict is all the more surprising because at various points throughout the trial the court itself acknowledged that there was legally sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that healthcare had acted in bad faith.denying healthcare motion for judgment as a matter of law at the end of new england case,the district court determined that there is enough evidence for the jury to determine whether there is clear liability.tr.at.following the jury verdict,the district court found that a reasonable jury could come to this verdict.tr.at.indeed,the district court could think of a combination of circumstances which could cause a bigger verdict and a more certain verdict and could not understand how anyone thought the hospital would prevail.tr.at emphasis added.
legally sufficient evidence of causation 
the evidence adduced at trial was legally sufficient to sustain the jury finding of causation,that healthcare lost an actual opportunity to settle the weinstock action within its policy limit between february and july,and between july,and september.
first,a reasonable jury could have found that the weinstocks would have settled with the hospital within healthcare million policy limit prior to july.pegalis,the weinstocks trial counsel,testified that when the weinstocks settled with horn in february,would have settled the case against the hospital.tr.at the weinstocks settlement demand was not raised above the primary policy limit until july.and,the jury reasonably could have found that,if asked,the hospital would have consented to settle during this first time period.as noted,the head of risk management testified that the hospital consented to settle of the time that healthcare suggested it do so.in this instance,however,healthcare did not offer to settle and did not even inform the hospital of the weinstocks settlement demand 
there was also sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could have determined that healthcare lost an actual opportunity to settle the malpractice action for million between july,and september,when the hospital demand to settle the case was in writing pegalis testified that,although the weinstocks raised their settlement demand from million to million during this period,he would have seriously considered a settlement offer of million at the end of the plaintiffs case,and would have suggested that his clients strongly consider accepting such an offer at the end of the plaintiffs case.at the close of all the evidence,pegalis stated that he absolutely would have considered a settlement offer of million and presented it to his clients,even though he was not sure whether he would have recommended that the weinstocks accept such an offer.
the district court acknowledged,on december,when it denied healthcare first motion for judgment as a matter of law,that there was legally sufficient evidence that the hospital would have agreed to settle the weinstock case prior to july,as far as no consent,there is evidence in this case,in head testimony,much evidence,that he was never consulted,and that he would seriously have considered consenting,if he had been asked to consent.tr.at.on december,when the court denied healthcare second application for judgment as a matter of law,it said the hospital was never asked to settle,which is on the plaintiff side.so,all in all,i think whether huntington hospital would have consented had a timely opportunity been afforded it,is a question for the jury to decide.tr.at.in denying the third application for judgment as a matter of law,following the jury verdict for new england on december,the district court stated i recall that head testimony on that was in certain points almost clear that he would have followed the recommendation of healthcare,if one had been made.i think the jury could have found very easily that he would have consented.tr.at.and,even in its written opinion granting healthcare renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law,the trial court assumed,at least for the purpose of its opinion,that a reasonable jury could find,as a fact,that prior to and during the weinstock trial to the conclusion of the plaintiffs case,healthcare could have settled the claim against the hospital for million or less,with the consent of the hospital.new england,d at.
healthcare argues,unpersuasively in our view,that it could not be found guilty of bad faith at any point after the weinstocks raised their demand above,appellees br.at,and that bad faith is not established if the trier of fact would be forced to speculate whether the weinstocks would have accepted a settlement offer that was not made.id.at.as this court noted in pinto,plaintiffs willingness to settle for the policy limits is one way,but not the only way,to show that an actual opportunity to settle existed.at quoting hartford ins.methodist.of significance here is the fact,among many others,that healthcare simply never made any settlement offer,thus enabling and requiring the jury to draw inferences regarding lost opportunities to settle from the evidence adduced at the bad faith trial healthcare may not use its willful failure to pursue any settlement negotiations as a shield against bad faith liability.see paul fire marine ins,at,see also young am.cas,cir new york law imposes an affirmative duty on an insurer to pursue settlement negotiations.
having determined that the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law was improper,we reverse and order entry of judgment for new england on the jury verdict.see indu craft,bank of baroda,cir howes great lakes press,cir we have broad power under.b to reverse and direct that the jury verdict be reinstated.
ii.healthcare motion for a new trial 
we review a denial of a motion for a new trial for abuse of discretion.see lightfoot union carbide,cir.healthcare application requested,in the alternative,a new trial pursuant to.on the grounds that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that there was an error in the trial court charge.upon granting healthcare rule motion,the district court also denied healthcare rule motion for a new trial upon appeal,healthcare urges this court to grant a new trial rather than reinstate the jury verdict in favor of new england.
we have already determined that the jury charges were correct and that the evidence at trial supported the jury determinations in favor of new england.we find,having reviewed the entire record below,including several statements by the district court about the legal sufficiency of the evidence,that it would be inappropriate now to order a new trial.see generally mallis bankers trust,cir the circumstances ordinarily recognized as supporting a new trial are that the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result or that the verdict is a miscarriage of justice,that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence,that the damages awarded were excessive,or that for stated reasons the trial was not fair to the moving party.none of these circumstances were found by the trial judge,and in our search of the record we have found no evidence of any reason which would warrant the grant of a new trial.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.we note again that the district court could think of a combination of circumstances which could cause a bigger verdict and a more certain verdict than the verdict for the weinstocks in this case.tr.at.see larabee m m l int l,cir a lthough our review would have been aided by the specific findings required by rule c,we conclude that a remand for such findings is not necessary for purposes of our decision.
nor was healthcare prejudiced in this litigation by the district court references to clear liability.the court specifically disavowed a clear liability theory of the case during the charge conference and in its jury charges the new york pattern jury instructions make no mention whatsoever of clear liability every court which has addressed the bad faith analysis since pavia has cited the probability of success on the issue of liability as one aspect of the multifactor balancing test.tr.at.new york embodied in pavia,smith,pinto,and the as to the appropriate multifactor test for bad faith.in determining whether the defendant healthcare acted in bad faith in deciding not to settle the weinstocks claim,you will consider all of the facts and circumstances existing at the time the decisions were made.tr.at.that,we find,is precisely what the jury did.
conclusion 
entry of judgment in favor of healthcare is reversed,and the district court is instructed to enter judgment in favor of new england in accordance with the jury verdict 
david breath sounds were very coarse with audible grunting in the nursery.by early evening,david was having seizures.he was then transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit of north shore university hospital.
in a letter to healthcare,dated november,lapping stated that david weinstock wasa child of normal or perhaps above normal intelligence trapped in a totally body.he can make yes or no answers understood and makes multiple choices with his eyes.he is now years old,and will never be independent.the case is,therefore,worth a fortune.at present levels,i can conceive of being affirmed in such a case.emphasis added.
on july,new england warned healthcare that plaintiff has established approximately million dollars in past and future damages to the infant plaintiff for rehabilitative care.on july,new england stated that if this case is lost the verdict against the h ospital will be in the multiple millions of dollars,far beyond the primary and excess coverage.new england august,bad faith letter advised that in the event a verdict is returned against huntington hospital in an amount in excess of the million primary limits,new england intends to pursue a bad faith action to recover any amount new england may be required to pay.and,on august,new england warned that t he trial of this action continues to go badly for the defense both new england and the insured have determined that this case should be settled because it will result in a verdict far beyond the insurance coverage.
after the close of plaintiffs case,lapping believed that the hospital was up to its neck,although he did not believe the case was hopeless.steven pegalis pegalis,counsel for the weinstocks,would later testify that,in the hiatus between the close of plaintiffs case and the beginning of the defense case,he was pessimistic about the case that he would have seriously considered a settlement offer of million and that he would have suggested that his clients strongly consider accepting such an offer.
pegalis later testified that,until the verdict was returned,he considered this to be a case that could go either way.he stated that,if presented with a settlement offer of million on august,after both sides had rested,he absolutely would have considered the offer,would have presented it to his clients,and would have suggested that they strongly consider the offer.he also stated that he was not sure whether he would have recommended that the weinstocks accept such an offer had it been made.
because an insurance company has exclusive control over a claim against its insured once it assumes defense of the suit,it has a duty under new york law to act in good faith when deciding whether to settle such a claim,and it may be held liable for breach of that duty.pinto allstate ins,cir.this duty also applies to those situations where an excess insurer is exposed to liability.fed.ins.liberty mut.ins,d,citation omitted,aff,wl cir.
donald head head,the hospital executive,chief operating officer and risk manager,testified at the bad faith trial,that among other things,the hospital was not informed of the weinstocks settlement demand until after the weinstocks raised the demand to million.head also testified that the hospital consented to settle approximately of the times that healthcare recommended settlement.
in other words,a bad faith plaintiff such as new england in this case,must establish that the defendant insurer,healthcare,engaged in conduct evincing a conscious or knowing indifference to the probability that the excess carrier would be held accountable for all or part of its excess policy,if a settlement offer within the primary policy limit was not accepted.tr.at.
the verdict sheet directed the jury to answer the following questions as to the first time period,between february and july.did the plaintiff new england prove that,at any time during this period,when the weinstocks agreed to settle their case against the huntington hospital for one million dollars or less,that the huntington hospital would have consented to the settlement.based upon your answer to the first question,all the instructions of the court,and the totality of the evidence,did the plaintiff new england prove that the defendant healthcare acted in bad faith with regard to the potential settlement of the weinstock case against the huntington hospital as to the second time period,between july,and september.did the plaintiff new england prove that during the second time period,the weinstocks would have agreed to settle their case against the huntington hospital for million dollars or less.based upon your answer to question,all of the instructions of the c ourt and the totality of the evidence,did the plaintiff new england prove that the defendant healthcare acted in bad faith with regard to the potential settlement of the weinstock case against the huntington hospital tr.at.
the court also noted that the new york state supreme court,appellate division,second department had affirmed an million verdict in a similar case.
b provides the movant may renew its request for judgment as a matter of law by filing a motion no later than days after entry of may alternatively request a new trial under rule.
the district court also determined that the hospital had an arguably viable defense on the liability issue throughout the weinstock,i that david weinstock injuries were suffered prior to his birth while in utero or during delivery,when horn,the obstetrician,was on the scene and fully in charge,and ii that the hospital had no vicarious responsibility for the actions of horn,the attending physician.id.at.at the same time,the court assumed for the purpose of its opinion that a reasonable jury could find,as a fact,that prior to and during the weinstock trial to the conclusion of the plaintiffs case,healthcare could have settled the claim against the hospital for million or less,with the consent of the hospital.id.
the district court disregarded the jury specific finding that the weinstocks would have accepted million between july,and septemb
