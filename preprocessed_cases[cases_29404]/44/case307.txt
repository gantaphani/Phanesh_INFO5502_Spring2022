the clery act,f the act,requires colleges and universities that participate in federal financial aid programs to notify their constituent communities of certain reported crimes.this case requires us to construe,for the first time at the federal appellate level,the act notification requirements.after analyzing the language and purpose of the act,charting the dimensions of the plaintiff claims,and sifting through the factual record,we affirm the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendant university.
background 
the plaintiff,christopher havlik,is a citizen and resident of new york.in,he enrolled as an undergraduate at johnson wales university the university in providence,rhode island.the events that led to this litigation occurred early in his junior year.
in the late night or wee morning hours of september,the plaintiff engaged in a heated exchange with another student,donald ratcliffe,on a sidewalk near the intersection of richmond and pine streets in providence.in the course of this encounter,the plaintiff punched ratcliffe,knocking him to the ground.as a result,ratcliffe hit his head on the sidewalk.
the providence police responded and investigated the incident.acquaintances of each protagonist had witnessed the fracas and gave somewhat differing accounts of what had transpired.one witness told the police that the plaintiff was holding a knife at the time of the confrontation.
the police arranged for ratcliffe to be taken by ambulance to a local hospital,where he was found to have sustained a concussion and a fractured skull.then,after concluding their probe,the police lodged a criminal charge against the plaintiff.
the incident was duly reported to the university campus safety and security office.that office commenced its own inquiry.this inquiry culminated in an incident report,which indicated that the episode probably had been triggered by animosities that the plaintiff was the likely aggressor and that he reputedly flashed a knife at the time.at least one witness stated that he and a friend also a witness feared that the plaintiff or his fraternity brothers would retaliate against them for cooperating in the investigation.
on september,the university student conduct office notified the plaintiff of his temporary suspension for violating rules contained in the student code of conduct the code.the notice cited three violations assaulting another student,possessing a knife,and engaging in criminal behavior.the notice advised the plaintiff that he had a right to a hearing and scheduled one for the following day.
the hearing went forward the next morning before the student conduct board the board.the plaintiff explained his actions and presented witnesses who testified on his behalf.other evidence also was adduced.after mulling all the proof,the board found the plaintiff responsible for assaulting another student and for engaging in lawless behavior the first and third charges.it found him not responsible for possessing a knife the second charge.the board then recommended that the plaintiff be dismissed from the university for having transgressed the code and notified him of his right to appeal its decision.
during the course of these proceedings,other related events were occurring on a parallel track.on the same day that the plaintiff received notice of his suspension,the university chief counsel,barbara bennett,reviewed and revised a draft of a crime alert that she had received that day from the campus safety and security office.the crime alert was,in effect,a notice designed to inform the university community of a reported crime.
while both versions of the crime alert included statements that a blow had been struck and a knife had been brandished,bennett version contained two facts not included in the original draft.first,it noted that members of a particular fraternity zbt,whose enrollment included the plaintiff,were involved in the incident.second,it named the plaintiff as the party reportedly responsible for the crime.
when her work was finished,bennett sent the final version of the crime alert back to the campus safety and security office.personnel from that office posted it in various locations some time after pm on september.the record indicates that,at the relevant times,neither bennett nor the campus safety and security office had any knowledge of the outcome of the disciplinary hearing before the board.
the plaintiff decided to appeal the board decision,as was his right.prior to going forward with his appeal,he and his mother conferred with ronald martel,the university for student affairs.at the meeting,martel accused the plaintiff of dissembling about the incident and called his fraternity brothers thugs.the plaintiff nonetheless persisted in his appeal and martel to whom the letter of appeal was sent turned the matter over to the designated appeal officer,veera sarawgi also a of the university.
although sarawgi was not deposed,she would in the normal course of events have received,along with the letter of appeal,the hearing notification,a statement of applicable hearing procedures,the board decision,and the university incident report sarawgi also asked martel whether he knew of any reason that the board proposed sanction should be tempered or overturned.martel replied in the negative.nothing in the record indicates that he shared his views about either zbt or the plaintiff veracity with sarawgi.on september,sarawgi affirmed the plaintiff dismissal.
during and after this time frame,a criminal prosecution was being mounted.the providence police had charged the plaintiff with criminal assault.see laws.the case originally was heard in the state district court and the plaintiff was found guilty after a bench trial.he appealed to the superior court and claimed his right to a de novo jury trial.see id.in may of,a jury acquitted him.
disgruntled by the disruption of his scholarly pursuits,the plaintiff filed a civil action against the university in rhode island federal district court.he premised jurisdiction on diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount.see a.his complaint alleged defamatory publication of false information by means of the crime alert and breach of contract for the university failure to provide a fair appeal process.the university denied the material allegations of the complaint and,after the close of discovery,moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion.havlik johnson wales,d.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
we review a district court entry of summary judgment de novo.iverson city of boston,cir.in conducting that tamisage,we must sift the evidence and evaluate it in the light most congenial to the nonmovant here,the plaintiff.id.by the same token,we draw all reasonable inferences from the facts in the nonmovant favor.id.we caution,however,that this decisional calculus need not take into account bald assertions,unsupported conclusions,or optimistic surmises.bennett,cir.when all is said and done,we will affirm the summary judgment order only if the record,scrutinized in the foregoing manner,reveals no genuine issue of material fact and verifies that the movant here,the university is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see.c.
a.the clery act.
to put the relevance of the clery act into perspective,we deem it useful to begin by delineating the anatomy of the plaintiff defamation claim.defamation is a common law cause of action that arises under state law here,the law of rhode place of publication.
in rhode island,defamation requires proof that i the defendant made a false and defamatory statement regarding another,ii published it to a third party without an attendant privilege and iii was at least negligent in making the publication,with the result that iv the defamed party incurred harm.kevorkian glass.consistent with this formulation,the defendant may avoid liability by showing that the publication enjoys a qualified privilege.see mills.
in this instance,the district court assumed for argument sake that the crime alert was defamatory.havlik,d at.it determined,however,that the university enjoyed a qualified privilege,stemming from its duty under the act,to publish the crime alert.id.at.the court further determined that,in issuing the crime alert,the university acted without ill will or malice,so that the qualified privilege protected it from liability.id.at.
the plaintiff advances three primary claims of error with respect to this determination.in addressing them sequentially,we assume arguendo,as did the district court,that the crime alert contained defamatory statements.
the qualified privilege.under rhode island law,a qualified privilege attaches if the publisher acting in good faith correctly or reasonably believes that he has a legal,moral or social duty to speak out,or that to speak out is necessary to protect either his own interests,or those of third persons,or certain interests of the public.ponticelli mine safety appl.thus,the privilege may apply when the speaker perception of his duty to speak,though incorrect,is nonetheless reasonable.see id.
with this legal landscape in mind,the plaintiff argues that the university had no duty under the act to report his involvement in the putative crime to the campus community and that,therefore,it had no qualified privilege to publish the crime alert.the university demurs,insisting that it had a legal duty to report the putative crime and set out the known particulars.on that basis,it defends the district court holding that a qualified privilege obtained.
to determine whether the university enjoyed a qualified privilege,we must first determine whether its professed belief in its legal duty was reasonable.this brings us to the clery act so a brief exposition of the act provisions and legislative purpose is in order.
the clery act mandates that all colleges and universities that accept federal funding must notify the constituent campus,faculty,employees,and the certain crimes are brought to their attention.specifically,the act requires every covered entity to make timely reports to the campus community on certain crimes considered to be a threat to other students and employees that are reported to campus security or local law police agencies.f.
the act has both qualitative and situational limitations.as to the former,the act does not reach all types of crimes but only encompasses murder,manslaughter,aggravated assault,sex offenses,robbery,burglary,motor vehicle theft,arson,liquor,drug,and weapons offenses,and hate crimes.id.f f i ii.an aggravated assault is a covered crime,and in this venue the plaintiff does not contest that his confrontation with ratcliffe qualifies under that rubric.see appellant br.at.
paragraph f of the act contains the relevant situational limitations.it describes the loci of crimes that must be reported.see f f.that paragraph speaks of crimes that occur on campus,in or on noncampus buildings or property,and on public property id.the act then proceeds to define each of these terms.n oncampus building s or property are those owned or controlled by the institution that are outside the reasonably contiguous geographic area of the institution,id.f a ii public property is property within the area reasonably contiguous to the institution and adjacent to a facility owned or controlled by the institution,id.f a iii.
the goal of the notification requirement is to protect members of the constituent campus communities by aid ing in the prevention of similar occurrences.id.f.the act history illuminates the centrality of this goal.congress passed the original version of the act in amid concerns that the proliferation of campus crime created a growing threat to students,faculty,and school employees.see,at,reprinted in.congress recognized that contemporary campus communities had become increasingly dangerous places.id.furthermore,it noted that,in roughly eighty percent of crimes on campus,both the perpetrator and the victim were students.see crime awareness and campus security act of,stat,codified as amended at f.
notwithstanding these concerns,the first iteration of the act restricted the reporting requirement to crimes committed on campus.see f f f see also,at,reprinted in at disclaiming any intention that institutions report offenses which occur outside of the campus.over time,however,congress became dissatisfied with this restriction.in,the house of representatives expressed its displeasure with current enforcement efforts and passed a resolution calling for the department of education to make s afety of students the number one priority,reprinted in wl,at citing res,cong.
two years later,congress amended the act to provide broader protections.through the higher education amendments of,congress expanded the act coverage to reach not only crimes committed on campus but also crimes committed on noncampus and public property,so long as i the property on which a crime occurs is owned or controlled by,or adjacent to a facility owned or controlled by,the institution,and ii that property or facility is used by the institution in direct support of,or in a way related to,its educational mission.higher education amendments of,stat,codified as amended at f a.
from the start,congress made manifest a desire that educational institutions retain the ability to tailor security procedures to particularized needs.see,at,reprinted in at stating that the legislation was designed to encourage campuses to develop campus security policies and procedures which are appropriate to the unique conditions of each particular campus.the amendments did not retreat from this aspiration.see,f declining to authorize the secretary of education to require particular policies,procedures,or practices by institutions of higher education with respect to campus crimes or campus security.as we read the act,it vests substantial discretion in each campus security office to phrase and disseminate reports in those ways that the particular institution deems best suited to apprise its constituent campus communities of incipient criminal activity.
in this case,the district court determined that the locus of the incident fell under the act definition of public property.havlik,d at see f a iii defining public property as all property that is within the same reasonably contiguous geographic area of the institution,such as a sidewalk and is adjacent to a facility owned or controlled by the institution so long as the facility is used by the institution in direct support of,or in a manner related to the institution educational purposes.on appeal,the plaintiff remonstrates that the university was not careful enough in gauging the location of the incident.building on this foundation,he engages in an exegetic discourse about the meaning of terms such as campus,noncampus,and public property,culminating in an assertion that the locus of the incident falls outside the compass of those definitions and,thus,outside the compass of the act.
we do not doubt the importance of the meaning that congress assigned to each of these terms.nevertheless,we reject the notion that the coverage of the act turns exclusively on the use of a surveyor theodolite.reasonableness is the beacon by which institutions must steer,and reasonableness is not totally constrained by mathematically precise metes and bounds.so,too,common sense must inform a court assessment of the reasonableness of a university belief that the reporting of a crime is compulsory under the act.and in making that assessment,the need to assure safety and security for campus communities counsels that doubts should be resolved in favor of notification.
in the case at hand,official who authored the final version of this crime without contradiction that when advising school hierarchs whether a duty to publish a timely notification exists,she first determines whether the crime is of a type covered by the act she then determines whether it has been reported to campus security or local law enforcement and she then determines whether the underlying conduct signals a threat to the university community a determination that takes into account where the incident happened.she believed that all of these factors supported notification in this instance.
nothing in the record undermines the reasonableness of bennett professed
