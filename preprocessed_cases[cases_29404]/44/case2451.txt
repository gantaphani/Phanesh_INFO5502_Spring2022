in this case,federal express corporation fedex,appeals a jury verdict in favor of,richard tisdale tisdale as well as the award of in punitive damages.the jury found that fedex violated title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,by terminating tisdale in retaliation for his complaints about racially discriminatory management practices.on appeal,fedex argues that the district court erred in deciding several issues including the denial of its motion to dismiss strike evidence of backpay for discovery abuse the denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law on the grounds that the administrative remedy was unexhausted the denial of its motion for a new trial where the clear weight of the evidence did not support the jury verdict the award of punitive damages and finally,certain evidentiary rulings.upon review of all of fedex arguments,we conclude that the district court did not err on any of these issues,and thus we affirm the jury verdict in favor of tisdale and the grant of punitive damages.
background 
from until,tisdale was employed as a handler and ramp transport driver rtd at fedex nashville distribution station hereafter bnart.during his employment,tisdale raised several concerns to management regarding the disparate treatment of its employees at bnart.specifically,in,tisdale,who is,complained to management that he was not paid for attending a fedex driver training program,while white employees were.he also complained to management that employees were being passed over for promotion and advancement to either dispatcher or office positions.of the approximately thirty employees at bnart,none served as managers or supervisors at this time.in response to the complaints,fedex sent an investigator from atlanta to meet with the employees at bnart to discuss the practices there,but no substantial changes were made.at the end of,the employees at bnart boycotted the office christmas party in protest of what they perceived were management discriminatory practices.tim stuthard stuthard,the operations manager of bnart,asked tisdale why the employees did not attend the party,to which tisdale responded a lot of people feel like if they are not going to be able to get some of those office jobs they do want to sit down and have dinner with you.joint appendix at trial tr.vol.i at.
on february,frances miller miller,the managing director of air,ground,freight services for the southcoast district,visited the bnart station and met with all the employees.stuthard,the operations manager and direct supervisor of tisdale,attended the meeting.miller asked the assembled employees if there were any issues that they would like to discuss.at that point,tisdale stood up at the public gathering and stated he had concerns regarding how were treated at bnart.in response to his statements,miller suggested that they talk privately following the meeting.
after the public meeting,tisdale and another driver,lovie hurt hurt,met with miller and discussed their specific concerns.miller advised tisdale and hurt to put their concerns in writing and promised that fedex would investigate.on february,a letter,by tisdale,and signed by eighteen other employees,was sent to miller documenting their allegations of discriminatory treatment at bnart.two days earlier,however,tisdale had been suspended for suspected theft of fedex property,and he was ultimately terminated.
fedex reasons for terminating tisdale related to his involvement in the program at bnart.while fedex uses its own customized containers to transport materials,the company receives large shipments from customers on pallets when fedex employees transfer the packages to a fedex container,the pallets become waste.neither fedex as a company,nor bnart specifically,had a policy regarding the disposal of the pallets,other than the general policy to dispose of waste in an manner.instead,as one bnart employee testified,the pallets were stacked up on the dock and thrown into the dumpster.at trial tr.vol.i at.in the past,one employee had even gathered the pallets,sold them to a recycler,and kept the proceeds.
in,tisdale decided to sell the pallets to a recycler and use the proceeds for an employee fund to pay for the company christmas party,picnics,and other employee events.a bank account hereafter the fedex pallet account was set up in which tisdale,and three other employees had privileges.the only restriction fedex managers put on the four employees is that they could not profit from the program,but otherwise tisdale was told to do the pallet operation as he saw fit.at trial tr.vol.i at.tisdale would deliver the pallets and receive a check written out to him,which he would then deposit into the fedex pallet account.recognizing a profitable opportunity for himself,tisdale collected discarded pallets from various other stores in the area during his and sold them to recyclers.several other fedex employees helped him in this endeavor during hours as well.the pallet recyclers would write a single check to tisdale,who would then deposit the amount for the fedex pallets in the fedex pallet account,and share the remaining amount with all the drivers who helped him in the enterprise.management at bnart knew that tisdale and other fedex drivers were working for the companies after work.
the fedex pallet program was such a success that tisdale received an employee award from brett gardner gardner,bnart senior manager,in recognition of his efforts to plan,organize,communicate and fund the second annual bnart christmas party.at memorandum from gardner to tisdale.in july,gardner assumed control of the fedex pallet account from the employees,and thereafter received all the checks and invoices for the fedex pallets and disbursed all the funds for the employee events.thus,mckinney lumber mckinney,the chief purchaser of the used pallets,wrote checks for the fedex pallets to gardner and wrote checks to tisdale only for the pallets collected by him and his fellow drivers.
in january,stuthard,an operations manager,became tisdale immediate supervisor and began an investigation into the program.on february,following his private meeting with tisdale and hurt about racial tensions at the facility,miller,the regional managing director,met with the managers of bnart,including stuthard.at the meeting,stuthard informed miller of his belief that tisdale was stealing from fedex by selling used pallets from bnart and keeping the proceeds for himself.miller told him to investigate further.on february,stuthard visited mckinney and reviewed the checks paid to tisdale for the pallets.two days later,stuthard sent an email to jeff werner,who worked in fedex personnel department,recounting his findings 
i paid another visit to the location that tisdale is selling pallets too sic.i about to blow you away.for the month of january,tisdale has been paid and federal express got.all the money tisdale has made was off federal express owned property.what do you think about his nice little operation now that only per week or tax free dollars per year.keep in mind,tisdale has no cost associated with this income.he has been using company owned vehicles and fuel.he has been paid delivering the pallets.i refuse to believe that federal express ca prosecute this man for stealing.as i said before,he is bigger than life itself at this location.i want to bring his little empire down this is a sad commentary and complete failure on sic management to allow this activity.what can we do 
at from stuthard to jeff werner,stuthard sent the email without first discussing the situation with gardner,his supervisor and the person overseeing the fedex pallet account.the following day,miller spoke with gardner,who told miller that he believed the fedex pallet account was accurate given the number of pallets received at the bnart facility.nonetheless,that same day,miller contacted anita gay bynum bynum,the zone manager with fedex security division,and asked her to investigate the fedex pallet account.on february,after speaking to stuthard and sam wrather wrather,the general manager for mckinney,bynum interrogated tisdale following his shift,from to throughout the interview,tisdale stated repeatedly that he believed that he had not confused fedex pallets with the pallets he collected during his own time.despite his denials,bynum continued to press the issue 
bynum is there a possibility that you brought in a load of pallets and they were confused on these are pallets or these are your pallets and maybe they wrote you a check.
tisdale not to my knowledge,not to my recollection.
bynum maybe you were tired and 
tisdale sometimes,sometimes they uh,they do know if i working for them or if i done brought it over for or.i see what you saying,but not to my knowledge i had 
bynum right,but,i saying maybe by possible,some type of accident or confusion and something you were maybe work out later that,or maybe you,after.ya know,because you have to admit you a busy man.sometimes,i sure you wake up in the morning and you do even know what day it is.you just trying to figure out what job am i supposed to go to and what i have to do today,try to sort all of this through your mind.you grab some pallets,you know that they have to be taken down there.they write you a check,you pocket it they written the check to me and this really should have been written to.but you feel like well,if i say something now they may think that i doing something wrong.so ya know,what do i do well,i just do say anything 
tisdale not to my knowledge.i do remember ever having going,confused,mixed up or anything.not to say that it has happened.
bynum i think you taking so many pallets over there,that you getting them confused on what pallets and what your pallets.
tisdale uh huh.
bynum ya see what i saying 
tisdale yeah.
bynum i know but,now do you think maybe somehow that there a possibility that they could have got something confused as far as what you turning into them is this your personal pallets or your pallets 
tisdale ummm,it might be a possibility.but what i saying is that i not sure that it,that it ever happened,i guess is what i trying to say 
bynum cause i do think,richard,i do think that you doing anything intentionally wrong here.now have there been mistakes made,yeah,ya know i think as far as you trying to juggle all this different stuff around that you do know who pallets you got,ya know at certain times.ya know,you take these pallets over there,they unload them,go,the next day you picking up checks.you dropping off more pallets,well no,now these are my pallets,well wait yesterday,what was them pallets,well ya know yesterday i think those were my pallets.ya know what i mean 
tisdale yes.
bynum and i think that probably what happening here i just,ya know,i just feel like,that with everything that you told us,that,ya know you trying to be helpful,you trying to be as honest as you possibly can and trying to recall as much as you can to,ya know,that if there has been mistakes made,we gon na clear them up now.ya know,i think that you need to get a hold of,ya know you gon na have to slow down,you not a young man.
tisdale uh huh.
at bynum interview tr.finally,after several hours,when asked to estimate how many fedex loads could have been mistakenly registered as his own,tisdale stated m aybe about three loads but clarified that he was just taking a wild guess at what,ya know,at what could have transpired.at bynum interview tr.following the interview,bynum wrote out a statement,which tisdale signed,stating that mckinney had paid him for fedex pallets maybe or times.at employee statement at.she also wrote an investigative memo to management which stated that tisdale admitted to stealing three or four loads and omitted any indication that it might have been a mistake bynum admitted at trial that during the interview she just needed tisdale to admit that he had taken the pallets and he had stole n them and failed to turn in the money.at trial tr.vol.iii at.she also testified that she did not discuss with gardner the specifics of the fedex pallet account,but just asked him for general background information.
on february,stuthard terminated tisdale employment on the grounds of theft of company property.no investigation was ever undertaken with respect to the other fedex drivers who had collected pallets for mckinney.tisdale filed a grievance through fedex guaranteed fair treatment procedure,claiming that he was terminated because of race.ultimately,fedex management upheld the termination.tisdale then filed a charge with the eeoc,which issued him a notification.on december,tisdale filed suit against fedex in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee alleging a violation of his rights under title vii.following a contentious discovery period and a trial,the jury found fedex guilty of retaliation in violation of title vii,and awarded tisdale in punitive damages.the district court also awarded tisdale backpay in the amount of,which was stipulated to by the parties.fedex appeals from the verdict and the award of punitive damages on several grounds.
ii.analysis 
discovery sanctions 
the first issue which fedex raises in its appeal is that the district court erred in denying its motion to dismiss strike evidence of backpay because of tisdale abuse of the discovery process.upon review,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying fedex motion on the grounds that tisdale failed to supplement his interrogatory responses.
pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e,a party is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response to an interrogatory,request for production,or request for admission if the party learns that the response is in some material respect incomplete or incorrect.e.failure to do so results in the party being unable to use the undisclosed information at trial as well as other appropriate sanctions that the district court may impose.c.we review a district court decision regarding rule sanctions for abuse of discretion.toth grand trunk,cir.we have stated that a n abuse of discretion occurs when the district court decision is based on an erroneous conclusion of law,the district court findings are clearly erroneous,or the district court decision is clearly unreasonable,arbitrary or fanciful.id.internal quotation omitted.moreover,factors which should be considered in determining whether the district court abused its discretion include prejudice resulting from the discovery abuse,whether the noncooperating party was warned that violations would result in sanctions,and whether the court considered less drastic sanctions.id.
in this case,fedex argues that tisdale provided false responses and omitted information from his responses to its discovery requests regarding his employment.reviewing fedex motion prior to trial,the district court agreed with fedex in part and therefore dismissed tisdale claim for front pay.in its appeal to this court,fedex contends that the district court should have dismissed the entire retaliation claim or the backpay claim in light of tisdale discovery abuse.specifically,fedex argues that tisdale failed to provide information about his employment at a numbers house,work he did for a moving company,and his side business of repairing shoes.fedex also claims that tisdale omitted the names of several employers to whom he applied for jobs.upon review of the record,we conclude that fedex argument is without merit.
first,the record reveals that tisdale took significant steps to try to comply with fedex extensive discovery requests.see at.notice of correspondence from tisdale to fedex regarding discovery responses.in a letter dated july,tisdale provided a list of all his current and potential employers,including those that fedex cites in its brief as omitted.at letter from david lyons to mary jane palmer july.tisdale also provided his tax information from and as well as signed releases enabling fedex to discover any records relating to his employment held by his employers.tisdale inability to comply fully with fedex request is largely a result of the fact that his economic livelihood consisted of sporadic employment with several different employers supplemented by many informal,discrete jobs,such as fixing shoes or helping to load a moving truck.the absence of information provided to fedex is a result of the of such information.thus,we conclude that the record does not reveal that tisdale intentionally withheld any information from fedex.
moreover,there is no evidence in the record that the absence of the requested information in any way prejudiced fedex in this case.recognizing the ambiguous and uncertain nature of tisdale employment,the district court dismissed tisdale claim.the district court sanction was an appropriate remedy for the absence of information fedex sought.the district court concluded,however,that fedex had sufficient knowledge of tisdale employment activities such that it could thoroughly him on the issue of backpay.indeed,fedex challenged tisdale at trial about several of his jobs including those about which it claims full information was withheld.see at trial tr.vol.i at.
in sum,we conclude the district court sanction of striking the claim was an appropriate response to tisdale failure to respond fully to fedex discovery requests.accordingly,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying fedex motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety strike evidence of backpay as a discovery sanction.
renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law 
the second issue which fedex raises on appeal is that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because tisdale eeoc complaint failed to include a retaliation claim upon review,we conclude that the district court did not err in denying fedex renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.
we review a district court denial of a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.barnes city of cincinnati,cir.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party,there is no genuine issue of material fact for the jury,and reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion in favor of the moving party.noble brinker int l,cir internal quotation omitted.in this case,fedex argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law because tisdale failed to check the box on the eeoc form marked retaliation.as a result,fedex argues that tisdale failed to exhaust his administrative remedies,and therefore his retaliation claim should have been dismissed.though it is undisputed that the retaliation box was unchecked,we conclude that fedex argument is without merit.
we have stated that if a plaintiff did not first present a claim to the equal employment opportunit y commission,that claim may not be brought before the federal courts on appeal.haithcock frank,cir.in the case of a retaliation claim not included in an eeoc charge,we have held that retaliation claims based on conduct that occurred before the filing of the eeoc charge must be included in that charge.strouss.dep t of,cir accord abeita transam.mailings,cir ang procter gamble,cir.we have cautioned,however,that an eeoc charge filed by lay complainants should be liberally construed,haithcock,at,because they are unschooled in the technicalities of the law and proceed without counsel.ang,at.actions in federal court should not be restricted by the failure of a complainant to attach the correct legal conclusion to the eeoc claim,conform to procedural technicalities,or include the exact wording which might be required in a judicial pleading.davis sodexho,cumberland coll.cafeteria,cir internal quotation omitted.thus,where the claimant is unrepresented,a broader reading of the charge is compelled.duggins steak n shake,cir.in such cases,we have stated that t he judicial complaint must be limited to the scope of the eeoc investigation reasonably expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.ang,at internal quotation omitted.therefore,where facts related with respect to the charged claim would prompt the eeoc to investigate a different,uncharged claim,the plaintiff is not precluded from bringing suit on that claim.davis,at.
in applying this principle,we have found jurisdiction over a title vii retaliation claim even though the complainant failed to check the retaliation box on the eeoc form.in duggins,the plaintiff related facts to the eeoc which would have prompted an investigation into retaliation.at.we stated that w here the plaintiff alleged facts to the eeoc which clearly included retaliation allegations and where that plaintiff was not represented by legal counsel in writing her eeoc charge,such a plaintiff should not be precluded from bringing a retaliation claim in the complaint.id.at.we also noted that retaliation naturally grows out of any underlying substantive discrimination charge,making a retaliation claim foreseeable to the defendants.id.
applying these principles to tisdale case,we conclude that the district court did not err in denying fedex renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.while it is true that tisdale failed to check the retaliation box on his eeoc charge,at the time he completed the eeoc charge,he was not represented by an attorney and did not know what the word retaliation meant.at trial tr.vol.i at,trial tr.vol.i at.moreover,tisdale testified that he did not prepare the charge himself,but instead recounted his story to a clerk in the eeoc office,who prepared it for him.the charge also contains several factual errors,which tisdale explained that he did not catch because of his dyslexia.at trial tr.vol.i at.in light of these circumstances,we decline to penalize tisdale for failing to reach the correct legal conclusion on the eeoc charge.
while it is unclear from the record what precisely tisdale related to the eeoc,both his discrimination claim and his retaliation claim contain the same common core of operative,that he was terminated after complaining about the treatment of employees in a public meeting.tisdale has not alleged any other separate acts of racial discrimination which led to his termination.thus,because we must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of tisdale,we can infer that he told the eeoc that he had complained to management about the treatment of employees at bnart.the charge states that tisdale was terminated from fedex for selling pallets,but that he believed that he was discriminated against because of his race.by stating that he was discharged and that he believed race played a role coupled with the inference that he told the eeoc that he had complained about the treatment of employees at bnart,a seasoned eeoc investigator would be naturally prompted to investigate the uncharged retaliation claim despite the procedural shortcomings in the formal charge.thus,we hold that the retaliation claim could reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination,and therefore,the district court did not err in denying fedex judgment as a matter of law.
motion for a new trial 
the next issue which fedex raises on appeal is that it should be entitled to a new trial because the jury verdict was against the clear weight of the evidence.upon review,we conclude the district court did not err in denying fedex motion for a new trial.
we review the denial of a motion for a new trial under an abuse of discretion standard.united states,ex rel.a homecare,medshares mgmt.group,cir internal quotation omitted.where the motion for a new trial is on the grounds that the jury verdict was against the clear weight of the evidence,we have explained that 
a court may set aside a verdict and grant a new trial when it is of the opinion that the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence however,new trials are not to be granted on the grounds that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence unless that verdict was unreasonable.thus,if a reasonable juror could reach the challenged verdict,a new trial is improper.
barnes fiberglas,cir internal quotations omitted.
in this case,fedex argues that its motion for a new trial should have been granted because the clear weight of the evidence does not support a finding of retaliation.specifically,fedex argues that tisdale could not satisfy the second and fourth prongs of the prima facie case for retaliation knowledge by the and a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.we have explained,however,that w hen reviewing the facts of a discrimination claim after there has been a full trial on the merits,we must focus on the ultimate question of discrimination rather than on whether a plaintiff made out a prima facie case.barnes city of cincinnati,at.that is,the sole remaining issue is discrimination vel non.noble,at internal quotations omitted.thus,we can not simply hold that the plaintiff failure to provide evidence of an essential element of her prima facie case is dispositive here.rather,we must look to the ultimate the plaintiff has proven that her discharge was intentionally discriminatory.gray toshiba am.consumer,cir.in making that determination,however,whether the plaintiff has in fact presented evidence supporting each element of her prima facie case is material to the determination of whether she has demonstrated that the employer articulated reason for the discharge is not credible.id.at.
the ultimate question in every employment discrimination case involving a claim of disparate treatment is whether the plaintiff was the victim of intentional discrimination.reeves sanderson plumbing,d.the plaintiff may succeed in this,in persuading the court that she has been the victim of intentional discrimination either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.mary honor ctr.hicks,d quoting.dep t of cmty.affairs burdine,d alteration in original.with respect to the indirect method of proof,which is what is involved in this case,the supreme court has said that i t is not enough to dis believe the employer the factfinder must believe the plaintiff explanation of intentional discrimination.noble,at quoting mary honor,at.we have stated that a plaintiff can establish that an employer reason is not credible by demonstrating either that the proffered reasons had no basis in fact,that the proffered reasons did not actually motivate his discharge,or that they were insufficient to motivate discharge.manzer diamond shamrock chems,cir internal quotation omitted.
applying these principles to this case,we conclude tisdale has demonstrated sufficient evidence by which a reasonable jury could find that fedex reason for his termination was not credible under any of the three manzer factors.first,a reasonable juror could find that fedex reason for firing tisdale,theft of company property,had no basis in fact.fedex does not cite any evidence in the record to prove that tisdale actually kept any money generated from the sale of fedex pallets.gardner,the senior manager at bnart and the person who oversaw the fedex pallet account,told miller he did not believe that there was a discrepancy.bynum,fedex chief investigator,never spoke to gardner about the details of the fedex pallet account or ever attempted to reconcile the account balance with the checks from mckinney to determine if any were missing.instead,bynum testified at trial that her goal was to get tisdale to admit that he stole fedex pallets.relying on manipulative interrogation techniques,bynum finally coerced tisdale into admitting that a mistake may have occurred.bynum reported to her supervisors however that tisdale admitted that he intentionally stole company property three or four times,which became the basis for his termination.
second,a reasonable juror could find that fedex proffered reason did not actually motivate tisdale discharge.tisdale had run the program since without any complaints from management and even received an employee recognition award for his efforts.following tisdale public statements about how were treated at bnart and his private meeting with miller,the regional managing director,a formal investigation into the pallet program was begun at miller behest three days later,and tisdale was suspended four days after that.prior to tisdale creation of the program,fedex characterized the pallets as waste and discarded them in a dumpster yet according to fedex,the pallets were company property sufficient to support termination of tisdale for theft.no other employee,including one who kept the proceeds from the sale of fedex pallets for himself,was ever investigated by fedex.
third,a reasonable juror could find that fedex proffered reason was insufficient to motivate tisdale discharge.despite the ambiguity of its policy regarding pallets and the absence of any clear evidence of wrongdoing,fedex chose to terminate tisdale rather than impose a lesser sanction such as a suspension or probation.no other employee connected with the program was ever investigated,not even the one who sold the pallets for his personal profit.
in addition to disbelieving fedex proffered reason for tisdale termination,a reasonable jury could also believe tisdale explanation of intentional discrimination.tisdale had a long history of speaking out about discriminatory practices at fedex.he repeatedly complained about the lack of career opportunities for employees and even organized a boycott of the office christmas party.the pallet investigation was started days after his public comments about discriminatory practices at bnart,and he was terminated shortly thereafter.it is also clear from the manner in which the investigation was conducted that fedex management was targeting tisdale.
in sum,we conclude that given all the evidence in this case,a reasonable juror could find that fedex purported reason for tisdale termination was not based in fact,did not actually motivate the discharge,and was insufficient to warrant termination anyway.moreover,we conclude that a reasonable juror could believe tisdale explanation of intentional discrimination.accordingly,we hold the district court did not err nor did it abuse its discretion in denying fedex motion for a new trial.
punitive damages 
fedex challenges the award of punitive damages on several grounds.after reviewing the merits of each of fedex arguments,we conclude that the district court did not err in refusing to set aside the award of punitive damages.
sufficiency of the evidence 
fedex first argues that the district court erred by failing to grant its rule b motion on the issue of punitive damages because the award was against the clear weight of the evidence.as we stated above,we review a district court denial of a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo.barnes,at.we have explained that 
in a federal question case,the standard of review for a rule motion based on sufficiency of the evidence is identical to that used by the district court.the evidence should not be weighed,and the credibility of the witnesses should not be questioned.the judgment of this court should not be substituted for that of the jury instead,the evidence should be viewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made,and that party given the benefit of all reasonable inferences.the motion should be granted,and the district court reversed,only if reasonable minds could not come to a conclusion other than one favoring the movant.
williams nashville network,cir.in its brief to this court,fedex argues that even if its actions against tisdale were retaliatory,no reasonable juror could find that those actions could be imputed to fedex.we find this argument to be unpersuasive.
punitive damages are available in a title vii claim where the plaintiff can demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer engaged in a discriminatory practice with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of an aggrieved individual.b.the supreme court has noted that the statutory language indicates congressional intent to narrow the class of cases for which punitive awards are available to a subset of those involving intentional discrimination.kolstad am.dental ass n,d.the court reasoned that an employer must at least discriminate in the face of a perceived risk that its actions will violate federal law to be liable in punitive damages.id.at.punitive damages liability does not arise where the employer may simply be unaware of the relevant federal prohibition,believes the discrimination is lawful,or reasonably believe s that the discrimination satisfies a bona fide occupational qualification defense.id.at.thus,an employer may be held vicariously liable for punitive damages for the intentionally discriminatory conduct of its employee,where the employee served the employer in a managerial capacity,committed the intentional discrimination at issue while acting in the scope of employment,and the employer did not engage in efforts to comply with title vii.lowery circuit city stores,cir interpreting the kolstad opinion,cert.denied,d.
first,fedex argues that all of its employees involved in tisdale termination are middle management and therefore,liability can not be imputed to fedex.the mere fact that fedex is a large,global corporation with a management structure is insufficient by itself to shield it from liability under title vii.in kolstad,the supreme court stated that whether an employee serves in a managerial capacity is determined by the type of authority that the employer has given to the employee,the amount of discretion that the employee has in what is done and how it is accomplished.at.internal quotation omitted.the employee must be important,but not necessarily top management,officers,or directors,to be acting in a managerial capacity.id.internal quotation omitted.we,along with several other courts of appeals,have held that management employees can serve in a managerial capacity.see jeffries stores,cir holding that store managers,a district manager,and a regional manager served in a managerial capacity so as to impute punitive damages liability onto the corporation as a whole lowrey,at holding that a department manager who supervised nine other employees,had the authority to hire new persons,and had discretion to organize the department,could constitute an employee in a managerial capacity eeoc stores,cir applying kolstad to find that both an assistant store manager,who had the authority to suspend subordinates and make hiring and firing recommendations,and the store manager,whose responsibilities included the operation of the store and making hiring and firing decisions,held managerial positions for purposes of vicarious liability in the punitive damages context.in this case,the initial investigation was conducted by stuthard,the operations manager at bnart,who had the authority to suspend and terminate employees.moreover,miller,whose authority is to supervise all of fedex operations in the district,instigated the security investigation against tisdale.miller gave tacit approval to the actions taken by bynum and stuthard,and concurred in the decision to terminate tisdale.given their significant authority and discretion,a reasonable juror could find that stuthard and miller served fedex in a managerial capacity for purposes of vicarious liability in the punitive damages context.
fedex second argument is that even if the actors could be found to have served in a managerial capacity,the decisions can not be imputed to fedex because they are contrary to the company efforts to comply with the law.the supreme court,in kolstad,stated that an employer may not be vicariously liable for the discriminatory employment decisions of managerial agents where these decisions are contrary to the employer good faith efforts to comply with title vii.at.internal quotation omitted.we have suggested in dicta that the mere existence of a written policy alone does not shield the company from punitive damages.eeoc,cir.other courts of appeals have explicitly held that an policy by itself does not shield an employer from liability.as the fourth circuit has stated,w hile an employer institution of a written policy against race discrimination may go a long way toward dispelling any claim about the employer reckless or malicious state of mind with respect to racial minorities,such a policy is not automatically a bar to the imposition of punitive damages.lowery,at emphasis added.see also stores,at holding that a written policy alone is not enough.the fourth circuit has explained that an employer written policy does not shield it from liability where there is sufficient evidence which called into question the sincerity of the employer commitment to abide by it.lowery,at.similarly,the tenth circuit held that a company policy did not shield an employer from liability where there was evidence that the employees were never trained about the policy or were even aware of it.stores,at.
applying these principles to this case,we are not persuaded that a reasonable juror could only conclude that fedex engaged in efforts to comply with title vii.though fedex has placed much evidence in the record in support of its policies,tisdale also presented evidence of a number of inconsistent practices at the bnart station,which calls into question fedex sincerity to abide by its own written policies.tisdale testified at trial that he had been complaining about the disparate treatment of employees from through,and that fedex made little effort to change.despite fedex professed commitment to diversity,tisdale explained that there were no managers,supervisors,or office staff at the bnart station during the time he worked there.several employees testified that they believed that when office jobs became available,were passed over in favor of white employees.to protest what they believed were management discriminatory practices,the employees at bnart boycotted the christmas party.eighteen employees signed a letter to miller outlining the perceived racial discrimination at bnart.at trial,fedex operations managers conceded that there were racial tensions at bnart during those years.fedex own internal documents admit s everal incidents of poor management practices at the bnart station which foster ed the mistrust of management and led to the deterioration of morale.at memorandum from miller to lana luster.whether the allegations made by the employees concerning discriminatory treatment were proven true is not the focus of our inquiry,but instead we must decide whether reasonable minds could not come to any conclusion other than the one favoring fedex.in this case,we conclude that in light of all the evidence presented by tisdale,a reasonable jury could find that fedex did not engage in efforts to treat its minority employees fairly as required by the law.
moreover,despite fedex written policy against retaliation,a reasonable jury could find that fedex ignored its own policies and terminated tisdale because he voiced concerns about management discriminatory practices.though fedex has established the guaranteed fair treatment procedure gftp to ensure against retaliatory terminations,the evidence in the record reveals that the administrative review of tisdale termination amounted to little more than a approval of bynum dubious investigation.shannon brown brown,a fedex regional vice president,participated in the second step of the gftp process with regard to tisdale termination and testified at trial that he did not conduct an independent investigation of his own but rather relied on the reports from bynum and miller.specifically,brown testified that he relied on bynum report which stated that tisdale admitted to intentionally keeping money from the sale of fedex pallets three or four times.tisdale wrote a letter to brown specifically stating that at no time did i fail to turn in fedex monies,nor did i say i sold pallets and i was confused when selling the pallets.at letter from tisdale to brown july.despite this fact,brown never questioned the accuracy of bynum report nor did he even speak to tisdale or gardner prior to deciding to uphold the termination.thus,we conclude that in light of all the evidence presented,a reasonable juror could find that fedex did not engage in efforts to comply with the law.
due process 
finally,fedex challenges the punitive damages award as unconstitutional under the due process clause of the fifth amendment.we find this argument to be unpersuasive as well.
we apply a de novo standard of review when passing on district courts determinations of the constitutionality of punitive damages awards.cooper,leatherman tool group,d.fedex sole argument is that because tisdale failed to
