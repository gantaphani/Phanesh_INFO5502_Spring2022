in the years since the supreme court decision in new york times sullivan,d,courts and legislatures have endeavored to strike a balance between individuals interests in their reputation and the public interest in free and robust debate.the resulting interplay of defamation law and the first amendment has substantially lessened the chilling effect of abusive tort claims for conduct stemming from the exercise of first amendment rights.while these efforts have shielded individuals from the chill of liability,they have often failed to protect speakers from the cost and burden of defending such tort claims.concerned over the growth of meritless lawsuits that have the purpose or effect of chilling the exercise of first amendment rights,a number of state legislatures have created a novel method for better striking the balance between interests in individual reputation and freedom of speech.
this appeal addresses one such method,specifically,article of louisiana code of civil procedure.article provides a mechanism whereby a plaintiff bringing a defamation claim must show a probability of success on the merits before proceeding.consist of four charles american press,lake charles american press,shearman.and shearman well as the author of the majority of the newspaper articles in san miguel collectively american press.american press brought an article motion in response to mark henry henry defamation suit.henry,owner of an airport refueling operation,asserts that american press defamed him by reporting that henry provided military aircraft with contaminated fuel that caused their engines to fail,or flame out.
the district court denied american press motion,and american press brought an immediate appeal.as a threshold matter,we hold that we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal.moreover,as henry has failed to establish the necessary probability of success,we reverse the district court order and render judgment dismissing henry defamation claim.further,we remand the case to the district court for a determination of american press entitlement to fees and costs.
factual and procedural background 
henry was the owner and president of chennault jet center,cjc from to.cjc operated out of the chennault international airport in lake charles,louisiana,and had contracted with the defense logistics agency to refuel military aircraft.in february,the government notified cjc that it was initiating an investigation into whether cjc had sold contractually noncompliant fuel for use in military aircraft.in april,the government terminated the defense logistics agency contract with cjc.
from may to january,american press published a series of articles describing the investigation of cjc fueling practices.henry asserts that these articles contained several defamatory statements,but focuses primarily on reports that cjc provided contaminated fuel to military aircraft that may have caused them to flame out.
on may,henry sued american press for defamation in texas state court.american press removed the case to the southern district of texas on the basis of diversity and later successfully moved to transfer the case to the western district of louisiana.on august,the district court determined that louisiana substantive law governed the dispute and permitted american press to file a special motion to strike pursuant to article of the louisiana code of civil procedure article.as discussed further below,article provides a mechanism whereby plaintiffs bringing certain tort claims must show a probability of success on their claim before proceeding.the district court initially denied american press article motion,and american press requested reconsideration.the district court granted reconsideration and again denied american press motion in a more detailed opinion.american press then filed a notice of appeal from the district court order denying its article motion.

iii.discussion 
louisiana article 
a number of state legislatures have expressed concerns over the use or abuse of lawsuits that have the purpose or effect of chilling the exercise of first amendment rights.these suits are commonly referred to as strategic lawsuits against public participation,or slapps.in response to the growth of slapps,some states have provided a procedural called a special motion to strike but also known as an motion or slappback to weed out and dismiss meritless claims early in litigation.dismissal of these frivolous tort claims saves defendants the cost and burden of trial and minimizes the chilling effect of these lawsuits.at the same time,meritorious claims proceed,vindicating the interests of those who actually suffered from defamation or other torts.
article of the louisiana code of civil procedure provides one such method.in the act creating article,the louisiana legislature set out the reasons behind and purposes of the law 
the legislature finds and declares that there has been a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for redress of grievances.the legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process.to this end,it is the intention of the legislature that the article enacted pursuant to this act shall be construed broadly.
thomas city of monroe,so d.cir quoting.acts.thus,article was enacted by the legislature as a procedural device to be used early in legal proceedings to screen meritless claims pursued to chill one constitutional rights under the first amendment of the united states constitution to freedom of speech and press.lee pennington,so d.cir,writ denied,so d see also lamz,so d at the intent of article is to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance and to prevent this participation from being chilled through an abuse of judicial process.baxter scott,so d.cir.article is a procedural device to be used in the early stages of litigation to screen those claims which lack merit and which would chill public participation in matters of public interest,vacated as moot,so d stern doe,so d.cir the purpose of article is to review frivolous and meritless claims against the media at a very early stage in the legal proceedings.
the portion of article relevant to the present purposes provides as follows 
a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or louisiana constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established a probability of success on the claim.
civ.proc.a.once a defendant files an article motion,the trial court stays all discovery except that which the court,on noticed motion and for good cause,orders to be conducted.id.d.the prevailing party on a special motion is entitled to reasonable attorneys fees and costs,id.b,and a plaintiff that successfully establishes a probability of success on the merits may submit the trial court determination as evidence at trial,id.a.
article establishes a analysis for weeding out frivolous claims.to succeed on an article motion,the defendant must first make a prima facie showing that article covers the activity underlying the suit.that is,the defendant must establish that a cause of action against him arises from an act by him in furtherance of the exercise of his right of petition or free speech under the united states or louisiana constitution in connection with a public issue.starr boudreaux,so d.cir.if the defendant makes this showing,the burden then shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate a probability of success on his claim.id.at.
if the plaintiff fails to demonstrate a probability of success,the trial court dismisses the claim.otherwise,the trial court denies the motion and the suit proceeds as it normally would.in louisiana state courts,an unsuccessful movant can obtain immediate appellate review of the trial court denial of the article motion through a writ of supervision under article of the louisiana code of civil procedure.see civ.proc.supervisory writs may be applied for and granted in accordance with the constitution and rules of the supreme court and other courts exercising appellate jurisdiction.several louisiana courts of appeal have immediately reviewed a trial court denial of an article motion pursuant to these supervisory writs.see,darden smith,so d.cir,writ denied,so d baxter,so d at benson city of marksville,so d.cir,writ denied,so d.
the collateral order doctrine 
the threshold issue in this appeal is whether a district court denial of an article motion is immediately appealable under.s ince appeals of right have been authorized by congress,there has been a firm congressional policy against interlocutory or piecemeal appeals and courts have consistently given effect to that policy.abney united states,d.section is part of that policy.under,this court has jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the united states.for purposes of,a final judgment is normally deemed not to have occurred until there has been a decision by the district court that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.midland asphalt united states,d quoting van cauwenberghe biard,d.thus,as a general rule,parties must litigate all issues in the trial court before appealing any one issue.appeal is thereby precluded from any decision which is tentative,informal or incomplete,as well as from any fully consummated decisions,where they are but steps towards final judgment in which they will merge.aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d quotation marks omitted.
in cohen beneficial industrial loan,the supreme court recognized the existence of a small class of decisions which finally determine claims of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action,too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.thus was born the collateral order doctrine,which establishes that certain decisions of the district court are final in effect although they do not dispose of the litigation.davis baton rouge parish sch,cir.the cohen court noted that it ha d long given this practical rather than a technical construction,at,and later courts have emphasized that t he collateral order doctrine is best understood not as an exception to the final decision rule laid down by congress in,but as a practical construction of it,digital equip.desktop direct,d see also will hallock,d regan starcraft marine,llc,cir sherwinski peterson,cir.the primary issue in the present appeal,then,is whether a district court denial of an article motion is among that small class of interlocutory orders that are immediately appealable to the courts of appeals.nixon fitzgerald,d.
to fall within cohen collateral order doctrine,an order must conclusively determine the disputed question,resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.coopers lybrand livesay,d numbering added see also will,at.noting that t he requirements for collateral order appeal have been distilled down to these three conditions.although the second condition requires that an issue be important,there has been much confusion over where importance actually applies.see kelly ford motor in re ford motor,cir noting that the jurisprudence surrounding the importance criterion is somewhat murky.some fifth circuit cases treat separability and importance as two distinct conditions of the collateral order doctrine,see,acosta tenneco oil,cir,while others treat them as one,see,goodman harris county,cir.the supreme court has discussed importance in the context of the third numbered element,unreviewability,and as discussed below recent supreme court decisions increasingly look to importance as a general and overarching consideration in the collateral order inquiry.
the confusion over where importance fits into the collateral order analysis is a symptom of the more general confusion over what constitutes a final collateral order.as judge jerome frank once said,
final is not a clear word it is slithery,tricky.it does not have a meaning constant in all contexts.what was said as to final orders a half century ago still holds the cases,it must be conceded,are not altogether harmonious.there is,still,too little finality about finality.a final decision is not necessarily the ultimate judgment or decree completely closing up a proceeding.but it is not easy to determine what decisions short of that point are final.
united states acres of land,cir quotation marks,citations,and footnotes omitted.in determining finality,courts have been inconsistent in enumerating the conditions that an order must meet to be considered collateral,resulting in such a variety of formulations that it is easy to point to cases that ignore some of the collateral order conditions or twist them into unrecognizable shapes.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed.the inconsistencies do not stop at the enumeration of conditions applications of the conditions vary in their strictness,and distinctions drawn between cases are sometimes difficult to reconcile.as one court has put it,no one can make a seamless web out of all of the decisions on collateral orders.united states billmyer,cir.other courts and commentators have maligned current finality jurisprudence as 
hopelessly complicated,legal gymnastics,dazzling in its complexity,unconscionable intricacy with overlapping exceptions,each less lucid than the next,an unacceptable morass,dizzying,tortured,a jurisprudence of unbelievable impenetrability,a crazy quilt,a state of affairs,a serbonian bog,and sorely in need of limiting principles.
adam steinman,reinventing appellate jurisdiction,citations omitted.indeed,one commentator has suggested that the cohen conditions are not really what determine whether an order is immediately appealable,as the collateral order doctrine framework obscures the policy judgments that actually determine whether immediate appellate review is available.id.at.
part of this confusion stems from the three cohen,separability,and unreviewability.there exists in each of these conditions substantial nuance,and it is in this nuance that we find the interests that drive collateral order determinations.that is,the collateral order determination often involves,explicitly or not,a balancing of the interests in postponing appellate review finality,efficiency,and in allowing immediate review the importance of the asserted right,the consequences of disallowing immediate appeal.moreover,although we sometimes speak of the three cohen criteria as strict preconditions for appellate review,see,goodman,at,even a brief exploration of the case law reveals that they might better be regarded as guidelines in making the pragmatic determination of whether to allow an order to be immediately appealed.
granted,a wholly pragmatic approach to finality inexcusably sacrifices clarity and predictability.indeed,a approach to the collateral order doctrine would be inimical to the general final order rule,as it would require balancing in each and every case.under such an approach,every order would be appealable if only to determine whether jurisdiction existed to appeal the order.thus,a wholly pragmatic approach would undermine the interests that lie at the heart of the collateral order doctrine.
consequently,we do not weigh the interests of granting and denying immediate appellate review in each and every case.consistent with supreme court precedent and the general purposes of the final judgment rule,we determine whether an order is appealable as a general or categorical matter.see cunningham hamilton county,d w e have consistently eschewed a approach to deciding whether an order is sufficiently collateral.digital,at.t he issue of appealability under is to be determined for the entire category to which a claim belongs,without regard to the chance that the litigation at hand might be speeded,or a particular injustice averted,by a prompt appellate court decision.quotation marks,citation,and alteration omitted see also in re carco,cir t he supreme court statement in cunningham that we should not apply the collateral order doctrine on a basis indicates that we should not attempt to carve out individualized,exceptions to the general rule that discovery orders are not immediately appealable.in other words,instead of making these decisions on a basis,we make them on a basis.
thus,for our present purposes,we do not look to whether the order in the context of this particular case is immediately appealable,but to whether orders denying motions brought under statutes such as article satisfy the conditions of the collateral order doctrine.to do so,an order denying such a motion must be sufficiently conclusive,separate,unreviewable,and perhaps important that the benefits of immediate appellate review outweigh the loss of efficiency that any movement away from a strict finality approach entails.
conclusivity 
we must first determine whether the denial of an article motion is conclusive.conclusivity does not merely require that the specific issue be conclusively determined were that the case,any issue on which a district court has rendered a decision would be conclusive.see goodman,at.instead,for an order to be conclusive,it should not be subject to later review or revision in the district court.see coopers lybrand,at.noting that the denial of a request for class certification is not conclusive under the collateral order doctrine because such an order is subject to revision in the district court baldridge sbc commc,cir noting that the denial of a request for certification for a fair labor standards act collective action is not conclusive under the collateral order doctrine because it is subject to revision before the district court addresses the merits.the mere power to revisit an order,however,is insufficient to preclude a finding of conclusivity it should be unlikely that the district court will revisit the order.see wright,miller cooper,supra,at so long as there is a plain prospect that the trial court may itself alter the challenged ruling,there is little justification for immediate appellate intrusion.the bare fact that the court has power to change its ruling,however,does not preclude review.it is enough that no further consideration is contemplated.citations omitted.that is,the order should be one that a district court rarely,if ever,revisits.
an order denying an article motion satisfies any concerns regarding conclusivity.a district court denial of an article motion is conclusive as to whether article mandates dismissal of the suit.the motion freezes a suit while the court determines whether the plaintiff claim has merit.if a trial court grants an article motion,the litigation ceases and the case is dismissed.if a trial court denies an article motion,then the case proceeds as it normally would.there is also no indication that a trial court would revisit an earlier decision on an article motion.we therefore conclude that an order denying an article motion is conclusive for the purposes of the collateral order doctrine.
separability 
second,we must determine whether an article motion resolves an issue completely separate from the merits of the case.issues are not separate where they are but steps towards a final judgment in which they will merge.cohen,at.moreover,where the issues raised in an interlocutory appeal involve considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff cause of action,the order is often found not to be separate.coopers lybrand,at.quoting mercantile bank langdeau,d.
for example,in pan eastern exploration hufo oils,cir,the trial court denied a foreign defendant motion to dismiss proceedings against it based upon considerations of international comity.the defendant argued that the district court should have granted the motion out of deference to a canadian court order staying all judicial proceedings against the defendant.id.in determining that the denial of the defendant motion was not an collateral order,this court noted that the considerations necessary to decide whether to extend comity to the canadian stay order were inextricably bound with the facts relevant to the merits.id.at.because t he substantiality of the plaintiff claims was relevant to the question of whether comity was consistent with domestic interests,the court concluded that the issues underlying the motion to dismiss were not sufficiently separate from the merits.id.at.
in contrast,courts have held that issues concerning immunity from suit are often separate from the underlying dispute in the litigation.for example,in mitchell forsyth,d,the supreme court noted that a claim of qualified immunity is conceptually distinct from the merits of the plaintiff claim because a n appellate court reviewing the denial of the defendant claim of immunity need not consider the correctness of the plaintiff version of the facts,nor even determine whether the plaintiff allegations actually state a claim.similarly,in abney,the court held that a denial of a claim of double jeopardy immunity was separate from the underlying dispute because the very nature of a double jeopardy claim is such that it is collateral to,and separable from,the principal issue at the accused impending criminal trial,whether or not the accused is guilty of the offense charged.at.italics omitted.the immunity decisions indicate that some involvement with the underlying facts is acceptable,as the court has found the issue of immunity to be separate from the merits of the underlying dispute even though a reviewing court must consider the plaintiff factual allegations in resolving the immunity issue.mitchell,at.see also moore felger,cir this court has exercised appellate jurisdiction when factual disputes relevant to the district court decision on the qualified immunity question were resolvable based on the record.thus,an order does not have to be separate from the entirety of the underlying dispute to satisfy cohen.
at first blush,an order denying an article motion seems to clearly decide an issue separate from the merits it determines only the issue of whether article requires dismissal of a suit.our inquiry should not end here,however,as further consideration raises several concerns.first,the article determination requires an assessment of the plaintiff probability of success.this risks involving an appellate court in the factual and legal issues underlying the plaintiff claim.indeed,the article determination is an assessment of the merits of a plaintiff claim,and this court has previously suggested that such an inquiry might weigh against a finding of separability.see acosta,at finding that a discovery order met the separability condition where r eviewing the propriety of the order does not require this court to examine the merits of the plaintiff claim or the defendant affirmative defense.for the sake of argument that article evidentiary provision would apply in federal allows plaintiffs to introduce a trial court denial of a special motion to strike as evidence at trial.see civ.proc.a.thus,although an article motion does not necessarily involve issues that arise later in the trial,issues that arise later in the trial might involve an article motion.this also weighs against a finding of separability.see cohen,at.noting that collateral orders are not of such an interlocutory nature as to affect,or to be affected by,decision of the merits of this case emphasis added.
these potential entanglements,however,are insufficient to forestall a finding of separability.first,article has a purpose distinct from that of the underlying suit.as the ninth circuit reasoned in addressing the appealability of a similar california statute,an motion resolves a question separate from the merits in that it merely finds that such merits may exist,without evaluating whether the plaintiff claim will succeed.batzel smith,cir.moreover,t he purpose of an motion is to determine whether the defendant is being forced to defend against a meritless claim,not to determine whether the defendant actually committed the relevant tort.id.article thus exists separately from the merits of the defamation claim itself.id.
further,the policy behind the collateral order doctrine militates in favor of finding separability.the final order rule limits appeals to encourage the aggregation of all necessary issues for one appeal and to provide for efficient adjudication.the separability requirement furthers this purpose by preventing appeals on issues that will be definitively decided later in the case.in this way,one might characterize separability as a way of ensuring that a movant is not attempting to have an appellate court preemptively resolve a disputed issue still pending in the district court.thus,in pan eastern exploration,discussed above,the issue of whether interests of international comity warranted dismissal of the suit was dependent upon the interests in proceeding with the litigation,and the district court would balance these interests as the trial progressed.see at.in contrast,issues of immunity are decided prior to trial and then not normally revisited.consequently,even where the immunity determination looks to the facts underlying the dispute,the immunity determination is tangential to the merits of the underlying case.similarly,although an article motion looks to the plaintiff probability of success,the court decides it before proceeding to trial and then moves on.immediate appellate review would thus determine an issue separate from any issues that remain before the district court.
finally,the mere fact that a trial court decision denying an article motion is admissible at trial does not change our conclusion.article a,as originally enacted,provided,
if the court determines that the plaintiff has established a probability of success on the claim,neither that determination nor the fact of that determination shall be admissible in evidence at any later stage of the proceeding,and no burden of proof or degree of proof otherwise applicable shall be affected by that determination.
acts.the louisiana legislature amended this provision in to allow a trial court denial of an article motion to be admissible at trial.see.acts amending article a to read,if the court determines that the plaintiff has established a probability of success on the claim,that determination shall be admissible in evidence at any later stage of the proceeding.the purpose of this change is unclear,but this provision appears to strike a balance between the costs and benefits of filing an article motion.that is,defendants should be hesitant to file a frivolous article motion,as an adverse decision can then be used against them at trial.
although seeming to have a bearing on the underlying suit,we fail to see how this unique evidentiary provision affects our collateral order analysis in any substantial way.granted,if an appellate court affirms a district court denial of an article motion on an interlocutory appeal,this unique evidentiary rule could mean that an appellate court assessment of the merits of a plaintiff claim might influence future trial proceedings.but a decision on an article motion is not a ruling on the ultimate merits it is merely tangential to the merits.a court deciding an article motion does not ask whether the plaintiff has proved her claim,but whether she has shown a sufficient probability of being able to prove her claim.this is akin to a court determining only that a plaintiff has presented a threshold showing that allows her claim to proceed.if the court determination is later admitted into evidence,it is only one piece of evidence that the jury could choose to consider or reject.as such,it is hardly dispositive as to the merits of the suit.more importantly,this evidentiary provision does not render the denial of an article motion any less or more final it does not affect the efficiency of judicial proceedings,blur the contours of the issue being appealed,or alter the interests that immediate appeal vindicates.this provision thus has only a minimal bearing on our inquiry.
moreover,the minor possibility of minimal entanglement is insufficient to overcome the interests that favor a finding of immediate appealability.as discussed below,article aims to serve the substantial public interest of protecting those exercising their first amendment rights from the chilling effect of defending meritless and abusive tort suits.article does so by immunizing speakers from suits stemming from the exercise of first amendment rights,thus preserving both an individual right to speak and the public collective interest in free and robust debate.the importance of the interests that article serves thus resolves any lingering doubts regarding separability.we therefore conclude that the denial of an article motion is sufficiently separate from the merits of the underlying case for the purposes of the collateral order doctrine.
unreviewability 
we must also determine whether a district court denial of an article motion is effectively unreviewable on appeal.unreviewability is the fundamental characteristic of the collateral order doctrine.pan exploration,at see also mitchell,at.a major characteristic of the denial or granting of a claim appealable under cohen collateral order doctrine is that unless it can be reviewed before the proceedings terminate,it can never be reviewed at all.quotation marks and alteration omitted.as this court stated in pan eastern exploration,
because of this essential requirement,almost all denials of motions to dismiss are not immediately appealable.if,on appeal from a final judgment,an appellate court finds that the motion to dismiss should have been granted,it can direct the lower court to dismiss.the rights of the movant will have been vindicated,although after the movant has suffered the expense and delay of trial.as we have said before,however,this sort of injury follows in every denial of a motion to dismiss a complaint and does not justify an exception to the rule.
at quotation marks omitted.thus,the collateral order doctrine requires something beyond the right to prevail at an early stage of the proceedings for an order to be effectively unreviewable.
perhaps the embodiment of unreviewability,then,is immunity from suit,for the essence of immunity is its possessor entitlement not to have to answer for his conduct in a civil damages action.mitchell,at.the entitlement is an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.id.at.in other words,immunity is not simply a right to prevail,but a right not to be tried.thus,the supreme court and the fifth circuit have held that denials of various forms of immunity are collateral orders.see aqueduct sewer,at eleventh amendment immunity mitchell,at.qualified immunity nixon,at.absolute executive immunity helstoski meanor,d speech and debate clause immunity abney,at.immunity from double jeopardy shanks alliedsignal,cir texas state law immunity for communications made during judicial,or legislative proceedings stena rederi ab comision de contratos del comite ejecutivo general,cir foreign sovereign immunities act immunity brown.a m,cir title vii qualified immunity.
the supreme court has warned,however,that o ne must be careful not to play word games with the concept of a right not to be tried,midland asphalt,at,for virtually every right that could be enforced appropriately by pretrial dismissal might loosely be described as conferring a right not to stand trial,digital,at.there is a crucial distinction between a right not to be tried and a right whose remedy requires the dismissal of charges.a right not to be tried in the sense relevant to the cohen exception rests upon an explicit statutory or constitutional guarantee that trial will not occur.midland asphalt,at.quotation marks and citation omitted.for this reason,courts have held that certain constitutional and statutory rights not to be tried are effectively unreviewable for the purposes of the collateral order doctrine,while privately contracted rights not to be tried are not.see,digital,at.lauro lines chasser,d.
the denial of an article motion satisfies the unreviewability condition.the purpose of article is to free defendants from the burden and expense of litigation that has the purpose or effect of chilling the exercise of first amendment rights.article thus provides a right not to stand trial,as avoiding the costs of trial is the very purpose of the statute.in other words,article does not provide a defense to liability defendants remain liable for actual acts of defamation and other torts.but it does provide defendants the right not to bear the costs of fighting a meritless defamation claim.if an article motion is erroneously denied and unappealable,then the case proceeds to trial and this right is effectively destroyed.and in line with the supreme court observation in midland asphalt,article provides an explicit statutory guarantee of a right not to stand trial.
we therefore conclude that the denial of an article motion is effectively unreviewable for the purposes of the collateral order doctrine.not only does such a denial fall directly within the language of midland asphalt,but the interests underlying both the collateral order doctrine and article militate in favor of such a conclusion.
importance 
as is perhaps evident from the above discussion,the traditional cohen factors for collateral order,separability,and not lend themselves to a satisfying and coherent exegesis.conclusivity does not simply mean conclusive,as all orders can be construed at a level of generality that renders them conclusive as to a specific issue.separability can not mean wholly separate,as all orders bear some tangential relationship to the underlying dispute,with the relationship of some issues quite more than tangential.and unreviewability can not simply mean effectively unreviewable,for any order can be reviewed on appeal,and the lack of appeal for any order can impose immense and unjust burdens on a party.
one method of bringing some unity to the doctrine is to look to another factor in the collateral order analysis,and recent supreme court decisions seem to indicate that the focus of the inquiry is shifting to importance.granted,importance is nothing new to the doctrine.in the court original formulation of the collateral order doctrine,it stated that the doctrine covered those orders too important to be denied review.cohen,at.the court has also employed importance as a trump card for distinguishing its prior decisions as the court stated in united states macdonald,d,
there is all but the most unusual triumphing before trial,rather than after it,regardless of the substance of the winning claim.but this truism is not to be confused with the quite distinct proposition that certain claims because of the substance of the rights entailed,rather than the advantage to a litigant in winning his claim sooner should be resolved before trial.
and as justice scalia stated in lauro lines,the importance of the right asserted has always been a significant part of our collateral order doctrine.at.scalia,concurring.
more recent decisions have increasingly looked to importance to clarify what is a less than clear area of the law.in digital equipment,the defendant argued that importance had no place in the collateral order analysis.at.the court acknowledged that one may validly question whether importance is a factor beyond the three cohen conditions or whether it is best considered,as the court had sometimes suggested it should be,in connection with the second,separability,requirement.id.at.but the court dismissed outright any suggestion that importance is itself unimportant,and indicated that importance informed both the second and third conditions of the collateral order doctrine,id.at.moreover,regarding its preference for constitutional or statutory rights not to be tried,the court stated that w hen a policy is embodied in a constitutional or statutory provision entitling a party to immunity from suit a rare form of protection,there is little room for the judiciary to gainsay its importance.id.at.the court opinion can even be read to indicate that importance is actually the driving force behind the collateral order doctrine,as it defined important in cohen sense as being weightier than the societal interests advanced by the ordinary operation of final judgment principles.id.that is,an order is immediately appealable when the interests in permitting immediate appeals are sufficiently important to outweigh the interests of finality in denying immediate appeals.
the supreme court later emphasized the centrality of importance to determining appealability in will.recognizing that a multitude of orders denying a right not to be tried were effectively unreviewable,the court combed its cases for some further characteristic that merits appealability under cohen.at.that something further boil ed down to a judgment about the value of the interests that would be lost through rigorous application of a final judgment requirement.id.at.quotation marks omitted.thus,according to the will court,compelling public ends rooted in the separation of powers were behind the nixon court decision that a denial of absolute executive immunity was immediately appealable threatened disruption of governmental functions,and fear of inhibiting able people from exercising discretion in public service drove the mitchell court decision that a denial of qualified immunity was immediately appealable the puerto rico aqueduct court based its decision that a denial of eleventh amendment immunity was immediately appealable not only on the burdens of litigation,but also on the need to ensure vindication of a state dignitary interests and,in determining that a denial of double jeopardy immunity was immediately appealable,the abney court looked to the enormous prosecutorial power of the government to subject an individual to embarrassment,expense and ordeal compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety.id.at.quotations marks,citations,and alterations omitted.the court continued,
in each case,some particular value of a high order was marshaled in support of the interest in avoiding trial honoring the separation of powers,preserving the efficiency of government and the initiative of its officials,respecting a state dignitary interests,and mitigating the government advantage over the individual.that is,it is not mere avoidance of a trial,but avoidance of a trial that would imperil a substantial public interest,that counts when asking whether an order is effectively unreviewable if review is to be left until later.
id.at.emphasis added.the court in will ultimately held that the denial of a judgment bar motion under the federal tort claims act was not an collateral order,as the order had no claim to greater importance than the typical defense of claim preclusion.id.at.
if importance is what is underlying the distinctions between which orders are conclusive,separate,and unreviewable,then the supreme court seems to be endorsing an increasingly pragmatic approach to the collateral order doctrine.this is not to say that importance is a defining or controlling criterion of appealability,or that the collateral order determination is wholly ad hoc or unguided.importance instead informs the three cohen criteria as well as our ov
