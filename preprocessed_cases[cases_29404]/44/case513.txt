this appeal is taken by general motors corporation gm from an adverse jury verdict in favor of frances babcock as executrix of the estate of paul babcock,iii,and individually.the case arose from an accident on february,when a general motors pickup truck driven by paul babcock,iii,went off the road and struck a tree.the accident rendered babcock a paraplegic.on june,babcock died as a result of complications from his injuries.
background 
plaintiff brought suit alleging negligence and strict liability against the defendant.the jury returned a verdict finding gm liable on the negligence count and not liable on the strict liability count.it is undisputed that when babcock was first seen after the accident his seat belt was not fastened around him.the complaint alleged that babcock was wearing his seat belt prior to the accident,but that the belt unbuckled as soon as pressure was exerted on it and the buckle released due to a condition known as false latching.the main focus of the trial was on this claim of false latching.
three main issues are before us whether the verdict should be set aside because it was internally inconsistent whether gm forfeited its objection to the alleged inconsistency because of its failure to follow the requirements of rules b and of the federal rules of civil procedure as applied by this court and whether the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict of liability based on negligence.we affirm the judgment below.
ii.discussion 
a.the claim of inconsistent verdicts 
gm advances a series of arguments to the effect that the jury verdict on the negligence count is invalid and can not stand as a matter of law,in the absence of a defect in the product,gm could not be found liable for negligence thus,the verdicts were inconsistent the inconsistency in the verdicts was caused by the district court erroneous jury instructions and plaintiff failure to appeal the verdict in favor of gm on the strict liability claim precludes entry of judgment for plaintiff on the negligence claim and mandates entry of judgment for gm.
none of these arguments or variations thereof was made in the trial court.during the discussions on the proposed jury charge,the trial judge discussed the verdict form with counsel on two separate occasions.gm did not object to the form on either occasion.the verdict form on liability submitted to the jury stated 
special verdict form 
has plaintiff proved her negligence claim by a preponderance of the evidence 
has plaintiff proved her product liability claim by a preponderance of the evidence 
answer questions and only if you have answered yes to question 
although the verdict form is entitled special verdict form,it seems clear that it was not a true special verdict,as described in rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.rule a states the court may require a jury to return only a special verdict in the form of a special written finding upon each issue of fact.here,for example,a special verdict form would have included questions such as whether babcock was wearing his seatbelt at the time of the accident.when such a form is used,the jury makes only findings of fact it is up to the court to apply the law.see charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure,at ed.it seems clear that this is not the type of verdict form used in this case.
rule b,which addresses general verdicts,states the court may submit to the jury,together with appropriate forms for a general verdict,written interrogatories upon one or more issues of fact the decision of which is necessary to a verdict.this is the type of form used in this case the jury returned a verdict against gm,and also answered specific interrogatories designed to channel its deliberations,focusing its attention on the crucial issues that it had to resolve in order to decide which party should prevail see wright miller,supra,at discussing the purpose of rule b.the last sentence of rule b specifically discusses inconsistent answers to questions submitted to the jury when the answers are inconsistent with each other and one or more is likewise inconsistent with the general verdict,judgment shall not be entered,but the court shall return the jury for further consideration of its answers and verdict or shall order a new trial.
we have held that under rule b,objections to the inconsistency of verdicts must be made after the verdict is read and before the jury is discharged,merchant ruhle,cir skillin kimball,cir.consistent with those precedents,we hold that gm forfeited its objection to the alleged inconsistency by failing to object at the critical time.see mcisaac didriksen fishing,cir.to decide otherwise would countenance agreeable acquiescence to perceivable error as a weapon of appellate advocacy.id.quoting merchant,at.consequently,unless there is plain error,we can not grant relief on gm claim that the jury inconsistent liability findings rendered invalid its finding that gm was negligent.we address the issue of plain error below.
our finding of forfeiture is reinforced by gm failure to object properly to the jury instructions,which made clear that the jury could return a verdict in babcock favor if it found either negligence or a design defect.toucet maritime overseas,cir noting that defendant should have been alerted to the potential inconsistency by the jury instructions,which stated that the plaintiff could recover if on one or both of her negligence and unseaworthiness claims.rule of the federal rules of civil procedure provides in pertinent part no party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict,stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.we point out that during the conference on the proposed jury instructions,the district court alerted counsel that in order to preserve objections to the charge they had to object as required under the rule.rule has been stringently enforced to the extent that a district court judge can not waive it even with the acquiescence of counsel.poulin greer,cir smith.inst.of,cir mcgrath spirito,cir rule is binding on both the court and attorneys and neither can circumvent it.and,of critical importance to gm position,a failure to object as required by rule deprives the party of review under rule,either before the trial court on a motion or on appeal.scarfo cabletron,cir.
there is nothing in the record from which it can be found either directly or inferentially that gm objected to the submission to the jury of both the negligence and strict liability claims.in fact,defense counsel treated the submission of both claims as routine procedure.gm only objection after argument and prior to the jury retiring for deliberations was as follows 
counsel for gm i just want to reiterate the comments that we had before that the court prepared the charge on the issue of defective design versus testing.
the court all right.that your argument is that this does not include a negligence testing claim,and you adequately preserved that argument.
evidently,the district court understood gm to be arguing as it had during an earlier conference that babcock claim of negligent testing was not properly in the case because it was not included in the amended complaint.nothing in gm comments raised the claim of possible verdict inconsistency it presses on appeal.we conclude that those brief comments did not satisfy the requirements of rule.
the only exception to nullification of appellate issues for failure to follow rule is the plain error doctrine.smith kmart,cir.reversal under that doctrine requires that there be error the error was plain obvious and clear under current law the error affected substantial rights and the error threatened a miscarriage of justice.danco,stores,cir.we have applied the plain error doctrine stringently in civil cases.id.accordingly,we will grant relief on an issue that has been forfeited on appeal only to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice or where the error seriously affected the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.romano int l,cir citations and
