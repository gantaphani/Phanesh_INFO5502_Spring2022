respondent sheehan lived in a group home for individuals with mental illness.after sheehan began acting erratically and threatened to kill her social worker,the city and county of san francisco san francisco dispatched police officers reynolds and holder to help escort sheehan to a facility for temporary evaluation and treatment.when the officers first entered sheehan room,she grabbed a knife and threatened to kill them.they retreated and closed the door.concerned about what sheehan might do behind the closed door,and without considering if they could accommodate her disability,the officers reentered her room.sheehan,knife in hand,again confronted them.after pepper spray proved ineffective,the officers shot sheehan multiple times.sheehan later sued petitioner san francisco for,among other things,violating title ii of the americans with disabilities act of ada by arresting her without accommodating her disability.see.she also sued petitioners reynolds and holder in their personal capacities under,claiming that they violated her fourth amendment rights.the district court granted summary judgment because it concluded that officers making an arrest are not required to determine whether their actions would comply with the ada before protecting themselves and others,and also that reynolds and holder did not violate the constitution.vacating in part,the ninth circuit held that the ada applied and that a jury must decide whether san francisco should have accommodated sheehan.the court also held that reynolds and holder are not entitled to qualified immunity because it is clearly established that,absent an objective need for immediate entry,officers can not forcibly enter the home of an armed,mentally ill person who has been acting irrationally and has threatened anyone who enters.
the question whether requires law enforcement officers to provide accommodations to an armed,violent,and mentally ill suspect in the course of bringing the suspect into custody,pet.for cert.i,is dismissed as improvidently granted.certiorari was granted on the understanding that san francisco would argue that title ii of the ada does not apply when an officer faces an armed and dangerous individual.instead,san francisco merely argues that sheehan was not qualified for an accommodation,because she pose d a direct threat to the health or safety of others,which threat could not be eliminated by a modification of policies,practices or procedures,or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services,cfr a.this argument was not passed on by the court below.the decision to dismiss this question as improvidently granted,moreover,is reinforced by the parties failure to address the related question whether a public entity can be vicariously liable for damages under title ii for an arrest made by its police officers.
reynolds and holder are entitled to qualified immunity from liability for the injuries suffered by sheehan.public officials are immune from suit under unless they have violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct,plumhoff rickard,an exacting standard that gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments,ashcroft.the officers did not violate the fourth amendment when they opened sheehan door the first time,and there is no doubt that they could have opened her door the second time without violating her rights had sheehan not been disabled.their use of force was also reasonable.the only question therefore is whether they violated the fourth amendment when they decided to reopen sheehan door rather than attempt to accommodate her disability.because any such fourth amendment right,even assuming it exists,was not clearly established,reynolds and holder are entitled to qualified immunity.likewise,an alleged failure on the part of the officers to follow their training does not itself negate qualified immunity where it would otherwise be warranted.

city and county of san francisco,california,et,petitioners teresa sheehan 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice alito delivered the opinion of the court.
we granted certiorari to consider two questions relating to the manner in which san francisco police officers arrested a woman who was suffering from a mental illness and had become violent.after reviewing the parties submissions,we dismiss the first question as improvidently granted.we decide the second question and hold that the officers are entitled to qualified immunity because they did not violate any clearly established fourth amendment rights.
petitioners are the city and county of san francisco,california san francisco,and two police officers,sergeant kimberly reynolds and officer kathrine holder.respondent is teresa sheehan,a woman who suffers from a schizoaffective disorder.because this case arises in a summary judgment posture,we view the facts in the light most favorable to sheehan,the nonmoving party.see,plumhoff rickard,slip,at.
in august,sheehan lived in a group home for people dealing with mental illness.although she shared common areas of the building with others,she had a private room.on august,heath hodge,a social worker who supervised the counseling staff in the building,attempted to visit sheehan to conduct a welfare check.hodge was concerned because sheehan had stopped taking her medication,no longer spoke with her psychiatrist,and reportedly was no longer changing her clothes or eating.see,app.
hodge knocked on sheehan door but received no answer.he then used a key to enter her room and found sheehan on her bed.initially,she would not respond to questions.but she then sprang up,reportedly yelling,get out of here you do have a warrant i have a knife,and i kill you if i have to.hodge left without seeing whether she actually had a knife,and sheehan slammed the door shut behind him.see,at.
sheehan,hodge realized,required some sort of intervention,app,but he also knew that he would need help.hodge took steps to clear the building of other people and completed an application to have sheehan detained for temporary evaluation and treatment.see cal.welf.inst.code ann.west cum.supp.authorizing temporary detention of someone who as a result of a mental health disorder,is a danger to others,or to himself or herself,or gravely disabled on that application,hodge checked off boxes indicating that sheehan was a threat to others and gravely disabled,but he did not mark that she was a danger to herself,at.he telephoned the police and asked for help to take sheehan to a secure facility.
officer holder responded to police dispatch and headed toward the group home.when she arrived,holder reviewed the application and spoke with hodge.holder then sought assistance from sergeant reynolds,a more experienced officer.after reynolds arrived and was brought up to speed,hodge spoke with a nurse at the psychiatric emergency services unit at san francisco general hospital who said that the hospital would be able to admit sheehan.
accompanied by hodge,the officers went to sheehan room,knocked on her door,announced who they were,and told sheehan that we want to help you.app.when sheehan did not answer,the officers used hodge key to enter the room.sheehan reacted violently.she grabbed a kitchen knife with an approximately blade and began approaching the officers,yelling something along the lines of i am going to kill you.i do need help.get out.ibid.see also,at did you tell them i kill you if you do get out of here yes the officers who did not have their weapons drawn retreated and sheehan closed the door,leaving sheehan in her room and the officers and hodge in the hallway.at.the officers called for backup and sent hodge downstairs to let in reinforcements when they arrived.
the officers were concerned that the door to sheehan room was closed.they worried that sheehan,out of their sight,might gather more weapons reynolds had already observed other knives in her room,see app.or even try to flee through the back window,at.because sheehan room was on the second floor,she likely would have needed a ladder to escape.fire escapes,however,are common in san francisco,and the officers did not know whether sheehan room had such an escape.neither officer asked hodge about a fire escape,but if they had,it seems he probably would have said there was one,at.with the door closed,all that reynolds and holder knew for sure was that sheehan was unstable,she had just threatened to kill three people,and she had a weapon 
reynolds and holder had to make a decision.they could wait for backup indeed,they already heard sirens.or they could quickly reenter the room and try to subdue sheehan before more time elapsed.because reynolds believed that the situation required their immediate attention,at,the officers chose reentry.in making that decision,they did not pause to consider whether sheehan disability should be accommodated.see,at.the officers obviously knew that sheehan was unwell,but in reynolds words,that was a secondary issue given that they were faced with a violent woman who had already threatened to kill her social worker and two uniformed police officers.app.
the officers ultimately decided that holder the larger officer should push the door open while reynolds used pepper spray on sheehan.with pistols drawn,the officers moved in.when sheehan,knife in hand,saw them,she again yelled for them to leave.she may also have again said that she was going to kill them.sheehan is not sure if she threatened death a second time,at,but concedes that it was her intent to resist arrest and to use the knife,at.in any event,reynolds began sheehan in the face,but sheehan would not drop the knife.when sheehan was only a few feet away,holder shot her twice,but she did not collapse.reynolds then fired multiple shots after sheehan finally fell,a third officer who had just arrived kicked the knife out of her hand.sheehan survived.
sometime later,san francisco prosecuted sheehan for assault with a deadly weapon,assault on a peace officer with a deadly weapon,and making criminal threats.the jury acquitted sheehan of making threats but was unable to reach a verdict on the assault counts,and prosecutors decided not to retry her.
sheehan then brought suit,alleging,among other things,that san francisco violated the americans with disabilities act of ada,stat,et,by subduing her in a manner that did not reasonably accommodate her disability.she also sued reynolds and holder in their personal capacities under stat,for violating her fourth amendment rights.in support of her claims,she offered testimony from a former deputy police chief,lou reiter,who contended that reynolds and holder fell short of their training by not using practices designed to minimize the risk of violence when dealing with the mentally ill.
the district court granted summary judgment for petitioners.relying on hainze richards,the court held that officers making an arrest are not required to first determine whether their actions would comply with the ada before protecting themselves and others.app.to pet.for cert.the court also held that the officers did not violate the fourth amendment.the court wrote that the officers had no way of knowing whether sheehan might escape through a back window or fire escape,whether she might hurt herself,or whether there was anyone else in her room whom she might hurt.at.in addition,the court observed that holder did not begin shooting until it was necessary for her to do so in order to protect herself and that reynolds used deadly force only after she found that pepper spray was not enough force to contain the situation.at.
on appeal,the ninth circuit vacated in part.relevant here,the panel held that because the ada covers public services,programs,or activities,the ada accommodation requirement should be read to to encompass anything a public entity does,at.the ninth circuit agreed that exigent circumstances inform the reasonableness analysis under the ada,but concluded that it was for a jury to decide whether san francisco should have accommodated sheehan by,for instance,respect ing her comfort zone,engag ing in communications and us ing the passage of time to defuse the situation rather than precipitating a deadly confrontation.at.
as to reynolds and holder,the panel held that their initial entry into sheehan room was lawful and that,after the officers opened the door for the second time,they reasonably used their firearms when the pepper spray failed to stop sheehan advance.nonetheless,the panel also held that a jury could find that the officers provoked sheehan by needlessly forcing that second confrontation,at.the panel further found that it was clearly established that an officer can not forcibly enter the home of an armed,mentally ill subject who had been acting irrationally and had threatened anyone who entered when there was no objective need for immediate entry.at.dissenting in part,judge graber would have held that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity.
san francisco and the officers petitioned for a writ of certiorari and asked us to review two questions.we granted the petition.
title ii of the ada commands that no qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.the first question on which we granted review asks whether this provision requires law enforcement officers to provide accommodations to an armed,violent,and mentally ill suspect in the course of bringing the suspect into custody.pet.for cert.i.when we granted review,we understood this question to embody what appears to be the thrust of the argument that san francisco made in the ninth circuit,namely that title ii does not apply to an officer responses to reported disturbances or other similar incidents,whether or not those calls involve subjects with mental disabilities,prior to the officer securing the scene and ensuring that there is no threat to human life.brief for appellees in,quoting hainze,supra,at emphasis added see also brief for appellees in,at similar.
as san francisco explained in its reply brief at the certiorari stage,resolving its question presented does not require a reasonable accommodation inquiry,since the only question for this court to resolve is whether any accommodation of an armed and violent individual is reasonable or required under title ii of the ada.reply to brief in opposition.
having persuaded us to grant certiorari,san francisco chose to rely on a different argument than what it pressed below.in its brief in this court,san francisco focuses on the statutory phrase qualified individual,and a regulation declaring that title ii does not require a public entity to permit an individual to participate in or benefit from the services,programs,or activities of that public entity when that individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others.cfr a.another regulation defines a direct threat as a significant risk to the health or safety of others that can not be eliminated by a modification of policies,practices or procedures,or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services.putting these authorities together,san argues that a person who poses a direct threat or significant risk to the safety of others is not qualified for accommodations under the ada,brief for petitioners.contending that sheehan clearly posed a direct threat,san francisco concludes that she was therefore not qualified for an accommodation.
though,to be sure,this qualified argument does appear in san francisco certiorari petition,san francisco never hinted at it in the ninth circuit.the court does not ordinarily decide questions that were not passed on below.more than that,san francisco new argument effectively concedes that the relevant provision of the ada,may requir e law enforcement officers to provide accommodations to an armed,violent,and mentally ill suspect in the course of bringing the suspect into custody.pet.for cert.i.this is so because there may be circumstances in which any significant risk presented by an armed,violent,and mentally ill suspect can be eliminated by a modification of policies,practices or procedures,or by the provision of auxiliary aids or services.
the argument that san francisco now advances is predicated on the proposition that the ada governs the manner in which a qualified individual with a disability is arrested.the relevant provision provides that a public entity may not exclud e a qualified individual with a disability from participat ing in,and may not den y that individual the benefits of,the services,programs,or activities of a public entity.this language would apply to an arrest if an arrest is an activity in which the arrestee participat es or from which the arrestee may benefi t.
this same provision also commands that no qualified individual with a disability shall be subjected to discrimination by any public entity.ibid.this part of the statute would apply to an arrest if the failure to arrest an individual with a mental disability in a manner that reasonably accommodates that disability constitutes discrimination.ibid.
whether the statutory language quoted above applies to arrests is an important question that would benefit from briefing and an adversary presentation.but san,the united states as amicus curiae,and sheehan all argue or at least accept that applies to arrests.no one argues the contrary view.as a result,we do not think that it would be prudent to decide the question in this case.
our decision not to decide whether the ada applies to arrests is reinforced by the parties failure to address a related question whether a public entity can be liable for damages under title ii for an arrest made by its police officers.only public entities are subject to title ii,see,pennsylvania of corrections yeskey,and the parties agree that such an entity can be held vicariously liable for money damages for the purposeful or deliberately indifferent conduct of its employees.see tr.of oral arg.but we have never decided whether that is correct,and we decline to do so here,in the absence of adversarial briefing.
because certiorari jurisdiction exists to clarify the law,its exercise is not a matter of right,but of judicial discretion.supreme court rule.exercising that discretion,we dismiss the first question presented as improvidently granted.see,board of trustees of of garrett,partial dismissal parker dugger,same.
the second question presented is whether reynolds and holder can be held personally liable for the injuries that sheehan suffered.we conclude they are entitled to qualified immunity 
public officials are immune from suit under unless they have violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.plumhoff,at slip,at internal quotation marks omitted.an officer can not be said to have violated a clearly established right unless the right contours were sufficiently definite that any reasonable official in his shoes would have understood that he was violating it,meaning that existing precedent placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.ashcroft,slip,at.this exacting standard gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments by protect ing all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.at slip,at.
in this case,although we disagree with the ninth circuit ultimate conclusion on the question of qualified immunity,we agree with its analysis in many respects.for instance,there is no doubt that the officers did not violate any federal right when they opened sheehan door the first time.see,at.reynolds and holder knocked on the door,announced that they were police officers,and informed sheehan that they wanted to help her.when sheehan did not come to the door,they entered her room.this was not unconstitutional.l aw enforcement officers may enter a home without a warrant to render emergency assistance to an injured occupant or to protect an occupant from imminent injury.brigham city stuart.see also kentucky king,slip,at.
nor is there any doubt that had sheehan not been,the officers could have opened her door the second time without violating any constitutional rights.for one thing,because the two entries were part of a single,continuous search or seizure,the officers were not required to justify the continuing emergency with respect to the second entry.at following michigan tyler.in addition,reynolds and holder knew that sheehan had a weapon and had threatened to use it to kill three people.they also knew that delay could make the situation more dangerous.the fourth amendment standard is reasonableness,and it is reasonable for police to move quickly if delay would gravely endanger their lives or the lives of others.warden.penitentiary hayden.this is true even when,judged with the benefit of hindsight,the officers may have made some mistakes.heien north carolina,slip,at.the constitution is not blind to the fact that police officers are often forced to make judgments.plumhoff,supra,at slip,at.
we also agree with the ninth circuit that after the officers opened sheehan door the second time,their use of force was reasonable.reynolds tried to subdue sheehan with pepper spray,but sheehan kept coming at the officers until she was only a few feet from a cornered officer holder.at.at this point,the use of potentially deadly force was justified.see scott harris.nothing in the fourth amendment barred reynolds and holder from protecting themselves,even though it meant firing multiple rounds.see plumhoff,supra,at slip,at.
the real question,then,is whether,despite these dangerous circumstances,the officers violated the fourth amendment when they decided to reopen sheehan door rather than attempting to accommodate her disability.here we come to another problem.san francisco,whose attorneys represent reynolds and holder,devotes scant briefing to this question.instead,san francisco argues almost exclusively that even if it is assumed that there was a fourth amendment violation,the right was not clearly established.this court,of course,could decide the constitutional question anyway.see pearson callahan,recognizing discretion.but because this question has not been adequately briefed,we decline to do so.see,at.rather,we simply decide whether the officers failure to accommodate sheehan illness violated clearly established law.it did not.
to begin,nothing in our cases suggests the constitutional rule applied by the ninth circuit.the ninth circuit focused on graham connor,but graham holds only that the objective reasonableness test applies to claims under the fourth amendment.see,at.that is far too general a proposition to control this case.we have repeatedly told courts and the ninth circuit in particular not to define clearly established law at a high level of generality.supra,at citation omitted slip,at lopez smith,per curiam slip,at.qualified immunity is no immunity at all if clearly established law can simply be defined as the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.
even a cursory glance at the facts of graham confirms just how different that case is from this one.that case did not involve a dangerous,obviously unstable person making threats,much less was there a weapon involved.there is a world of difference between needlessly withholding sugar from an innocent person who is suffering from an insulin reaction,see graham,supra,at,and responding to the perilous situation reynolds and holder confronted.graham is a nonstarter.
moving beyond graham,the ninth circuit also turned to two of its own cases.but even if a controlling circ
