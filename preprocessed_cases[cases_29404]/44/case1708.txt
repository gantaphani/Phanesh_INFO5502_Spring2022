the pertinent facts are not in dispute and are cogently set forth in the district court and panel opinions.although,like the district court,we do not condone the border patrol actions or the choices it made,castro,dist.lexis,at,the district court was correct in concluding that,because plaintiff tort claims are barred by the discretionary function exception to the ftca,the court was without subject matter jurisdiction,and the government motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b should be granted.

i concur in judge stewart astute dissent.if the border patrol agents exceeded the scope of their authority,the discretionary function exception would not apply and monica castro tort claims would not be barred by sovereign immunity.but,even if the border patrol agents acted within the scope of their authority and the discretionary function exception applied,castro claims for false imprisonment,abuse of process,and assault would not be barred by sovereign immunity.the law enforcement proviso waives sovereign immunity for those claims.
generally,sovereign immunity bars suits against the government.ashford united states,cir.the federal tort claims act waives the government sovereign immunity for torts committed by its employees in circumstances where,if the government were a private person,the government would be liable under state law.martin halliburton,cir citations omitted see b.this general waiver of sovereign immunity is circumscribed by a list of exceptions in.ashford,at.pertinent to this appeal are the discretionary function and intentional tort exceptions.
under sovereign immunity is not waived when the claim is based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty the discretionary function exception or when the claim arises out of assault,battery,false imprisonment,false arrest,malicious prosecution,abuse of process,libel,slander,misrepresentation,deceit,or interference with contract rights the intentional tort exception.a h.the law enforcement proviso in h,however,provides an exception to these exceptions.see nguyen united states,cir sutton united states,cir see also h.the proviso waives sovereign immunity with regard to acts or omissions of investigative or law enforcement officers for any claim arising out of assault,battery,false imprisonment,false arrest,abuse of process,or malicious prosecution.h.if the law enforcement proviso applies,sovereign immunity is waived and the discretionary function and intentional tort exceptions will not bar a plaintiff claims for relief.nguyen,at effecting the plain meaning and clear purpose of the statutory language by concluding that sovereign immunity does not bar a claim that falls within the proviso to subsection h,regardless of whether the acts giving rise to it involve a discretionary function see sutton,at concluding that the discretionary function exception can not be an absolute bar which one must clear to proceed under the h law enforcement proviso.
monica castro alleged the following torts against the united states negligence,intentional infliction of emotional distress,false imprisonment,abuse of process,and assault.the district court correctly found that the law enforcement proviso applies to castro claims for false imprisonment,abuse of process,and assault.neither party contests that finding.because the law enforcement proviso applies,sovereign immunity is waived.the court has subject matter jurisdiction over these claims and the district court holding to the contrary is in error.
for these reasons and for the reasons stated by judge stewart,i dissent.

with undisputed knowledge of the united states citizenship of baby girl,border patrol agents in lubbock,texas,took into custody with her undocumented father,omar gallardo,when he was detained for removal.monica castro,united states citizen mother,pleaded with the border patrol to turn over her daughter and allow her to remain in the united states.castro also frantically sought to secure a temporary custody order in a matter of hours.but on the very same day that and gallardo were detained,and although gallardo did not have a custody order in his favor,the border patrol deported and gallardo to mexico.castro could not locate her daughter for the next three years.
the majority acknowledges the novel facts of this case,but minimizes their importance to the legal inquiry.the majority further erroneously applies the principles of rule b according to bell atlantic twombly,and ashcroft iqbal,and disregards the supreme court instruction to narrowly construe exceptions to waivers of sovereign immunity in the context of the sweeping language of the ftca.dolan postal,internal citations and quotation marks omitted.i therefore respectfully dissent.
on behalf of herself and,castro brought state law claims of negligence,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and false imprisonment against the united states under the federal tort claims act ftca.castro plausibly alleged that the border patrol exceeded the scope of its authority under the immigration and nationality act of ina,et,and the fourth and fifth amendments.the discretionary function exception to the ftca does not shelter against liability for unauthorized actions by government agents,yet the majority nonetheless applies the discretionary function exception without any inquiry into whether the border patrol agents acted in excess of their authority.in my view,the order granting the government rule b motion to dismiss based on the discretionary function exception should be vacated and the case remanded for an evaluation of whether the border patrol acted outside of its authority.
the ftca provides consent for suit against the united states for injury caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.b.one exception to the ftca is the discretionary function exception,a,the purpose of which is to prevent judicial of legislative and administrative decisions grounded in social,economic,and public policy united states gaubert.the discretionary function exception applies when the challenged government action involves an element of judgment or choice by a government agent and the choice is the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.id.at citing berkovitz united states.
the discretionary function exception does not protect the unauthorized acts of government agents.see berkovitz,at the discretionary function exception applies only to conduct that involves the permissible exercise of policy judgment.emphasis added truman united states,cir through the enactment of the ftca,the government has generally waived its sovereign immunity from tort liability for the negligent or wrongful acts or omissions of its agents who act within the scope of their employment.c ourts have read the supreme court discretionary function cases as denying protection to actions that are unauthorized because they are unconstitutional,proscribed by statute,or exceed the scope of an official authority.thames shipyard repair united states,cir internal citations omitted.this safeguard inherent in the discretionary function exception has been recognized by seven other circuits in addition to this circuit.see sutton united states,cir concluding that action by a government agent does not fall within the discretionary function exception of a when governmental agents exceed the scope of their authority as designated by statute or the constitution.despite the overwhelming weight of authority and our own precedent,the majority entirely ignores the principle that the discretionary function exception does not encompass unauthorized actions.
if the border patrol agents acted outside their scope of authority by violating constitutional rights,then those constitutional transgressions foreclose the protection of the discretionary function exception.a border patrol agent authority is also limited by statutory mandates,therefore any actions of the border patrol agents in contravention of specific provisions of the ina or other statutes preclude the application of the discretionary function exception.see gaubert,at if the employee violates the mandatory regulation,there will be no shelter from liability because there is no room for choice and the action will be contrary to policy.the majority errs by concluding that the discretionary function exception deprived the district court of jurisdiction and dismissing castro claims without an evaluation of whether the actions of the border patrol agents exceeded the scope of their authority.
whether the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the government conduct in this case is a question of law,subject to de novo review by this court.buchanan united states,cir internal citations omitted see also limone,at we afford de novo review to a district court determination that the discretionary function exception does or does not apply.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint need only contain sufficient factual matter to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.cornerstone christian schs.interscholastic league,cir citing twombly,at see also iqbal.at reiterating the twombly holding that a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.all factual allegations contained in the complaint must be accepted as true.iqbal.at.
the majority acknowledges that we have before us a rule b dismissal,but it erroneously concludes that castro has not met her burden under twombly and iqbal.to the contrary,based on the allegations contained in castro complaint,the border patrol agents actions in detaining and deporting implicate both statutory and constitutional concerns.the facts included in the particular the undisputed fact that the border patrol agents knew citizenship status and did not doubt that she was a united states a plausible claim that the border patrol agents exceeded the scope of their statutory and constitutional authority and their actions were therefore.
castro complaint alleged a plausible violation of specific constitutional mandates the fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure and the fifth amendment right to due process.see united states,explaining that the fourth amendment forbids stopping or detaining persons for questioning about their citizenship on less than a reasonable suspicion that they may be aliens hernandez cremer,cir observing that the right of a united states citizen to enter the country is a right which the fundamental law has conferred upon him and is a part of the liberty of which the citizen can not be deprived without due process of law under the fifth amendment.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.in her complaint,castro alleged the following 
defendant united states detention of plaintiff without due process violated her fourth amendment constitutional interest in remaining free from bodily seizure detention of plaintiff was not due to an act of wrongdoing that warranted detention nor was detention based on an emergency.the united states did not and can not show that seizure of the minor child was necessary to protect plaintiff health,safety and welfare indeed,defendant united states placed in imminent danger by deporting her with a man it knew was wanted in connection with a homicide.
plaintiff castro made a claim of citizenship to defendant united states on behalf of her minor child,plaintiff despite that claim,and despite defendant recognition of plaintiff status as a citizen,defendant united states intentionally,maliciously,and recklessly violated plaintiffs right to procedural due process guaranteed by the fifth amendment.
defendant united states willfully detained without her consent or the consent of her citizen parent,and the detention was without legal authority or justification from the moment defendant united states knew or should have known that was a citizen and that a citizen parent was present to take possession of her and did not release her,defendant united states had no legal authority or justification to continue its detention of the child.
castro complaint additionally alleged that the border patrol agents acted outside of their statutory grant of authority under the ina,averring that n o section of the ina provides authority for the united states to detain or remove a citizen.the border patrol is an agency of the department of homeland security,and subject to the ina.see.the ina scope is limited to regulating the entry of aliens,as well as their detention,removal,and naturalization.see,a,a,a.within this statutory grant of authority,border patrol agents have discretion in making determinations in matters such as the detention or removal of aliens illegally present in the united states.see,ins yang,explaining the broad ins discretion in determining who,among a class of eligible aliens,may be granted relief from removal.no statute grants border patrol agents the power to deport united states citizens,however,and the power of border patrol agents to detain united states citizens is quite limited.see a.nor do border patrol agents have statutory authority to make child custody decisions.johns dep t of justice,cir federal immigration authorities lack authority to determine custody of a child or to enforce the custodial rights of others.
despite the border patrol agents conceded knowledge of citizenship and castro plausible allegations of constitutional and statutory violations,the district court upon by the to address whether the border patrol agents exceeded their scope of authority.this crucial omission in the district court rule b analysis allows any actions taken by the border patrol agents in excess of their authority to nonetheless benefit from the protection of the discretionary function exception.the majority opinion therefore effectively bestows immunity from ftca liability upon even the most egregious constitutional and statutory violations by gov
