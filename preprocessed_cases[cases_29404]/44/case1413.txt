upon our review,we affirm the district court holding that the prison officials discretionary decision not to separate rich from his attackers is subject to the discretionary function exception of the ftca,depriving us of jurisdiction over that claim.however,with regard to rich claim that prison officials did not perform the searches properly,we remand for additional discovery because jurisdictional facts are intertwined with the merits of that claim.
in,the united states district court for the district of utah sentenced rich to years imprisonment for armed bank robbery,in violation of a and d,and for using and carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence,in violation of c.rich entered the custody of the bureau of prisons bop in september 
according to rich,he immediately was targeted in prison by a white supremacist group,the aryan brotherhood,for his refusal to follow that group rules and to participate in the group criminal schemes.although transferred frequently to different penitentiaries,rich contends that he was targeted continually by the aryan brotherhood and required separation from the group 
in february,rich was transferred to usp hazelton and,on august,five inmates attacked him in a recreation cage within the special housing unit shu.the attackers beat rich and stabbed him repeatedly.a knife measuring about nine inches in length was recovered from the scene rich suffered serious injuries and underwent numerous surgeries,including a bronchoscopy for respiratory failure,a laparotomy to repair a laceration to his liver,and surgery to repair the right atrium of his heart.
rich sued the united states under the ftca,alleging one count of negligence asserting that the prison officials had failed to protect him from harm.rich alleged that the officials should have kept him separated from his attackers,and that the officials failed to screen,wand,or search the inmates properly prior to placing them in the recreation cage.
the government moved to dismiss rich complaint on the basis that the discretionary function exception to the ftca,which limits the government waiver of sovereign immunity for certain kinds of discretionary conduct,applied both to the prison officials decision whether to separate rich from his attackers and to the manner in which the prison officials searched the attacking inmates.to support its position,the government included several exhibits with its motion to dismiss.these attachments included portions of rich prison file and declarations from the prison officials,who stated that they performed patdowns and searches properly on all inmates before the attack.the attachments also included various post orders in effect at usp hazelton on august,
the post orders relating to the shu require that an inmate hands be restrained behind his body whenever leaving his cell for recreation.additionally,the post orders state that inmates will be pat searched and screened with the handheld metal detector before entering and upon exiting the recreation cages.the post orders do not otherwise describe how a patdown should be performed.however,the bop program statement applicable to all prisons,including usp hazelton,provides that a ny pat search shall be conducted as outlined in the correctional services manual.moreover,according to the post orders,when an inmate has a prior history of weapons possession,prison officials must perform a visual search of the inmate,including a search of the inmate body cavities,prior to his entry into a recreation cage.
after reviewing these attachments,the district court agreed with the government that the discretionary function exception applied to the prison officials decisions regarding inmate separation and the manner in which the prison officials performed the patdowns and searches the court found that the post orders do not mandate a specific course of conduct for the officers to follow in performing the required searches.the court also concluded that the discretion afforded prison officials is consistent with the public policy of granting prison officials deference in implementing and executing their security measures.
the district court further concluded that rich was not entitled to any discovery regarding whether additional directives mandated a particular method for performing patdowns and searches.accordingly,the district court granted the government motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.this appeal followed.
on appeal,rich challenges the district court conclusion that the discretionary function exception applies to the prison officials conduct.he argues that the officials had a nondiscretionary duty to maintain and monitor both his prison files and the files of other inmates.rich contends that if the officials had taken these security measures,they would have known about rich history with the aryan brotherhood and the need to keep him separated from the group members.rich also argues that the post orders and other policies imposed mandatory directives that the prison officials search and patdown inmates prior to placing them in the recreation cage,thereby precluding application of the discretionary function exception.rich contends that,at a minimum,he should have been allowed the opportunity for discovery before the district court determined that the discretionary function exception applied.
in response,the government contends that the officials decision not to separate rich from his attackers,as well as the manner in which the searches were performed,are matters within the discretionary function exception.the government asserts that there are no directives governing the separation of prisoners or the proper procedure for performing patdowns and searches.the government argues that,therefore,the prison officials discretion in these areas implicates public policy considerations that justify application of the discretionary function exception.the government further asserts that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to grant rich discovery,because no additional information could be uncovered that would establish the district court jurisdiction.
