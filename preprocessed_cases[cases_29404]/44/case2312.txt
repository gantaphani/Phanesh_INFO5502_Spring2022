plaintiff richard taylor taylor,formerly a deckhand on the ann peters for teco barge line,teco,sued his former employer for damages,claiming exposure to coal tar left him with a permanent,severe skin reaction.after a jury awarded taylor one million dollars,teco brought this appeal.on appeal,teco asserts that the district court made three evidentiary errors,erred in denying its motion for a judgment as a matter of law,and erred in refusing to offer a jury instruction on the harmlessness of the chemical in question.additionally,teco argues that the jury verdict was excessive.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court judgment.
background 
factual background 
taylor began working for teco in october,and at that time he had no history of skin trouble.when he started at teco,taylor was assigned to the ann peters as an inexperienced deckhand.according to taylor,at some point in late or early,as part of his deckhand duties,he was instructed to enter the potable water tank and sweep the walls and floor.at trial,taylor testified that he was given no protective equipment in order to perform this task.when he emerged from the tank,he was covered with dust and noticed that he had developed a sunburn type rash on his skin.joint appendix at,trial,taylor test.at.
over the next several months,taylor rash continued to develop.the rash would get better when he disembarked from the ship and would worsen when he returned.as time passed,the rash began to spread up his hands to his arms.on march,taylor requested medical attention for the rash,which by now had advanced up his right arm.doctor simpson twice evaluated taylor during this period of time and diagnosed taylor with contact dermatitis.while sailing on november,the rash worsened,and taylor again sought medical attention.taylor thus began a long history of medical consultation and treatment.see at records of various medical consultations and treatments between and.despite medical attention,taylor rash continued to worsen according to taylor,it got to a point where my skin would get better when i got home.at taylor at.
in,teco directed taylor to return to the water tank.according to taylor,he and three other crewmen were instructed to enter the tank and remove all of the material coating the tank.in order to do their work,the crewmen were each fitted for a full face mask and a respirator,but taylor testified that they were provided with only a smaller face mask,safety glasses,and a tyvek paper suit.the crewmen work made the tank extremely dusty,a circumstance exacerbated by the use of a fan that blew air into the tank.according to taylor,it was so dusty that it was difficult for the crewmen to see.when taylor emerged from the tank,he was covered in black dust,including a coating of dust over his exposed skin taylor once again developed a reaction.taylor was not the only employee to react to the substance two of the other deckhands cleaning the tank also suffered chemical burns.david duane dubrock dubrock,teco safety manager,told taylor and the other deckhands that he suspected that the tank was coated with a substance called bitumastic.bitumastic is a sealant that contains coal tar,and coal tar is a known carcinogen that can sensitize skin.
after visiting numerous other doctors,in february,taylor began to see artis truett iii truett.a test on march,revealed that taylor had developed an allergy to coal tar.as truett testified in his deposition,which was admitted at trial i tested him to coal tar,which is suppose sic to with bitumastic.so,yes,i think he was allergic to the bitumastic and that caused him to break out in an itchy rash.at,artis truett depo.at.after trying various topical ointments,in january,truett prescribed phototherapy for taylor.taylor received at least phototherapy treatments,which were reportedly helping to reduce his rash.
procedural background 
taylor sued teco on february,and amended the complaint on march.he raised claims under both the jones act,et and general maritime law.the complaint alleged that teco was negligent in exposing him to bitumastic and that the ship was unseaworthy because of the presence of bitumastic.
on june,teco filed a motion in limine to exclude from evidence any material data safety sheets msds or data sheets regarding bitumastic that were dated after.teco argued that it purchased the ship in,and because the prior owners had applied the bitumastic to the ann peters tank,the bitumastic used may have been an older formulation.teco also claimed that the data sheets apply only to the application of bitumastic,not its removal,so the msds are irrelevant to taylor case.on august,the district court denied teco motion.the district court stated that the plaintiff correctly notes that the material safety data sheet msds is relevant to the safe removal of bitumastic.at,order.
on august,the trial began.just prior to voir dire,teco sought to exclude photographs of taylor skin condition that taylor took in march,which were provided to teco only the week before trial.teco claimed that it received the photographs too late for them to be admissible.specifically,teco argued that admitting the photographs would be prejudicial because teco did not have the opportunity to use the photos during the deposition of truett.the district court concluded that the photos were not prejudicial and admitted them over teco objection.
at the close of taylor case,teco asked for a judgment as a matter of law,which the district court promptly denied.
on august,the jury found teco liable under both the jones act and general maritime law for unseaworthiness.the jury awarded taylor one million dollars.the district court discounted the award to present value and awarded taylor.teco renewed its motion for a judgment as a matter of law and additionally requested a new trial or remittitur.the district court denied the motions,and teco filed this timely appeal.

admission of photographs 
on appeal,teco asserts that the district court made three evidentiary errors.the first alleged error is the district court admission into evidence of the march photographs that taylor took of his skin.according to teco,taylor disclosure of these photographs so soon before trial made them inadmissible.
when considering teco motions for a judgment as a matter of law or a new trial,the district court justified the decision to admit the photos while the photographs may be harmful to teco,the photographs still provided an accurate description of taylor skin condition at that time,and therefore,were not overly prejudicial.at,mem.op.at.in addition,the district court stressed that a t trial,teco had ample opportunity to show the photographs to the plaintiff expert,and question him about them.in addition,teco could have questioned its own expert about the photographs however,teco chose not to do so.id.although it is not clear to us that teco had the opportunity to question taylor witness,truett,regarding the photographs,we conclude that it was not an abuse of discretion to admit the photographs.furthermore,even if the district court did err in admitting the photographs,the error did not influence the outcome of the trial.
first,as the district court noted,the photographs were relevant and taylor deserved the opportunity to present an accurate depiction of his condition.furthermore,the challenged photographs were not the only images admitted into evidence during trial,taylor introduced pictures from september,in addition to the contested photos from march.although the photographs themselves are not in the record,the testimony suggests that both the uncontested photographs and the contested photographs document the inflamed condition of his skin on similar areas of his body.compare at taylor at discussing the photographs with at taylor at discussing the photographs.therefore,it is unlikely that admission of the photographs would have prejudiced teco because teco was already prepared to deal with the previously disclosed photographs.
second,although we disagree with the district court that teco had the opportunity to use the photographs to challenge truett testimony,we do not believe that the lack of opportunity to challenge truett with the photographs prejudiced teco.although the district court believed that teco could have challenged truett with the photographs,that would have been impossible given that truett gave a deposition on july,before taylor turned over the photographs in august.that said,we believe that it is unlikely that presenting the photographs to truett would have altered the outcome of the trial.teco believes that the photographs contradicted truett testimony that phototherapy was helping taylor,but truett,as taylor treating physician,was well aware of taylor condition.in his deposition,truett stated in no uncertain terms his thoughts on the phototherapy well it helped significantly.at july,artis truett depo.at.in addition,truett name appears on the phototherapy treatment forms,and truett was in charge of adjusting the dosage for the treatment.therefore,it seems unlikely that the march photographs would have altered truett testimony.in any event,teco could have easily challenged truett conclusions regarding the effectiveness of phototherapy through its own witness,as we will discuss next.thus,we conclude that presenting the photographs to truett would not have altered the outcome of the trial.
third,teco claims that the photographs were prejudicial because its witness was not allowed to testify about the photographs.teco,however,mischaracterizes the district court ruling because the district court never barred teco expert from addressing the photographs.the district court ruled that teco witness could not testify about an osha regulation,but teco attorneys never asked about the photographs.it is entirely possible that the district court would have allowed teco expert to testify about the photographs had teco attorneys asked.furthermore,teco expert was still able to express his doubts about the benefits of the phototherapy treatment 
the difficulty is that when i saw taylor today he does show really a significant improvement.his hands look pretty much the way they looked to me when i saw him last summer,and he told did ask him to take his clothes off,but he told that the rash on his arms and legs was pretty much the same as it always was.
at,trial,jonas kalnas test.at.thus,even without testimony regarding the photographs,which it may have been able to offer had it asked,teco was still able to present expert opinion regarding the effectiveness of taylor treatment.
fourth,teco claims that had it used the photographs after they were admitted over teco objections,teco would have waived its objections to the photographs.we conclude that this argument is lacking force.the supreme court has said that g enerally,a party introducing evidence can not complain on appeal that the evidence was erroneously admitted.ohler united states,d emphasis added.teco did not seek to introduce the photographs because taylor already introduced them thus,this waiver doctrine would not have applied to teco.accordingly,this argument lacks merit.
finally,we note that federal rule of civil procedure did not require the district court to bar the admission of the photographs.although taylor provided the photographs after the discovery period,it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to conclude that the omission was a small oversight,especially given that taylor had previously disclosed other photographs documenting the condition of his skin over the same set of body parts.
for these reasons,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the photographs.even if the admission of the photographs was error,the admission did not alter the outcome of the trial.
admission of material safety data sheets 
the second evidentiary error that teco alleges is that the msds are irrelevant and inadmissible because the bitumastic aboard the ann peters was applied sometime before.furthermore,teco alleges that msds are relevant only for the application of bitumastic,not its removal.we conclude that both of these arguments are without merit.
the data sheets are relevant.although only a msds would conclusively establish the chemical makeup of bitumastic,in the absence of any msds,more recent data sheets are suggestive as to the content of bitumastic.during the trial,taylor introduced numerous data sheets for bitumastic part a,and all of the data sheets were dated after.all of the sheets noted that bitumastic contained around coal tar and warned that bitumastic m ay be harmful if absorbed through the skin may cause skin burns.may cause allergic skin reaction.see,at,msds for bitumastic part a at.the data sheets also stated that they r ecommend impervious gloves,clothing and safety glasses with side shield or chemical goggles to avoid skin and eye contact.if material penetrates to skin,change gloves and clothing.hypersensitive persons should wear gloves or use protective cream.see,at,msds for bitumastic part a at.taylor also introduced data sheets for bitumastic part b,and those sheets also contained warnings such as may cause skin reaction.may cause allergic skin reaction.see,at,msds for bitumastic part b at.the part b msds also suggested that users take the same precautions as were suggested in the part a data sheets.the fact that all of the sheets are almost identical suggests that bitumastic has not changed very much since,which makes the more recent data sheets probative as to the content of bitumastic.
furthermore,teco own safety manager,dubrock,relied on an msds when taylor and the other crewmen suffered burns.although we do not know which data sheet dubrock used,he testified that there was essentially no difference between the various sheets 
q.you did think it was important whether it was this msds for bitumastic or that msds for bitumastic,because the risks are essentially the same 
they similar yes,sir.
at,trial,david dubrock test.at.this statement by one of teco own employees further underscores the relevance of any of the bitumastic data sheets,even the sheets.
likewise,the argument that the msds are relevant only for the application of bitumastic and not the removal is also unavailing.first,dubrock relied on the msds for bitumastic when two sailors were burned cleaning the water tank of a similar ship in.second,dubrock used a msds to tell taylor and the other injured crewmembers about bitumastic after they were burned during removal of the substance.thus,dubrock clearly believed that the data sheets were relevant for more than just the application of bitumastic dubrock even responded in the affirmative when asked if the best available information as to the health hazards involved with the removal of the product are the material safety data sheets at dubrock at.
dubrock belief that the data sheets are applicable to the removal of bitumastic is shared by carboline the manufacturer of bitumastic director of technical resources,dwayne meyer meyer.meyer stated 
there no government requirement to have anything specific for the removal of coatings.so the best thing that we always tell people is to follow the guidelines that are kind of set forth on the material safety data sheet for the application because that the scenario.
at,dwayne meyer depo.at.in addition,a doctor of environmental toxicology,doctor kenneth mark rudo rudo,testified that the chemicals that make a compound dangerous during its application often remain until its removal 
well,there there most certainly going to be vapors and volatiles that can come off once you start chipping away,and you banging at it and you breaking it up and it getting in the air and the dust is getting in the air,and,you know,it a confined space,and it might be hot in there,you know,you going to know,these chemicals are volatile.
at,trial,mark rudo test.at.
for these reasons,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted the data sheets.
denial of expert testimony on osha regulations 
the third and final alleged evidentiary error involves testimony regarding applicable osha standards.after taylor expert discussed osha standards,which teco argues were inapplicable standards,teco wanted its expert,kalnas,to testify about the correct osha standard.the district court responded that i f he has provided that opinion before that nothing that you were caught off guard on.and you known that for a long time.he ca give that opinion tomorrow.i think that is prejudicial.at,trial tr.at.the district court also noted that teco had advance notice that taylor expert was going to discuss the osha standard.see at,trial tr.at.elaborating on its denial,the district court,in response to teco motion for a new trial,stated that in both reports written by kalnas and filed by the defendant,neither report addressed kalnas opinions on those matters.the defendant made its motion to have kalnas address these matters.at mem.op.at.
the district court was correct that teco had at least eight months of notice that taylor was going to discuss osha standards.for example,on january,taylor filed his proposed jury instructions.proposed instruction number would have instructed the jury on a possible violation of,which is the provision dealing with procedures.given the advance notice that teco had,we can not say that the district court abused its discretion when it barred teco witness from testifying on the osha regulation.

sufficient evidence to support jury verdict 
a.the form of bitumastic 
teco claims that it deserved a judgment as a matter of law or a new trial because there was insufficient evidence to support a jury verdict.in support of this argument,teco points toward two ways in which the evidence was insufficient.first,teco claims that the evidence presented established that bitumastic is not dangerous in its dried state.
as we have already discussed in the context of the admissibility of the msds,rudo offered testimony that established that bitumastic is indeed dangerous in the dried state.in addition to that testimony,there was additional testimony establishing that coal tar,the main ingredient in bitumastic,is dangerous even in its dried state.for example,dubrock stated that regardless of which bitumastic product was used aboard teco ships,they all contain coal tar.rudo testified that coal tar contains many chemicals many of these chemicals,dozens of them are carcinogens,human carcinogens.dozens of them are mutagens.dozens of them are chemicals that can cause effects on the skin by sensitizing it.at rudo at.he then added,we know beyond a shadow of a doubt,there mean it says it in these sheets.it says it everywhere that people exposed to these chemicals that they can cause these kind of skin problems,you know,from exposure.so it sort is sort of an absolute thing.at rudo at.it is apparent that there is quite a bit of evidence contradicting teco assertion regarding bitumastic supposed safety in its dry form.
when we combine the apparent dangerousness of bitumastic with testimony indicating that teco suspected that there was bitumastic in the tank before teco ordered the cleaning,see at dubrock at,there was sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that teco was negligent.
b.the osha regulation 
second,teco claims that it deserved a new trial or a judgment as a matter of law because the evidence established that teco complied with osha standards.at trial,taylor presented testimony from roger wabeke wabeke,an industrial hygienist.wabeke mentioned the standard during his trial testimony,a standard that teco claims is inapplicable it was this testimony that led to teco claims regarding the district court decision not to admit its expert testimony,which we have already addressed.although wabeke initially mentioned the disputed standard,when asked to name a specific regulation that teco may have violated,wabeke did not discuss the disputed standard instead,wabeke mentioned,the standard for respiratory protection.according to wabeke,the regulation required teco to provide to taylor and the other crewmen entering the water tank level a personal protective equipment.at,
