section of title of the code also known as masha law provides a civil right of action in federal district court to victims of several federal crimes,including sexual exploitation of a child and various child pornography offenses.this case requires us to decide whether a restitution award for a criminal offense bars a civil claim by a victim under based on that same offense.because we find that permits such a claim,and collateral estoppel is not appropriate in this case,we will reverse the district court judgment dismissing the plaintiff complaint.we will also vacate the district court judgment setting aside a default entered against the defendant and remand for further proceedings.
background 
factual background 
plaintiff appellant jane doe formerly known as masha allen was adopted from russia by defendant appellee matthew alan mancuso when she was five years old.over the course of the following five years,mancuso sexually abused doe and documented the abuse in a series of photographs and videos.mancuso copied these media and distributed them through chat rooms on the internet in exchange for media documenting the sexual abuse of other children.mancuso photographs and videos became popular among viewers of child pornography and he was subsequently arrested after a law enforcement investigation identified him as doe abuser.following his arrest,a federal grand jury in the western district of pennsylvania returned a indictment against mancuso count one charged mancuso with sexual exploitation of a minor in violation of a and count two charged mancuso with possession of material depicting the sexual exploitation of a minor in violation of a b.
mancuso entered into a plea agreement.he agreed to plead guilty to count one of the indictment sexual exploitation and the government agreed to dismiss count two possession of child pornography.in the plea agreement,mancuso made several affirmations that would affect his sentence.he acknowledge d his responsibility for the conduct charged in count two of the indictment and stipulate d that the conduct charged in that count may be considered by the district court in imposing sentence.he also agreed to pay mandatory restitution to doe under the protection act,and in the amount of.
pursuant to the plea agreement,the sentencing court ordered mancuso to fully fund a trust for the benefit of doe in the amount of pursuant to title,united states code,sections a through,a and.sentencing tr.at,united states mancuso.
procedural history 
ten years after mancuso criminal conviction,on august,doe filed the present civil suit under against a purported class of defendants in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.doe named fourteen purported class representative defendants in her complaint,including mancuso,and alleged that each defendant had violated a predicate statute under doe sought damages against mancuso for his possession and distribution of child pornography depicting her 
on december,mancuso was served with process,but over the following nine months no counsel entered an appearance on his behalf and he did not file a responsive pleading.on september,the district court clerk docketed doe application for an entry of default against mancuso.the next day,the clerk entered a default against mancuso for failure to plead or otherwise defend.
following the entry of default,mancuso attorney was admitted pro hac vice to the eastern district of pennsylvania and promptly filed a motion for relief from default judgment and a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.mancuso argued that doe civil claim against him was barred by her prior receipt of restitution in his criminal case because the sentencing judge intended to fully compensate doe for both the convicted and dismissed charges in his indictment.the district court agreed and,finding that mancuso had a meritorious defense to doe suit,set aside the default entered against mancuso and granted his motion to dismiss.this appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction over doe civil suit under.we have jurisdiction over this appeal from the district court judgment dismissing doe complaint against mancuso under.given the unusual procedural posture in this action,we take this opportunity to explain our appellate jurisdiction under.
doe named fourteen defendants in her complaint,including mancuso.the district court dismissed one defendant with prejudice pursuant to a settlement,and dismissed all the remaining defendants except mancuso for lack of personal jurisdiction without a designation that the dismissals were with or without prejudice.in order to examine our appellate jurisdiction,we assume without deciding that the dismissals for lack of personal jurisdiction were without prejudice.
ordinarily,we do not have jurisdiction under of an appeal in which any defendant was dismissed below by the district court without prejudice.erie cty.retirees ass cty.of erie,cir.in such a case,the district court disposition of the case is not deemed sufficiently final within the meaning of because the plaintiff can her claim against the dismissed defendant.however,we have observed an exception to this general rule in a situation where a claim dismissed without prejudice can not be,such as a claim for which the statute of limitations has run.brennan kulick,cir.we have also observed an exception in a situation where a plaintiff renounces any intention to reinstate litigation on a claim dismissed without prejudice.tiernan devoe,cir.in these cases,the district court disposition of the case is final because we are satisfied that the dismissed claims will not be.
these exceptions fit well within the policies of,which we have observed to be minimizing the possibility of piecemeal appeals,according due deference to trial court judges,and promoting the conservation of judicial resources.aluminum of am.beazer,cir.if a dismissed claim will not be,there will be no further proceedings in front of the district court judge with respect to that claim and thus there is no possibility of a future piecemeal appeal and the attendant waste of appellate judicial resources.
in this case,the district court concluded that it lacked personal jurisdiction with respect to the dismissed defendants and doe indicated in supplemental briefing her belief that the district court dismissal operates to bar her from reasserting the dismissed claims in the district court.accordingly,doe has renounced any intention to amend her complaint in the district court with respect to her allegations of jurisdiction in pennsylvania against the dismissed defendants.see allegheny hosp.philip morris,cir.finding that a stipulation by parties filed after a notice of appeal rendered an earlier district court order final and appealable.doe also indicated at oral argument an intention to against the dismissed defendants in other courts in their home states in new actions.although doe did not renounce any intention to against the dismissed defendants,we see no meaningful distinction to be made for purposes of between a case where a claim will not be at all and a case where,as here,the plaintiff has represented to our satisfaction that she will not a claim in the district court at issue.
our conclusion finds support in our precedent.in beazer east,we held that 
where the effect of a district court decision is to accomplish all that the parties asked the court to accomplish,and where the parties agree there can not be and,by court order,there will not be any further proceedings in the district court as part of the same action,the district court decision must be considered final for purposes of.

other circuits have endorsed this principle as well.see hope klabal,cir.after the voluntary dismissal without prejudice,there was nothing left for the district court to resolve,and the suit had ended as far as that court was concerned,thereby creating a final judgment.am.bank trust of chi.equitable life assurance soc y of,cir.t he fact t hat the dismissal was without prejudice to filing another suit does not make the cause unappealable,for denial of relief and dismissal of the case ended this suit as far as the district court was concerned.second alteration in original quoting united states wallace tiernan,de tie orange,cir.concluding that an order dismissing an action without prejudice was final for purposes of appeal because t he action was over as far as the district court was concerned.
in assessing whether we have appellate jurisdiction,we give a practical rather than technical construction.bethel mcallister,cir.internal quotation marks omitted quoting carr am.red cross,cir.here,doe stipulation that she will only the dismissed claims in other actions in other courts satisfies us that the district court proceedings in this case are concluded and will not be reinstated.see beazer,at a n appellate court must determine whether,at the time it is examining its jurisdiction,there remain unresolved issues to be adjudicated in the district court.as such,the policies underlying are not implicated there is no risk of further proceedings on the dismissed claims in front of the district court and thus no risk of this court hearing piecemeal appeals from the district court proceeding 
thus,we conclude that the district court disposition with respect to the dismissed defendants in this action is final within the meaning of and permits us to hear doe appeal 
we exercise plenary review over the district court order dismissing doe complaint for failure to state a claim.rea federated inv rs,cir.in our review,we accept all factual allegations as true,construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,and determine whether,under any reasonable reading of the complaint,doe may be entitled to relief.id.as a judgment setting aside an entry of default is within the district court discretion,we review that judgment for abuse of discretion.united states in currency,cir.
iii.analysis 
we first examine the text of and its place in congress remedial scheme for child victims of sex crimes.we then address whether collateral estoppel is applicable to doe claim finally,we turn to the default entered against mancuso in the court below.
section and congress remedial scheme 
in construing a statute,we are guided by the principle that every exercise of statutory interpretation begins with an examination of the plain language of the statute.rosenberg xm ventures,cir.when the statutory language is unambiguous,our inquiry is complete and we ordinarily do not consider statutory purpose or legislative history.ex rel.durrell lower merion sch,cir.in such a case,only in the rare circumstances where a literal application of the statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters or where the result would be so bizarre that congress could not have intended it is further inquiry warranted.in re segal,cir.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
the operative provision of provides 
any person who,while a minor,was a victim of a violation of section,c,or of this title and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation,regardless of whether the injury occurred while such person was a minor,may sue in any appropriate united states district court and shall recover the actual damages such person sustains and the cost of the suit,including a reasonable attorney fee.any person as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained damages of no less than in value.
a the language of the statute makes clear that the civil right of action it provides is available to any person who,while a minor,was a victim of a violation of a predicate statute resulting in personal injury.
we faced a similar question of statutory interpretation in united states alcan aluminum,cir.in that case,the federal government had entered into a consent decree with a group of defendants involving the cleanup of a parcel of land containing hazardous materials.id.at.the government later entered into another consent decree with a second group of defendants involving the cleanup of that same site.id.at.the trustees of the parcel of land,on behalf of the first group of defendants,moved to intervene under cercla in the government second suit.id.the relevant provision of cercla provided 
in any action commenced under this chapter or under the solid waste disposal act in a court of the united states,any person may intervene as a matter of right when such person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action may,as a practical matter,impair or impede the person ability to protect that interest 
id.at quoting i.
the government,citing legislative history,contended that intervention was limited to persons who sought to raise health or environmental concerns.id.at.in rejecting that limited construction of the statute,we observed that the plain language of the intervention provision did not so limit or qualify the right to intervene.id.at.we expressed doubt that congress would have used the phrase any person may intervene or any action under this chapter if it had intended to restrict intervention to only those persons raising a particular,but unidentified,claim.id.
similarly here,the text of in no way limits the availability of the civil right of action to cases in which a victim has not been compensated in the past by a restitution order.we therefore find the statute to be unambiguous for our purposes.doe boland,cir.rejecting an argument that was not intended to cover an expert witness creation of child pornography images because the words congress chose in offer no basis for drawing this kind of line,and it is not our place to second guess the judgment congress put into law.
looking beyond the text of the statute here to limit the statute application is not appropriate where allowing a civil action under to a child victim of a sex crime after her receipt of criminal restitution can not fairly be labelled a bizarre result.in fact,such a construction of is consistent with congress remedial scheme for child victims of sex crimes.the procedures governing the award of mandatory restitution under provide any amount paid to a victim under an order of restitution shall be reduced by any amount later recovered as compensatory damages for the same loss by the victim in any federal civil proceeding j they further provide a conviction of a defendant for an offense involving the act giving rise to an order of restitution shall estop the defendant from denying the essential allegations of that offense in any subsequent federal civil proceeding brought by the victim.id.l.
with these provisions,congress not only contemplated that a victim who had received restitution could file a subsequent civil action,but also provided procedures for that very situation.these provisions ensure that a victim will not have to the conduct forming the basis of a criminal conviction in a subsequent civil action and a defendant will not be required to pay double damages for the same loss if a subsequent civil action is successful.we can conceive of several reasons for congress determination that a victim who has already received restitution should be permitted a subsequent civil suit.
congress may have wanted to give victims a chance to prove a higher level of damages than that which a sentencing court found during a limited factfinding proceeding as part of sentencing a victim participation in a sentencing court determination of restitution is limited to conferring with the government,id.d,submitting information to a probation officer,id.d a vi,or potentially providing testimony at the sentencing court discretion,id.d a subsequent civil action allows a victim to fully litigate the question of her damages to achieve compensation for the full amount of her damages.and it allows a victim the opportunity to prove those damages in front of a jury a procedure that is unavailable in the context of criminal restitution in sentencing proceedings,id.e.see const.amend.vii curtis loether,the seventh amendment applies to actions enforcing statutory rights,and requires a jury trial upon demand,if the statute creates legal rights and remedies,enforceable in an action for damages in the ordinary courts of law.
the opportunity for a victim to fully litigate the question of her damages in a civil action is even more important for those victims who choose not to participate in a sentencing court determination of restitution.see g no victim shall be required to participate in any phase of a restitution order.by permitting a later civil suit,congress may have wanted to shield victims from participating in the criminal sentencing of their victimizers while the victims are so close in time to the damaging effects of the offense.this concern is particularly acute in child pornography cases as victims are children who have often suffered horrific abuse and,as such,it may not be desirable to have them participate in a sentencing proceeding section statute of limitations protects such children by providing an extension in cases where a victim is still a minor when the statute of limitations would otherwise have run.stephens clash,cir.see b.
civil actions,such as that provided in,also allow a victim to recover additional categories of damages not compensable as part of restitution.for example,a civil action allows a victim to recover for damages,such as pain and suffering or mental and emotional distress,which may not be available under the restitution statutes.see united states berk,supp,me.expressing doubt that the mandatory restitution provision in was intended to permit restitution for pain and suffering melanie reid curtis collier,when does restitution become retribution.
certainly congress could not have intended in providing a remedy the opposite situation where was only available to victims who had not previously received restitution.section provides for mandatory restitution to victims of the crimes codified at,see a,which are all predicate offenses listed in as forming the basis for a civil claim,see a.if we accept the district court conclusion that an award of restitution bars a claim under,then we would render nothing more than a dead letter with respect to those predicate offenses.united states jersey shore state bank,cir.
nor is our construction of the statute demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters.in re segal,at internal quotation marks omitted quoting taylor freeland kronz,cir.at oral argument,counsel for mancuso suggested that congress intended to be available only to those victims who had yet to receive payment in satisfaction of a prior criminal restitution award.however,mancuso has pointed to no legislative history or other statutory provisions that evince such an intent.moreover,it is unlikely that congress could have reasonably concluded a victim would be more successful in obtaining satisfaction of a civil judgment than a criminal restitution order.see a permitting a district court to revoke a defendant probation or term of supervised release,resentence a defendant,hold a defendant in contempt of court,enter an injunction against a defendant,or order a sale of property of a defendant in order to obtain compliance with a restitution order.
an examination of the legislative history of does not provide any clear insight into whether congress intended the civil right of action in to be available to victims who had already received criminal restitution.congressional findings at the time of enactment describe a lack of effective remedies under federal law for exploitation victims.child abuse victims rights act of,pub,stat.however,these findings were made prior to congress enactment of,which provided mandatory restitution for the full amount of a victim losses to victims of the child pornography predicate offenses listed in.b.
statements by legislators at the time of recent amendments to similarly do not speak on this question,but suggest that the law general purpose is to provide both compensation to child pornography victims and a measure of deterrence to possessors and distributors of child pornography.see cong.rec.daily ed.july,statement of gingrey currently,a person who illegally downloads music faces penalties in civil court that are three times as harsh as a person who downloads child pornography.this horrible inequity was the inspiration behind the introduction of masha law see also cong.rec.daily ed,statement of kerry this legislation increases the civil penalties recoverable by victims of child sexual exploitation,including internet child pornography,to at least.this increased penalty will serve as a deterrent to those who disseminate and possess child pornography,as well as a means of compensating victims of this terrible abuse.we are satisfied that our construction of the statute to allow a victim who has received criminal restitution to bring a civil suit furthers these goals.
we therefore hold that permits a victim to bring a civil claim for the violation of a predicate statute even where that victim has previously received criminal restitution for the same violation of that statute for her purported full damages 
collateral estoppel 
collateral estoppel prevents the of a factual or legal issue that was litigated in an earlier proceeding.when examining the preclusive effect of a prior federal court determination,we apply federal law principles of collateral estoppel.see paramount aviation agusta,cir.collateral estoppel is appropriate where the identical issue was decided in a prior adjudication there was a final judgment on the merits the party against whom the bar is asserted was a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication and the party against whom the bar is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in question.river port auth.fraternal order of police,cir.internal quotation marks omitted quoting bd.of trs.of trucking emps.of jersey welfare fund,centra,cir.as doe was neither a party to mancuso prior criminal proceeding nor in privity with a party,and did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the question of her damages,we will not apply collateral estoppel to prevent doe from litigating the question of her damages based on mancuso criminal conduct 
since doe was not a party to mancuso criminal sentencing proceeding,collateral estoppel will only be appropriate if she was in privity with the government.we assess privity under the rubric laid out by the supreme court in taylor sturgell.see nationwide mut.fire ins.george hamilton,cir.a nonparty will be found to be in privity with a party to a proceeding where 
the nonparty agrees to be bound by the determination of issues in an action between others 
a substantive legal relationship,traditional privity exists that binds the nonparty 
the nonparty was adequately represented by someone with the same interests who wa s a party 
the nonparty assumes control over the litigation in which the judgment is rendered 
the nonparty attempts to bring suit as the designated representative of someone who was a party in the prior litigation or,
the nonparty falls under a special statutory scheme that expressly foreclos es successive litigation by nonlitigants.
id.at second and fourth alterations in original quoting taylor,at.doe is not in privity with the government under the two categories of privity applicable to this case category three and category six.
the interests of a victim and the government in a restitution determination are not sufficiently similar for a finding of privity.a victim interest in the context of restitution is undoubtedly to achieve the maximum amount of compensation for herself permissible under the law.a victim such as doe may be willing to assume the time and cost to litigate the full extent of her damages in a trial as doe has chosen to do in her civil suit.by contrast,the interests of the government in the restitution context are necessarily affected by its responsibility to represent the interest of society as a whole.ferri ackerman,see,berk,supp.at noting an obvious conflict between the position of two victims and the government in briefing before the court with respect to whether the mandatory restitution provision in contains a proximate cause requirement for compensable losses.
accordingly,the government has an interest in securing a plea agreement that is palatable to the defendant in order to avoid a lengthy and costly criminal trial in which it may not prevail and an interest in achieving speedy punishment for the purpose of deterrence.see brady united states,for the state there are advantages the more promptly imposed punishment after an admission of guilt may more effectively attain the objectives of punishment and with the avoidance of trial,scarce judicial and prosecutorial resources are conserved.these are not necessarily interests that the victim shares.see nationwide,at under the adequate representation exception,the interests of the party and nonparty must be squarely aligned.
these varied interests are balanced by the government as it decides whether to accept a plea agreement with a given amount of restitution and render the government necessarily less interested in litigating extensively to have mancuso pay the maximum amount of restitution permissible under the law the effect of these varied interests are particularly acute in the present situation as the child victim in this case had a limited ability to advocate on her behalf and instead relied on a restitution amount that was derived from a plea agreement negotiated between mancuso and the government.
nor can we find privity based on a conclusion that or the restitution statutes expressly foreclose a subsequent civil claim under once a victim has received criminal restitution.as we explain above,the text of does not contain any indication that its application is limited to those victims who did not previously receive restitution.and,far from expressly foreclosing subsequent civil claims,the restitution laws expressly contemplate such claims.see j id.l eeoc steel,cir.if congress did not believe that the individual claim would be adequately pressed by the eeoc,it would surely have preserved the individual right to bring suit either during or after the eeoc suit.
under the final factor of the collateral estoppel test,doe did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the question of her damages in mancuso sentencing proceeding.during sentencing,the government is the party that advocates for its desired level of restitution.see e.as doe was not a party to the prior criminal sentencing proceeding,she had a limited opportunity to influence the process.as we explain above,doe participation in the restitution process was limited by to conferring with the government,providing information to a probation officer as to the extent of her losses,or providing testimony to the sentencing court only if the sentencing court determined that such testimony was warranted.see united states brown,cir.t he victim is not a party to a sentencing hearing and therefore has only a limited ability to influence the outcome.the victim can not control the presentation of evidence during the sentencing hearing and is not even guaranteed the right to testify about the extent of his losses.there were no other provisions of the restitution statutes that permitted doe to influence the sentencing court restitution decision.see united states stoerr,cir.
we remain mindful of the fact that,at its core,collateral estoppel is an equitable doctrine.see jean alexander cosmetics,usa,cir.thus,in addition to the test for collateral estoppel,we recognize the equitable exceptions to the general rule of collateral estoppel codified in the restatement second of judgments.passenger.pub.util.comm n,cir.relevant for our purposes is the equitable exception that applies where t he party against whom preclusion is sought could not,as a matter of law,have obtained review of the judgment in the initial action.restatement second of judgments.in this case,doe was not able to obtain appellate review because she was not a party to the criminal proceeding during which mancuso was ordered to pay restitution see stoerr,at brown,at.despite the fact that doe may have believed,as she argues here,that the restitution award of did not compensate her for her full losses,she was not permitted to appeal the sentencing court award to this court and thus can not be bound by its determination.
under the facts of this case,where the interests of doe and the government were not squarely aligned,she had a limited ability to participate in the determination of her restitution in front of the sentencing court,and she had no ability to seek appellate review of that determination,we are of the firm belief that the application of collateral estoppel would simply be inequitable and would offend the historic tradition that everyone should have his own day in court.nationwide,at internal quotation marks omitted quoting richards jefferson.for these reasons,and because the collateral estoppel test and exception set forth above counsel against the application of the doctrine,we will not apply collateral estoppel to bar doe claim.
relief from entry of default 
a judgment setting aside the entry of default is within a district court discretion,in currency,at,and may only be made for good cause,fed.civ.c.in exercising that discretion and determining whether good cause exists,we have instructed district courts to consider the following factors whether the plaintiff will be prejudiced whether the defendant has a meritorious defense and whether the default was the result of the defendant culpable conduct.in currency,at.
the district court rested its judgment setting aside the entry of default against mancuso solely on the finding that mancuso had a meritorious defense specifically,that the prior criminal restitution award barred doe present civil claim.the district court did not address whether doe would be prejudiced by a vacatur of default or whether the default was the result of mancuso culpable conduct.given that we find doe claim is not barred by the prior criminal restitution award,and the district court made no additional findings with respect to its vacatur of default for us to review,we will vacate the district court judgment and remand to the district court for consideration anew of whether there is good cause for setting aside the default entered against mancuso.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we will reverse the judgment of the district court dismissing doe complaint against mancuso,vacate the judgment of the district court setting aside the default entered against mancuso,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
