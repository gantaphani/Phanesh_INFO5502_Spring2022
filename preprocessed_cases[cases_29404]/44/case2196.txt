after freda susan mowbray mowbray had served nine years in prison for her husband murder,her conviction was set aside,whereupon,under and state law,she sued the county that had jailed her and the three prosecutors,three police officers,and the county lab technician who had participated in her trial she also sued her husband heirs to regain the proceeds from his life insurance policy.the district court dismissed all of mowbray claims but one,against officer george gavito.
mowbray appeals several.b dismissals and a summary judgment based on prosecutorial immunity,absolute witness immunity,and qualified immunity,and a dismissal based on res judicata.gavito appeals a denial of summary judgment based on qualified immunity.we affirm the dismissals and summary judgment that mowbray challenges,but we reverse the denial of summary judgment to gavito and render judgment for him.
one night in september,mowbray was lying in bed with her husband,bill mowbray,when he was shot.mowbray claimed that her husband had committed suicide at least twice before,he had attempted suicide,once by shooting himself.bill mowbray car dealership was on the brink of failure,and apparently he had vowed to kill himself rather than face jail for tax evasion or commercial fraud.
estelle mauricio,a reserve deputy sheriff,was the first to arrive at the residence after the shooting.she testified that she found the deceased still alive,shot through the head,and lying on his left side with the bed covers pulled up to his shoulder.the bullet had entered the right side of his head,exited the left,and wounded his left hand,which was under his head with a pillow between his head and left hand.his right hand was lying across his chest under the bed covers.no blood or brain matter was on his right hand,and mauricio never saw his hand being washed at home or in the hospital.lieutenant george gavito of the cameron county sheriff department also was present at the scene.
dahm,who conducted the autopsy,stated that if the deceased had shot himself,there would have been blood and brain matter covering his right hand,fingers,and forearm.finding no blood,dahm concluded that the death was a murder.
mowbray was considered a suspect.in early october,steve robertson,a lab technician at the texas department of public safety dps,met with police officer mentford dusky hesskew to discuss the theory that mowbray had killed her husband.hesskew was principally employed by the austin police department but also taught classes at the dps academy on high impact spatter.hesskew performed a luminol test on the nightgown mowbray wore that night to detect the presence of blood.because luminol reacts to substances other than blood,luminol tests are only presumptive in nature.
on november,robertson and hesskew met with prosecutors benjamin euresti and edmund cyganiewicz and reported that the nightgown had tested positive for blood.on november,robertson conducted two confirmatory blood tests on the nightgown,both of which were negative.at the habeas corpus proceedings,he explained that the negative results could have resulted from the excessive testing the nightgown had already undergone.the tests for the gunshot residue could have destroyed the protein in the blood,and the chemicals sprayed to detect lead residue could have diffused or dissolved the red stains.robertson never reported these negative results to the district attorneys,hesskew,or mowbray defense counsel.
the prosecution asked herbert macdonnell,an expert on blood spatter,to examine mowbray nightgown.on november,macdonnell told euresti and cyganiewicz that he had found no indication of blood stains or high velocity impact spatter of the sort that would have been present had mowbray shot her husband while wearing a nightgown.he concluded that if mowbray had shot her husband,she was not wearing a nightgown at the time.
cyganiewicz,euresti,gavito,mauricio,and assistant district attorney luis saenz prepared a of the shooting scene.the did not alter macdonnell conclusions that he had listed in his report.on december,macdonnell discussed his report with gavito and stated that he thought mowbray had shot her husband while she was naked.the only record of macdonnell statement comes from gavito deposition testimony.macdonnell report was made available to mowbray defense counsel ten days to two weeks before trial.
on december,mowbray was indicted for murder.at trial,the prosecution offered hesskew and robertson testimony that blood was found on the nightgown neither side called macdonnell.mowbray was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.after her petition for writ of habeas corpus was granted and the conviction was set aside,see ex parte mowbray,she was acquitted at a second trial.
mowbray sued cameron county,three prosecutors,three police officers,and a county lab technician,alleging conspiracy to violate her civil rights,false imprisonment,malicious prosecution,abuse of process,slander,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.she also sued jeanne,james,and margo mowbray to regain the proceeds of her husband life insurance policy.

mowbray argues that the district court erred in extending absolute immunity to euresti,cyganiewicz,and saenz,whom she accuses of shopping for experts,laboring to sell these experts on their theory,and rejecting the leading authority in the field and instead selecting an expert who perpetrated junk science.mowbray also complains that the prosecutors did not turn over exculpatory evidence to the defense until ten days before trial.
under,prosecutors are entitled to absolute immunity for acts performed as advocates of the state.imbler pachtman,d.for acts of investigation or administration,prosecutors are entitled to only qualified immunity.buckley fitzsimmons,d.absolute immunity extends to a prosecutor actions preliminary to the initiation of a prosecution and apart from the courtroom.id.at.quoting imbler,at.this includes a prosecutor decision on which witnesses to call and what other evidence to present,imbler,at,and an effort to control the presentation of a witness testimony,buckley,at.quoting imbler,at.alteration in original.
all the acts mowbray lists involve the prosecutors choosing expert witnesses,preparing those witnesses for trial,and performing the state trial duties.because these acts fall under the protection of absolute immunity,the district court did not err in dismissing suit as to them.
although mowbray argues that the court erred in failing to address her slander claim under,she has not alleged facts sufficient to state a claim.she asserts that after meeting with macdonnell,euresti opined that he was now confident that he could get an indictment.mowbray never avers that this comment or any other deprived her of a constitutional or other federal right she states only that she was publicly humiliated and subjected to scorn and ridicule during the investigative phase of the prosecution and that she was put through an emotionally damaging trial.such allegations do not state a claim under.
mowbray contends that the court erred in dismissing her claims against hesskew and robertson for conspiracy to commit perjury and violation of a duty under brady maryland,d,to disclose exculpatory evidence.although witnesses are entitled to absolute immunity against suits based on their testimony in a criminal trial,briscoe lahue,d,it is less certain whether the rule of briscoe extends to claims that a witness entered a conspiracy to commit perjury.
of the eight circuits that have addressed the issue,seven have extended absolute witness immunity the second circuit stands alone in reaching a contrary conclusion 
we find the reasoning of the majority of circuits persuasive.as a matter of logic,a person may not be prosecuted for conspiring to commit an act that he may perform with impunity.house,at.hesskew and robertson can not be liable under for conspiracy to commit perjury where grants them absolute immunity for that act
