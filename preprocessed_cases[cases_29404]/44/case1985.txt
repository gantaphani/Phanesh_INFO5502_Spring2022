this case stems from an between diane oak,a vessel now owned and operated by teco barge line,and a wharf owned by dow chemical company dow.the allision caused severe damage to the wharf.consequently,diane filed a petition for limitation of liability dow countered by filing a claim in the limitation proceeding seeking recovery of the damages sustained from the allision.thereafter,diane oak brought suit in rem against three other vessels on the river that morning and in personam against related interests,alleging that those vessels had so embarrassed her navigation as to be contributory and proximate causes of the allision and thus deserving of some liability for the damages incurred by dow.
after a bench trial solely on the question of liability,the district court found that the diane oak was solely at fault for the allision.diane oak timely appeals contending that the district court erroneously applied a presumption of fault against her erroneously relied on the last clear chance doctrine to excuse negligence on the part of the other vessels and failed to properly apply controlling principles of proximate causation and comparative fault amongst all of the vessels.finding no reversible error,we affirm.
background 
on the morning of march,four vessels traveling on the mississippi river converged on mile point.two of those vessels,the diane oak and the gotland spirit were headed south,down the river.the other two,the ginny stone and the donau were headed north,up the river.it is undisputed that all four vessels safely passed mile point.it is also undisputed that the diane oak allided with the dow wharf two miles and nearly sixteen minutes downriver from mile point.
in this case,the district court determined that as the lead southbound vessel,diane oak was the privileged vessel and thus had the over each of the other three vessels.second,the court determined that with this privilege,the diane oak was under a concomitant obligation to give instructions to the other vessels as to the manner and place of meeting and passing.see inland navigation rule a ii,a a vessel operating in narrow channels and proceeding with a following current shall have the over an vessel,shall propose the manner and place of proper passage,and shall initiate the maneuvering signals as appropriate.emphasis added.citing diane oak failure to adequately direct the traffic in this area that morning and to give adequate and timely instructions on the place and manner of passing,the district court identified diane oak failure to adhere to her duties as the lead southbound vessel as the primary problem in this allision.
specifically,the district court faulted diane oak for allowing gotland spirit to overtake her so close to the point with both vessels traveling at high speeds.according to the court,this created a situation where gotland spirit became the privileged vessel and allowed gotland spirit to keep ginny stone on the point for a port to port passing,instead of the starboard passing diane oak arranged with ginny stone,as well as allowing gotland spirit to direct traffic and permit donau to come up to the point.similarly,the court also faulted diane oak for miscalculating the speed and location of the various vessels,an error that caused all four vessels to come up on the point around the same time and that,according to the district court,could have been avoided had diane oak held ginny stone below the point or communicated earlier with donau and held her up below the point.
the district court then turned its attention to the conduct of the other vessels,stating that their liability,if any,boils down to two relatively simple factual issues to be resolved.the first being,whether or not any neglect or fault that did occur on the part of the ginny stone nobra gotland spirit had anything to do with proximately causing the allision that later occurred.the district court answered this first question in the negative,and in so doing relied on the testimony of diane oak pilot,captain couey,in which he being impeached with his prior deposition he had all the chance in the world to successfully navigate mile point but for the actions of donau.thus the district court held that 
in all probability,regardless of what had gone on up until that the action of the donau coming upriver,the upriver tanker,captain couey would have safely navigated the point despite the fact that the ginny stone was right on the point and despite the fact that nobra gotland spirit had come downriver at what the diane oak claims was too fast a speed and passed her too close to the point.that passing had occurred and it obvious to me that the diane oak at that point had plenty of room to clear that point.
in essence,then,the court found that even assuming arguendo that both gotland spirit and ginny stone were in some respects at fault,that fault would only be fault in the abstract to the extent it was neither a contributory nor proximate cause of the subsequent allision.
the second question for the district court was whether the northbound donau embarrassed the navigation of diane oak,with its fault thereby being a contributory and proximate cause of the subsequent allision with dow wharf.in answering this question,the district court examined the evidence supporting captain couey claim that,as he was trying to navigate around mile point,the northbound donau passing starboard to starboard had initially moved to the west bank to allow her room to pass,but then for some unexplained reason suddenly veered back directly at the stern of diane oak tow.
the district court explicitly rejected couey testimony on this score 
i just find not credible that testimony because it seems to me that,first of all,if the donau and the diane oak had passed within feet of each almost reach out and touch distance between these two there would have been a lot of excited utterances,a lot of noise,a lot of racket,or screaming over those vhf radios.there would have been bells and whistles and emergency signals.you would have expected there would be something i did see and i did hear that makes me believe the passing was not nearly that close.
the court thus concluded,so i think the preponderance of the credible evidence is that the passing,although perhaps closer than would be an ideal situation,was certainly not feet and was probably more like somewhere between and feet away and the actions of the did not embarrass the navigation of the diane oak or her tow and was not a proximate cause of the subsequent allision.having thus resolved the two factual disputes,the court concluded that the sole fault in the allision was the negligence of the diane oak.diane oak timely appeals.
ii.analysis 
the standard of review for a bench trial is well established findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and legal issues are reviewed de novo.furthermore,this court reviews a district court findings of fact regarding the respective fault,if any,of each of the four vessels and whether they were contributory and proximate causes of the allision for clear error 
the diane oak challenges both the district court findings of fact and conclusions of law on appeal.specifically,diane oak contends that the district court erroneously applied the oregon presumption of fault against her erroneously relied on the last clear chance doctrine to excuse negligence on the part of the other vessels and failed to properly apply controlling principles of proximate causation and comparative fault.we address each contention in turn.
a.the oregon 
diane oak first contention on appeal is that the district court erroneously applied the presumption of fault announced in the oregon,against her and thus in favor of the three other vessels applying this presumption of fault was error,she contends,because the oregon rule should apply only in favor of the damaged stationary object and therefore is inapposite given the facts at hand where liability is uncontested as between the damaged stationary object and the alliding vessel and the only question beyond the extent of damages sustained by the stationary object is liability for the allision as between the navigating vessels.
