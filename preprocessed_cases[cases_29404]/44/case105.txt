some years ago,appellant mark hansen served as a vice president of wilcox industries wilcox before striking out on his own and founding his own company,advanced life support technologies,alst.although his departure may have been amicable at first,it did not remain so for long.wilcox sued hansen in the new hampshire district court for,allegedly,poaching its customers and spreading false,damaging information about its products.
hansen,who had not purchased liability insurance to cover his new business,found himself with the prospect of funding his legal defense and satisfying any judgment against him.necessity being the mother of invention,hansen hit upon an ingenious solution to his conundrum or so he thought.he demanded that wilcox insurer,appellee sentry insurance company sentry,defend and indemnify him against his former employer claims.sentry declined,and this coverage action followed.
although hansen crafts some creative arguments,a da vinci he is not.we conclude sentry does not owe any duty to defend or indemnify hansen against wilcox claims.accordingly,we affirm the district court grant of sentry motion for summary judgment.
background 
because the contours of our analysis are governed in large part by the allegations in wilcox november,complaint against hansen the underlying complaint,we set forth those allegations,supplemented as necessary with uncontested evidence adduced during discovery in the underlying litigation.
wilcox is a new hampshire corporation that designs,manufactures,and sells tactical equipment to the united states military and other federal and local government agencies.one of the products it has manufactured over the past is a breathing apparatus think of scuba gear used on land originally referred to as scout but known today as patriot.according to the underlying complaint,patriot utilizes technology and offers features not available in competing products.
hansen entered the picture in,when wilcox hired him as a consultant.he began working directly for wilcox in march of,and served as one of wilcox vice presidents until leaving wilcox employ on june.as a vice president,hansen had access to confidential information regarding wilcox development of the patriot,along with knowledge of wilcox current and potential customers,and its marketing strategies.he also signed a nondisclosure and nonsolicitation agreement in which he agreed that he would not disclose wilcox confidential information,including all tangible and intangible trade secrets,proprietary information,inventions,discoveries,processes,methods,formulas,and the like.
although their relationship ceased in june,hansen involvement with wilcox continued,as wilcox hired him and alst as consultants.in this role,hansen was expected to market patriot to potential new customers and provide support and training to patriot customers.wilcox also paid him to attend internal meetings regarding the patriot.his consulting role again provided hansen with access to wilcox confidential and proprietary information,up to the time he and wilcox parted ways in february.as the underlying complaint puts it,during this time hansen referred to himself to wilcox customers as president of alst,and marketed his own products and company to these customers.
the gravamen of the underlying complaint is wilcox claim of unfair competition against hansen.according to the underlying complaint,hansen used his knowledge of wilcox trade secrets and proprietary information to develop his own competing breathing device,shield,which he based on wilcox technology and unique product features.hansen then began selling shield through alst.more than that,wilcox claims,hansen used his knowledge of wilcox customer base to go out and,essentially,steal wilcox customers.the underlying complaint specifically alleges that hansen signed a contract with the los angeles county sheriff department for the manufacture and sale of shield,despite his knowledge that wilcox had been in the middle of marketing patriot to that very department.wilcox goes on to assert that this is not the only example of hansen unfair competition.
the underlying complaint sets forth a panoply of counts against hansen and alst breach of contract breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing common law and statutory unfair competition misappropriation of trade secrets breach of fiduciary duty unjust enrichment and intentional interference with contractual relations.count viii is especially significant to the insurance coverage issues we address here,as it states that hansen is making harmful false statements about wilcox and its technology while marketing his own products to wilcox customers.
wilcox filed the underlying complaint on or about november.hansen tendered his defense to wilcox insurer,sentry,which insured wilcox under a commercial general liability policy effective from november,to november,the policy.sentry denied coverage on march.sentry said it did not have to defend or indemnify hansen because among other reasons the policy only covered hansen during the time he was a wilcox officer or employee,while the underlying complaint sought to recover damages wilcox suffered after june,hansen last day as a wilcox employee.hansen did not immediately pursue his coverage claims request against sentry.
discovery proceeded in the usual course,and wilcox ceo,james teetzel,was deposed on june.hansen counsel asked teetzel about the dates on which hansen made false and disparaging statements about wilcox,and teetzel initially responded with uncertainty.but after some questions,teetzel testified hansen absolutely made derogatory statements about wilcox and its products during the time hansen served as vice president.teetzel also testified that wilcox filed suit against hansen in part because of these statements,but primarily because of hansen disregard to trade secrets that wilcox owns.
during the course of his deposition,teetzel detailed hansen personal business activities.teetzel testified that hansen formed alst during the time he worked for wilcox,and that through alst hansen sold other products that are completely unrelated to the patriot line.these unrelated products included things like jump bottles for skydiving and oxygen consoles for holding oxygen for it like a large reservoir of oxygen for skydivers to jam before they jump out of an aircraft.according to teetzel,alst logo is a guy jumping out of a plane,and on at least one occasion while on wilcox payroll or as a consultant he showed up with that logo that he has on his shirt.
armed with teetzel deposition testimony,hansen renewed his coverage demand on august.hansen said that this testimony now made him eligible for insurance coverage,as it showed wilcox was actually claiming that he made derogatory statements about wilcox during the course of his employment there.sentry disagreed and again denied coverage.key to its denial this time was its position that hansen still failed to qualify for coverage because,in making such disparaging statements,hansen was not carrying out his duties as an executive officer of wilcox or otherwise acting on wilcox behalf or to further its interests.
sentry continued denial precipitated this suit.grounding federal jurisdiction on diversity pursuant to,hansen seeks a declaration under state and federal law that sentry owes a duty to defend and indemnify him with respect to the underlying complaint.he also asserts that sentry denial of coverage constitutes a breach of contract.
after dismissing the state law declaratory judgment claim as untimely,the district court concluded that hansen does not qualify as an insured given the nature of the allegations against him,and granted sentry motion for summary judgment.this appeal followed 
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
the parties,quite rightly,do not dispute that the substantive law of new hampshire applies to the coverage issues in this diversity case.see energynorth natural gas,century indem,cir applying new hampshire law.neither party argues that this matter involves a federal question.
in new hampshire t he interpretation of insurance policy language is a question of law,town of londonderry mun.ass property liability ins.trust,and engenders de novo review on appeal,ross home ins,internal quotation mark omitted the interpretation of insurance policy language is ultimately a question of law for this court to decide.to the extent the district court made factual findings,we defer to them unless they are lacking in evidential support or tainted by error of law.raudonis ins.of north america,quoting gelinas metropolitan prop.liability ins.
timeliness of the action 
the parties expend significant energy arguing over whether the district court erred when it dismissed hansen declaratory judgment count as.under new hampshire law,a declaratory judgment action to determine insurance coverage must be filed within months after the filing of the writ,complaint,or other pleading initiating the action which gives rise to the question.see.ann.iii.
hansen admits that he failed to file his coverage action within six months of the underlying complaint.however,and necessarily conceding the correctness of sentry initial denial of coverage,he claims to fall within an exception to the limit because the facts giving rise to the coverage dispute were not known to,or reasonably discoverable by him until teetzel testified that hansen made disparaging statements about wilcox while a vice president.see id.providing that the limitations period shall not apply where the facts giving rise to such coverage dispute are not known to,or reasonably discoverable until after expiration of such month period.hansen then argues that this action is timely because he filed suit within a reasonable time after teetzel deposition.see binda royal ins,imposing requirement that action be filed within a reasonable time frame after discovery of facts giving rise to coverage dispute.sentry argues that even if the coverage dispute did not become apparent until teetzel deposition,hansen was not reasonable in waiting almost six full months after the deposition to file suit 
we decline to decide this issue,as hansen coverage claim fails on its merits in any case.accordingly,we will simply assume that hansen complaint was timely under new hampshire law and proceed from there.
coverage analysis 
policy language 
to set the stage for the rest of our discussion,we begin with a of the policy language relevant to this appeal.
the policy is an occurrence policy effective november,through november.see policy declarations.the sole named insured is wilcox.id.the policy defines the term you to mean the named insured only,commercial general liability coverage form.insured is broader though,and includes the named insured along with its executive officers and directors,but only with respect to their duties as your,wilcox officers or directors,section ii d.thus,pursuant to the policy plain and unambiguous language,hansen is insured by the policy only with respect to his duties as a wilcox vice president,and only up through the date of his termination,june.
we must also determine whether any of the policy specific coverages may apply to the allegations in the underlying complaint.hansen contends sentry owes a duty to defend him pursuant to coverage b,personal and advertising liability.we have reviewed the underlying complaint and the policy,and we concur that this is the only potentially applicable coverage.coverage b provides,in pertinent part 
a.we will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of personal and advertising injury to which this insurance applies.we will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking those damages.however,we will have no duty to defend the insured against any suit seeking damages for personal and advertising injury to which this insurance does not apply 
b.this insurance applies to personal and advertising injury caused by an offense arising out of your business but only if the offense was committed in the coverage territory during the policy period.
policy,coverage b emphases added.
notably,the policy first refers to liabilities of the insured,which as we established above includes wilcox executive officers in certain circumstances.however,the policy goes on to immediately limit coverage b to personal and advertising injury arising out of your business.recalling that the policy reference to you means wilcox only,this qualifying language unambiguously establishes that coverage b is only available when a wilcox officer,in the course of his duties for wilcox,becomes liable for personal and advertising injury arising out of wilcox business.
but what exactly is personal and advertising injury the policy defines it as 
injury,including consequential bodily injury,arising out of one or more of the following offenses 
oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person or organization goods,products or services 
policy,section v 
having gone through the provisions important to our analysis,we can move on to address hansen specific coverage arguments.
ii.framing the issues 
hansen alleges that the underlying complaint,when coupled with teetzel deposition testimony,triggers sentry duty to defend him.in his view,he qualifies for coverage because wilcox alleges that it was damaged,at least in part,by hansen actions while he was a vice president,thereby rendering the policy applicable,and the alleged acts were undertaken with respect to his duties as a vice president,meaning that he falls within the definition of an insured.in insisting that the alleged statements were made during the policy period,hansen relies on teetzel deposition testimony in which teetzel stated as much.
with respect to his second point,hansen argues it is theoretically possible that he could have made statements that harmed wilcox while he was fulfilling his duties as a vice president.by way of example,he posits that wilcox underlying complaint could have been alleging that hansen,during a visit to one of wilcox customers,was servicing the patriot and marketing his own products that did not compete with wilcox products while making one of the alleged harmful false statements.under this scenario,hansen believes that any harmful statements he may have made would have been in connection with his duties as vice president.he also suggests that any misrepresentation can only have been negligent,as he does not believe he ever made any harmful,false statements about wilcox.
for its part,sentry first contends that the underlying complaint alleges that hansen only made disparaging statements after he left wilcox employment.it then argues that teetzel deposition testimony is equivocal and,therefore,does not establish that hansen made disparaging statements during his service as vice president.in the absence of alleged damages occurring during the policy period,sentry asserts,the policy does not apply to any of the alleged acts,and there is no duty to defend or indemnify.
should this not carry the day,sentry goes on to argue that even if we conclude that hansen is alleged to have made derogatory remarks while working for wilcox,the crux of the underlying complaint is wilcox claim that hansen intentionally breached his fiduciary duties as a corporate officer.according to sentry,hansen willful misconduct eliminates all possibility that he was acting with respect to his duties as a wilcox vice president when he disparaged wilcox and its products.and,because the policy covers corporate officers only with respect to their duties as officers of wilcox,sentry would have us find that wilcox allegations of intentional misconduct relieve it of its duties to defend and indemnify hansen in the underlying litigation.
we discuss these arguments in turn.
iii.did any alleged damages occur during the policy period 
we must first address sentry argument that wilcox failed to allege hansen made disparaging statements about it or its products during the time of his employment.given that hansen only potentially qualifies for coverage while he worked for wilcox,this issue is potentially dispositive.
our review of the record indicates that the evidence in this regard is not.although the underlying complaint does
