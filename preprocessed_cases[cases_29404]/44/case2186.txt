claude swope and his wife brought this suit alleging that he was rendered totally and permanently disabled by lung damage caused through his inhalation of ozone during his employment as a maintenance worker by columbian chemicals company columbian.columbian is in the business of manufacturing carbon black with a process that involves the use of ozone.columbian purchased and operated ozone generators manufactured by emery industries,emery.henkel petrochemicals,henkel is emery successor corporation and subject to liability for harm to persons caused by emery defective products.
under the swopes allegations of facts,swope lung damage resulted from hazardous characteristics of the emery ozone generators which made them unreasonably dangerous in design and unreasonably dangerous for lack of an adequate warning of those hazards.the swopes allege that columbian knew to a substantial certainty that its continual exposures of swope to harmful amounts of ozone without providing him with any respiratory protection would cause repeated damage to his lungs.accordingly,the swopes sued for damages against henkel under allegations raising products liability theories and against columbian for intentional torts or batteries.the district court granted motions for summary judgment by columbian and henkel rejecting all of the swopes claims,except that their products liability claim for design defect was dismissed voluntarily without prejudice to its refiling in the event of reversal of the summary judgment in favor of henkel on appeal.
the questions raised by the swopes appeal from the district court summary judgments against them are does this court have appellate jurisdiction if so,can the swopes tort action against columbian survive a motion for summary judgment because of a genuine dispute as to whether columbian intentional tort of battery caused swope lung damage is the swopes products liability action against henkel under louisiana revised statute because emery,the manufacturer of the ozone generators,performed a construction of an improvement to immovable property if the swopes product liability action is not time barred under louisiana revised statute,can it survive a motion for summary judgment because henkel failed to carry its burden of showing that columbian knew or reasonably should have been expected to know of the dangerous characteristic of the emery generator that caused damage to swope 
after reviewing the defendants motions for summary judgment de novo,we reverse and remand the case for further proceedings.
jurisdiction 
on february,the district court entered an order granting summary judgment to,and dismissing all claims against,columbian.on february,plaintiffs filed both a notice of appeal from the district court february ruling and a motion to designate the february order in favor of columbian as final under federal rule of civil procedure b.on february,the trial court entered partial summary judgment in favor of defendant henkel,and dismissed all claims against henkel except for plaintiffs claim for defective design.the same day,the district court denied the swopes rule b motion to designate the court february ruling as final.
on april,plaintiffs filed a rule a stipulated motion to dismiss the remaining claim against henkel and a motion to designate both the february and the february orders granting summary judgment as final pursuant to.b.the plaintiffs also filed a second notice of appeal on both grants of summary judgment.the plaintiffs stipulated motion to dismiss was qualified.the dismissal was to be with prejudice if the trial court summary judgment ruling in favor of henkel was affirmed on appeal,and without prejudice if the district court was reversed.on may,the district court entered an order dismissing without prejudice the remaining claim against henkel also on that day,the district court granted plaintiffs second rule b motion and expressly designated the february and february summary judgment rulings as final judgments 
on appeal,columbian filed a motion to dismiss for lack of appellate jurisdiction,arguing that appellate jurisdiction is defective because appellants notice of appeal preceded the trial court designation of its summary judgment decisions as final.henkel has filed a motion making essentially the same arguments.the swopes have filed memoranda in opposition,and henkel has replied.
this court jurisdiction is limited by,which authorizes appeals from final decisions of the district courts.hence,as a general rule,all claims and issues in a case must be adjudicated before appeal,and a notice of appeal is effective only if it is from a final order or judgment.there are exceptions,of course,and one such exception is found in paul mercury insurance fair grounds in that case,this circuit held that a premature notice of appeal is effective if rule b certification is subsequently granted.here,the swopes filed a notice of appeal at the same time they filed for rule b certification.since the swopes rule b motion was subsequently granted the rule in paul mercury insurance controls and appellate jurisdiction is proper.
appellees argue,however,that paul mercury insurance is inconsistent with united states cooper and firstier mortgage investors mortgage ins.firstier involved a plaintiff who had filed a notice of appeal close to a month before entry of judgment,but after a bench ruling on the same claims.firstier held that federal rule of appellate procedure a permits a notice of appeal from the final judgment only when a district court announces a decision that would be appealable if immediately followed by the entry of judgment.
in cooper,the fifth circuit relied on firstier to hold that no appellate jurisdiction existed where a plaintiff purported to appeal from a magistrate report and recommendation,even though the district court subsequently entered final judgment in so holding,it disapproved the line of cases,which had held that the circuit can consider a premature appeal where judgment becomes final prior to disposition of the appeal though cooper did not discuss paul mercury insurance,it stated that to the extent that our prior cases allowed appeal of decisions,they are no longer good law 
cooper does not abrogate paul mercury insurance is not an en banc opinion,and firstier decided in is not an intervening decision paul mercury insurance was decided in.hence,the cooper panel can not have overruled paul mercury insurance moreover,the logic of cooper is not inconsistent with that of paul mercury insurance.paul mercury insurance may be limited to the rule b scenario,because rule b was created specifically to avoid piecemeal appeals and to create finality for appeal cooper,on the other hand,applies to orders that become final through means other than a rule b motion and arguably it may apply only in the more limited situation where the order purportedly appealed from can never be a final decision.in any event,it is unnecessary to decide today the exact scope of cooper,since it does not conflict with paul mercury insurance,by which we are bound.
we observe that finality in this case was not created by the filing or granting of the stipulated motion that purported to be a rule a dismissal of the remaining claim against henkel hence,the trial court granting of the rule b motion was not superfluous and paul mercury insurance controls.
it is a settled rule in the fifth circuit that appellate jurisdiction over a order can not be created by dismissing the remaining claims without prejudice.this rule originated in ryan occidental petroleum,in which a district court granted a defendant motion and dismissed the majority of plaintiff complaint in order to appeal,the plaintiff obtained an order dismissing without prejudice his remaining substantive claims against the appellees but the plaintiff did not file a rule b motion to designate the earlier ruling as final the ryan court found it lacked appellate jurisdiction because a dismissal without prejudice can not be regarded as terminating the litigation between the parties.in the absence of rule b certification,the trial court rulings were held to lack finality under 
the ryan rule is employed by three of our sister circuits but two circuits have adopted a rule directly contrary to that of ryan in addition,three circuits have adopted a sort of middle way that requires them to evaluate cases on an individual basis perhaps because of these widely varying approaches,the merits of the ryan rule were discussed extensively in the eleventh circuit opinion of state treasurer barry there,a majority of the court defended the eleventh circuit maintenance of the ryan rule while judge cox,in a special concurrence,urged en banc reconsideration of the rule.
as ryan and other courts have stated,a party seeking to create finality through dismissal without prejudice of remaining claims must file for rule b certification with the trial court this permits a trial court to control its docket and make an independent determination whether an appeal is warranted under the circumstances of the case judge cox approach,which would grant parties automatic right of appeal where they dismiss all remaining claims without prejudice,is dubious for relying on the deterrents to party manipulation further,any factors which make an appeal meritorious,and which support the argument for appeal as of right,are properly within the cognizance of the trial court in deciding a rule b motion.
hence,the ryan rule requiring rule b certification to create finality will not prevent an appeal where one is warranted.this is especially so since the abrogation of ryan other rule that rule b certification is only to be granted in the infrequent harsh case.the fact that the denial of a rule b certification is reviewable for abuse of discretion is additional insurance.
the seventh and the ninth circuits have adopted an rule that allows jurisdiction as long as the parties have not intended to manipulate the system however,here we agree with judge cox and reject the practice of combing the record for manipulative intent since it waste s resources better spent on the merits of an appeal.ryan rule is therefore preferable as it fosters predictability and streamlines review 
in short,ryan means that finality was created when the district court granted the swopes rule b motion,and paul mercury insurance means that appellate jurisdiction is proper because,although the swopes filed a premature notice of appeal,the orders appealed from were subsequently deemed final pursuant to rule b.
ii.intentional tort 
columbian is not entitled to summary judgment dismissing the swopes suit against it for damages based on intentional torts or batteries.there are genuine issues as to the material facts that columbian knew to a substantial certainty that it was continually causing swope bodily harm by exposing him to dangerous amounts of ozone without providing him with any respiratory protection.
many of the principal facts are undisputed.claude swope was employed by columbian from march until several days after his final inhalation of ozone on july.columbian continually required swope to breathe ozone without protective respiratory equipment throughout his nine years and some months of employment.columbian in this manner repeatedly caused him and other employees to breathe levels of ozone high enough to cause them respiratory discomfort,choke ups,nausea,headaches,and chest pains.on at least three occasions,employees other than swope had passed out from breathing too much ozone and had been taken to hospital emergency rooms or given oxygen on the plant premises.many other times,employees had to flee the immediate vicinity in which they were working because the ozone level had become intolerable.in fact,from the deposition testimony,it appears that the only safety instruction columbian ever gave to swope and his fellow employees for dealing with such levels of ozone was to vacate the area of excessive concentration of ozone,get some fresh air,and return to work when feeling better.thus,swope was aware that columbian continually required him to breathe high levels of ozone,but he was not aware that his inhalation of the ozone was damaging his lungs.it is not disputed for purposes of the motion for summary judgment,however,that columbian continual exposures of swope to ozone caused him to sustain repetitive damage to his lungs.swope physician,doctor thomas callendar,declared in an affidavit that he had diagnosed swope to suffer injury from frequent exposures of ozone and other toxic substances over a period of years during the course and scope of his employment at columbian.according to doctor callendar,swope injury occurred due to repeated exposures to ozone,not solely as a result of his last date of exposure on july.therefore,the only question presented at this stage of the proceedings is whether there is a genuine issue as to whether columbian knew to a substantial certainty that its deliberate continual exposures of swope to such levels of ozone without respiratory protection were causing him to sustain repetitive physical impairments to his bodily condition.
in order to recover from swope employer in tort,the plaintiffs must demonstrate that their action falls within the intentional tort exception to the exclusive remedy rule of the louisiana workers compensation act.the act provides that e xcept for intentional acts the rights and remedies granted to an employee or his dependent on account of a injury,or compensable sickness or disease for which he is entitled to workers compensation benefits shall be exclusive of all other rights,remedies,and claims for damages the act also provides that nothing shall affect the liability of the employer,or any officer,director,stockholder,partner,or employee of such employer or principal to the liability,civil or criminal,resulting from an intentional act.
the louisiana supreme court held in bazley tortorich,that under section of the workers compensation act the words intentional act mean the same as intentional tort in reference to civil liability.observing that the word intent has generally accepted meaning in the fields of tort and criminal law,the court held that t he meaning of intent is that the person who acts either consciously desires the physical result of his act,whatever the likelihood of that result happening from his conduct or knows that that result is substantially certain to follow from his conduct,whatever his desire may be as to that result.
in caudle betts,the court held that when an employee seeks to recover from his employer for an intentional tort,a court must apply the legal principles of general tort law related to the particular intentional tort alleged in order to determine whether he has proved his cause of action and damages recoverable thereunder.the court in caudle also adopted and reaffirmed the definition and principles of law set forth in the louisiana jurisprudence and the restatement second of torts concerning the intentional tort of battery 
a harmful or offensive contact with a person,resulting from an act intended to cause the plaintiff to suffer such a contact,is a battery.the intention need not be malicious nor need it be an intention to inflict actual damage.it is sufficient if the actor intends to inflict either a harmful or offensive contact without the other consent 
the original purpose of the courts in providing the action for battery undoubtedly was to keep the peace by affording a substitute for private retribution.the element of personal indignity involved always has been given considerable weight.consequently,the defendant is liable not only for contacts that do actual physical harm,but also for those relatively trivial ones which are merely offensive and insulting.
the intent with which tort liability is concerned is not necessarily a hostile intent,or a desire to do any harm.rather it is an intent to bring about a result which will invade the interests of another in a way that the law forbids 
bodily harm is generally considered to be any physical impairment of the condition of a person body,or physical pain or illness.the defendant liability for the resulting harm extends,as in most other cases of intentional torts,to consequences which the defendant did not intend,and could not reasonably have foreseen,upon the obvious basis that it is better for unexpected losses to fall upon the intentional wrongdoer than upon the innocent victim 
in louisiana,b attery does not require direct bodily contact between the actor and the victim.the contact may be with an inanimate object controlled or precipitated by the actor,such as the surgeon scalpel,a bullet or even a thrown hamburger.the victim need not be aware of the contact when it occurs.consequently,the swopes,by alleging that columbian frequently exposed swope to excessive levels of ozone that it knew to a substantial certainty would be harmful to his health,stated a valid cause of action in battery against columbian.
rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure allows the court to enter summary judgment in favor of the moving party only if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.the moving party has the burden of demonstrating clearly that there is no genuine issue of fact moreover,the evidence presented at the hearing on the motion must be considered in the light most favorable to the opposing party,and he must be given the benefit of all inferences that might reasonably be drawn in his favor 
when the nonmovant would bear the burden of proof at trial,however,the moving party can make a proper summary judgment motion in reliance on the pleadings and the allegation that the nonmovant has failed to establish an element essential to that party case rule e then would require the opposing party to go beyond the pleadings and to designate specific facts showing there was a genuine issue for trial however,t he burden on the nonmoving party is not a heavy one the nonmoving party simply is required to show specific facts,as opposed to general allegations,that present a genuine issue worthy of trial.
in the present case,the swopes satisfied this requirement by introducing the countervailing evidence discussed below.columbian had been provided material safety data sheets msds regarding ozone for at least ten,and probably twenty,years prior to swope disability.the msdss dated april,and april,state,inter alia,danger ozone is a highly toxic,irritant gas may be fatal if inhaled may cause damage to the lungs,respiratory system,and eyes do not get in eyes,on skin,or on clothing.do not breathe gas or vapor.use only with adequate ventilation.wash thoroughly after handling.keep away from combustible materials.the msds also contained the following warnings concerning long term exposure to various concentrations of ozone 
effects of prolonged,low level ppm exposure are not well defined however,scarring and thickening of small air passages may result in chronic lung disease.in addition,people with existing lung disease may show earlier and more severe symptoms when exposed to ozone.an increased susceptibility to lung disease and infection may also occur symptoms usually begin with a sensation of tightness in the chest on deep inspiration and discomfort under the breastbone uncontrollable coughing spasms develop with prolonged exposure.
the swopes introduced deposition testimony demonstrating columbian knowledge that it was requiring swope and other employees to inhale dangerous levels of ozone without protective equipment.bobby jordan,columbian general plant manager,and richard bianchi,columbian maintenance supervisor,former project engineer,and b witness,testified that columbian knew during swope employment that inhalation of ozone could be fatal to workers and damaging to their lungs.
the swopes presented evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that columbian was forewarned that it was exposing swope and other employees without protection to concentrations of ozone.on july,thomas mcquiston,an industrial hygienist on behalf of the international chemical workers union,local,warned columbian of the danger of ozone damage to workers in the columbian plant.mcquiston report,based on his august,tour of the plant,described to columbian the effects of excessive ozone exposure and specifically warned columbian that workers complaints of ozone exposure indicated that the enclosed systems are not adequately designed maintained to provide adequate protection against exposure and that a preventative maintenance program should be implemented to assure potential leaks in the system are prevented.emphasis added.his report to columbian stated that excessive ozone exposure could result scarring and thickening of the small air passages and could result in chronic lung disease and noted that w orkers have complained of symptoms related to ozone exposure.mcquiston report also warned columbian that c hronic exposure tends to decrease a worker ability to sense the presence of ozone although s ome workers can detect the ozone odor down to ppm,chronically exposed workers have not been able to sense the presence of ozone at ppm three times the osha limit.a year before swope last ozone exposure,columbian was again warned that it was exposing its employees to harmful levels of ozone.on june,laurence durio of durio consulting services,an industrial hygiene consulting group,advised columbian that the short term exposure limit for ozone was parts per million.with that as a basis for comparison,the report concluded,excessive ozone concentrations were found around the ozone generators and the number two ozone treater in columbian plant,which would likely translate into excessive employee exposures.emphasis added.moreover,bianchi admitted that despite several surveys and recommendations made by the workers union to install equipment,columbian did not purchase or install any ozone monitors until after swope final inhalation on july,he added that the monitors were removed soon afterwards because they constantly sounded alarms indicating excessive concentrations of ozone in the plant.in this regard,bianchi stated,y ou ca ca walk outside the building without it sounding whether you in here in this office or anywhere else.the swopes also introduced the december,report of joseph wood,an industrial hygienist and safety professional certified by both the american board of industrial hygiene and the board of certified safety professionals,who concluded that columbian purposely disregard ed the health of their employees by allowing them to be exposed to potentially harmful concentrations of ozone.emphasis added.wood evaluated swope accident in light of existing osha compliance issues and based his conclusions on the absence of ongoing ozone monitoring programs,the absence of historical data showing that monitoring was not necessary,the findings of multiple industrial hygienists that ozone levels exceeded permitted limits during normal operations,the knowledge that maintenance activities involve higher levels of ozone containment,and the absence of point source ozone monitoring at the generators prior to opening.
furthermore,the swopes introduced other evidence from which it reasonably may be inferred that columbian knew that swope and other employees were being bodily harmed by their unprotected exposures to ozone.bianchi testified that columbian knew that union members at its plant had complained about exposures to ozone.ozone leaks,according to bianchi,could occur once a month,sometimes once a week.in fact,bianchi,himself,admitted to having been exposed to ozone,and,over the course of his thirty years of employment,bianchi said the smell of ozone has always been there.swope fellow mechanic and relief foreman russell salkowitz testified during his deposition that everyone complained about ozone exposure.salkowitz claimed that at least percent of the plant had bad whiffs of ozone causing headaches,upset stomach,and chest pains.salkowitz further testified that he had been exposed to ozone in the plant a couple of hundred times.plant foreman david self also recounted his own exposures to ozone,causing him coughing spasms,and estimated that operators at the plant had a choke up from ozone exposures once a day or once a week.self further testified that sometimes ozone exposure became so pervasive and intense that the whole plant had to be shut down.depositions taken from columbian employees leonce boudreaux and curtis shoop corroborated the testimony of salkowitz,swope,and self,regarding the frequency of worker exposure to ozone.boudreaux testified,s ometimes it was strong enough where you could,you know,really go in there the plant and work on the generators.when asked how many times shoop had inhaled ozone in his work at columbian,he replied,it can not be numbered a bunch.
bianchi testified that he knew of at least one case in which an operator got sick and was taken to the emergency room because of inhaling or coming into contact with ozone.boudreaux testified that he now suffers from headaches that he did not have before he worked at columbian.boudreaux also testified that he missed work because of ozone exposure but that his absences were not recorded.boudreaux recounts that one night when he arrived at work the ozone smell was so strong that it pervaded the entire parking lot.when boudreaux began work that night,the union president called and told them they needed to clear up because the ozone was too strong.that night when boudreaux went home,he suffered a migraine headache lasting through the entire next day,vomited,and did not return to work the next night.curtis shoop,another columbian employee,testified that he has had coughing and gasping episodes from ozone and that he witnessed a,tommy comeaux,collapse on the job as a result of ozone exposure.van adams testified that as a result of ozone exposure he experienced nausea and a tightness in his chest.swope testified that he knew of two other columbian employees,mike chauvin and harry johnson,who had been taken to the hospital because of ozone exposure.
swope testified that columbian never informed him of the characteristics of ozone,its chemical properties,or the danger of lung damage from excessive ozone exposure.he stated that columbian gave him no special handling instructions regarding ozone,even though he was constantly exposed to the gas emitted by the generators during his work.swope described the employees exposures and columbian attitude and response to their painful or distressing inhalation of ozone as follows 
we were constantly exposed working on the generators on know,quite often basis.we know,it seems like they could have schooled us a little,or maybe went over some material data sheets on this chemical to let us know the severity of it and maybe supplied us with,you know,protective,personal protection equipment,properly handled the situation.and it were exposed to ozone on a routine basis,and they took it like it was no big deal.if you breathe some,they would suggest,you know,you go outside and get some fresh air know,if you exposed to it,get out and breathe some fresh air and then go back to work several people complained know,complained about it t wo other people were exposed to it and had to be sent to the emergency room.not on a particular piece of equipment i was working on,but in operations they were exposed to the chemical and had to be treated for it in emergency.one of them spent the night in the hospital,and i not sure of the treatment of the other fellow.it seemed like that would have sent some warning flags off to further educate your employees about the severity of the chemical that you had the possibility of being exposed to.
shoop,self,and van adams corroborated swope testimony and stated that columbian never warned its employees that chronic ozone exposure could be fatal and cause permanent lung damage.
columbian officers,bianchi and jordan,admitted that the company had refused to monitor ozone levels during swope employment,despite osha regulations requiring it to report ambient ozone levels of over grams per cubic meter.and,because of columbian lack of monitoring and testing of air quality,bianchi conceded that he could not say whether columbian was in compliance with osha.according to jordan,columbian had fewer than five breathing apparatuses to meet the needs of one hundred twenty shift workers,and these remained stored in a shed three hundred yards away from the ozone generator buildings.
columbian supported its motion for summary judgment with the affidavit of its general manager,bobby jordan,who stated in conclusory fashion that columbian did not subjectively intend swope alleged injuries to result from the work tasks assigned to him and that columbian was not substantially certain that swope injuries would follow from performing the assigned work tasks although jordan did attest that he had personal knowledge of the matters in his affidavit,he did not state what,if any,underlying facts within his knowledge enabled him to reach those conclusions.jordan only statement clearly based on his direct personal knowledge was that he did not observe harmful or toxic exposure to plant employees on a routine basis,nor was he aware that other columbian employees observed such exposures.yet in his final statement jordan admitted that in any situation in which,through upset,there have been any kind of exposures,columbian chemicals always took action to make them as short as possible by terminating the cause of the incident and taking appropriate remedial action.moreover,in his deposition jordan did not profess to be very knowledgeable about ozone at the plant.he instead deferred to bianchi to answer questions concerning ozone hazards and safety.bianchi,on the other hand,who was designated as columbian b witness and who was best qualified to answer questions regarding the operations and maintenance of the ozone generators by virtue of his years of experience with the company,did not at any time during his two depositions deny that he and columbian knew to a substantial certainty that columbian had continually exposed swope and other employees to bodily harmful concentrations of ozone during the period of swope employment.
consequently,considering all of the evidence of record it is clear that a reasonable jury could find that columbian knew to a substantial certainty that it was continually exposing swope to high levels of ozone without affording him the protection of any respiratory safeguard and that his direct inhalations of such large quantities of ozone would do gradual,but definite and repeated,bodily harm to him.at the very least,there is a genuine issue as to whether columbian knew to a substantial certainty that its activities would cause a physical impairment of the condition of swope body or cause him pain or illness.under louisiana law,in order to prove a battery,it is not necessary for the plaintiff to show that a tortfeasor desired to do any harm or even that the defendant knew to a substantial certainty the full extent of the bodily harm that would result because the pleadings,affidavits,and depositions present conflicting evidence from which a jury could reasonably reach different conclusions as to whether columbian knew that some physical impairment to the condition of swope body was substantially certain to follow from his repeated exposures to and unprotected inhalations of ozone,we conclude that the district court fell into error in granting columbian motion for summary judgment.
iii.peremption under.stat.
the district court granted henkel motion for summary judgment against the swopes based on a statute of peremption or repose,louisiana revised statute,which provides,in pertinent part,that n o action to recover damages shall be brought against any person performing services preparatory to construction,or against any person performing or furnishing the design,planning,supervision,inspection,or observation of construction or the construction of an improvement to immovable property more than ten years after an acceptance or occupation of the work or the improvement by the owner the swopes do not dispute that ten years elapsed between columbian acceptance or occupation of the installation of the generators and the discovery of their claims against henkel on or about july.to be entitled to the benefits of the statute,however,henkel must prove that the equipment manufactured by its predecessor,emery,became part of an improvement to immovable property and that emery performed the construction of that improvement as the statute is inapplicable to contracts of sale.upon review of the summary judgment record,we conclude that henkel has failed to show that there is no genuine issue as to any material issue and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law 
the louisiana civil code defines an obligation as a legal relationship whereby a person,called the obligor,is bound to render a performance in favor of another,called the obligee.that performance may consist of giving,doing,or not doing something.the obligation to give is one whereby the obligor binds himself to transfer to the obligee the ownership of a thing or to grant him some other real right in a thing.the obligation to do is one whereby the obligor binds himself to carry out or execute an act,or a series of acts,other than the transferring a real right,such as making or manufacturing something or rendering a service.the distinction between obligations to give,sales,and obligations to do,building constructions,is material to the judicial determination of questions involving transfer of ownership,risk of loss,prescription,and remedies.consequently,louisiana courts and federal courts applying louisiana precedents are frequently required to classify contracts as one or the other when one obligor is bound under one contract both to transfer things and provide services or labor to the obligee 
when it is possible to isolate one type of obligation from another owed by the same obligor,each obligation remains subject to the rules applicable to its own kind but when a single obligor plural obligations are intimately connected,one of the obligations must be recognized as fundamental,and the whole contract treated as giving rise to obligations of that kind 
analogously,when two obligors are each bound to perform a different obligation for the same obligee,if the performance of each may be separately identified,each obligation remains subject to the rules applicable to its own kind.for example,in conmaco southern ocean,conmaco,an independent distributor,sold a craning block to ocean salvage,which had been constructed by mckissick although the block was built according to specifications furnished by ocean salvage,and there had been consultations between all three parties in drawing up the specifications,the court held that conmaco obligation was one to give,to sell or transfer ownership of the block to ocean salvage,and not an obligation to do the mere fact than an obligor may be involved in the installation and delivery of the equipment will not change the characterization of the obligation from that of a sales contract and therefore the rules governing a sale will control.
in dewoody citgo petroleum,nelson electric company manufactured and sold a volt motor starter to industrial supply company,which in turn sold and delivered the product to citgo the motor starter was installed in citgo refinery,evidently by a person other than nelson electric company in determining that a claim against nelson electric was not extinguished by peremption or repose,the court necessarily concluded that the obligation performed by nelson electric was that of a sale of its product,not an obligation to build or install the product in citgo refinery to be entitled to the benefits of,it was not enough that it be shown that the equipment manufactured by nelson electric ultimately became an improvement to immovable property i t must be shown that nelson electric was a contractor.
in tidewater,hamilton,boyce machinery corporation sold a crane to tidewater which boyce had acquired from,the crane manufacturer an independent shipbuilder installed the crane on a vessel it constructed for tidewater boyce inspected the crane after its installation for proper working order and to make certain tidewater employees were instructed in the crane proper operation and care the court concluded that the contract between boyce and tidewater was a contract of sale although the manufacturer and boyce may have consulted with the plaintiff and jointly participated in the drawing up of specifications for the crane,these actions do not change the sales contract to an obligation to do or not to do.the mere fact that an obligor may be involved in the installation and delivery of the equipment will not change the obligation from that of a sales contract 
in jones crane,crane manufactured a central heating unit which ultimately was installed in a house during its construction by an independent building contractor crane did not install the unit,the ventilation system,the gas plumbing,the interior wires,or the duct system to which the unit was connected in addition,n othing in the record indicate d that the central heating unit was designed or manufactured specifically for th at particular house.consequently,the court held that louisiana revised statute was not applicable because crane had not proved that it had entered or performed a contract to build or install the central heating unit in the house 
applying the foregoing principles of law to the present case,we conclude that henkel is not entitled to a summary judgment as a matter of law declaring that its obligation to the swopes as successor to the manufacturer of the generators in question under the lpla has been extinguished by peremption or repose under louisiana revised statute.it is undisputed that columbian purchased the generators in question from henkel predecessor,emery,and contracted with an independent building contractor to have them installed on columbian property that the independent construction contractor installed the generators either autonomously or under the surveillance of columbian and that emery services were limited to the secondary,ancillary,chores of inserting glass dielectric tubes and checking to see that the generators were in proper working order.richard bianchi of columbian testified that construction was done through an independent contractor retained by columbian and that henkel had absolutely nothing to do with the installation of the unit after it was delivered to columbian.thus,the summary judgment evidence indicates that emery did not supervise or participate in the installation.emery advised only on how to operate the equipment,not how to install it.in fact,the record indicates that emery may not have even arrived at the scene until the generators were almost ready to go.the summary judgment evidence is also clear that the work of connecting external piping and tubing to the generators as sold by emery was all supplied by columbian.
moreover,from the evidence in the record,it does not appear that emery or designed the generators specifically for columbian.the record indicates that columbian assigned bianchi the responsibility for the purchase and installation of the new ozone generators.bianchi went to emery factory in cincinnati,looked at the emery equipment,and placed an order we purchased them and they worked.evidently,emery manufactured several different models of generators in standardized forms,each with different characteristics and capabilities.the record indicates that columbian simply related the production capacity it needed within its particular plant environment,and emery sold columbian the particular model of generator that would meet these needs.bianchi testified that the information provided to emery was limited to how much ozone they would produce per hour or pounds per day,the concentration,the voltage that they operated at or the incoming voltage,and the type of air we had.these figures were simply the raw data used by emery to decide which model of its generator to recommend and sell to columbian.columbian needs data no more amounted to the specifications for a or generator than would a request for a standard truck model having a certain load or power capacity.furthermore,nothing in the record specifies any modifications in model structure,characteristics,or capabilities to be performed by emery in connection with the sale and delivery of the generators.
finally,even if emery owed two obligations,one to give,to sell,and one to do,perform incidental services,the performance of the obligations would not fall within the ambit of the statute of peremption or repose because the inspection and insertion of the glass tubes into the generators was de minimis in comparison with the performance of the obligation to give or sell the generators.the parties failure to assign any value or cost to emery services plainly indicates that they were insignificant in economic value in relation to the performance of the obligation to give or sell.
in sum,emery,the vendor of the generators,performed an obligation to give,sale of equipment,to the obligee,columbian,and the independent building contractor performed the obligation to do,installation and assembly of the generators for the obligee.consequently,henkel failed to demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact that,as a matter of law,it performed an obligation to do,install or construct,rather than an obligation to give,to transfer ownership of the ozone generators to columbian.
iv inadequate warning 
at the outset,it is important to note that in this section we deal with the issue of whether columbian knew or reasonably should have been expected to know of the alleged dangerous characteristic of the generator that allegedly caused bodily harm to swope on july.this is different from the issue we dealt with in section ii,whether columbian knew to a substantial certainty that its operations in general,over a period of time,were exposing swope to harmful levels of ozone caused not only by purgation defects in generators,but also by other exposures,including during columbian manufacture of carbon black using ozone after it had been produced by the generators.
in support of its motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of the swopes products liability claim,henkel argues that it is sufficient that the manufacturer prove that the plaintiff or his employer should have known of the danger and that there is no duty under louisiana law to warn an employee of a sophisticated user or purchaser of the dangers of a product.henkel relies exclusively upon a sophisticated user or purchaser defense to excuse emery from its duty as manufacturer to use reasonable care to provide users and handlers of the product with an adequate warning about the product dangerous characteristics at the time it left the manufacturer control the louisiana products liability act establishes the exclusive theories of liability for manufacturers for damage caused by their products.the only provision of the lpla that affords a basis for arguing or guessing that manufacturers liability is limited by a sophisticated user or purchaser defense is section b,which states that a manufacturer is not required to provide an adequate warning about his product if the user or handler of the product already knows or reasonably should be expected to know of the characteristic of the product that may cause damage and the danger of such characteristic.consequently,as henkel concedes,under any sophisticated intermediary defense the threshold burden is on the manufacturer to prove that the knew or reasonably should have been expected to know of the dangerous characteristic of the product that caused the damage in a jury trial,if reasonable minds could differ on that question,the court must submit the issue to the jury with a proper instruction consequently,in seeking summary judgment on this issue,henkel has the threshold burden of demonstrating that there is no genuine issue as to the fact that columbian already knew or reasonably should have known of the dangerous characteristic of the generator,its propensity to retain and recycle ozone so that,contrary to emery instructions and representations,a purgation period was not a sufficient precaution to ensure the safety of a worker opening the generator door to replace a glass dielectric tube.we conclude that henkel did not carry this burden because based on the record presented for our review a reasonable jury easily could find that columbian did not already know and reasonably should not have been expected to know of that hazardous characteristic of the generator and the nature and magnitude of the danger it entailed.
in support of its motion,henkel relied upon evidence in the record that columbian manufactured carbon black with a process that involves the use of ozone for over years and held a patent on its process and that since or columbian has used the emery generators in question to produce ozone for subsequent use in its carbon black manufacturing process.the record reflects,however,that columbian process of making carbon black with ozone is distinct from the generation of the ozone with the emery and other makes of generators.discovery was limited to issues concerning the emery ozone generators columbian did not permit questions concerning the use of ozone after it left the generators and was used in the actual carbon black manufacturing process in which columbian had a proprietary interest.nevertheless,henkel contends,in effect,that a reasonable jury would be unable to find that columbian did not already know or should not have been expected to know of the dangerous characteristic of the emery generator and the inadequacy and inaccuracy of emery safety instructions and representations.we in light of the countervailing evidence presented by the plaintiffs.
in opposition to henkel motion for summary judgment the swopes presented,inter alia,the report of their expert witness,stephen killingsworth,a registered professional mechanical engineer,and the depositions of richard bianchi,columbian maintenance supervisor and former project engineer,swope,and other employees of columbian.killingsworth reported on the characteristics of the ozone generator that caused damage to swope,in pertinent part,as follows 
did not provide a method to monitor determine the presence of ozone within the ozone generator during system shutdown maintenance of the generator,specifically when the generator heads are removed.emery acknowledged and incorporated safety relative to the protection of the equipment such as high and low air pressure,low cooling water flow and high gas and water temperature.however,emery does not acknowledge and incorporate safety into the design of the generator relative to the protection of the individual or work er maintaining the equipment,specifically installing a monitor detection system to determine the presence of ozone prior to or during maintenance of the generators.the design of emery ozone generators should have included an ozone monitoring detection system.
maintenance and safety procedures do not include considerations for leakage improper system purging.emery procedure requires a of the entire system for a minimum of minutes to drive the ozone out of the ozone generator and all downstream piping.however,the process is flawed.the ozone generator and piping does not include a monitor detection system to determine if the system is truly purged of all ozone.ozone may remain within the system or the system through valve leakage,improper purging including insufficient purge time or insufficient flow of the purging media or simply human error.emery should have provided a maintenance and safety procedure that included considerations for leakage,improper purging and human error.
thus,killingsworth reported that emery purging instructions were both inadequate and untrue because they inaccurately represented that the prescribed purge was sufficient to remove all ozone from the generator and make it safe to be opened for maintenance.bianchi testified that under the guidance and instruction of emery employees,quisno and merit,he helped write operation and repair procedures for the emery generators based on emery operation manual and,that among the operations and repair procedures necessary to insure a safe work environment is a prescribed purge of the generators.killingsworth report stated that he had taken into account an itemized list of materials,including a copy of the emerzone ozone treatment system operation and maintenance manual for the columbian chemicals company north bend ozone facility.a reasonable jury could infer from killingsworth report and bianchi deposition that emery conveyed to columbian the inadequate and inaccurate purging instructions described by killingsworth via the emery operation and maintenance manual and other written and oral communications.the deposition of bianchi combined with that of swope tend to corroborate the inadequacy and inaccuracy of the purging instructions.although bianchi could not say for certain how long the generator that delivered the last blast of ozone to swope on july,had been shut down,he did testify that at the time a purge was the standard time for shutdown.swope testified that after he and a opened the generator door and replaced the dielectric tube,they shut the door temporarily while the fetched some silicone to apply to a gasket.when the door was reopened and after swope began to apply the silicone,he was struck in the face by a blast of ozone mist.he fell to his knees,unable to breathe,and crawled away from the open generator door vomiting.afterwards he suffered from respiratory difficulties,was given oxygen,and spent the remainder of the work day in the company air conditioned lunch room.leonce boudreaux,the who witnessed the accident,corroborated swope testimony.
henkel does not address the evidence of record in any detail in an effort to show that there is no genuine issue as to whether columbian already knew or reasonably should have been expected to know of the emery generator dangerous characteristic of retaining ozone after the purgation period in contradiction to emery safety instructions and representations of facts.henkel presents two arguments based on the general facts that columbian had extensive knowledge and experience in making carbon black with a process involving ozone and that columbian had used the emery ozone generators to produce ozone for this process.
the first argument,in effect,merely suggests that because of columbian experience with the emery generators,a reasonable inference could be drawn that it already knew or should have known of their dangerous characteristics.we need not decide whether this is a reasonable inference which could be drawn from the record evidence.assuming arguendo that it is,a jury could with equal,if not more,reasonableness find that columbian reasonably relied on the safety instructions and representations of emery and did not discover their inaccuracy and the dangerous characteristic of the generator to retain ozone after purgation until swope final exposure caused by that characteristic on july,
the second argument begs the question and improperly inverts the analysis required by lpla b.simply put,the argument is that because of columbian extensive experience in making carbon black with a process using ozone,columbian is a sophisticated purchaser and user of anything involving ozone in its business,and therefore columbian should have been expected to know of the latent dangerous characteristic of the generator contradicted by emery safety instructions and representations.however,lpla b explicitly requires that the manufacturer,in order to be relieved of his duty to warn,prove that the user or handler of the product already knew or reasonably should have been expected to know of the product dangerous characteristic once this threshold burden of proof has been met,it may be plausible to find an implication in the statute that the purchaser becomes a sophisticated intermediary with an exclusive or concurrent duty to warn his employee users and handlers of the danger.but the statute plainly does not authorize courts to judicially notice or assume ipse dixit that a particular purchaser is a sophisticated intermediary with respect to a specific latent dangerous characteristic of a product.the argument begs the question because it bas es a conclusion on an assumption that is as much in need of proof or demonstration as the conclusion itself.
the record does not contain evidence of sufficient concrete facts to demonstrate that there is no genuine dispute that columbian should have known of the latent dangerous characteristic of the ozone generators it purchased from emery.in fact,it is undisputed that these were the first ozone generators columbian had ever purchased from emery and that the vast majority of columbian experience had been with other makes and models of generators.moreover,there is nothing in the record to suggest why even a highly experienced user or handler of ozone generators should have been expected to know that the particular emery generators purchased by columbian could not be safely and adequately purged in the manner prescribed by emery.just as an experienced trucking firm or its professional drivers might not be expected to anticipate an unusual hidden danger involved in a routine engine maintenance procedure,we see no reason in this record to believe that an experienced user of ozone generators should have been aware of the specific dangerous propensity of the emery ozone generators to recycle and retain ozone even after following the manufacturer prescribed purging procedure.based on the present record,a reasonable jury could infer that a carbon black manufacturer in columbian position reasonably should not be expected to know that the emery generators could not safely be purged according to emery own instructions and representations,although that manufacturer might reasonably be expected to know everything about how to use the ozone subsequent to its generation in its patented carbon black manufacturing process.there is nothing in the record to indicate that columbian had ever made an ozone generator or had any occasion to delve into the intricacies of its internal operation.indeed,it is undisputed that columbian had never dismantled or performed major internal maintenance on the emery generators or had even opened anything on such a generator other than its outer door for the minor maintenance purpose of replacing glass dielectric tubes.jordan explicitly stated in his deposition that as far as he knew a turnaround was never done by columbian on an emery ozone generator,and bianchi confirmed that belief.bianchi testified that no periodic inspections or maintenance procedures were done on the emery generators,other than the replacement of the glass dielectric tubes.
the cases cited by henkel do not conflict with the foregoing analysis or require a conclusion that there is no genuine issue as to whether columbian already knew or reasonably should have been expected to know of the latent dangerous characteristic of the emery ozone generator despite emery inaccurate and inadequate safety instructions and representations.for example,henkel cites davis avondale industries,for the proposition that if columbian was a sophisticated user then the henkel defendants owed no duty to warn columbian or swope in the present case,however,we do not reach the question of what would be the effect of henkel having carried its burden of showing that columbian was a sophisticated intermediary.we can not do so because there is a genuine dispute as to whether columbian already knew or reasonably should have known of the characteristic of the product that may cause damage and the danger of such characteristic.in washington department of transportation,this court,in a harmless error analysis of an evidentiary ruling that was assumed to be erroneous arguendo,cited davis and concluded that the manufacturer had no duty to warn because the representative testified he actually already knew of the pertinent danger 
henkel cites a number of cases that are inapposite because,among other reasons,they applied law and did not involve alleged sophisticated intermediaries.all but one were decided after a full trial and not on a motion for summary judgment.hines remington arms is inapposite for the additional reasons that the court found de novo from the jury trial record that the trial court exclusion of warning evidence was harmless because a the gunpowder manufacturer provided ample warning of the flammability and danger of the product,b the plaintiff admitted he was well aware of the danger of firing a bullet into a container of gunpowder,and c the danger of pointing a loaded high powered rifle at gunpowder,is well known and obvious to the ordinary consumer,especially one such as hines,who is a sophisticated user of rifles and gunpowder.the court use of the term sophisticated user in hines is not relevant to the present case.in todd shipyards hercules,this court held that the district court was not clearly erroneous in finding after a full trial that the defendant manufacturer adequately warned todd of the application and limitations of the product,thermal barrier cloth the purchaser and his employees admitted to having knowledge of the danger that the cloth could burn,and the defendant introduced expert testimony that this danger was common knowledge in the industry the court statement that the plaintiff was a sophisticated user was not especially meaningful or crucial to the holding.in ducote liberty mutual insurance,the trial court found,after a full trial,that the manufacturer warning that the electrical saw should be grounded while in use to protect the user from electric shock was adequate to warn an experienced carpenter of the danger of death by electrocution the trial court based its decision on a finding that the warning was adequate,not on whether the manufacturer had been relieved of a duty to warn the use of the term sophisticated user in the appellate opinion was unnecessary and irrelevant finally,the court in scallan duriron,applying law,affirmed a summary judgment relieving the manufacturer of a duty to warn because the danger was obvious to an ordinary,not a sophisticated,user 
moreover,none of these cases presented an issue of whether there was a genuine issue of material fact for trial as to whether a purchaser already knew or reasonably should have known of the dangerous characteristic of a product so as to excuse a manufacturer failure to provide an adequate warning.all except one were decided after a trial,and the one was a case of summary judgment based on a danger obvious to an ordinary user.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court in favor of defendants,columbian and henkel,is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the order reads,in its entirety,it is hereby ordered,pursuant to the foregoing motion to dismiss without prejudice,that the remaining claim of complainants against henkel corporation and millennium petrochemicals,be dismissed without prejudice.the order did not refer to the qualified nature of the parties stipulated motion.
the order reads,in its entirety,it is hereby ordered that the memorandum rulings issued on february,and february,be and are hereby rendered as final judgments pursuant to the federal rule of civil procedure b,thereby allowing complainants the opportunity to appeal the rulings with the united states fifth circuit court of appeal.
rule b requires an express determination that there is no just reason for delay.the fifth circuit does not require a mechanical recitation of the rule requirements,but rather requires that the district court manifest unmistakable intent to make its judgment final.see briargrove shopping ctr.joint venture pilgrim,cir.the district court order meets this requirement.see supra note.
