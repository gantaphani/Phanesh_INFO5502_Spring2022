in this diversity jurisdiction civil action based on louisiana products liability law,the manufacturer,nut hustler,challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff,elton fitzgerald ellis,on the single issue of whether ellis injury,the traumatic amputation of his arm,arose from a reasonably anticipated use of the product,a mechanized pecan harvester.alternatively,nut hustler seeks reversal of the district court denial of its motion for a new trial because of an alleged inconsistency between special verdicts.at the outset,we stress the limited nature of the principal issue on appeal we are not here presented with a challenge to the jury determination that ellis injury was proximately caused either by a characteristic of the product that rendered it unreasonably dangerous in design or by an inadequate or unprovided warning about the product danger.rather,we are to consider only whether the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to create an issue of fact for the jury as to the reasonably anticipated use element of ellis claim or whether the district court was required to enter a judgment as a matter of law against him on that issue.on the issues appealed we affirm the judgment on verdict of the district court.
facts and procedural history 
in the season of,the plaintiff,elton ellis,worked for clarence spotsville harvesting pecans on spotsville farm in colfax,louisiana.ellis job entailed operating spotsville tractor and mechanized pecan picker.spotsville had purchased the pecan harvester machine from its manufacturer,the defendant nut hustler.
on the day of the accident,february,spotsville picked up ellis in his truck and bought each of them a can of beer on their way to the pecan orchard.after drinking two sips or a can of beer ellis started the tractor and set out to collect fallen pecans with the nut hustler machine attached to the tractor.the harvester function was powered by a spinning drive shaft attached to a power on the tractor.as he was circling the first pecan tree,ellis noticed that the harvester was not ejecting leaves,twigs,and debris as it should when properly harvesting pecans.ellis testified 
it was blowing out the leaves.it was stopped up,so i did my normal routine,what i always do,that the way i was taught,was to stop the tractor,leave the running and get off the tractor,walk back there and see what was not spinning back there on the spinner,see what was stopped up,what was causing it.
thus,to identify the part of the harvester that was not working properly,ellis left the tractor motor idling in neutral gear and the drive shaft spinning,so that he could see where the mechanism was broken,stuck,or not properly functioning.
ellis testified that both spotsville and valle,another pecan farmer for whom he had worked,taught him to follow this procedure to determine the nature of the problem when the harvester was not performing effectively.the plaintiff expert witness,mansel mayeux,a retired louisiana state university professor of agricultural engineering who had extensive experience in research,design,and safety of agricultural machinery,testified that ellis had not engaged in an unexpected or improper use of the pecan harvester when you inspect a machine like that when you have a problem,you may have to leave it running in order to tell what the problem is.you turn it off and nothing is happening,so you do know what wrong,so you got to leave it on.the defendant expert witness,gerald whitehouse,who had three degrees in mechanical engineering and specific expertise in mechanical design,testified that pecan harvesting was the reasonably anticipated use of the pecan harvester and that this was his understanding of what ellis was doing at the time of the accident.nut hustler did not present any evidence that it reasonably should not have expected ordinary persons to troubleshoot a malfunctioning harvester in the field by visually inspecting its moving parts while it was being operated by a power from a stationary tractor.
ellis walked around the pecan harvester and inspected its working parts,but he was not able to identify the cause of the malfunction.because of the cold weather,ellis was wearing a long flannel jacket over his trousers and undergarments.this was not unusual garb for pecan harvesting,as he testified without contradiction that spotsville and valle wore similar jackets in the field.as he headed back to the tractor,he noticed that a bolt on the front of the harvester was loose and dangling.this was a different bolt from the one on the drive shaft involved in the accident.he walked over and looked at the dangling bolt for a moment.then he turned and walked toward the tractor again.suddenly,the spinning drive shaft caught some part of his clothing and pulled him back into the machinery.ellis testified 
so i walked back there and i looked and i could seem to find what the problem was,so i said,well,i go cut the machine off and come back and look again.so as i headed back to the tractor,i noticed that another bolt was loose.i heard it dangling.so i walked over and i looked over at it,and as i glanced and i turned around and i headed back to the tractor,that do know.i do know what happened to me.i just felt something grab me from the back,and as it grabbed me from the back,it made me lose my balance,you know,and it pulled me into it.
after the clothing covering ellis arm became tightly wrapped around the spinning drive shaft,his body was thrown away from the shaft,tearing off his arm at the shoulder.
ellis filed this products liability suit against three defendants,including nut hustler.the district court dismissed the claims against all defendants except nut hustler.a jury trial was held on may.nut hustler moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the plaintiff case and the motion upon completion of its case.the district court withheld ruling on the motion.the jury returned a verdict finding nut hustler at fault and spotsville at fault.the jury found that ellis was negligent in his use of the harvester but determined that his negligence was not a cause of the accident.the jury quantified damages in the amount of.nut hustler again moved for judgment as a matter of law on the issue of whether ellis was engaged in a reasonably anticipated use of the harvester at the time of the accident.nut hustler also moved for a new trial on the issue of whether ellis was guilty of negligence that was a cause of the accident.the district court denied the motions and rendered judgment for ellis on the verdict.nut hustler appealed.
the district court ruling on the motions succinctly describes the evidence from which it concluded that the jury reasonably found in favor of ellis on the issues of reasonably anticipated use,unreasonably dangerousness in design and lack of adequate warning,and proximate causation of injury.the pertinent part of the district court ruling provides 
in this case,there was sufficient evidence that ellis used the pecan harvester for the exact purpose for which it was intended,gathering pecans.further,there was testimony that ellis was inspecting the machine when his shirt became twisted in the rotating machine.such a use is consistent with the purpose of the product.see kampen american isuzu motors,cir en banc.the defendant argues that the placement of a large bolt on the drive shaft was an unreasonable and unanticipated use of the pecan harvester.consideration of the placement of the bolt is more appropriate when analyzing the issue of alteration and modification of the product.
the unreasonably dangerous question encompasses the reasonably anticipated alteration or modification issue.see c.that is the issue before this court whether there is legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find that the modifications made to the machine could be reasonably anticipated by the defendant.
from the evidence presented,the jury could have found that the pecan harvester was unreasonably dangerous when it left the nut hustler control.basil savage,the majority shareholder in nut hustler testified that he had developed a shield for the drive shaft in the early.he placed this shield on the pecan harvester of his other company,savage equipment company.he discussed the need for the shield with jimmy goforth,another shareholder of nut hustler and manager of the company,but goforth would not place the shield on the nut hustler equipment.savage admitted that a guard could have been manufactured and installed at a reasonable cost and would provide protection for an operator.in addition,savage testified that the designer sent nut hustler a blueprint of the pecan harvester in that warned them that the drive shaft had no shield and such a shield should be provided by the implement manufacturer,nut hustler.
mansel mayeux,plaintiff expert in agricultural engineering,testified that in march the american society of agricultural engineers,the society of automotive engineers,and the american national standards institute generated standards that required a shield to cover any protruding object on a drive shaft see basil savage testimony.the standard was issued prior to the production of the equipment involved in this case.savage testified that he knew that standards existed but had no knowledge of the requirements of the standards.in addition,mayeux estimated the cost of such a shield to be.
mayeux also opined that the unshielded drive shaft would be dangerous absent any protruding objects.further,he stated that the two nut projection designed by nut hustler was unreasonably dangerous if unprotected by a shield.in this case,the jury could have found that the pecan harvester was unreasonably dangerous in design and that the addition of the large bolt was not unreasonable or unforeseeable there was sufficient evidence that both the lack of the shield and the addition by the owner of a large bolt contributed to ellis injury.nonetheless,the culprit,according to believable testimony,is the lack of a protective shield.there is ample evidence that without a shield,the accident would have occurred with or without the presence of the awkward bolt added by the owner.this is supported in the jury finding of spotsville as being at fault for these reasons,the defendant motion for a new trial or for a judgment as a matter of law is denied.
ii.judgment as a matter of law 
louisiana products liability act 
the louisiana products liability act lpla.et,provides that the manufacturer of a product is liable to a claimant for damage proximately caused by a characteristic of the product that renders the product unreasonably dangerous when such damage arose from a reasonably anticipated use of the product by the claimant or another person or entity.id.under the lpla,a product is unreasonably dangerous if,inter alia,the product is unreasonably dangerous in design as provided in or the product is unreasonably dangerous because an adequate warning about the product has not been given as provided in.lpla b.the term reasonably anticipated use means a use or handling of a product that the product manufacturer should reasonably expect of an ordinary person in the same or similar circumstances.id.
the claimant has the burden of proving the elements of reasonably anticipated use,unreasonable dangerousness in design or lack of adequate warning,and proximate causation,d.thus,ellis had the burden of producing evidence and persuading the jury to find by a preponderance of the evidence the facts that his injury arose from a reasonably anticipated use of the product,and that his damage was proximately caused by a characteristic of the product that rendered it unreasonably dangerous in design or by the lack of an adequate warning.the existence of each of these elements is a question of fact or of mixed fact and policy to be decided by the jury based upon the evidence and circumstances presented by the particular case the factual findings of the existence or of each of these elements is subject to appellate review in louisiana under the manifest error standard 
distinguishing between decisions on law and facts in louisiana cases 
under the louisiana state constitution,the general rule as to the scope of appellate review in civil cases is that the jurisdiction of the supreme court and the courts of appeal extend to questions of fact as well as to questions of law.const.art.v c b.jurisdiction to review findings of facts,resulting from louisiana history as a hybrid civil and common law jurisdiction,has been interpreted as giving the supreme court and courts of appeal the power to decide factual issues de novo.see,rosell esco,so d,the exercise of this power is limited by the jurisprudential rule of practice that the factual finding by a trial judge or jury will not be upset unless it is manifestly erroneous or clearly wrong.id.when an appellate court finds that a reversible error of law was made in the trial court or a manifest error of material fact was made by the trial court or jury,however,the reviewing court is required to redetermine the facts de novo from the entire record and render a judgment on the merits.id.citing gonzales xerox,so d mclean hunter,so d otto state farm mut.auto.ins,so d ragas argonaut southwest ins,so d.the manifest error doctrine also makes it possible for different triers of fact to validly reach different conclusions concerning the same set of facts.see knighten am.auto.ins,so d,st cir.
c onflicting decisions upon the same issue of fact do not necessarily connote erroneous judicial action.differences in proof and the latitude necessarily allowed to the trier of fact in each case to weigh and draw inferences from evidence and to pass upon the credibility of witnesses,might lead an appellate court to conclude that in none is the judgment erroneous.

unlike the seventh amendment to the united states constitution,the louisiana constitution contains no guarantee,in civil cases,of a right to trial by jury and no restriction upon appellate reexamination of facts tried by a jury.as this court observed in wright,at,as a consequence of the appellate review of facts in louisiana,in civil jury cases federal courts evaluating decisions of louisiana state courts as precedents have the difficult task of separating the decisions of the louisiana courts on the law from their review of the facts.emphasis added.accord miskell southern food,cir see also shirey louisville nashville,cir great am.indem.inkenbrandt,cir paul fire marine insurance company heath,cir gov t employees ins.davis,cir labuff texas new orleans,boeing shipman,cir en banc rives,concurring,overruled on other grounds by gautreaux scurlock marine,cir william crawford,life on a federal island in the civilian sea,msclr.
thus,in diversity cases,a federal court or jury can be bound by a louisiana court creation or interpretation of state law but not by a state court finding or decision on the facts of a particular case.wright,at.indeed,it is an error of law for a federal district court in a diversity case to base its ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law or,formerly,on a judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the findings of louisiana courts on facts as distinguished from their decisions on law.id.at 
accordingly,in evaluating the louisiana decisions cited by nut hustler in support of its motion for judgment as a matter of law,we must first determine whether the state decisions upon which it relies make or interpret state law on point.after carefully studying those louisiana cases,we conclude that none of them do so.rather,each decision relied upon by nut hustler constitutes only a finding of an adjudicative specific to that particular case,whether the claimant damage in that particular case arose from a reasonably expected use of the specific product.because each of the louisiana decisions relied upon by nut hustler with respect to the issue of reasonably anticipated use is a decision making a finding of fact,rather than a decision making or interpreting law,the jury,the district court,and this court are not bound in this diversity case by those state cases on their findings of facts with respect to the issue of reasonably anticipated use.
actually,nut hustler does not contend that the louisiana cases it cites make or interpret state law with respect to the reasonably expected use of a product.nut hustler argues instead that we must grant its motion for judgment as a matter of law because in a number of cases louisiana courts have found that a claimant injury did not arise from a reasonably expected use of a product based on facts that were closely analogous or strikingly similar to the present circumstances.that argument is based on a faulty notion of binding factual precedents,however,which is contrary to the jurisprudence of this circuit that in diversity cases we are bound by louisiana courts decisions making or interpreting state law but not by their findings of facts in particular cases.see wright,at miskell,at shirey,at cir inkenbrandt,at paul fire marine ins,at davis,at labuff.at boeing,at rives,concurring.
that the louisiana cases cited by nut hustler represent only findings of facts in particular cases with respect to reasonably expected use of a product,not the making or interpreting of law on that issue,is evident from a brief survey of them.also evident is the questionableness of nut hustler contention that the louisiana decisions it cites are closely analogous or strikingly similar to the present case on the facts.the louisiana cases involve a wide array of dissimilar products and uses,and none of them involves the use of a pecan harvester.we pretermit discussion of the factual analogies or contrasts between those decisions and the case at bar,however.they are not relevant to our decision,because we are not bound by the state courts findings of facts in our review of this federal diversity civil jury trial.
in myers american seating,so d.cir,relied upon heavily by nut hustler,the court of appeal reversed a directed verdict for the manufacturer on the issues of the unreasonable dangerousness and reasonably anticipated use of a folding chair because based on the evidence presented to the jury,reasonable people could have reached a different conclusion.id.at.after conducting a trial de novo on the record,the court of appeal found that the plaintiff use of the folding chair as a step ladder by standing on the rear part of the chair seat was not a reasonably anticipated use of the chair and that the product was not unreasonably dangerous in design or otherwise.this case illustrates that the louisiana courts regard the question of whether a particular use of a product was reasonably anticipated as a question of fact for the jury when reasonable people could disagree as to the answer and that if the trial judge errs in not sending the issue to the jury,the court of appeal will decide that question of fact as the trier of the facts in a trial de novo on the entire record.thus,the court of appeal in myers made a finding of fact,and did not make or interpret state law,on the issue of reasonably expected use of a product.
in kelley hanover ins,so d.cir,a teenage boy died as the result of his intentional inhalation of propane gas to get high.the appellate court upheld summary judgment for the defendant manufacturers on the issue of whether intentional inhalation was a reasonably anticipated use of the product because the evidentiary basis in that case was not sufficient to support a reasonable trier of fact finding to the contrary.again,this case does not establish a rule of law or change the lpla legal definition of reasonably anticipated use it merely decides that based on the summary judgment evidence presented in that particular case a reasonable trier of fact could not have found for the claimant on that issue.
in ford beam radiator,so d.cir,a radiator cap boss was welded to the stainless steel stud after it was sold,eliminating the taper lock feature.the appellate court upheld the jury factual finding for the defendant manufacturer on the issue of reasonably anticipated use because the record provided a reasonable basis for the jury to conclude that the improper modification by welding was not a misuse that could be reasonably anticipated.id.again,nut hustler does not and can not point to any law established or interpreted by the decision but mistakenly claims that we are bound by its factual finding.
in johnson black decker,so d.cir,after reviewing the record,the appellate court affirmed the jury factual finding that the plaintiff use of a power miter saw without the safety guard,which was attached at the time of the sale,should not have been reasonably anticipated by the defendant manufacturer.far from being a creation of law or a gloss on the lpla,this was simply an appellate determination that the jury finding of fact was not unreasonable the appeals court did not address whether a contrary finding also would have been reasonable based on that particular evidentiary record.in other words,the appellate court made no law because it merely reviewed the jury findings of fact for manifest error and,finding none,affirmed.
in hoyt chipper,so d.cir,the appellate court,upon its own review of the record,made a finding of fact de novo that the manufacturer should not have reasonably expected the replacement of the starter switch on a woodchipper with a less safe toggle switch.moreover,peterson bass and,so d.cir,affirmed a summary judgment that,on the particular evidentiary basis in that case,in which the plaintiffs presented no evidence to the contrary,the manufacturer reasonably should not have expected teenage girls to intentionally inhale vapors from products expressly designed and labeled for the care of shoes 
the foregoing analysis of the louisiana court decisions and the federal louisiana diversity decisions relied upon by nut hustler demonstrates that each case presents only a finding of fact on the issue of reasonably anticipated use with respect to the evidentiary basis of that particular case.none of those cases represents a creation or interpretation of louisiana law with respect to reasonably anticipated use.consequently,nut hustler sample of louisiana cases presents no decision on state law that is binding on the jury,the district court,or this court in the present diversity case with respect to the reasonably anticipated use issue

d.there was a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for ellis on the issue of reasonably anticipated use the district court correctly denied nut hustler motion for judgment as a matter of law.
in denying nut hustler motion for a judgment as a matter of law,the district court stated 
in this case,there was sufficient evidence that ellis used the pecan harvester for the exact purpose for which it was intended,gathering pecans.further,there was testimony that ellis was inspecting the machine when his shirt became twisted in the rotating machine.such a use is consistent with the purpose of the product.
citing kampen am.isuzu motors,cir en banc the lpla objective inquiry requires us to ascertain what uses of its product the manufacturer should have reasonably expected at the time of manufacture.after reviewing the record,we conclude that the district court correctly analyzed the evidence and applied rule,not simply for the district court stated reasons,but also because of additional evidence in the record from which the jury reasonably could have found that nut hustler should have reasonably expected or actually did expect that an ordinary person operating the pecan harvester would inspect the harvester or walk between the tractor and the harvester while the harvester machinery was running.
for example,ellis testified that in inspecting the malfunctioning pecan harvester he followed the procedure that he had been taught by two experienced pecan farmers.he was instructed to leave the tractor motor running in neutral gear,with the drive shaft engaged to the power,while he inspected the harvester.the purpose of leaving the harvester operational during the inspection was to distinguish working from parts,so as to facilitate identification of the part of the harvester that was broken,stuck,or otherwise impaired.the plaintiff expert in agricultural machinery also testified that this was the normal procedure for detecting the trouble with such machinery in the field.he said that many problems could not be detected unless the machine was activated.the jury reasonably could have inferred that it would not have been practicable or reasonably expected for a farm worker to haul the harvester to the shop each time it malfunctioned without first performing a field inspection.further,the jury reasonably could have found that the manufacturer own expert agreed that ellis use of the harvester during his inspection of it was a reasonably anticipated use.
the jury also could have reasonably drawn the inference that nut hustler actually anticipated or should have expected that the harvester users would leave it running while inspecting it for problems because nut hustler presented no evidence to the contrary.nut hustler did not ask any of its witnesses,which included its owners,officers,and farm machinery expert,whether the type of operational field inspection conducted by ellis was a use of the product that the manufacturer should reasonably expect of an ordinary person in the same or similar circumstances.finally,the jury reasonably could have inferred that savage and goforth,nut hustler owners and operators,actually anticipated or reasonably should have expected farm hands to walk near the tractor and the harvester while these machines were operating in idling mode for inspections for the following reasons the designer of the machinery had given them notice on the design drawings that they used in manufacturing the harvesters that a shield should be placed over the drive shaft at the point where ellis was pulled into it savage placed such a shield on all harvesters made in the oklahoma plant savage told goforth that he should place such shields on the harvesters manufactured in the texas facility and savage and goforth attached similar shields in many places on the nut hustler harvesters other than on the drive shaft to prevent farm workers from being injured by moving parts.also,mayeaux testified that at the time of nut hustler manufacture of the pecan harvester the american society of agricultural engineers,the society of automotive engineers,and the american national standards institute had generated standards that required a shield to cover any protruding object on a drive shaft.
nut hustler principal argument on appeal appears to be that ellis leaving the machinery fully operational while he walked around the harvester with clothing to look for a possible malfunction was a use but not a reasonably anticipated use of the product in its main argument,however,nut hustler does not directly address the evidence in attempting to explain why a reasonable jury could not have found for ellis on that issue.instead,nut hustler presents an argument based on a complex inexplicit analogy drawn from a detailed survey of louisiana court opinions containing factual findings for manufacturers on the reasonably anticipated use issue.in nut hustler case sample,however,the facts and circumstances,the products,the product uses,and the product users differ considerably from those in the present case.nevertheless,nut hustler argues that these louisiana court decisions,none of which involved a pecan harvester,somehow show that the jury was unreasonable in finding for ellis on the reasonably anticipated use issue in the present case.
nut hustler asserts that t he louisiana decisions over the last ten years leave no doubt that the answer to that question must be in the negative and that t here is a pattern in all of these cases,and the pattern dictates the result in this case.thus,there is an excluded middle in nut hustler argument.nut hustler does not even attempt to explain exactly how the facts and circumstances of its sample of cases demonstrate that no reasonable jury could have found for ellis on the quite different anticipated use issue created by the unique circumstances,product,and use in the present case.
more important,as indicated in our discussion of the distinction between interpretations of law and findings of fact in louisiana cases,the findings of fact on the issue of reasonably anticipated use in nut hustler case sample do not constitute creations or interpretations of louisiana law.therefore,those factual findings are not binding on federal courts or juries in diversity cases.furthermore,as noted previously it has long been settled in this circuit that a federal court may not base its ruling upon a motion for judgment as a matter of law or,formerly,for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict upon findings of facts in louisiana cases in a diversity civil jury action.see wright,at miskell,at shirey,at cir inkenbrandt,at paul fire marine ins,at davis,at labuff.at boeing,at rives,concurring.
nut hustler other argument in support of its motion for judgment as a matter of law is also without merit it alludes to several different theories but fully develops none,perhaps because they are not supported by the evidence and the applicable law.essentially,nut hustler recounts evidence tending to show that spotsville had removed and failed to replace some of the original shields covering other moving parts different from the spinning drive shaft of the pecan harvester,and after the original bolt in the drive shaft and several of its replacements had broken,spotsville inserted a longer bolt that protruded further out of the drive shaft than the original bolt.from this premise nut hustler leaps to the conclusion that t he sum total of all of the foregoing testimony,when compared to the results in analogous cases,requires the conclusion that plaintiff was not engaged in a reasonably anticipated use of the product at the time of this incident.
this argument seems to be an amalgam of nut hustler main argument based on factually analogous louisiana cases discussed and rejected above,impermissible attacks upon the verdict finding that the product was unreasonably dangerous and a proximate cause of the accident not challenged on appeal,and the notion that the manufacturer reasonably should not have expected an ordinary farm worker like ellis to use the pecan harvester with a long replacement bolt in its drive shaft,a slightly different approach from its earlier argument that a field inspection during the harvester dysfunctional operation was not reasonably expected.
nut hustler did not challenge the jury verdict that ellis injury was proximately caused by nut hustler product that was unreasonably dangerous in design or in its lack of an adequate warning.consequently,nut hustler second argument is precluded insofar as it suggests that spotsville negligence was the sole proximate cause of the accident or insofar as it suggests that the product was not unreasonably dangerous at the time it left the control of the manufacturer but was rendered unreasonably dangerous only because of an alteration or modification of the product that reasonably should not have been anticipated.these arguments can not be entertained for two reasons.first,they are outside the scope of nut hustler sole appeal from the denial of judgment as a matter of law based exclusively on the contention that ellis injury did not arise from a reasonably anticipated use of the product.second,they are inconsistent with the unchallenged jury verdicts that assigned only of the fault to spotsville and that found that the pecan harvester was unreasonably dangerous in its design or because of an inadequate warning and that the unreasonably dangerous nature of the pecan harvester was the cause of ellis accident.
moreover,there was a legally sufficient basis for rejecting nut hustler arguments and finding that ellis injury arose from a reasonably anticipated use of the pecan harvester.the evidence is undisputed that the accident was not caused by the missing original equipment shields but by the drive shaft which was uncovered or unshielded when it left the control of the manufacturer.the record contains evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that nut hustler owners actually or reasonably should have anticipated that farmers would replace broken bolts in the harvester drive shaft by using longer bolts if they did not have bolts of the exact length as the original bolts on hand.one of nut hustler owners,goforth,stated that replacing a broken bolt on a harvester by rigging it with a larger bolt was a typical farmer deal one that was common among all your farmers.there also was a legally sufficient basis for the jury finding that at the time the product left the manufacturer control there existed an effective alternative design,an economical and feasible safety shield covering the open drive shaft,that was capable of preventing ellis injury regardless of the length of the bolt in the drive shaft.furthermore,there was sufficient evidence from which the jury reasonably could find that because of the absence of a drive shaft safety shield,ellis jacket would have become caught in the open drive shaft even if the original bolt had not been replaced there was evidence that the original bolt was not flush with the shaft but also protruded,although to a lesser extent than the replacement bolt and there was evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that the spinning drive shaft,even if its surface had been smooth,would have been capable of catching and wrapping a farm worker clothing.there was legally sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could have concluded that the breaking of the original bolt in the drive shaft and its replacement with the more protrusive bolt was either a change arising from ordinary wear and tear or a change that nut hustler should reasonably expect to be made by an ordinary person in the same or similar circumstances finally,for all of the foregoing reasons,including the reasons given in our discussion concluding that the type of field inspection used by ellis was a reasonably expected use of the harvester,the evidence was legally sufficient to support a finding that nut hustler reasonably should have expected ordinary farm workers to use the harvester with a longer bolt in the drive shaft in the circumstances presented by this case.
nut hustler also argues that ellis conduct in wearing a coat while inspecting the harvester was not reasonably expected in connection with his use of the machine.however,there was no evidence that the jacket was either unusual apparel for a pecan farm worker or extremely for ellis.ellis testified without contradiction that spotsville and valle wore similar jackets in the pecan orchards.no witness testified that the jacket was unusual or unreasonably big or long for ellis or his work.pecans are harvested in the fall and winter.the jury reasonably could have found that nut hustler reasonably should have expected that farm workers using the harvester to pick up pecans in february would wear long,heavy jackets during their work on cold days.see johnston hartford ins,so d.cir t he manufacturer is obligated to anticipate the environment in which the product will be used and to give notice of the potential risks arising from reasonably anticipated use in the foreseeable environment.citing bloxom bloxom,so d.
applying the standards dictated by rule and reeves it is apparent that nut hustler is not entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.after reviewing all of the evidence in the record,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,refraining from credibility determinations or weighing the evidence,and disregarding all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury was not required to believe,we conclude that there was a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for ellis on the issue of reasonably anticipated use.
iii.motion for a new trial 
the jury answered affirmatively interrogatory number three do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that elton ellis was negligent in his use of the pecan harvester and negatively interrogatory number four do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that elton ellis s negligence was a cause of the accident.nut hustler moved for a new trial on these questions,arguing that these answers are inconsistent and irreconcilable.the trial court rejected the argument and the motion.
the trial court ruling on a motion for a new trial must be given deference and will only be reversed if the trial court abused its discretion.see industries of vermont,kelco disposal,d smith riceland foods,cir a district court has discretion to decide whether a jury findings on a verdict form are incomplete,confusing,or inconsistent and whether to resubmit the claim to the jury.the district judge,who has observed the jury during the trial,prepared the special verdict questions and explained them to the jury,is in the best position to determine whether the answers reflect confusion or uncertainty.citations and quotations omitted see also cantellops,cir.we conclude that the trial court ruling was not an abuse of its decision.
we are required under the seventh amendment to make a concerted effort to reconcile apparent inconsistencies in answers to special verdicts if at all possible.atlantic gulf stevedores,ellerman lines,d griffin matherne,cir.see also watkins fibreboard,cir,overruled on other grounds by white grinfas,cir davis west cmty,cir crossland canteen,cir mercer long,cir wright kroeger,cir.therefore,courts must attempt to reconcile the jury findings,by exegesis,if necessary,before we are free to disr
