andrew waybright died by accident while training to join the frederick county fire department in maryland.his parents brought suit on state constitutional and tort law also,with the same conduct in view,under and substantive due process.the claims overreach nothing defendants did rises to the level of a due process violation,and accidents in the main are a matter of state law.as to the state constitutional and tort law claims,we remand them to state court,where this case began and where it still belongs.
a little before seven on the morning of july,new recruits for the frederick county fire department assembled for outdoor physical training.a firefighter named jeffrey coombe was supervising,and he drove the recruits hard.he had told the group that he did like quitters and did like to hear i ca.that morning,for an hour,with temperatures rising to degrees and a heat index rising to,recruits ran miles,did squats,pushups,and other calisthenics,and ran wind sprints.coombe did not bring water,or communications,transportation,or equipment.many of the recruits struggled during the session and some experienced disorientation and pronounced exhaustion.one told coombe that he was dizzy,and coombe told him to rest.
a recruit named andrew waybright started looking sick and pale during the workout.another recruit asked if waybright wanted to say something to coombe,but waybright said no.just before,as the session was concluding and everyone was heading back to the training center,waybright collapsed in the grass.he tried to crawl back to the training center,saying i want to finish with my class,and was able to get up briefly.but his legs were shaky and coombe told him to rest where he was.
as waybright lay there,two bystanders came by and offered to call,but another firefighter,eckhardt who was also an emergency medical technician,said that waybright was just played out,no need to call.coombe stayed with waybright briefly,but did not administer first aid.before leaving,coombe assigned eckhardt to watch over waybright.at the training center,coombe told a second firefighter,grossnickle,to get a pickup truck to pick waybright up.
while eckhardt waited with him,waybright lost consciousness.eckhardt had no phone or radio,but when grossnickle arrived in the truck,eckhardt told him to call.grossnickle returned to the training center,told another firefighter to call,and brought a paramedic back to the scene.he returned to the training center to look for medical equipment,which he could find.
at about,waybright went into cardiac arrest.the paramedic administered cpr,and soon thereafter an ambulance arrived and took waybright to the emergency,at,he died.an autopsy revealed that he had no preexisting conditions and died of hyperthermia heat stroke.
a frederick county board of inquiry was impaneled and,after considerable investigation,issued a report in january.with respect to coombe,the report found that he failed to bring water to the training session contrary to protocol,overlooked the recruits distress during the session,and failed to recognize the emergency situation that occurred when waybright collapsed.with respect to frederick county recruiting school,the report found that its staff was overloaded and undertrained coombe,for example,had no certification in physical fitness,and that the school simply could not be run safely without substantial reform.it also found that at least one supervisor knew about these problems to some extent.in response to the incident and report,the recruiting school was shut down for several years and training outsourced to other jurisdictions.
in march,andrew waybright parents filed a tort suit in state court against jeffrey coombe,various in the frederick county fire department,and the department itself.the complaint alleged wrongful death,loss of solatium,and survival,all premised on negligence.at a hearing in,the court dismissed the survival claim.
before the state court could rule on the remainder of the case,plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding new defendants and new causes of action,some of which were federal.defendants,invoking federal question jurisdiction,removed to federal district over the next years,the case ballooned,swelling in complexity to such an extent that the second amended complaint,at pages,was almost six times the original state complaint length,and the district court needed a chart to keep track of the claims and defendants.see waybright frederick county.dep t of fire rescue,d.when all was said and done,plaintiffs had lodged three types of claims against four types of defendants.
first was a claim,premised on waybright substantive due process right to life and directed against coombe,various supervisors at the fire department,various members of the frederick county board of commissioners,and frederick county itself.with respect to coombe,the claim stemmed from his conduct on that july morning as to the others,it stemmed from their supervisory role in creating the conditions that allegedly led to waybright death.see monell dep t of soc,d carter morris,cir.second was a state constitutional claim,based on article of the maryland declaration of rights no man ought to be deprived of his life,liberty or property,but by the law of the land,and directed against coombe,the supervisors at the fire department,and the commissioners of the board.third were the original state tort claims,based on wrongful death,loss of solatium,and despite the state court ruling survival,and directed against coombe,the supervisors at the department,and frederick county.
defendants moved for summary judgment,and,in march,the district court granted it with respect to plaintiffs federal and state constitutional claims,but remanded the tort claims to the circuit court for frederick county.waybright,d.first,the district court rejected plaintiffs due process claim,holding that coombe conduct was not egregious enough to shock the conscience as a constitutional matter because the harm coombe did was not intentional.see county of sacramento lewis,d.the district court reasoned,second,that the federal due process analysis should control the state article analysis,citing the maryland court of appeals for the proposition that the two are in pari materia,such that the interpretations of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment provided by the united states supreme court serve as persuasive authority for article.pickett sears,roebuck.finally,as to plaintiffs state tort claims,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction and remanded them to state court.plaintiffs timely appealed.
the claim against jeffrey coombe is the gateway to all the other claims,for supervisors and municipalities can not be liable under without some predicate constitutional injury at the hands of the individual state officer,at least in suits for damages.city of los angeles heller,d see also grayson peed,cir.here,the individual constitutional wrong alleged is that coombe deprived of his right to life under the fourteenth amendment to the constitution a substantive due process claim.second am.compl.if this allegation survives scrutiny,we go on to the others if not,the federal side of this case comes to a close.
the fourteenth amendment due process clause protects a set of,liberty,and are also protected by state tort law.together with,then,there is some risk of the clause supplanting state tort law in almost any suit alleging that a local official has caused harm.in case after case,the supreme court has rejected this prospect and spurned any approach to the fourteenth amendment that would make it a font of tort law to be superimposed upon whatever systems may already be administered by the states.paul davis,d.see also county of sacramento lewis,d t he due process guarantee does not entail a body of constitutional law imposing liability whenever someone cloaked with state authority causes harm.collins city of harker heights,d w e have previously rejected claims that the due process clause should be interpreted to impose federal duties that are analogous to those traditionally imposed by state tort law.deshaney winnebago county dep t of social,d t he due process clause of the fourteenth amendment does not transform every tort committed by a state actor into a constitutional violation.daniels williams,d our constitution does not purport to supplant traditional tort law in laying down rules of conduct to regulate liability for injuries that attend living together in society.baker mccollan,d section imposes liability for violations of rights protected by the constitution,not for violations of duties of care arising out of tort law.
two principles stand out in these cases.the first involves a certain sense of constitutional sense that,as due process at the core combats arbitrary action of government,county of sacramento,at.emphasis added,applying the clause to the ordinary run of governmental neglect,inaction,and bad policy would diminish it.thus we find the court remarking that only the most egregious official conduct can be said to be arbitrary in the constitutional sense,id.at.quotation omitted that the constitution deals with the large concerns of the governors and the governed,daniels,at.that courts should exercise judicial and utmost care in novel substantive due process cases,collins,at.and that the clause was intended to prevent government from abusing its power,or employing it as an instrument of oppression,deshaney,at.quotation omitted,and it would not do to trivialize it,daniels,at.repeatedly,the court quotes chief justice marshall great admonishment w e must never forget,that it is a constitution we are expounding.mcculloch maryland,wheat.emphasis in original,quoted in county of sacramento,at.daniels,at.and paul,at.brennan,dissenting.
second is concern for the authority of state governments over areas traditionally assigned to state with that,disquiet at the potentially staggering practical consequences of empowering federal judges to oversee everything from pillows left on prison stairs daniels to sewer maintenance collins with the inflexible instrument of constitutional law.thus collins states that decisions about how to allocate resources in state government involve a host of policy choices that must be made by locally elected representatives,rather than by federal judges interpreting the basic charter of government for the entire country.at.and paul davis,paus ing to consider the result should be interpreted to transmute ordinary torts against the government into fourteenth amendment claims,points out that almost anyone wronged by local authority would obtain a constitutional claim under such a result that would come as a great surprise to those who drafted and shepherded the adoption of that amendment.at.
with these principles in mind,the supreme court has,for half a century now,marked out executive conduct wrong enough to register on a due process scale as conduct that shocks the conscience,and nothing less.county of sacramento,at.quoting rochin california.the test turns on degree of fault.for a due process challenge to executive action to succeed,the general rule is that the action must have been intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest.county of sacramento,at.as to negligently inflicted harm,it is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due process.id.and as to culpability falling within the middle range,following from something more than negligence but less than intentional conduct,the court has allowed that it may have constitutional implications,but only in special circumstances.id.quotation omitted.as to what those special circumstances are,the court has issued no general rule except that judges should proceed with and utmost care,collins,at,and make an exact analysis of the circumstances presented before any abuse of power is condemned as conscience shocking,county of sacramento,at.
what this body of law on the whole makes clear is that,where a claim sounds both in state tort law and substantive due process,state tort law is the rule and due process the distinct exception.in other words,the supreme court has established a strong presumption that due process claims which overlap state tort law should be rejected and the case,if diversity is lacking,sent to state court.the presumption is rebuttable it can be overcome by showing governmental conduct so arbitrary and egregious that it shocks the conscience,usually because a state actor intended harm without justification.county of sacramento,at.but the presumption should be vigorously applied,for without it,a problem arises that we see in the present case and never want to see in law basic difficulty and extensive litigation over the forum in which a case threshold question that tells plaintiffs and defendants nothing about the merits of the case and delays resolution for all.
plaintiffs due process claim overlaps state tort law there is thus a presumption against it.the most likely path for overcoming the presumption is closed,for under no construction of events could coombe be said to have intended waybright death.and to the extent coombe was negligent,the claim is not a constitutional one and the presumption stands.thus plaintiffs only option is to argue,against a presumption to the contrary,that this case presents one of those special circumstances in which culpability in the middle,deliberate shock the conscience to such an extent that a federal action lies.
plaintiffs first and major argument for recognizing a federal substantive due process claim is that coombe,in their view,had time before waybright collapse to deliberate about the dangers awaiting recruits.coombe knew how dangerous it was to exercise outside in the heat without adequate hydration he had given a powerpoint presentation on the subject just the day before the fatal run.and although one might disagree as to whether coombe had time to deliberate after waybright collapsed,plaintiffs argue,he certainly had time beforehand to make an unrushed decision about the need to have water on hand.according to plaintiffs,it was this time to deliberate that transmuted what might otherwise be ordinary negligence into a form of deliberate indifference cognizable under the constitution.
the support for this argument comes from the sixth circuit remarks in estate of owensby city of cincinnati that t he determining factor when deciding whether deliberate indifference shocks the conscience should be whether the circumstances allowed the state actors time to fully consider the potential consequences of their conduct,cir quotation omitted.but the case law as a whole is against a general rule that time to deliberate transforms negligent error into constitutionally shocking conduct.the circuit has rejected the rule,holding that t he opportunity for deliberation alone is not sufficient to apply a lower bar to substantive due process claims.fraternal order of police dep t of corr.labor comm.williams.and the supreme court,we think,has done the same.in holding that due process does not require governmental employers to provide a safe workplace,but that state tort law may,see collins city of harker heights,d,the court necessarily rejected the time to deliberate employers most often have time to deliberate about workplace conditions.the court has also held that there is no deliberate indifference without actual knowledge of a danger,see farmer brennan,d and of course one can have time to deliberate about danger without having actual knowledge of it.
the time to deliberate theory is also difficult to apply.what part of the challenged conduct matters does the opportunity to deliberate begin months or weeks before an accident,the night before,or at the time events unfolded this question would emerge in many cases besides waybright because longstanding conditions often lead to rapidly unfolding harm.also,when has one had enough time to deliberate what kind of prior notice of potential danger causes the deliberative duty to kick in these and other questions have real litigious potential.indeed,they threaten more cases like the present one,where confusion over what belongs in state and what in federal court leads to delay for plaintiffs in getting relief and uncertainty for defendants in finding out if liability attaches.
