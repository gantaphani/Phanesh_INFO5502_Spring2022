opinion of the court 
in this personal injury action filed against the united states pursuant to the federal tort claims act,the united states appeals from an order of the district court directing that the united states pay interest on a judgment entered against it at the rate set forth in the virgin islands code,rather than pursuant to the generally applicable rate formula set forth at.we are convinced that the calculation should have been undertaken in accordance with the provisions of section.accordingly,we will reverse the order of the district court.
thomas alkon,a croix attorney,was seriously injured in a fall on the stairs at the federal courthouse on croix.following a bench trial in an action brought pursuant to the federal tort claims act,alkon was awarded a judgment in the amount of the united states paid the judgment and interest on that judgment calculated according to the formula set forth in.
thereafter,alkon filed a motion in the district court seeking to have interest due on the judgment recalculated at the higher rate set in.the motion was granted.this timely appeal followed.
this appeal requires that we determine which of two statutory provisions controls the calculation of interest applicable to the judgment awarded in this action.we begin by noting that in almost all instances,the calculation of interest on a judgment rendered against the united states in a civil action is governed by the provisions of 
the district court held that section should not apply in this case because the district court of the virgin islands is not a district court for purposes of the statute.accordingly,the district court found that interest on the judgment awarded to alkon should be calculated with reference to,which provides that the rate of interest on judgments and decrees for the payment of money shall be percent per annum.
in reaching this conclusion,the district court found that strict construction of the term district court as used in section is appropriate in light of the prohibition set forth in section c section shall not be construed to affect the interest on any judgment of any court not specified in this section.
in order to determine whether congress did,in fact,intend that the interest formula set forth in section not apply to ftca judgments obtained in the district court of the virgin islands,the district court first looked to.that section reads in part 
the term court of the united states includes the supreme court of the united states,courts of appeals,district courts constituted by chapter of this title,including the court of international trade and any court created by act of congress the judges of which are entitled to hold office during good behavior.
the terms district court and district court of the united states mean the courts constituted by chapter of this title.
chapter of title,provides for the constitution of the district courts of the fifty states,the district of columbia,and puerto rico.as the district court in this matter recognized,
conspicuously absent from the chapter v list are the district courts of the virgin islands,guam,and the northern mariana islands,which were established pursuant to,and,respectively.
alkon united states,mem.opinion at.
according to the district court,since the district court of the virgin islands was not constituted by chapter,it is not a district court for purposes of that section,therefore,does not establish the applicable interest rate.the district court summarized its holding as follows 
while the matter is not altogether free from doubt,i conclude for several reasons that the correct rate of interest to be awarded in the district court of the virgin islands is the rate prescribed by.first,i must consider the mandatory language of c,which limits the application of that section to only those courts specified therein second,i am reluctant to substantially invalidate a section of the virgin islands code absent some compelling reason to do so finally,calculating interest on judgments against the united states at the same rate as other virgin islands judgments is consistent with the overall theme of the federal tort claim act itself,which is to render the government liable to the same extent as private tortfeasors.
alkon,mem.op.at.
we agree with the district court that resolution of the issue raised in this appeal turns on whether congress intended to mandate a technical reading of the term district court as used in a when it provided in c that t his section providing for the calculation of interest rates shall not be construed to affect the interest on any judgment of any court not specified in this section.we do not,however,agree with the district court conclusion that the term district court must be read to exclude application of section to judgments entered against the united states pursuant to the ftca in the district court of the virgin islands.
in declining to adopt a reading of section which would make it inapplicable to the judgment obtained here,we are guided by our decision in in re jaritz,cir.there,we were asked to determine whether authorized the third circuit judicial council to transfer bankruptcy judges to the virgin islands.this determination hinged on a narrow question w hat did congress intend when it used the term judicial district in section.id.at.did it use the term in a generic sense to refer to the geographic area in which a district court exercises judicial authority in bankruptcy matters,or did it intend its scope to be limited to the geographic area in which an article iii district court exercises judicial authority over such matters.id.
in order to answer this question,we first considered the statutory text,finding nothing that would limit its scope to judicial districts having an article iii district court.id.at.we next considered relevant legislative history,and again failed to find any indication to suggest an intent to restrict the authorization conferred by section to article iii districts.id.
not finding the statutory text or the legislative history to be dispositive,we inquire d whether the broader or the narrower reading of judicial district would best service congress objectives in enacting chapter and section in particular.id.at.we identified the objective of chapter as the creation of a reorganized bankruptcy system in which a specialized corps of bankruptcy judges would assist district court judges in adjudicating bankruptcy matters.id.we identified the objective of section as the efficient and effective use of that corps of bankruptcy judges.id.interpreting congress use of the term judicial district in light of the purpose underlying the statute,we were unable to discern any reason congress might have wished to garner the efficiencies provided by section for judicial districts having an article iii district court and not for judicial districts having an article iv district court which exercises the jurisdiction of an article iii by virtue of the legislation that created it.id.
finally,we addressed the dilemma posed by the application of limited definition of a district court as a court constituted under article iii.we wrote 
while we,of course,recognize that a definitional section like section must presumptively be taken as reflecting the congressional intent when a defined term is used even in subsequent legislation,it is not controlling where consideration of the term immediate context and its place in the overall congressional scheme clearly indicate that it is being used not as a defined term of art but in its commonly understood sense.
we found support for our analysis of the applicability of section in the supreme court decision in international longshoremen and warehousemen union juneau spruce.there,the ilwu filed suit against juneau spruce in the district court for the territory of alaska,alleging violations of the labor management relations act.section b of that act provided that an action for violation of its provision could be brought in any district court of the united states.addressing whether the district court of alaska had jurisdiction over the matter,the supreme court accorded great weight to the underlying purpose of the
