william fonner lived at the essex house,a group home in fairfax county operated by fairfax county.fonner works at mount enterprises,a nonprofit organization that provides fonner with vocational training and day support.
samuel durie lived with his adult brother,robert durie.until november,samuel durie and his brother lived in fairfax county with doris burnette,an employee of fairfax county mental retardation services who was assigned to essex house.
while working for mental retardation services,miss burnette met fonner.in,miss burnette arranged for fonner and samuel durie to meet and the two men became friends.fonner and durie began to spend time together at the duries home.because neither fonner nor durie drove,fonner relied on miss burnette and durie brother robert to pick him up at the essex house and take him to the duries home.miss burnette sometimes took fonner to visit samuel durie during her work hours.fonner spent some nights at the duries home.the staff at essex house knew miss burnette occasionally took fonner to visit samuel durie,but miss burnette did not obtain approval from anyone at essex house for the visits.
on may,fonner complained to miss burnette that he had been left alone in a county van for an hour while victor palermo,an essex house employee,was inside another group home.miss burnette reported the incident to her supervisor,and took fonner home to stay with her and the duries that night.an investigation by mental retardation services determined that fonner human rights had not been violated.the investigators report also found communications problems between miss burnette and palermo.the report noted that miss burnette had taken fonner to her home for the night because fonner was upset and that she did not notify her supervisor of her actions.the mental retardation services report recommended that in order to ensure that the professional relationship between staff and the consumer is not compromised,a defined protocol should be put into place and adhered to that addresses under what circumstances it is appropriate for consumers to visit with or at staff homes.there is no evidence in the record that suggests the investigators who completed the report were aware that miss burnette lived with samuel and robert durie.
after the report was issued,alan wooten,the director of mental retardation services,decided to prohibit essex house residents from visiting the homes of essex house staff members.on june,wooten met with miss burnette and her supervisor and explained that fonner could no longer be taken to miss burnette home.wooten told miss burnette that fonner and samuel durie could still meet at essex house or other locations.miss burnette relayed this information to robert durie.
on july,an essex house counselor helped fonner call samuel durie and arrange to meet him at a pizza shop the following thursday.on thursday,durie brother robert picked fonner up at essex house.when fonner returned that evening,he told essex house staff members that robert had stopped to buy spaghetti and then taken fonner back to the duries home for dinner.on august,miss burnette took fonner from essex house and dropped him off at the duries home.on august,fonner again visited the duries home to watch a football game.it is unclear from the record who took fonner to the duries home that day.on august,miss burnette again took fonner to the duries home for lunch.
on september,robert durie went to mount enterprises,where fonner works during the day,and told the staff he was picking fonner up to take him to see an attorney.a staff member found fonner in the lunch room and asked him if he had any appointments that day.fonner said he did not.the staff member then told robert that he could not allow fonner to leave because no prior appointment had been made and robert was not an authorized visitor.mental retardation services asked fonner several times if he wanted to meet with a county human rights advocate or an attorney but fonner stated that he did not want to meet with an attorney.
at some point,which is not clear from the record,miss burnette stopped working for mental retardation services.on october,alan wooten issued a memo stating that fonner was not to have any contact with robert durie or doris burnette.wooten stated that he was concerned robert is attempting to involve william in his own complaint against the county.he stated that he viewed robert durie actions as exploitive of william mental health status.
on october,without notifying any essex house staff,robert durie and samuel durie lawyer,harvey williams,boarded a van used to transport residents of the county group homes.williams spoke with fonner and had fonner sign a retainer agreement.fonner did not receive a copy of the document and when he later told essex house staff members what happened he did not know what he had signed.fonner later told the guardian ad litem that he was afraid when robert durie and harvey williams boarded the van and spoke to him.on april,fonner and durie,both represented by harvey williams,brought the suit which is now appealed in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia.
on august,the defendants filed a motion to appoint a guardian ad litem for fonner,arguing that there was evidence fonner did not want to be involved in the lawsuit.the district court granted the motion and appointed a guardian ad litem on september.after the guardian ad litem submitted her report to the court,the defendants moved to dismiss fonner from the lawsuit.relying on the findings of the guardian ad litem,the district court determined that fonner did not want to proceed with the litigation and granted the defendants motion to dismiss.
after fonner was dismissed,durie gave notice to take the deposition of fonner.the defendants moved for a protective order,arguing that the deposition could be harmful to fonner,and the magistrate judge granted the motion.the district court affirmed the magistrate order.
on march,the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on all counts.fonner,through his counsel,has appealed the district court order dismissing fonner from the case.durie appealed from the district court grant of a protective order preventing fonner deposition,and from the district court order granting summary judgment for the defendants.

fonner counsel objects to fonner dismissal from the case on two grounds.first,he argues that the district court was not authorized to appoint a guardian ad litem under.c absent a determination of incompetency by the commonwealth of virginia.second,fonner counsel argues that the district court decision was not supported by the facts.
we reject these arguments.first.c provides that the district court shall appoint a guardian ad litem fo
