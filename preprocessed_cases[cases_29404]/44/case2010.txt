this appeal arises from the bankruptcy court refusal to give preclusive effect to findings made by the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeal.appellant roy raspanti brought an adversary proceeding against appellee robert burke keaty,in bankruptcy court seeking a determination that a state court judgment against keaty was not dischargeable under a of the bankruptcy code.raspanti asked the bankruptcy court to apply principles of collateral estoppel to the louisiana appellate court findings on the issue of whether the debt arose from a willful and malicious injury as required under a of the bankruptcy code.the bankruptcy court did not give preclusive effect to the state appellate court findings,reasoning that the issue had not been actually litigated at the state court level.instead,the bankruptcy court held a trial to determine if the debt owed by keaty was for a willful and malicious injury.after that trial,the bankruptcy court concluded that the debt owed to raspanti was not for a willful and malicious injury,and the court thus held that the debt was dischargeable.the district court affirmed.we conclude that the bankruptcy court erred in not giving preclusive effect to the state appellate court findings.we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court.
factual and procedural background 
in,connie byrd employed robert burke keaty,thomas keaty,and keaty keaty collectively the keatys to represent her son,gregory byrd,as a plaintiff in a louisiana state court lawsuit.in that suit,the byrds sued two defendants for injuries that gregory sustained at school.in,one of the defendants settled with the byrds.following a fee dispute,the byrds and the keatys executed a compromise agreement by which the keatys received in fees and costs.the keatys continued to represent the byrds at trial against the other defendant,the school board,in the judicial district court for the parish of bossier the bossier parish proceeding.in january,the trial court ruled in favor of the school board,and the keatys subsequently filed a notice of appeal on behalf of the byrds.immediately thereafter,however,the byrds discharged the keatys,and in march,roy raspanti was substituted as counsel.
raspanti represented the byrds in their appeal against the school board.while the appeal was pending,the keatys filed an intervention in the suit seeking additional attorney fees should the appeal against the school board be successful.the appellate court ultimately reversed the judgment in favor of the school board and remanded the case.the school board subsequently agreed to settle the claim,and raspanti was paid in attorney fees.meanwhile,the trial court dismissed on summary judgment the keatys claim for additional fees,reasoning that the compromise agreement executed between the byrds and the keatys settled all of their fee disputes.the keatys appealed the judgment,but the louisiana second circuit court of appeal dismissed the appeal as untimely.
in november,the keatys sued raspanti in the civil district court for the parish of orleans,alleging tortious interference of contract and unjust enrichment and seeking a portion of the attorney fees collected by raspanti.in february,the keatys filed a second suit against raspanti seeking an apportionment of the attorney fees on a quantum meruit basis.the two suits were consolidated.in response,raspanti filed exceptions of prescription,no cause of action,and res judicata,as well as a motion for summary judgment and a motion for sanctions.all of these exceptions and motions were denied.raspanti then requested several admissions from the keatys first,that there was no contract between raspanti and robert keaty,thomas keaty keaty and keaty,and second,that there had never been a contract between any of those parties.keaty raspanti,so d.the keatys denied raspanti request for admissions and responded that their claims encompass ed contractual claims and a claim for apportionment of attorney fees.id.however,the keatys later admitted,in a written opposition to a motion for summary judgment filed by raspanti,that they had no contract with raspanti.id.in light of this,raspanti reurged his motion for summary judgment,making the additional argument that because the keatys already had been denied additional fees from the byrds by the state court in bossier parish,they could not recover additional fees from him.in support,raspanti pointed to prior admissions made by the keatys that the source of their claim was the contract with the byrds and that they had no contract with raspanti.
on august,the trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of raspanti.keaty raspanti,so d.on may,the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeal affirmed.see id.the appellate court reasoned that the bossier parish proceeding had resulted in a final judgment that the keatys could not recover additional fees from the byrds because the compromise agreement encompassed claims for both past and future fees.id.at.thus,the court concluded that since the keatys claim was based on their contract with the byrds,the keatys were precluded from seeking additional fees from raspanti.id.the court also made the observation that the keatys had acknowledged that their tortious interference claim was prescribed.id.
on june,raspanti filed a motion for sanctions against the keatys on the basis that the keatys tortious interference claim was frivolous.in response,the keatys filed exceptions of prescription and res judicata.the trial court granted the keatys exceptions without written reasons,and raspanti appealed to the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeal.
on february,the appellate court reversed the decision of the trial court and held that the keatys exceptions of res judicata and prescription had no merit.the court then went on to assess raspanti sanctions claim de novo.the court,referred to its decision and noted that keaty had no claim for attorney fees against raspanti.the louisiana appellate court then made particular findings regarding the keatys claims.specifically,the court found that the keatys knew their claims had prescribed,that their answers to raspanti request for admissions were disingenuous,and that the proceedings by the keatys were knowingly without foundation,crafted for the purposes of harassment,and designed to prolong the proceedings deliberately and needlessly.id.at.accordingly,the appellate court concluded that the keatys conduct was sanctionable under louisiana and remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing to set the amount of sanctions to be awarded.the state trial court awarded raspanti,which the appellate court increased to on appeal.keaty raspanti,so d.
meanwhile,on december,before the louisiana appellate court reversal,robert burke keaty,keaty and erin kenny keaty filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of louisiana.on april,keaty added raspanti as a creditor.thereafter,on june,raspanti filed a complaint to determine the dischargeability of his debt pursuant to a specifically,raspanti contended that keaty debt,the sanctions assessed by the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeal should not be discharged under a because it was a debt for a willful and malicious injury,bringing a frivolous lawsuit against raspanti.
on october,raspanti filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that the findings of the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeal amounted to a finding that the debt owed by keaty to raspanti resulted from a willful and malicious injury,and thus,under the doctrine of issue preclusion,keaty was barred from relitigating the issue.the bankruptcy court denied raspanti motion on march.the court reasoned that the issue of willful and malicious injury was not actually litigated as required under issue preclusion because neither the louisiana trial court nor the appellate court ever conducted an actual evidentiary hearing regarding keaty conduct.on april,raspanti filed a second motion for summary judgment and attached a copy of the entire state court record.on july,the bankruptcy court again denied raspanti motion.the court again reasoned that the sanctions issue had not been actually litigated so as to support a finding of willful and malicious injury under a because the sanctions issue was decided without the introduction of exhibits,testimony or any other evidence and without any hearing.
thereafter,the bankruptcy court held a trial on raspanti complaint on november.at trial,raspanti relied solely on the state court record.on august,the bankruptcy court issued an order dismissing raspanti complaint with prejudice.in its reasons for decision,the bankruptcy court held that raspanti failed to satisfy his burden of proving each element of a because he presented no evidence that went to keaty intent or subjective motivation.the bankruptcy court specifically rejected raspanti argument,which raspanti had also put forth in his motions for summary judgment,that the state appellate court findings clearly established all the elements of a and that,pursuant to the doctrine of issue preclusion,judgment should be entered in his favor.in rejecting raspanti argument,the bankruptcy court restated the reasoning it articulated when it ruled on raspanti motion issue preclusion require s that an issue be actually litigated in the first instance in order for issue preclusion to apply in the second case.finding that there was never a trial on the issue of sanctions,this court concluded that issue preclusion did not apply.raspanti keaty in re keaty.accordingly,the bankruptcy court refused to give preclusive effect to the state appellate court findings to conclude that raspanti had met his burden of proving the elements of a because the appellate court entered sanctions without a trial or evidentiary hearing whatsoever.id.
raspanti appealed the bankruptcy court decision to the united states district court for the western district of louisiana.the district court adopted the findings of the bankruptcy court and dismissed raspanti appeal.raspanti now appeals to this court,arguing that the district court erred in affirming the bankruptcy court decision.the issue before us is whether,under principles of collateral estoppel,the sanctions issue was actually litigated in the state court such that the louisiana appellate court findings barred the relitigation of the willful and malicious injury requirement of a.

section a of the bankruptcy code excepts from discharge any debt incurred for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity.a.section a of the bankruptcy code specifically provides

for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity 
id.the supreme court,in kawaauhau geiger,d,stated that t he word willful in a modifies the word injury,indicating that nondischargeability takes a deliberate or intentional injury,not merely a deliberate or intentional act that leads to injury.the fifth circuit extended kawaauhau reasoning in miller abrams in re miller,cir,and stated that either objective substantial certainty of injury or subjective motive to injure meets the supreme court definition of willful injury in a.third alteration in original.the court in miller went on to define the word malicious and specifically rejected that it meant an act without just cause or excuse.id.at.instead,the court defined malicious as an act done with the actual intent to cause injury.id.at.the court noted that this definition is synonymous with the definition of willful and thus aggregated willful and malicious into a unitary concept.thus,the court held that an injury is willful and malicious where there is either an objective substantial certainty of harm or a subjective motive to cause harm.id.at see also williams ibew local in re williams,cir.

when giving preclusive effect to a state court judgment,this court must apply the issue preclusion rules of that state.miller,at citing matsushita indus.epstein,d in re king,cir gober,at.here,because the underlying judgment is from the louisiana fourth circuit court of appeal,louisiana issue preclusion rules apply.louisiana law provides in pertinent part 
except as otherwise provided by law,a valid and final judgment is conclusive between the same parties,except on appeal or other direct review,to the following extent 
a judgment in favor of either the plaintiff or the defendant is conclusive,in any subsequent action between them,with respect to any issue actually litigated and determined if its determination was essential to that judgment.
the requirements for issue preclusion under louisiana state law are identical to those recognized by the fifth circuit the parties must be identical the issue to be precluded must be identical to that involved in the prior action the issue must have been actually litigated and the determination of the issue in the prior action must have been necessary to the resulting judgment.charpentier bg wire rope slings,see also matter of whittaker.moreover,this circuit has held that because is modeled on federal doctrine and the restatement of judgments,we can consult federal jurisprudence for guidance when interpreting it.see lafreniere park found.broussard,cir see generally goodman spillers,so d,citing james moore et,moore manual,federal practice and procedure,and restatement second of judgments,cmt.d.
in addition,the scope of collateral estoppel is circumscribed by the particularized findings of the state court.miller,at.thus,c ollateral estoppel applies in bankruptcy courts only if,inter alia,the first court has made specific,subordinate,factual findings on the identical dischargeability issue in is,an issue which encompasses the same prima facie elements as the bankruptcy the facts supporting the court findings are discernible from that court record.dennis dennis in re dennis,cir.therefore,the state court findings must satisfy the elements of the willful and malicious injury requirement.
in the case at hand,the bankruptcy court refused to give preclusive effect to the state appellate court findings because it concluded the sanctions issue whether keaty had filed the claim against raspanti to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation had not been actually litigated in the state court.specifically,the bankruptcy court stated that the sanctions issue had not been actually litigated because there had never been a trial or an evidentiary hearing on the issue.we disagree with the bankruptcy court legal premise.
there is nothing in the case law defining the term actually litigated to require a trial or evidentiary hearing.notably,the bankruptcy court failed to cite any law to the contrary.louisiana law does not mandate that an issue must be decided after a trial or evidentiary hearing to be considered actually litigated.such a requirement is clearly absent from the louisiana statute setting forth the requirements of issue preclusion.see.ann.west.likewise,at the federal level,there is no requirement of a trial or evidentiary hearing to conclude that an issue has been actually litigated.see restatement second of judgments cmt.d stating that an issue is actually litigated when an issue is properly raised,by the pleadings or otherwise,and is submitted for d
