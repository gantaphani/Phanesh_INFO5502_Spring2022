we consider in this case whether the appellants have alleged viable claims under the torture victim protection act tvpa,note,or the alien tort statute ats.the appellants filed a class action complaint under these statutes,alleging that defendant alcolac,a chemical manufacturer,sold thiodiglycol tdg to saddam hussein iraqi regime,which then used it to manufacture mustard gas to attack kurdish enclaves in northern iraq during the late 
in granting alcolac motion to dismiss pursuant to.b,the district court held that corporations are not subject to suit under the tvpa,and that the appellants had not pleaded facts sufficient to support a reasonable inference that alcolac provided tdg to iraq with the purpose of facilitating genocide against the kurds,which the district court determined was an element of a claim under the ats.
we agree with the district court that the tvpa excludes corporations from liability.we further conclude that the ats imposes liability for aiding and abetting violations of international law,but only if the attendant conduct is purposeful.the appellants,however,have failed to plead facts sufficient to support the intent element of their ats claims.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
for purposes of resolving this appeal,we accept as true the facts alleged by the appellants in the amended complaint.in the,the republic of iraq,then under the dictatorial control of saddam hussein,was embroiled in a armed conflict with iran.international news media widely reported and the governments of many countries including the united states,the united kingdom,and germany explicitly condemned the iraqi regime use of mustard gas and other chemical weapons against iran.simultaneously,iraq launched chemical weapon attacks against the kurds in northern iraq,whom hussein accused of collaborating with iran.
as a result,many international businesses,including commercial chemical manufacturers,cut off ties with hussein regime.in april,following the issuance of an investigative report commissioned by the secretary general finding that mustard gas and other chemical weapons had been used in the iraq iran war,an international coalition of governments known as the australia imposed licensing restrictions on the export of chemicals used in the manufacture of chemical weapons.
alcolac,then a subsidiary of the british conglomerate rio tinto zinc,began selling tdg under the trade name kromfax in the early tdg has many lawful commercial applications for example,it is used as a solvent in dyeing textiles and producing inks.as early as,however,alcolac was also aware that tdg could be used to manufacture mustard gas.
representatives from the customs service and the state department specifically warned alcolac that tdg was subject to export restrictions.despite these warnings,in late alcolac fulfilled an order for tons of kromfax from colimex,a german company.this order,about ten times larger than any alcolac had ever received,was eventually transshipped to iran via singapore.
in late and early,alcolac also delivered four shipments of kromfax totaling over one million pounds to nukraft mercantile corporation,a company in brooklyn,new york,with whom alcolac had not previously done business.alcolac knew that nukraft was a shell corporation created to facilitate the purchase of kromfax for shipment to europe and transshipment elsewhere via a swiss company identified as companies,and that nukraft intended to place further orders in the three to six million pound range annually.
in february,alcolac pleaded guilty to a single count of violating the export administration act,app.a,in connection with the kromfax order to colimex.during the plea hearing,the government also proffered facts relating to a sale of kromfax to nukraft that the government believed ultimately reached iraq however,alcolac was not prosecuted for that sale.
the four kromfax shipments that alcolac delivered to nukraft did reach iraq,where they were processed to manufacture mustard gas used to attack the kurds.the iraqi regime use of chemical weapons against the kurds left thousands dead,maimed,or suffering from physical and psychological trauma.
the appellants are individuals of kurdish descent who are either victims of mustard gas attacks or family members of deceased victims.the amended complaint identifies two classes of plaintiffs.the class a plaintiffs,who are citizens and permanent residents,advance claims against alcolac under the tvpa.the class b plaintiffs,who are foreign nationals,assert claims against alcolac under the ats.the district court granted alcolac motion to dismiss by memorandum and order dated june.the appellants filed this timely appeal.
we review de novo a district court decision to dismiss for failure to state a claim,assuming all,nonconclusory factual allegations in the complaint to be true.ashcroft iqbal,d airline pilots ass awappa,llc,cir.to survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b,plaintiffs f actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,thereby nudg ing their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.bell atlantic twombly,d.while a court must accept the material facts alleged in the complaint as true,edwards city of goldsboro,cir,statements of bare legal conclusions are not entitled to the assumption of truth and are insufficient to state a claim,iqbal.at.
we first address the district court dismissal of the tvpa claims.enacted in,the tvpa provides a civil action for recovery of damages from an individual who engages in torture or extrajudicial killing,stat.codified at,note.in pertinent part,the tvpa states as follows 
a liability.an individual who,under actual or apparent authority,or color of law,of any foreign nation 
subjects an individual to torture shall,in a civil action,be liable for damages to that individual or 
subjects an individual to extrajudicial killing shall,in a civil action,be liable for damages to the individual legal representative,or to any person who may be a claimant in an action for wrongful death.
the district court determined that alcolac,as a corporation,is not an individual subject to liability under the tvpa.the district court noted the absence of fourth circuit precedent and the presence of a circuit split on this question.compare khulumani barclay bank,cir dismissing tvpa claim against corporation for the additional reason that only natural persons are subject to liability under it korman,concurring in part and dissenting in part,aff for lack of en banc quorum sub nom.am.isuzu motors,ntsebeza,d with romero drummond,cir allowing tvpa claim to proceed against a corporation.see also aldana del monte fresh produce,cir.here,the district court applied what it found to be the more persuasive view found in judge korman concurring opinion in khulumani.the district court reasoned that the term individual referred in ordinary usage to a human being,described those who can both perpetrate and suffer torture,and should not have a different meaning depending on whether the term identified the perpetrator or the victim of torture.
whether alcolac is an individual within the meaning of the tvpa is a question of statutory interpretation.our objective in all such cases is to ascertain and implement the intent of congress,and congress intent can most easily be seen in the text of the acts it promulgates.broughman carver,cir internal citations and quotations omitted.in that regard,the supreme court has instructed that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.when the words of a statute are unambiguous,then,this first canon is also the last judicial inquiry is complete.crespo holder,cir quoting.bank germain,d.
we hold that the tvpa admits of no ambiguity and congress intent to exclude corporations from liability under the tvpa is readily ascertainable from a reading to that end,unless there is explicit legislative intent to the contrary,we are to give the words of a statute their plain and ordinary meaning.carbon fuel usx,cir.because congress did not define individual in the tvpa,we are bound to give the word its ordinary meaning unless the context suggests otherwise.the plain and ordinary meaning of individual is a single human being.random house webster unabridged dictionary ed.and although the plain and ordinary meaning of person is also a human being,the word often has a broader meaning in the law to include a corporation,a partnership,an estate,or other legal entity recognized by law as having rights and duties.id.
this broader meaning is also consistent with that found in the dictionary act,which prescribes default rules of construction for interpreting acts of congress.as is relevant here,the dictionary act provides that i n determining the meaning of any act of congress,unless the context indicates otherwise the word person include s corporations as well as individuals.thus,congress has directed courts when interpreting a federal statute to give a broader reach to the noun person to include both corporations and individuals.in our view,then,when congress uses the noun individual rather than the broader term person it should ordinarily be construed to mean a human being or natural person.
this presumptive construction strikes us as particularly appropriate because there is no indication congress intended individual to have a variety of meanings throughout the tvpa.bowoto,at.as did the plaintiffs in bowoto,the appellants here ask us to interpret individual to mean a natural person when referring to the victim,but to mean either a natural person or a corporation when referring to the torturer.id.we see no compelling reason,and the appellants have not articulated one,for adopting such a schizophrenic construction of the tvpa.instead,we apply the standard rule of statutory construction urging that identical words used in different parts of a statute be given the same meaning.comm r lundy,d in a case involving the interpretation of the term claim under the internal revenue code,stating that t he interrelationship and close proximity of two statutory provisions presents a classic case for application of the normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning internal citations and quotations omitted.
additionally,we note that the term person appears in the tvpa,in reference to those who may be claimant s in an action for wrongful death,note a.as the circuit recently noted,a claimant under the tvpa could be a juridical person,such as the estate of a decedent.see mohamad,at.we conclude,as did the circuit,that this distinction further supports the significance of the congress having used individual rather than person to identify who may be sued under the tvpa.id.
clinton city of new york,d,a case cited by the appellants,does not persuade us to adopt a reading of individual in the tvpa to include corporations.in clinton,the supreme court determined that congress intended the term individual in the line item veto act to be synonymous with person,including juridical persons such as corporations and associations.id.at.the precise question presented there was whether a corporation could utilize the expedited review provisions of the act authorizing any individual adversely affected to challenge the constitutionality of the line item veto authority given to the president.
although the court recognized that the term individual in ordinary usage often refers to a single human being while person has a broader meaning,id.at,it nevertheless concluded there was no plausible reason why congress would have intended to provide for such special treatment of actions filed by natural persons and to have precluded entirely jurisdiction over comparable cases brought by corporate persons,id.at.simply put,according to the court,a cceptance of the government reading of the act would produce an absurd and unjust result which congress could not have intended.id.quoting grifin oceanic contractors,d.we find the holding in clinton easily distinguishable,as our interpretation of the tvpa far from absurd,unjust,or lacking plausible reason provides a rational and consistent limitation to the tvpa reach.
accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court dismissing the appellants claims under the tvpa.
we turn next to the dismissal of the appellants ats claims and again review the district court holding de novo.the district court assumed that the appellants stated viable ats claims against the republic of iraq,based on international norms that prohibit the development,manufacture,stockpiling,and use of chemical weapons.the appellants,however,do not assert that alcolac directly engaged in these acts,but rather that it aided and abetted iraq in committing them.the gravamen of the appellants ats claims is that alcolac sold quantities of kromfax to nukraft with actual or constructive knowledge that such quantities would ultimately be used by iraq in the manufacture of mustard gas to attack the kurds.
as it did before the district court,alcolac contends here that the ats bars the appellants from seeking relief on an aiding and abetting theory because such a claim is not recognized under international law.alternatively,alcolac contends that the appellants do not allege facts sufficient to show that alcolac acted with the purpose of facilitating genocide against the kurds,which alcolac asserts is an element of the claim the appellants urge that the ats imposes liability for violations of international law on principals as well as aiders and abettors.the appellants argue further that ats aiding and abetting claims do not require a showing of purpose,but that their allegations in the amended complaint met that standard in any event.
the district court assumed the viability of an aiding and abetting claim under international law,but agreed with alcolac that the appellants had failed to allege the requisite mens rea to make out their claims under the ats.we turn now to consider that ruling.
the ats was passed by the first congress as part of the judiciary act of and provides in its current form the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only,committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the united states.the supreme court seminal exposition on the ats arrived in sosa alvarez machain,d,over two centuries after the statute initial enactment.
the court in sosa noted the presence of radically differing historical interpretations of the ats,stemming from uncertainty as to whether the statute simply vested federal courts with jurisdiction,neither creating nor authorizing judicial recognition of any particular rights of action absent further congressional action,or instead enabled federal courts to hear cognizable claims without further congressional action.the court ultimately concluded that the ats is a jurisdictional statute,albeit one that enable s federal courts to hear claims in a very limited category defined by the law of nations and recognized at common law.id.at.
regarding this very limited category of claims,the court found no basis to think that congress was mindful of any specific examples other than those corresponding to violations recognized by the criminal law of england relating to violation of safe conducts,infringement of the rights of ambassadors,and piracy.id.at.in that regard,the court held that courts should require any claim based on the law of nations to rest on a norm of international character accepted by the civilized world and defined with a specificity comparable to the features of the paradigms the court had recognized.id.at.although the court did not undertake to comprehensively delineate a set of norms,the violation of which would give rise to actionable claims under the ats,it nonetheless cautioned a restrained approach to such an exercise.id.specifically,the court stated that although the door is still ajar for the recognition of violations of the law of nations,it is subject to vigilant doorkeeping,and thus open to a narrow class of international norms today.id.at.
the appellants specific claim under the ats is that alcolac aided and abetted the iraqi regime use of mustard gas to attack the kurds.accordingly,we first consider whether the ats permits suits for aiding and abetting a violation of international law and,if so,the requisite mens rea for prosecuting such an action.
following sosa,the precise question of accessorial liability under the ats initially vexed lower federal courts.a few refused to recognize it,reasoning that the supreme court decision in central bank of denver first interstate bank of denver,d,foreclosed the imposition of aiding and abetting liability in civil cases except where expressly authorized by congress see,doe exxon mobil,d.more recently,however,the question of whether the ats recognizes aiding and abetting liability has become,as v irtually every court to address the issue,before and after sosa,has so held,recognizing secondary liability for violations of international law since the founding of the republic.doe vii exxon mobil,wl,at.july,citing the presbyterian church of sudan talisman,cir khulumani,at sinaltrainal coca cola,cir.
in recognizing aiding and abetting claims under the ats,the second circuit and the circuit both held that central bank does not preclude them.doe viii,wl,at khulumani,at katzmann,concurring.these courts determined that because congress gave explicit authority to federal courts to hear claims under the ats committed in violation of the law of nations,the holding in central bank was inapposite.doe vii,wl,at quoting khulumani,at katzmann,concurring internal citation and quotation omitted.and although the eleventh circuit did not explicitly address central bank,it has recognized aiding and abetting liability under the ats.see sinaltrainal at cir romero,at aldana,at.following the lead of our sister circuits,we conclude that aiding and abetting liability is well established under the ats,doe viii,wl,at,and that central bank does not foreclose such claims.
we turn next to the parties competing contentions as to the applicable mens rea for the claim.alcolac urges us to uphold the district court specific intent mens rea standard,which the latter derived from the second circuit opinion in talisman.the talisman panel,in turn,was persuaded by judge katzmann concurring opinion in khulumani and adopted his proposed rule as the law of the circuit.the second circuit held that a defendant may be held liable under international law for aiding and abetting the violation of that law by another when the defendant provides practical assistance to the principal which has a substantial effect on the perpetration of the crime,and does so with the purpose of facilitating the commission of that crime.talisman,at quoting khulumani,at katzmann,concurring.
in drawing a mens rea standard,judge katzmann looked to the rome statute,pursuant to which the international criminal court was created the rome statute of the international criminal court imposes aiding and abetting liability on one who aids and abets the commission of a crime only if he does so f or the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime.khulumani,at quoting rome statute,july.judge katzmann,noting that the rome statute has been signed by countries and ratified by,including most of the mature democracies of the world,took it to constitut e an authoritative expression of the legal views of a great number of states.id.at quoting prosecutor furundzija,case no.it t,trial chamber judgment,int l crim.trib.for the former yugoslavia.
judge katzmann acknowledged that there was some support for a knowledge standard of aiding and abetting liability in tribunal decisions from the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia icty and the international criminal tribunal for rwanda ictr id.at.judge katzmann noted,however,that these decisions arise out of completely distinct factual contexts and often involve defendants who might have been convicted on alternate theories of liability.id.at.further,he noted that panels of the icty occasionally and consciously engaged in discussions peripheral to the ratio decidendi of a case in order to provide clarification that might have some value for the future development of international criminal law.id.internal citations and quotations omitted.finally,he noted inconsistencies in the application of a knowledge mens rea standard in certain of the tribunals prosecutions,citing to one decision that seemed to require that assistance be specifically directed to assist the perpetration of a certain specific crime.id.at citing prosecutor vasiljevic,case no.it a,appeals chamber judgment,i int l crim.trib.for the former yugoslavia.for all these reasons,judge katzmann was unable to find that liability predicated on the knowledge definition of aiding and abetting offered in the decisions of the icty and ictr is sufficiently and universally recognized to trigger jurisdiction for a tort suit under the ats.id.at.
the appellants urge us to reject talisman and instead follow the lead of federal courts that have defined the scope of aiding and abetting liability to reach those who provide knowing assistance that has a substantial effect on the commission of the human rights violation.doe vii,wl,at see also doe i unocal,cir,vacated,reh g en banc granted cir.in doe viii,the circuit held that knowledge embodies the mens rea standard for imposing aiding and abetting liability under the ats,finding that the decisions of the icty and ictr were in fact more authoritative than the rome statute.the court analysis looked to customary international law to determine the standard for assessing aiding and abetting liability,because c onsistent with sosa,the question is whether the international community would express definite disapprobation toward aiding and abetting conduct only when based on a particular standard.wl,at.the court found that the icty and ictr,as international tribunals mandated by their charter to apply only customary international law,constituted authoritative sources of that law.id.the circuit concluded that prosecutions before those tribunals have declared that the knowledge standard suffices under customary international law.id.
the circuit also rejected the rome statute as an authoritative source of the proper mens rea standard after concluding that it is properly viewed in the nature of a treaty and not as customary international law.id.at.the court specifically cited article of the rome statute,declaring that the statute is not to be interpreted as limiting or prejudicing in any way existing or developing rules of international law.id.the court also reasoned that,as a treaty,the rome statute binds only the countries that have ratified it and noted that the united states has not.id.finally,the court cited an international criminal court icc prosecution in which the icc recognized that the rome statute did not necessarily represent customary international law.id.citing prosecutor germain katanga and mathieu ngudjolo chui,case no.icc,decision on the confirmation of charges.
the district court accepted the second circuit analysis in talisman concluding that where liability hinges on a theory of aiding and abetting the principal actor,a plaintiff must allege that the defendant acted with the purpose of facilitating the violation of an international norm.finding that the amended complaint failed to plead facts sufficient to establish that alcolac sold kromfax to nukraft with the purpose of facilitating genocide,the district court dismissed the ats claims.
we are persuaded by the second circuit talisman analysis and adopt it as the law of this circuit.in that regard,we agree that sosa guides courts to international law to determine the standard for imposing accessorial liability,given sosa command that courts limit liability to violations of international law with definite content and acceptance among civilized nations equivalent to the historical paradigms familiar when the ats was enacted.talisman,at quoting sosa,at internal alterations omitted.
we recall that the ats confers jurisdiction over any civil action by an alien for a tort only,committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the united states.thus,we must necessarily look to the law of nations to determine the reach of the statu
