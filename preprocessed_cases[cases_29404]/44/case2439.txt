plaintiff cornelius hoevenaar is a native american of cherokee ancestry currently serving a life sentence in the ohio prison system.while incarcerated,hoevenaar began to practice a native religion which prohibits him from cutting his hair.as a result,hoevenaar claims that prison rules regulating hair length violate his right to practice his religious beliefs and are in violation of the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of rluipa,et.
following a hearing on the plaintiff request for a temporary injunction,the district court granted limited relief under rluipa,allowing hoevenaar to maintain a kouplock a two inch by two inch square section at the base of the skull that is grown longer than the person remaining hair.this court reversed the district court decision,in light of cutter wilkinson,cir,rev,d,which held that the rluipa was unconstitutional.hoevenaar lazaroff.cir,vacated by,d.subsequently,the supreme court reversed this court decision in cutter and remanded the instant matter for further consideration in light of its holding.following remand from the supreme court,this court ordered the parties to file letter briefs to address warden lazaroff alternative arguments for reversing,which were not addressed in this court prior decision.
again,after reviewing this matter,we conclude that the district court failed to give proper deference to prison officials with respect to the issue of whether a kouplock presented security,identity,or other concerns similar or in addition to those presented by the grooming regulation in general.therefore,we again reverse the decision of the district court granting injunctive relief to hoevenaar.
background 
at times relevant to this proceeding,hoevenaar was incarcerated at the madison correctional institution serving a life sentence.beginning around,hoevenaar began following the practices of his native american religion,which include growing his hair long.he claims that a fundamental tenet of this religion prohibits the cutting of his hair.this practice,however,is not permitted by an ohio prison regulation that provides 
haircuts shall be provided as needed.hair and hairstyles shall be clean,neatly trimmed and shall not extend over the ears or the shirt collar.hair and hairstyle shall not protrude more than three inches from the scalp.braids and plaits may be worn subject to the limitations of this rule.the following hairstyles or facial hair are not permitted initials,symbols,dyes,multiple parts,hair disproportionately longer in one area than another excluding natural baldness,weaves,wigs,dreadlocks and shaved heads.other hairstyles not specifically listed herein may be prohibited if they are determined to be either a threat to security or contrary to other legitimate penological concerns.
ohio admin.code d.
as a result of the conflict presented,hoevenaar commenced an administrative proceeding challenging the relevant portion of the regulation.on february,he was notified by the office of chief inspector that his grievance had been denied and that the decision of the inspector was affirmed.the chief inspector further instructed that unless you have a court ordered exemption,you are obligated to adhere to the inmate grooming code as stated in administrative rule.
after his administrative grievance was denied,hoevenaar filed suit challenging the ohio regulation under the rluipa.following a hearing on the plaintiff request for a temporary injunction,the district court granted limited relief allowing hoevenaar to maintain a kouplock.in addressing hoevenaar likelihood of success,the court analyzed his rluipa claims as well as his first amendment claim 
as the district court noted,rluipa is similar to the religious freedom restoration act of rfra in that the court must determine whether the plaintiff is likely to succeed in demonstrating that the regulation in issue imposes a substantial burden on his religious exercise.hoevenaar lazaroff,d.assuming the plaintiff makes this initial showing,the court next considers whether the regulations meet strict scrutiny,the regulation must be the least restrictive means towards furthering a compelling governmental interest.cutter.at quoting a.again,this test is the same as that previously imposed under rfra.
the district court found that warden lazaroff was significantly likely to satisfy his burden of demonstrating that the grooming regulation furthers a compelling state interest in identifying prison inmates and suppressing contraband in prisons.hoevenaar,d at.notwithstanding this finding,it concluded that the warden was unlikely to succeed in demonstrating that blanket application of the regulation,without individual exceptions,would be the least restrictive means of furthering the government interest in the efficient identification of escaped inmates.id.at.according to the district court,an exception to the grooming regulation that would allow for the growing of a kouplock based on sincerely held religious beliefs,and would be granted to inmates who are determined not to pose a significant security risk,is a less restrictive means of furthering the compelling interest in identifying inmates.id.
in addition to requiring prison officials to consider the particular hair style in issue,the district court indicated that the officials should consider the inmate particular security classification and any specific medical condition that would bear on his security risk.according to the district court 
just as the defendant takes into consideration the fact that female inmates,as a whole,pose less of a security risk than male inmates as a justification for allowing female inmates to grow their hair long,so should the defendant take into account the different security risks of various male inmates in making the decision of whether to allow them to grow a kouplock.in particular,here,the plaintiff will likely succeed in demonstrating that,as a medium security prisoner who is losing feeling in his feet due to neuropathy resulting from diabetes,he is unlikely to pose a security threat by being permitted to grow a kouplock.
based on these findings,the district court concluded that limited injunctive relief should be granted,allowing hoevenaar to maintain a kouplock.
standard of review 
we review the grant of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion,but questions of law are reviewed de novo.detroit free press ashcroft,cir.in particular,the district court analysis of whether the prison regulations were the least restrictive means is a question of law,subject to de novo review.lawson singletary,cir hamilton schriro,cir.
warden lazaroff argues that the absolute ban on long hair promotes security by preventing inmates from hiding contraband in their hair,and prevents inmates from quickly changing their appearance after a by cutting their hair.hoevenaar counters that these concerns can be satisfied by less restrictive alternatives to warden lazaroff absolute kouplock ban,such as allowing inmates to grow their hair long,but requiring them to be subjected to periodic hair searches,conducted by the prisoners under the supervision of prison officials taking pictures of inmates with and without long hair to distribute in the event of an escape and permitting,on a basis,those inmates with a low security risk to grow a kouplock.the district court concluded that,while hoevenaar would likely lose on his first two alternatives,he had a significant likelihood of success on his third proposed less restrictive alternative.hoevenaar,d at.
in contesting hoevenaar assertion that the prison could permit inmates with sincerely held religious beliefs to grow a kouplock,provided that the inmate was,warden lazaroff argued that 
escape attempts and contraband problems arise even in minimum and medium security prisons.thus,it would not be helpful to assume that minimum or medium security inmates would not pose the security risks attempted to be prevented by these regulations.moreover,the defendant maintains that individualized exemptions are problematic because they cause resentment among the other inmates,a copycat effect,and problems with enforcement of the regulations due to staff
