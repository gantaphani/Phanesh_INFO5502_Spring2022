in october,jatinder sharma purchased from khalil ahmad and mahrah butt two restaurant franchises a checkers and an auntie anne which were located in a store in gainesville,virginia.he paid for the restaurants,a price negotiated and based on a multiple of the gross sales of the restaurants.when,after closing,the restaurants sales only achieved percent of what had been represented,sharma uncovered evidence leading him to believe that the sales figures supplied by ahmad had been manipulated to falsely increase them.sharma commenced this action for fraud and conspiracy,seeking as damages the difference between the price he paid and the actual value of the restaurants based on a multiple of the restaurants actual sales.
the district court granted the defendants summary judgment,concluding that the plaintiffs had not introduced adequate evidence of their damages,particularly of the actual value of the restaurants at the time of the sale.we conclude,however,that the plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence to create a dispute of material fact as to the amount of their damages.accordingly,we vacate and remand for further proceedings.
ahmad and butt were partners in usa international,llc,the entity that owned and operated the checkers and auntie anne restaurants.through their accountant,sharma learned that ahmad and butt were interested in selling the restaurants,and he became interested in purchasing them when the accountant told him that the restaurants were generating high sales figures.
during negotiations,sharma was provided usa international tax returns and financial statements prepared by the accountant indicating that the restaurants combined sales for november and december were approximately per month.ahmad later provided sharma with additional financial statements for january and february showing somewhat lower sales,but he explained that sales were typically lower during that time of the year and assured sharma that they would increase as the year went on.
the accountant prepared a conditional asset purchase agreement,which the parties executed in march.this preliminary agreement specified a purchase price of and made the sale of the restaurants contingent on the stores reaching in combined monthly sales during the two months prior to settlement.after executing the agreement,ahmad provided sharma with two further financial statements prepared by his accountant.one statement covered the period from january through march and showed average monthly sales of,and the other covered april and showed sales of.
in april,sharma met with checkers corporate officials to obtain approval of the transfer of the franchise.during that meeting,checkers officials told sharma that,based on the restaurants profitability,a purchase price of was too high.
following this meeting with checkers,sharma reopened negotiations with ahmad and the two agreed to a lower sales price of.in the final purchase agreement that was executed in may,the monthly sales contingency was deleted and the sales price was allocated between the two restaurants for the checkers and for the auntie anne.
in preparation for closing,sharma formed haymarket fast foods,to take title to the restaurants and submitted a loan application to his bank for a portion of the purchase price.in his application,he indicated,based on the financials submitted by ahmad,that the restaurants had an average monthly gross sales of for the eight months ending in august.the closing took place on october.
shortly after sharma took over the operation of the restaurants,he noticed that his sales figures were only about percent of the sales figures he had been given by ahmad.seeking to investigate the reason for the slow sales,he asked employees at two of his food vendors whether his supply orders in the first weeks of operation were different from those of usa international.both vendors indicated that sharma purchases were in line with prior purchases that had been made by usa international,and this was confirmed by usa international earlier food purchase orders issued to the vendors.this fact provided sharma a red alert because,in his view,the restaurants simply could not generate the amount of sales that ahmad had reported without having purchased more food supplies.he began to suspect that the defendants had somehow inflated their sales numbers and reported those inflated sales numbers in the income statements that had been supplied to him.
pursuing the matter further,sharma reviewed his cash registers transaction histories and observed that,on several occasions,many sales in high dollar amounts were processed in quick succession.these sales were all rung up while mahrah butt one of the partners of usa international and manager of the checkers restaurant was logged into the cash register.in addition,employees who had worked at checkers before sharma took over told sharma that butt had many times and on many different days rung up sales that no customer had placed and had directed employees not to make sandwiches even though receipts for them had been printed.
sharma also conducted an analysis of the bank of america accounts into which usa international had deposited its proceeds,both from credit card transactions and cash.those deposits were substantially lower than the amounts represented in the sales records provided to sharma.for example,for the period from may to july,the bank account statements showed deposits from credit card transactions and cash in the total amount of.the reported sales figures for that period,however,indicated that the total sales were,an apparent overstatement of over.
sharma and haymarket commenced this fraud action in december in virginia state court,naming usa international,ahmad,and butt as defendants,and the defendants removed the action to federal court.in their complaint,the plaintiffs alleged that,by inflating sales figures and lying about those figures during negotiations,the defendants fraudulently induced sharma to pay for a business that was worth far less.the complaint also asserted a claim for conspiracy to commit fraud.the plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages.
after discovery,the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment,contending that the plaintiffs could not establish their damages with reasonable certainty and that,in any event,the plaintiffs presented insufficient evidence of their reliance on and the materiality of the alleged misrepresentations.
in considering the motion,the district court concluded that the plaintiffs had presented sufficient evidence to show that the defendants made false representations of material fact with the intent to mislead the plaintiffs about the value of the restaurants and that the plaintiffs reasonably relied on those representations.the court nonetheless concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to submit sufficient evidence to allow a factfinder to estimate with reasonable certainty the amount of damages plaintiffs sustained.
while the court assumed that the sales price of adequately evidenced the restaurants value,it found insufficient evidence of the restaurants actual value at the time of the sale,which the plaintiffs had claimed was.specifically,the court rejected the two methods proposed by the plaintiffs to reach the actual value that they claimed,which were multiplying the restaurants weekly sales by,or multiplying the restaurants monthly earnings before interest,tax,depreciation,and amortization ebitda by.as the court explained 
plaintiffs methods of calculation,as explained in their answers to interrogatories and in sharma deposition testimony,do not conform to any of the generally accepted methods of business valuation,nor has plaintiff offered sufficient evidence that their methods are independently reliable.
because damages are a necessary element of a fraud claim under virginia law,the court granted the defendants summary judgment on the fraud claim.it also granted the defendants summary judgment on the conspiracy claim,finding no record evidence suggesting a meeting of the minds between ahmad and butt.
from the district court judgment dated july,the plaintiffs filed this appeal,challenging only the
