the instant appeal arises from the settlement of a tort action brought by terrence merritt against,inter alia,the owner and the operator of a virginia resort.merritt lawsuit sought damages for an alleged food poisoning he suffered while at the resort.the defendants agreed to settle the action for million,million of which was funded through an interim agreement between three insurance companies paul fire and marine insurance company paul,cna casualty company of california,cna and american international specialty lines insurance company,aislic.the companies agreed to resolve their coverage and allocation issues after the lawsuit settled.
subsequently,paul filed suit against cna,aislic,and a fourth insurer,tig insurance company tig who did not contribute to the settlement,requesting a declaration of the four insurers respective liability respecting the settlement.paul sought to recover the million it had already contributed,arguing that it had no obligation to cover any portion of the settlement.exercising diversity jurisdiction,the district court granted aislic motion for summary judgment and denied paul motion for summary judgment.the court also ordered tig to pay million plus interest toward the underlying settlement.for the reasons that follow,we reverse and remand.
in,vms lansdowne limited partnership vms lansdowne and benchmark management company benchmark management entered into a master management agreement mma relative to the management and operation of lansdowne resort referred to in the mma as the project,a resort and conference center in leesburg,virginia.according to the mma,benchmark management is the operator of the sole and exclusive management company under the vms lansdowne is the owner.the mma specifies that all management have to be employees of the operator,and that all other employees working in or about the project shall be employees of a subsidiary of operator.benchmark conference resorts of virginia benchmark conference,a subsidiary of benchmark management,was incorporated for that very purpose.
among its numerous sections,the mma includes indemnification provisions that require,generally speaking,that vms lansdowne indemnify benchmark management and its agents from liability arising from ordinary negligence or the like at the resort,but that the opposite occur as to liability arising from gross negligence,fraud,or willful conduct.
the mma also requires that comprehensive general liability insurance in the amount of million,and excess umbrella liability insurance in the amount of million,be maintained for the project in the name of the owner and the operator.accordingly,vms lansdowne purchased insurance policies effective december from cna and aislic.the cna general liability policy provides million in primary coverage,and the aislic umbrella liability policy provides million of coverage in excess of the cna policy collectively,the line.both policies list vms lansdowne as a named insured and extend coverage to vms lansdowne real estate manager.a named insured endorsement for the cna policy listed vms lansdowne development vms development,vms lansdowne subsidiary,and lansdowne resort.
benchmark management and benchmark conference also procured coverage for themselves from paul and tig.the paul policy provides million in primary coverage,and the tig policy provides million of umbrella coverage in excess of the paul policy collectively,the line.notably,each of the four policies includes some form of other insurance provision specifying that the policy will serve as excess insurance over,will not respond until the exhaustion of any other valid and collectible insurance for damage covered by that policy.
pursuant to the settlement agreement,cna,and paul agreed to resolve all claims against the remaining named defendants vms lansdowne,vms development,benchmark management,and benchmark conference,all of which were alleged to be jointly and severally liable by the merritt complaint.the settlement agreement establishes the named defendants collective liability for the million settlement amount,but explicitly does not resolve the controversy among the insurers as to their ultimate liabilities.
in proceedings before the district court,paul,tig,and aislic filed for summary judgment aislic motion was granted,and paul and tig motions were denied.in its analysis,the district court accepted appellants argument that the line was procured to provide and should be accordingly interpreted to provide coverage only if the coverage lapsed or was exhausted.because it was undisputed that benchmark management was covered under the line by virtue of being vms lansdowne real estate manager,the court concluded that paul and tig were shielded from any obligation to cover benchmark management liability from the settlement.
the court concluded,however,that the same result did not follow for benchmark conference.benchmark conference was not listed by name in the cna and aislic policies,was not covered simply by virtue of being benchmark management subsidiary,and did not qualify,in the court view,under any provision in the cna and policies.thus,the court concluded that paul and tig were benchmark conference primary and excess insurers,and thus were obligated to pay into the settlement.
the district court proceeded to allocate the payment of the settlement between the settling parties insurers.the district court first decided that it was unnecessary to allocate payment between cna and paul because,as primary insurers of the settling parties,their policy limits million apiece would necessarily be exhausted.then,construing tig and aislic as concurrent excess insurers,the district court equally divided the remaining million there between.since tig had not yet contributed to the settlement,the court ordered tig to fulfill its assessed obligation,with interest to account for its delay.
paul appeals the district court order denying its motion for summary judgment and granting aislic for summary judgment tig appeals the district court consequent order requiring that it pay million plus interest towards the underlying settlement.we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,affirming only if there are no material facts in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.hitachi credit am.signet bank,cir.because we reverse the district court grant of aislic motion for summary judgment and accompanying order of payment directed to tig,as well as its denial of paul diametrically opposed motion for summary judgment,in assessing the record is undisputed in all material grant aislic the benefit of all reasonable inferences.see rossignol voorhaar,cir,cert.denied,d detailing method for treating for summary judgment.
each side makes several arguments on appeal.in brief,paul and tig appellants argue that the district court erred in implicitly rejecting their arguments that benchmark conference is insured under the lines as,vms lansdowne real estate manager or because benchmark conference did business as lansdowne resort,which is listed as an insured under the cna policy.for its part,aislic defends the district court division of liability among the four insurers,but on different grounds than that court expressed.but appellants also contend,and we agree,that even if the district court did not err in this regard,vms lansdowne is obligated under the mma to indemnify benchmark management and benchmark conference for their share of the settlement,an obligation that should be assessed before any conflicts between the policies are resolved.so in the end,we largely disregard the parties arguments about the various policies,for this case resolution is controlled by the mma indemnification provisions.
as might be expected from the facts,the ultimate determination for this,the respective liability of each insurer on for summary not simple.however,because the liability of an insurer is a question of contract stemming from its contractual obligation to cover its insured liabilities,see,hudgins jones,the logical first step is to determine the respective obligations of the insureds in this case under the settlement.once that is determined,we must decide how much of the settlement amount to allocate to each party that is a question of contribution between joint tortfeasors governed by the law of virginia,where the alleged tort occurred.see buchanan doe.only after completing these initial steps do we determine the insurers respective obligations to cover the settlement liability.
as originally filed,the underlying action named five defendants vms lansdowne,vms development,benchmark management,benchmark conference,and benchmark hospitality.but by settlement time benchmark hospitality had dropped out,leaving the other four as the named defendants to the suit.appellants contend that the natural division of the settlement liability is equally between the four settling parties.
aislic,however,asserts that the settlement should be divided three ways between the vms entities,vms lansdowne and vms development,benchmark management,and benchmark conference only.as support,aislic notes that the sole basis for the liability asserted in the complaint for each vms entity is of the resort.in contrast,the complaint named benchmark conference and benchmark management for separate reasons the former employed the culinary persons and the latter sold the food.from this distinction aislic reasons that the vms entities,the collective owner,should only be assigned one share of the settlement liability,with one going to benchmark conference,the employer,and one going to benchmark management,the operator.br.of appellee at.
but aislic proposed division is contrary to the general rule in virginia,and without any identified basis in law.as joint tortfeasors,the named defendants are each liable for the entire settlement amount,the allocation of which is a question of contribution.see ohio cas.ins.state farm fire and cas.generally,such joint liability is allocated by equal division between the liable parties.see wiley jackson city of norfolk,the right to contribution is based on the broad principles of equity that where two or more persons are subject to a common burden it shall be borne equally.
moreover,the settlement agreement provides no support for treating the vms entities differently than the benchmark entities benchmark management and benchmark conference when apportioning liability.in particular,the settlement agreement mentions both vms lansdowne and vms development as defendants to the very suit that the agreement settled and establishes the collective liability of the defendants,emphasis added,which necessarily includes vms development.moreover,the record suggests that if vms development was improperly sued,it could have been dismissed from the case prior to settlement,as benchmark hospitality was.in sum,aislic presents no recognized equitable argument for its proposed allocation of liability,and we see none.nationwide mut.ins.jewel tea,explaining ways in which an alleged joint tortfeasor might challenge his obligation to contribute to a compromise settlement.accordingly,we assess each of the four named defendants an equal share of the settlement 
since there are no genuine issues of material fact,in a simpler case we would just proceed to construe the policies at issue and assess liability to each insurer in accordance with its policy obligations to each insured.here,however,our analysis is complicated by each side conflicting assertions.
for its part,aislic concedes that benchmark management is insured under both insurance lines.but aislic rejects the district court conclusion below,and appellants argument in this court,that with respect to benchmark management,the line provides contingent excess coverage applicable only if the line is exhausted or fails to respond.aislic reasons that the policies in each line contain other insurance clauses also known as excess insurance clauses that,on their face,would make the coverage provided by those policies excess insurance relative to the insurance provided by the policies of the other line.since there is,aislic contends,no reason to consider either line other insurance provisions superior to the other,the other insurance clauses are mutually repugnant,requiring equal division of benchmark management liability between the two lines.and if benchmark conference is also considered to be insured by all four insurance polices,aislic contends the same result must follow for its settlement share.
for appellants part,they first contend,and we agree,that in analyzing the insurance policies,the district court only construed the indemnification provisions as an attempt by appellants to use extrinsic evidence to modify the terms of the cna and aislic policies.the district court thus failed to address appellants argument that vms lansdowne is obligated to indemnify benchmark conference,and the line to insure that liability,regardless of whether benchmark conference was itself insured under that line.but if,as appellants contend,the settlement liabilities of the benchmark entities must be indemnified by vms lansdowne,and if the line must cover vms lansdowne indemnification duty in full,then paul and tig would have no obligation to pay into the settlement.
in proving up that contention,appellants argue that the cna and aislic policies must respond first to satisfy the settlement because the mma requires vms lansdowne to indemnify benchmark management,as the operator,and benchmark conference,as benchmark management agent,for their share of the settlement.in this regard,appellants rely on cases that give priority to indemnification agreements between the insured in assessing the respective obligations of the insurers and hold that such agreements may prevent the indemnitee insurer from being liable for a settlement arising from a covered loss,notwithstanding the existence of an other insurance clause in the indemnitor insurance policy.in response,aislic denies the applicability of the indemnification provisions and suggests that,in any event,such issues should be deferred for a separate proceeding.
we agree with appellants,and predict that under these circumstances virginia would apply the indemnification provisions now rather than wait for a subsequent action that would produce the same result.moreover,we conclude that the indemnification provisions control the allocation of liability between the insurers in this case because it results in vms lansdowne having responsibility for the benchmark entities shares of the settlement.since that results in the line having no obligation to cover any of the settlement liability,the alleged conflict between the two lines other insurance provisions is irrelevant.
appellants claim respecting the mma indemnification provisions rests heavily on stores,rli ins,cir.in that case,the eighth circuit predicted that arkansas would follow the growing trend of jurisdictions that allowed valid,enforceable indemnification agreements to determine the allocation of liability in an insurance dispute.id.at.in particular,the general rule,as stated by a leading commentator,is that an indemnity agreement between the insureds or a contract with an indemnification clause may shift an entire loss to a particular insurer notwithstanding the existence of an other insurance clause in its policy.id.quoting lee russ thomas segalla,couch on insurance,at ed.
the dispute in stores arose out of a sales agreement between cheyenne,a distributor of halogen lamps,and,which sold those lamps at retail.the agreement required cheyenne to indemnify for any liability arising from sale of the lamps.after one of the lamps malfunctioned,the injured plaintiff sued and cheyenne in state court.cheyenne had procured insurance covering itself and from paul,which provided million primary coverage,and from rli,which provided million in excess coverage over the paul policy,coverage which extended to cheyenne contractual indemnity obligation to,however,was also covered by its own million policy with another insurer,national union,which did not cover cheyenne.the rli policy was excess to any policy,which included the national union policy.
the underlying suit was settled for million.paul paid million of that settlement,and the remaining million was paid by rli,which reserved the right to seek recovery from and national union.subsequently,and national union brought a declaratory judgment action to determine whether either was obligated for any part of the settlement.rli counterclaimed,contending that its policy applied in excess of national union,so that it was entitled to contribution from national union,primary insurer,for all or part of the million it had paid.
in an extensively researched opinion,the eighth circuit predicted that arkansas would give priority to the indemnity agreement at issue in that case in assessing the relative obligations of the insureds before allocating payment of the settlement between the insurers,and accordingly held that neither national union nor was obligated to contribute anything to the underlying settlement.thus,despite rli policy providing excess coverage over national union as to,rli,as cheyenne insurer,was liable for the entire million remainder of the settlement.
the stores court justified its decision for several reasons relevant to this case.first,the court stated that examination of the relationships between the parties has convinced us that cheyenne intended to and did make a valid promise to indemnify for claims arising from the halogen lamps.id.at.second,the court determined that rli provided liability insurance to cheyenne that covers both the boykin settlement and cheyenne indemnification obligation.id.third,the court explained that under the circumstances of that case,consideration of the indemnity agreement reflects the intention of and relationship between the parties and does not unfairly prejudice the insurers.id.finally,the court reasoned that consideration of cheyenne indemnification obligation at that stage in the litigation was proper because mak ing or national union liable to rli the anticipated result of considering the policies without consideration of the indemnification agreement would simply be the first step in a circular chain of litigation that ultimately would end with rli still having to pay the million.id.
the opinion in stores demonstrates that several jurisdictions have addressed the issue with which we are faced.nevertheless,the parties have identified no virginia precedents that explicitly recognize the principles discussed in that case,and,except where virginia cases are cited in our analysis below,our independent research has revealed little of direct,or even indirect,import to the question of whether the mma indemnification provisions should be considered in assessing the coverage responsibilities of the insurers in this case.thus,we must predict how virginia would address the issue.
as a federal court sitting in diversity,we are obliged to apply the jurisprudence of the supreme court of virginia on issues of virginia law see private mortg.inv,hotel and club,cir.where,as here,that court has spoken neither directly nor indirectly on the particular issue before us,we are called upon to predict how that court would rule if presented with the issue.id.in so predicting how that court would decide the issue,we may consider the teachings of treatises,as well as the practices of other states.wade danek,cir.
here,a prominent treatise has acknowledged the well recognized principle applied in stores.am.indem.lloyds travelers prop.cas.ins,cir citing couch on insurance.further,all indications are that most,if not all,jurisdictions to have faced the question of whether an indemnification agreement could relieve particular insurers of an obligation to pay,without resort to a separate action to enforce the indemnification agreement,have answered in the affirmative.see id.at collecting and discussing cases stores,at same 
while we do not belabor the issue as to every point for which virginia law is unclear,we believe that the cases and principles relied on in stores,and applied herein,represent general practices and the majority position on the respective issues,see id.at reaching similar conclusion,and would be adopted by the supreme court of virginia in the appropriate case.as stated by the fifth circuit in predicting that texas would apply the rules recognized in stores to reach a similar result,t he holding and reasoning of the well considered stores opinion are applicable here.am.indem.lloyds,at.in particular,we think virginia would give priority to the mma indemnification provisions at least where the record evidence demonstrates that all of the relevant considerations relied on in stores favored considering the indemnification provisions in this proceeding rather than a later one.an examination of whether such is actually the case here follows.
the first issue is whether vms lansdowne is obligated to indemnify both benchmark management and benchmark conference for their respective shares of the settlement.section of the mma,entitled mutual indemnification,contains provisions specifying when either the owner,vms lansdowne,or the operator,benchmark management,is obligated to indemnify the other and possibly other parties.under these provisions,vms lansdowne is obligated to indemnify and hold harmless benchmark management,its agents,and employees from and against any liability,loss,damage,cost or expense caused by 
any act or omissions,negligent,tortious or otherwise,of any agent or employee of vms lansdowne or benchmark management in the performance of this agreement,except this provision will not apply to any such liability arising from any fraud,willful misconduct or gross negligence of benchmark management,its employees or agents.
conversely,benchmark management is obligated to 
indemnify and hold harmless vms lansdowne,its agents and employees from and against any liability,loss,damage,cost or expense arising from any fraud,willful misconduct or gross negligence of benchmark management,its agents and employees.
thus,assuming the settlement liability otherwise falls under the scope of the provisions,the classification of the settlement liability as arising from ordinary negligence or the like on one hand,or as gross negligence or the like on the other,will determine whether the indemnification obligation rests on vms lansdowne or on benchmark management.
on this point,however,aislic claims that because the underlying litigation was settled prior to trial,the record does not demonstrate whether indemnification would run only from the owner to the operator.indeed,given the reciprocality of the indemnification provisions,obligations to indemnify could,aislic claims,run both ways.in light of this uncertainty,aislic suggests that determination of indemnification obligations under the mma is best left for a subsequent action.
we reject aislic contention the record evidence is more than sufficient to conclude that the settled liability did not arise from fraud,gross negligence,or willful conduct,but instead arose from acts or omissions on the order of ordinary negligence,for which vms lansdowne is obligated under the mma to provide indemnification.for one,this settlement agreement here memorialize d the final compromise and settlement of the action brought by the plaintiff against the named defendants.thus,we can only look to the plaintiff lawsuit as it stood at the time of settlement.
and while the settlement agreement is silent on this point,the complaint for the action that agreement settled is not.neither the facts merritt pled nor the types of claims merritt asserted,as represented in his final amended complaint,give rise to any suggestion that his food poisoning was caused by the type of action for which benchmark management would have to indemnify vms lansdowne.for example,gross negligence requires action which shows indifference to others,disregarding prudence to the level that the safety of others is completely neglected it is negligence which shocks people wilby gostel.the underlying action,though,arose from an alleged incident of food poisoning that occurred while the plaintiff was attending the resort.as might be expected,the actual claims against the named defendants were based on theories of breach of warranty,negligence,negligence per se,and res ipsa of which give rise to an indemnification obligation solely on behalf of vms lansdowne.the facts pled by me
