opinion of the court 
this appeal presents two questions first,whether pennsylvania rule of civil procedure,requiring the filing of a certificate of merit in malpractice cases,is substantive law that federal courts must apply under erie tompkins.and second,if the rule is substantive state law,did the appellant comply we answer both questions in the affirmative and will,as a result,reverse the district court dismissal of the appellant complaint and remand this matter for further proceedings.
in this diversity case,appellant elizabeth liggon redding filed suit pro se against attorney robert sugarman,alleging that he committed legal malpractice while representing her in a medical malpractice case in pennsylvania state court in particular,she alleged that her medical malpractice case was dismissed by the state court because sugarman was negligent in failing to retain an expert.sugarman,also proceeding pro se in the district court,defaulted on the complaint but successfully moved to vacate the default,explaining the circumstances that gave rise to it and also summarizing his defense to liggon redding claim in essence,that liggon redding subsequent treating physician told him that liggon redding previous physician had not been negligent,and that he could not locate an expert to testify to the contrary.the district court then permitted him to file an answer.sugarman died while this case was pending in the district court and his estate was substituted as a defendant.
pennsylvania law requires a plaintiff to file a certificate of merit within days after filing a professional negligence complaint.liggon redding certificate was due by january,but she did not file a certificate within that time.sugarman,however,did not raise that issue either in his answer filed three days before that deadline or later by separate motion.the district court entered a routine scheduling order on january.then,on february,the district court sua sponte entered an order directing the parties to file briefs regarding pennsylvania certificate of merit requirement the order correctly noted that the pennsylvania rules require 
a certificate of merit signed by the attorney or party that either 
an appropriate licensed professional has supplied a written statement that there exists a reasonable probability that defendant conduct fell outside acceptable professional standards and that such conduct was a cause in bringing about the harm,or 
expert testimony of an appropriate licensed professional is unnecessary for prosecution of the claim.
civ.a emphasis added.the order also quoted the note to the latter provision,which states 
in the event that the attorney certifies under subdivision a that an expert is unnecessary for prosecution of the claim,in the absence of exceptional circumstances the attorney is bound by the certification and,subsequently,the trial court shall preclude the plaintiff from presenting testimony by an expert on the questions of standard of care and causation.
civ.a,note.
in response to this order,liggon redding filed a document entitled certificate of merit,in which she stated in relevant part at the conference when you asked if i wanted or needed an expert and i said no,will that be deemed under rule as expert testimony of an appropriate licensed professional is unnecessary for prosecution of the claim the district court did not directly answer her question and,instead,entered a second order on march,amending its previous order to allow plaintiff days from the date of this order to submit a certificate of merit,and again quoting the relevant language of rule.within those days,liggon redding filed two more documents.the first is captioned motion on certificate of merit requirement,and states in relevant part the plaintiff has not failed to comply with this requirement,once again,expert testimony of an appropriate professional is unnecessary for prosecution of the claim.the second document is also captioned a certificate of merit and states in relevant part that plaintiff does not know how to comply with rule if stating that,expert testimony of an appropriate licensed professional is unnecessary for prosecution of the claim,does not satisfy the requirement,and that plaintiff has satisfied the certificate of merit requirement to the best of her knowledge and belief.
thereafter,when sugarman estate was substituted as a defendant,counsel for the estate filed a motion to dismiss liggon redding complaint under rule b for her purported failure to file a certificate of merit.the district court granted that motion by memorandum and order entered october.in doing so,the district court wrote that liggon redding had failed to file a certificate of merit,and characterized her as argu ing that she does not need a certificate of merit because she expects to proceed without an expert.judge sanchez rejected that argument because he concluded that liggon redding in fact would require expert testimony to prove her claim.the district court did not address why liggon redding filings should not be construed as a certificate under pennsylvania rule a or why,as a matter of pennsylvania or federal law,she was not entitled to proceed under that section of the rule.
we begin with the question of whether the pennsylvania rule requiring a certificate of merit is procedural or substantive law.the district court found pennsylvania certificate of merit requirement to be substantive state law.we have never addressed the issue precedentially and asked the parties to submit additional briefing on this question 
a federal court sitting in diversity must apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.see erie tompkins.in chamberlain giampapa,cir,we summarized the jurisprudence of the united states supreme court and other courts concerning the erie rule,and set out a test to determine whether a state law is substantive or procedural for purposes of compliance with the erie rule.first,a court must determine whether there is a direct collision between a federal rule and the state law or rule that the court is being urged to apply.if there is a direct conflict,the federal court must apply the federal rule and reject the state rule.if there is no direct collision,then the court applies the erie rule to determine if state law should be applied,by evaluating the second and third prongs of the chamberlain test.chamberlain,at.in the second part of the chamberlain test,a court must determine whether the state law is and whether failure to apply the state law would frustrate the twin aims of the erie rule to discourage forum shopping and avoid inequitable administration of the law.third,the court must consider whether any countervailing federal interests prevent the state law from being applied in federal court.see id.
the parties point to federal rules of civil procedure,and b as rules that may collide with the pennsylvania certificate of merit requirement.we have also independently looked at.none of these rules collide with the pennsylvania certificate of merit requirement.we will briefly discuss each rule.
federal rule b governs the application to the court for an order and requires that any application to the court be by motion.unlike federal rule b,pennsylvania rule requires a certificate of merit to be filed within days after filing a professional negligence claim.filing a certificate of merit,and applying for an order are clearly different and unrelated.filing a certificate of merit is not an application to the court for an order because,when a plaintiff files a certificate,he or she is merely adding to the record and not requesting any relief or action by the court.therefore,federal rule b and pennsylvania rule do not directly collide.
in chamberlain,we held that neither.nor conflicted with a new jersey affidavit of merit statute.see at.the same holds true for the pennsylvania rule.federal rule sets out a requirement that a complaint contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.a.in contrast,pennsylvania rule does not require a plaintiff to set forth any factual averments upon which a claim is based.instead,the rule requires that a writt
