general electric capital corporation gecc appeals the dismissal of its negligent misrepresentation claim against several former directors and officers of promedco management company promedco.because gecc complaint pleads sufficient allegations to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,we reverse and remand.
gecc original complaint alleged that in june it was induced to lend promedco million.according to gecc,in deciding to enter into the credit agreement,it relied on promedco representations about its financial condition.gecc further contends that many of these representations were false misleading and that as a result it sustained a loss of over million.
promedco was a medical services company that managed health care practices in markets.essentially,promedco would approach an existing medical practice,acquire its operating assets other than real estate,and employ its personnel other than the physicians.promedco would then manage the business aspects of the practices and provide administrative services such as facilities management,the acquisition of malpractice insurance,and accounting services.
in february,gecc was approached and requested to extend credit to promedco.before eventually agreeing to make a million loan,gecc reviewed financial reports and other documents supplied by promedco management.these documents,inter alia,represented promedco earnings before interest,taxes,depreciation,and amortization ebitda to be million,when its financial condition was much more precarious.
by the time gecc sued,it had been revealed by independent auditing that promedco true ebitda were much lower according to gecc complaint,as low as million.gecc alleges that this overstatement was the result of improper internal accounting with respect to several transactions and that 
the source of the financial misstatements was the improper treatment given by promedco,subject to the oversight and control of the officers and directors,to various of its internal transactions.this improper treatment formed the basis of promedco audited financial statements,its which was approved by the officers and directors,and other financial materials provided to and relied upon by gecc in its decision to lend promedco the million.
less than a year after the loan was made,promedco filed for chapter bankruptcy protection,as a consequence of which gecc recovered only some million of the loan.
gecc sued wayne posey,ceo and robert smith,cfo promedco outside buysse,thomas chaney,james herd,jack mccaslin,and richard ragsdale and other promedco edwards,senior vice president of development charles mcqueary,senior vice president of operations robert sontheimer,senior vice president for managed care gregory wagoner,senior vice president for medical affairs and deborah johnson,senior vice president of administration and secretary to the board of directors collectively,the defendants.gecc attached to its complaint promedco form and its attachment,the report of independent public accountants,prepared by arthur andersen llp arthur andersen.the report states that arthur andersen audited promedco and financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards.
defendants filed motions to dismiss under federal rules of civil procedure b and b,arguing that gecc complaint failed to allege fraud with the requisite particularity,and in any event,failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.see.b,b.the district court properly dispensed with the rule b argument,concluding that gecc had not alleged any fraud claims and thus was not subject to the heightened pleading requirements of rule b 
on the rule b motion,however,the court held that gecc had failed to state a claim for negligent misrepresentation.specifically,the court found that gecc pleadings,the attachment of the form contradicted its allegation that the defendants had failed to exercise reasonable care in obtaining and communicating the information concerning promedco financial condition.under article c of the texas business corporation act,officers and directors are entitled to rely in good faith on the reports of public accountants.see.bus.act c consequently,the district court concluded that the reliance on arthur andersen approval of promedco accounting methods directly contradicted gecc allegation that the directors and officers had failed to exercise reasonable care.
additionally,the court reasoned that although allegations that the directors and officers should not have relied on the arthur andersen report,an allegation that they knew the information provided to arthur andersen was false would have been sufficient to sustain a cause of action,gecc made no such allegations.as a matter of law,therefore,the court concluded that the defendants could not have acted negligently in vouching for the accuracy of the financial statements provided to gecc.the court dismissed gecc claim with prejudice and entered a final judgment.
in response,gecc filed motions to vacate the judgment and to amend,see.e,a,attaching a proposed amended complaint that it claimed would remedy the pleading defects identified by the district court.the main difference between the original and proposed amended complaints is the inclusion of allegations that the misrepresentations occurred in both audited and unaudited financial information.specifically,the amended complaint alleges that gecc relied on erroneous unaudited documents including an offering memorandum,some documents attached to the form,promedco form for the first quarter of,and a certificate of compliance.additionally,gecc alleges that it relied on a live presentation made by posey,smith,edwards,and sontheimer.
the district court again held that gecc had failed to state a claim.in a opinion,the court concluded that gecc had failed to allege any facts in support of the notion that the defendants did not exercise reasonable care.the court also noted that the complaint failed to allege sufficient facts to sustain other elements of a claim for negligent,plaintiff has failed to allege any facts tending to demonstrate that the director defendants had a pecuniary interest in the financing transaction at issue,nor has plaintiff alleged any facts tending to demonstrate that the defendants were responsible for the alleged misrepresentations.
we review a dismissal under rule b de novo.see bombardier aerospace employee welfare benefits plan ferrer,poirot wansbrough,cir.consequently,we employ the same standard as that used by the district court a claim will not be dismissed unless the plaintiff can not prove any set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.id.
the district court predicated its initial dismissal of gecc claim on a finding that gecc complaint contradicted its allegation that the defendants acted without reasonable care.on appeal,however,defendants argue that gecc failed to allege sufficient facts for any of the required elements of a negligent misrepresentation claim.
under texas law,a claim for negligent misrepresentation consists of four elements 
the representation is made by a defendant in the course of his business,or in a transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest the defendant supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business the defendant did not exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information and the plaintiff suffers pecuniary loss by justifiably relying on the representation.
clardy marine midland bus.loans,cir.although the three sets of defendants the ceo and cfo,the outside directors,and the defendants take somewhat differing approaches on appeal,all three contend that gecc has generally failed sufficiently to plead these required elements.
specifically,defendants argue that the complaint contains mere conclusional allegations,or legal conclusions stated as factual conclusions.for example,defendants point to gecc allegations with respect to the first element of its claim.that element requires that the representation be made by a defendant in the course of his business,or in a transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest.gecc complaint states that the suppos
