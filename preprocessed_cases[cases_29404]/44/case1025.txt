background 
vito milanese,milanese was the of a small landscaping business.his amour propre,however,was his ferrari.in december,he dedicated his evenings to the chassis.this tedious operation required the entire of the car,then applying a primer coat,followed by a coat of enamel.for use in priming and painting,milanese bought a can of rusty metal primer the primer and a can of protective enamel the enamel.while using the primer,vapors were ignited by the flame in an adjacent stove,causing a flash fire that severely burned milanese.
the can of primer 
on the front of the primer can appeared the following warning in red,bold letters danger extremely flammable.contents under pressure.vapor harmful.the directions for use on the back of the can stated use outdoors,or in a area,when temperature is above f c and humidity is below to ensure proper drying.avoid spraying in very windy,dusty conditions.
on the back of the primer can the following precautions also appeared 
contains tuluol and xylol.keep away from heat,sparks and flame,including pilot lights and cigarettes.avoid to vapors.to avoid breathing vapors or spray mist,open windows and doors or use other means to ensure fresh air entry during application and drying.if you experience eye watering,headaches or dizziness,increase fresh air or wear respiratory protection tc c or equivalent,or leave the area.avoid contact with skin.do not puncture or incinerate.
the can of enamel 
in contrast,the warning on the front of the enamel can stated,in red bold letters danger extremely flammable liquid vapor.vapors may cause flash fire.contents under pressure.emphasis added.although the directions for use on the back were similar to those on the can of primer,additional precautions were listed on the back of the enamel can 
vapors may ignite explosively.keep away from heat,sparks and flame.extinguish all flames and pilot lights,and turn off stoves,heaters,electric motors and other sources of ignition during use and until all vapors are gone.do not smoke.use only with adequate ventilation.prevent of vapors by opening all windows and doors to achieve.do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above exposure to heat or prolonged exposure to sun may cause bursting.do not puncture or incinerate burn container.emphasis added.
the two products were packaged together in a blue plastic wrapper.it is unclear from the record what warnings,if any,appeared on the plastic packaging itself.milanese was familiar with the individual warning labels because he had used both products on numerous occasions and had recently read each label.
on december,as he had done often,milanese went out to his garage to work on his ferrari.the garage was detached from his house,was approximately feet x feet in size,and was heated by a,stove.on this night,milanese intended to scrape and prime but not paint the car wheel wells.
the ferrari was parked in,with its rear wheels closest to the garage door,and its side near the stove.having previously compared the primer label with the enamel label,milanese concluded that,as long as he did not use the primer near the stove,he need not put out the fire that was fully enclosed in the stove before using the primer.in addition to two large air vents in the rafters,milanese cranked open two small windows on the wall of the garage nearest the stove.he did not open the garage door.
he then began to scrape and prime the wheel wells,beginning with the front,then moving to the rear and the rear.ten minutes after he began to spray the primer onto the rear wheel well,vapors from the primer licked the fire in the stove approximately feet away,triggering a flash fire that engulfed milanese in flames.milanese sustained second and third degree burns to more than of his body.he is permanently disfigured and scarred.
in august,milanese commenced this action against the corporation in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york mishler,alleging common law claims for breach of warranty,strict products liability,and negligence.the crux of each cause of action was that failed to warn on the primer compared with the enamel its vapors could cause flash fire.milanese wife also asserted a claim for loss of consortium.
in november,upon completion of discovery,moved for summary judgment on the ground that the milaneses claims were preempted by the federal hazardous substances act fhsa,and certain regulations promulgated thereunder.milanese for leave to amend the complaint to add a cause of action alleging that negligently failed to comply with the fhsa.in particular,the claim would allege that the primer can failed to identify vapor flash fires as a principal hazard and failed to list the necessary precautionary measures,in violation of p.
to support his,milanese attached the deposition testimony of a employee,larry west,a safety and industrial hygiene coordinator.west had admitted that the same propellant is used in both the primer and enamel the propellant,which is a vapor,is extremely flammable and vapors from the primer which include both the propellant contained in the liquid primer itself and the vapors that are emitted from the liquid once it has been sprayed onto a surface may cause flash fires.when asked to explain why,unlike the primer can,the enamel can warned that both the liquid enamel and its vapors were flammable and that the vapor may cause flash fires,west answered that the enamel was in a later generation can and he speculated that the enamel may contain a raw material that makes it more flammable than the primer.west contended that the very warning extremely flammable on the primer can implied that both the liquid primer and its vapors were flammable,and that the precautions regarding proper ventilation adequately protected the consumer from the flash fire hazard.
milanese also attached the affidavit of robert cunitz,a certified human factors psychologist.cunitz stated that he had expertise in the area of product design,product warnings,product safety information and safety labeling,and was familiar with the requirements mandated by the fhsa.based on his review of milanese and west testimony,videotapes of the spray cans at issue,transcribed text of the warnings and labels on each can,and material safety data sheets produced by,cunitz concluded in his expert opinion that corporation did not properly comply with the provisions of the fhsa.specifically,he considered the primer can to be a misbranded product under the fhsa because the principal hazard associated with the product,namely that vapor may cause flash fire,nowhere appeared on the product label.
the district court granted motion for summary judgment,denied milanese to amend,and dismissed the complaint.specifically,the court held that cunitz affidavit was inadmissible because he failed to submit proof of his qualifications to express an opinion as to whether the primer can was misbranded within the meaning of the fhsa the primer label was fully compliant with the fhsa milanese failure to warn claims were therefore preempted and granting leave to amend the complaint would be futile because the evidence offered by milanese merely supported the argument that the primer warning should have been more claim that is than a claim that the warning failed to comply with the fhsa requirements.
milanese now appeals,arguing that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because west deposition testimony created genuine issues of material fact.milanese identified those issues as whether vapor flash fire is a principal hazard distinct from,and in addition to,the flammability of the liquid primer if so,whether the primer can identified this principal hazard and contained the necessary precautionary measures,as required by the fhsa,and whether the enamel can,when packaged together with the primer can,misled the consumer into believing that vapor flash fire,while admittedly a danger when using the enamel,was not a hazard when using the primer.milanese also contends that the district court erred by denying him leave to amend his complaint.
for the reasons set forth below,we affirm in part,reverse in part,vacate and remand.
discussion 
preemption under the fhsa 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,drawing all inferences and resolving all ambiguities in favor of the.parker columbia pictures,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if the admissible evidence establishes that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
the primer used by milanese is concededly a hazardous substance sold for household use.as such,it is regulated by the fhsa.f a v defining a hazardous substance as a ny substance or mixture of substances which is flammable or combustible.
the fhsa was enacted in to provide nationally uniform requirements for adequate cautionary labeling of packages of hazardous substances which are sold in interstate commerce and are intended or suitable for household use.house comm.on interstate and foreign commerce,federal hazardous substances labeling act,sess,reprinted in.a limited preemption provision was added in.it provides that 
if a hazardous substance or its packaging is subject to a cautionary labeling requirement under p or b designed to protect against a risk of illness or injury associated with the substance,no state may establish or continue in effect a cautionary labeling requirement applicable to such substance or packaging and designed to protect against the same risk of illness or injury unless such cautionary labeling requirement is identical to the labeling requirement under p or b.

in light of these express provisions,milanese concedes that the fhsa preempts any state cause of action that seeks to impose a labeling requirement different from the requirements found in the fhsa and the regulations promulgated thereunder.although we have not previously so held,we do so now and join many of our sister circuits,comeaux tea,cir moss parks,cir,cert.denied,d pennsylvania general ins.landis,d,aff,cir,table,kirstein barr company,aff,cir,cert.denied,d.therefore,to the extent that milanese claims for breach of express warranty,strict products liability,and negligence seek to impose additional or more elaborate labeling requirements on,we fully agree with their dismissal by the district court on preemption grounds.
we agree with milanese,however,that a state cause of action alleging with the fhsa would not be preempted by the act.torres rios lps,cir moss,at landis,d at kirstein.at.although there is no federal private right of action under the fhsa,riegel textile celanese,cir,a state negligence claim lies for failure to comply with the federal,labeling requirements.wallace parks,dep t.
ii.leave to amend the complaint 
in opposition to motion for summary judgment,milanese for leave to amend his complaint to add a claim for with the fhsa.the district court denied this motion,concluding that the amendment would be futile because,as a matter of law,the primer can complied with all necessary labeling provisions of the fhsa and related regulations.we disagree.
we review the district court denial of leave to file an amended complaint for abuse of discretion.jones new york div.of military and naval affairs,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling on a mistaken application of the law or a clearly erroneous finding of fact.cooter gell hartmarx,d.leave to file an amended complaint shall be freely given when justice so requires.a,and should not be denied unless there is evidence of undue delay,bad faith,undue prejudice to the,or futility.foman davis,d.here,the district court believed it would be futile to allow milanese to amend his complaint because the proposed claim of with the fhsa could not withstand an inevitable motion for summary judgment.
milanese argues that the district court applied the wrong standard by measuring the proposed amendment against a summary judgment yardstick.he contends that a plaintiff should be allowed to amend his complaint so long as the proposed complaint on its face states a valid claim,and could therefore withstand a motion to dismiss under.b.milanese is incorrect.
it is true that when a for leave to file an amended complaint is made in response to a motion to dismiss under.b,leave to amend will be denied as futile only if the proposed new claim can not withstand a b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim,if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can plead no set of facts that would entitle him to relief.ricciuti transit,cir.however,the rule is different where,as here,the is made in response to a.motion for summary judgment,and the parties have fully briefed the issue whether the proposed amended complaint could raise a genuine issue of fact and have presented all relevant evidence in support of their positions.in the latter situation,even if the amended complaint would state a valid claim on its face,the court may deny the amendment as futile when the evidence in support of the plaintiff proposed new claim creates no triable issue of fact and the defendant would be entitled to judgment as a matter of law under.c.see azurite amster,denying plaintiff leave to amend complaint where proposed amendment would be futile because the factual foundations of its new allegations are insufficient,as a matter of law,to withstand defendants motion for summary judgment,aff,cir baker,cir hemphill schott,cir applying summary judgment standard and allowing amendment.
here,moved for summary judgment on the ground that milanese claims are preempted because primer label complied with the fhsa as a matter of law.milanese for leave to amend his complaint to add a claim that the primer label did not comply with the fhsa.in opposition to motion and in support of his,milanese presented evidence of with the act.under these circumstances,the district court correctly applied the summary judgment standard set forth in.c and not the.b standard for failure to state a determine whether granting milanese leave to amend his complaint would be futile.
misbranding under the fhsa 
a manufacturer violates the fhsa if it introduc es into interstate commerce any misbranded hazardous substance.a.a hazardous substance is misbranded if its packaging or labeling is in violation of an applicable regulation issued under the act,or if such substance fails to bear a label which states conspicuously e an affirmative statement of the principal hazard or hazards,such as flammable,combustible,vapor harmful or similar wording descriptive of the hazard and f precautionary measures describing the action to be followed or avoided p e and f.see also requiring labels of products with multiple hazards to contain a n affirmative statement of each such hazard and the precautionary measures describing the action to be followed or avoided for each such hazard.
milanese argues that the primer was misbranded in two ways the label on the primer can itself failed to warn of the principal hazard of vapor flash fire and failed to state the precautionary measures necessary to avoid this hazard and when packaged together with the enamel,the primer label effectively disclaimed vapor flash fires as a principal hazard and misled the consumer into believing that he need not extinguish all sources of ignition prior to its use.we address each argument in turn.
compliance of the primer label standing alone 
milanese contends that the primer can does not contain a warning of the principal hazard that vapors may cause flash fire,as distinct from the hazard that the liquid itself is extremely flammable.nor does the primer label say extremely flammable liquid vapor.in contrast,the enamel can does.
in addition,unlike the enamel,the primer can does not tell the user to e xtinguish all flames and pilot lights,and turn off stoves,heaters,electric motors and other sources of ignition during use and until all vapors are gone,or to use adequa
