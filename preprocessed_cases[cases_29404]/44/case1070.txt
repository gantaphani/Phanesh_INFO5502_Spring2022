fair wind sailing,brought this action against virgin island sailing school viss and its scott dempster,alleging,in relevant part,that defendants infringed upon fair wind trade dress in violation of the lanham act,et,and unjustly enriched themselves by copying fair wind business.the district court dismissed fair wind trade dress and unjust enrichment claims,and subsequently awarded defendants fees under virgin islands law.fair wind challenges both the dismissal of its claims and the award of attorneys fees.
the district court properly concluded that fair wind failed to state claims for trade dress infringement and unjust enrichment.as to the former claim,fair wind has failed to adequately explain what dress it seeks to protect,and its trade dress,as pleaded,is functional in nature.as to the latter claim,fair wind has not pleaded with sufficient particularity in what manner defendants have been unjustly enriched.we therefore affirm the dismissal of both claims.
however,we agree with fair wind that the district court improperly awarded fees for the entirety of the litigation under virgin islands law.while it would have been appropriate for the district court to award reasonable fees accrued defending the territorial law claims,an award for the portion of the fees accrued defending the lanham act claim was appropriate only to the extent that this was an exceptional case.a.the district court did not decide whether this case was an exceptional one.we therefore remand the fee dispute for further proceedings.in the wake of new supreme court precedent,we take this opportunity to amend our jurisprudence on the standard for finding exceptionality under a of the lanham act.
the complaint alleges the following facts,which we assume to be true and construe in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.see ashcroft igbal.
fair wind is a michigan corporation that owns sailing schools throughout the united states,including one in thomas,virgin islands.the thomas school exclusively uses catamarans 
in july,fair wind hired larry bouffard as a captain and sailing instructor for its thomas school.bouffard entered into a contract with fair wind,which contained a provision precluding bouffard from joining a fair wind competitor within miles of the thomas school for two years after the end of his employment with fair wind.a popular instructor,bouffard stayed with fair wind for over three years.
in june,bouffard introduced dempster to fair wind as a potential instructor and captain.relying on bouffard assurance that dempster was qualified for the post,fair wind hired dempster for a probationary period.fair wind was dissatisfied with dempster performance,and declined to retain dempster at the end of those two weeks.
shortly after fair wind terminated dempster,bouffard resigned.at or about this time,however,dempster and bouffard decided to open a sailing school together in thomas.by the following winter,dempster and bouffard school,viss,was up and running,in direct competition with fair wind.opening viss violated bouffard noncompete agreement with fair wind.
since its inception,viss has copied fair wind thomas school in several respects.viss employs foot catamarans,the same boats used by fair wind.viss also uses teaching curriculum and itineraries identical to those used by fair wind,and employs the same procedures for student feedback.the marketing on viss website is identical to fair wind marketing.additionally,the viss website contains a picture of a catamaran belonging to fair wind,includes student testimonials from students who took classes with dempster while he worked for fair wind,and mentions bouffard experience teaching o ver the last year,presumably in reference to his time teaching at fair wind.first am.compl.
fair wind alleges that s ince viss began competing with fair wind,fair wind has lost considerable business and reputation.id.it also alleges that dempster and viss have been enriched by their improper and unjustified conduct.id.
fair wind filed an action against dempster and viss in the district court of the virgin islands.the complaint,as amended shortly thereafter,alleged three claims against dempster and fair wind a trade dress infringement claim under a of the lanham act a tortious interference claim and a unjust enrichment claim.viss filed a motion to partially dismiss the complaint under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure,arguing that fair wind failed to state claims for trade dress infringement or unjust enrichment.
the district court concluded that fair wind had failed to state claims for either trade dress infringement or unjust enrichment.as to the trade dress claim,the district court concluded that the complaint had several dispositive flaws.first,the district court explained that fair wind had failed to allege facts about its business that amount ed to its trade dress.fair wind sailing,dempster,wl,at.without knowing the precise product features that fair wind seeks to protect as trade dress,the district court struggle d to undertake a productive rule b analysis.id.second,assuming that the product features at issue amounted to a trade dress,the court determined that the complaint was devoid of any allegations that these features were inherently distinctive or ha d acquired any secondary meaning.id.at.third,the district court determined that the product features comprising fair wind alleged trade dress were functional and therefore fell beyond the protections of the lanham act.id.at.with respect to the unjust enrichment claim,the district court concluded that fair wind had failed to allege any facts to support the first element required for an unjust enrichment claim that the defendant was enriched.id.at.accordingly,the district court granted viss motion to dismiss in its entirety.in response,fair wind voluntarily dismissed its remaining claim for tortious interference,making the judgment final and appealable.see camesi of pittsburgh med,cir.
thereafter,defendants moved for in attorneys fees under a of the lanham act and title,section of the virgin islands code.this constituted the total amount of legal fees incurred by defendants in this matter over the course of the litigation.app.relying solely on the virgin islands fee statute,the district court concluded that defendants were entitled to a fair and reasonable award of attorney fees for their effort defending the entirety of this case.fair wind sailing,dempster,wl,at.after concluding that a portion of the fees sought was unreasonably expended,the district court awarded defendants fees in the amount of.id.at.
fair wind filed separate,timely appeals of both the dismissal order and the fees order,which were subsequently consolidated for disposition 
we first consider fair wind trade dress claim.like the district court,we conclude that fair wind has failed to properly state a claim for trade dress infringement.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of the claim 
section a of the federal lanham trademark act sets forth the standard for infringement of unregistered trademarks.it provides in relevant part that 
any person who,on or in connection with any goods or services,or any container for goods,uses in commerce any word,term,name,symbol,or device,or any combination thereof,or any false designation of origin,false or misleading description of fact,or false or misleading representation of fact,which a is likely to cause confusion,or to cause mistake,or to deceive as to the affiliation,connection,or association of such person with another person,or as to the origin,sponsorship,or approval of his or her goods,services,or commercial activities by another person,or b in commercial advertising or promotion,misrepresents the nature,characteristics,qualities,or geographic origin of his or her or another person goods,services,or commercial activities,shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.
a.section a protects from deceptive imitation not only a business trademarks,but also its trade dress.a two pesos,taco cabana,stevens,concurring.trade dress has been defined as the total image or overall appearance of a product,and includes,but is not limited to,such features as size,shape,color or color combinations,texture,graphics,or even a particular sales technique.rose art,swanson,cir.in short,trade dress is the overall look of a product or business.see,taco cabana,at the decor of a restaurant am.greetings dan dee imports,cir a line of teddy bears with tummy graphics see also bristol myers squibb mcneil,cir graphics and arrangement of elements on a box of excedrin.
the purpose of trade dress protection is to secure the owner of the trade dress the goodwill of his business and to protect the ability of consumers to distinguish among competing producers.mcneil nutritionals,llc heartland sweeteners,llc,cir quoting shire barr,cir.trade dress protection does not shield businesses from plagiarism.see dastar twentieth century fox film.indeed,t rade dress protection must subsist with the recognition that in many instances there is no prohibition against copying goods and products.trajfix devices,mktg.displays,see also thomas betts panduit,cir copying is not only good,it is a federal right a necessary complement to the patent system grant of limited monopolies.thus,the law does not afford every combination of visual elements exclusive legal rights.instead,trade dress protection extends only to incidental,arbitrary or ornamental product features which identify the product source.shire us,at.
a plaintiff must prove three elements to establish trade dress infringement under the lanham act the allegedly infringing design is nonfunctional the design is inherently distinctive or has acquired secondary meaning and consumers are likely to confuse the source of the plaintiff product with that of the defendant product.mcneil nutritionals,at.in addition to satisfying these three elements,it is the plaintiff duty to articulat e the specific elements which comprise its distinct dress.see landscape forms,columbia cascade,cir see also thomas mccarthy,mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition ed.t he discrete elements which make up the trade dress claim should be separated out and identified in a list.this allows the district court to ensure that the claim is not pitched at an improper level of generality,the claimant does not seek protection for an unprotectable style,theme or idea.landscape forms,at.even before it reaches the question of protectability,however,a district court should scrutinize a plaintiff description of its trade dress to ensure itself that the plaintiff seeks protection of visual elements of its business.as the sixth circuit has noted,any thing that dresses a good can constitute trade dress.abercrombie fitch stores,am.eagle outfitters,cir.however,the thing must dress a good.id.that is,the alleged trade dress must create some visual impression on consumers.otherwise,there is simply no dress to protect.
according to fair wind,its trade dress is the combination of its choice to solely employ catamaran vessels and its unique teaching curriculum,student testimonials,and registered domain name,which all combine to identify fair wind uniquely configured business to the general public.appellant br.at by its own terms,then,fair wind trade dress is simply a hodgepodge of unconnected pieces of its business,which together do not comprise any sort of composite visual effect.fair wind is not arguing that viss stole fair wind look in order to lure away customers.in fact,several of the elements of fair wind trade dress such as the teaching curriculum are not clearly visual aspects of the business at all rather,fair wind asserts that defendants have harmed fair wind by copying every material element of fair wind business and presenting it to the public.id.at.this claim has little to do with trade dress.
perhaps realizing its failure to plead a cognizable trade dress,fair wind pivoted at oral argument,placing its web design at the center of the trade dress claim.but the complaint does not enumerate what specific elements of its website comprise a distinctive trade dress or that its site has any distinctive ornamental features.xuan thao nguyen,should it be a free for all the challenge of extending trade dress protection to the look and feel of web sites in the evolving internet,am,arguing that a combination of a website color,graphics,animations,designs,layout,and text may qualify for trade dress protection.
indeed,fair wind has failed to allege any facts at all relating to the substance of its own website.true,the complaint suggests that viss website contains a picture of a fair wind catamaran,as well as student feedback mechanisms,curriculum,and itineraries identical to those used by fair wind.first.am.compl.but the fact that viss has copied aspects of fair wind business and placed them on its website says nothing about the content of fair wind website,let alone whether fair wind website has a composite look that might constitute a trade dress.
because fair wind has failed to give defendants adequate notice of what overall look it wishes to protect,its trade dress claim can not survive defendants motion to dismiss.see twombly,at.
but even assuming that fair wind had adequately stated the overall design it seeks to protect,its alleged trade dress is clearly functional,and therefore not protectable.a functional feature is one that is essential to the use or purpose of the article,affects the cost or quality of the article,or one that,if kept from competitors,would put them at a significant disadvantage,at.by contrast,a feature is nonfunctional where it is unrelated to the consumer demand and serves merely to identify the source of the product or business.prufrock,lasater,cir.student feedback procedures,catamarans,teaching itineraries,and curriculum all affect the quality of fair wind business.they play a critical role in the consumer demand for fair wind services,rather than merely identifying fair wind as the source of the sailing instruction,at holding that the design was not protectable because it had a purpose beyond serving the purpose of informing consumers that the sign stands are made by the plaintiff.thus,fair wind alleged dress is plainly functional.
rather than argue that the particular features of its trade dress are nonfunctional,fair wind argues that the various functional aspects of its business combine to create something nonfunctional.fair wind argument rests on clicks billiards,sixshooters,where the ninth circuit concluded that the sum of particular functional elements in a pool hall,such as its counters and lighting,could amount to a nonfunctional look.see,cir.the clicks court explained,t he fact that individual elements of the trade dress may be functional does not necessarily mean that the trade dress as a whole is functional rather,functional elements that are separately unprotectable can be protected together as part of trade dress.id.at internal quotation marks omitted see also id.at to be sure,many of these elements,considered in isolation,may be functional.the issue,however,is whether,taken as a whole,the overall look and feel of the establishment is functional.the plaintiff in clicks offered evidence that its composite tapestry of visual effects had become associated with its pool halls and not others.see id.at.thus,the ninth circuit concluded that the plaintiff trade dress claim should survive summary judgment.
in stark contrast to the plaintiff in clicks,fair wind has not explained how the identified functional elements achieve a nonfunctional composite tapestry of visual effects.id.at.fair wind has not suggested,in its complaint or elsewhere,that its business has a distinctive appearance at all.clicks is therefore inapposite.
in sum,fair wind has failed to allege a cognizable trade dress.moreover,to the extent that the complaint alleges that fair wind boats,curriculum,itineraries,and student feedback procedures are its trade dress,that trade dress is functional,and therefore not protectable.fair wind claim does not hold water.
fair wind next argues that the district court improperly dismissed its unjust enrichment claim by employing too exacting a pleading standard.specifically,the district court concluded that fair wind had f
