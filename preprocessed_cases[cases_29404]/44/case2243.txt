plaintiff joelle premo appeals the district court determination that pursuant to the federal tort claims act,et,michigan state law,which in this case is the michigan automobile insurance act.comp.laws ann,et,applies to premo claim for personal injury benefits against the government.plaintiff also appeals the district court denial of her request for interest and attorneys fees.for the following reasons,we affirm in part and reverse in part the district court decision.
statement of facts 
factual background 
on august,joelle premo,then years old,was riding her bicycle in royal oak,michigan.while riding through a cross walk,premo was struck by a united states postal service usps postal truck and injured.she suffered multiple leg,ankle,and foot fractures that required surgery.
premo does not own an automobile and thus,does not have automobile insurance.consequently,premo was unable to claim insurance benefits from her own insurance company.on september,premo counsel contacted the usps to file a claim for insurance benefits,pursuant to the michigan automobile insurance act act.comp.laws ann,et,under the postal service insurance plan.the usps declined premo request for benefits in a letter dated september.the letter stated,inter alia,the following 
the united states postal service is and does not carry insurance on its motor vehicles because it is exempt from the requirements of state vehicle insurance statutes.in the most general of terms,the supremacy clause of the united states constitution does not allow a state to regulate the actions of any arm of the federal government,unless,of course,the federal government agrees to allow that regulation.no such allowance has been provided in this instance.
there is one relevant exception to the united states sovereign immunity from claims of any kind.the federal tort claims act ftca,codified at,provides the exclusive means of pursuing a claim against the federal government based on the negligence of one of its agencies or their employees.b.therefore,michigan does not apply to the united states postal service.accordingly,the postal service declines premo request for benefits from the postal service.
if it is your intent to present an administrative tort claim with the united states postal service under the provisions of the federal tort claims act,the claim must conform in all respects with title,united states code,and title,code of federal regulations,part.accordingly,each claim should state,with specificity,sufficient facts to allow the government to investigate its liability and a sum certain amount for injuries or losses alleged to have occurred by reason of the incident.please note that sum certain is the term used to identify the amount of damages the claimant seeks to resolve the dispute.further,it should be accompanied by supportive documentation,and exhibit an original ink signature.
plaintiff filed an ftca administrative claim with the usps,seeking for personal injury and the property damage to her bicycle.the agency denied premo claim on may,stating an investigation into the accident failed to establish a negligent act or omission on the part of the postal service or its employees.while we regret any injury that may have occurred,we can not accept legal liability for these alleged damages.accordingly,this claim is denied.plaintiff did not subsequently apply for insurance benefits under michigan assigned claims plan.
procedural history 
plaintiff filed suit in district court against the united states,the usps,and john doe on july,pursuant to the federal tort claims act,et,seeking economic and damages resulting from the driver alleged negligence.after discovery concluded,the government moved for summary judgment,arguing that the michigan act was applicable and therefore,plaintiff could not recover economic damages and plaintiff had not demonstrated that she met the threshold to receive damages under michigan law.
on october,the district court granted in part and denied in part the government motion for summary judgment.the district court determined that michigan act applied,the government was not estopped from arguing that the act applied,plaintiff failed to meet the standard necessary to recover damages,and the case would go forward as to the government liability and premo would be entitled to economic damages if such liability were established.
on october,premo moved for summary judgment on her claim for in economic damages,which included in medical expenses and in property damage,and requested in interest and in attorneys fees.on february,the district court granted in part and denied in part plaintiff motion,finding that plaintiff was entitled to the in economic damages but denying her request for interest and attorneys fees.plaintiff filed a motion to reconsider,which was denied.plaintiff appeals the district court application of michigan act to her claim and denial of her request for interest and attorneys fees the government appeals the district court award of economic damages to plaintiff.

requirements under the federal tort claims act 
sovereign immunity prevents suit against the united states without its consent.united states mitchell,d.the federal tort claims act ftca waives sovereign immunity for certain actions in tort by giving district courts exclusive jurisdiction over those types of civil actions.under the ftca,the government may be liable 
for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment,if a private person would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.
b.the ftca was designed primarily to remove the sovereign immunity of the united states from suits in tort and,with certain specific exceptions,to render the government liable in tort as a private individual would be under like circumstances.richards united states,d.the ftca neither creates causes of action against the united states nor provides a means of enforcing federal statutory duties.rather,it constitutes consent to suit and is fundamentally limited to cases in which a private individual would be liable under like circumstances.united states cundiff,cir alteration in original.although the united states government may be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,the government is not liable for interest or for punitive damages.
claims under the ftca involve a analysis.first the district court applies local law to determine liability and to assess damages.second,federal law is invoked to bar proscribed recoveries,such as punitive damages.palmer united states,cir quoting kirchgessner united states,cir see richards,at.we conclude that congress has,in the tort claims act,enacted a rule which requires federal courts to look in the first instance to the law of the place where the acts of negligence took place.thus,liability under the ftca is usually determined by referencing state law.molzof united states,d.because the alleged act of negligence took place in michigan,we must look to michigan law.
under michigan act,victims of motor vehicle accidents receive insurance benefits for their injuries as a substitute for their remedy in tort.kreiner fischer.the act
