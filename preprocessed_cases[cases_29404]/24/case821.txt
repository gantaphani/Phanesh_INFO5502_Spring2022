kelly and golden signed a superseding agreement the sa in january,terminating and replacing the agreement.clause of the sa conveys golden interest in kelly patents back to kelly.clause states that kelly agrees to dismiss his complaint with prejudice.clause provides that golden will receive a royalty and other payments.clause contains a mutual release and confidentiality undertaking that releases the parties from all claims then or previously held,includes an agreement not to make or authorize disparaging,derogatory,or defamatory comments about one another and provides that they will not discuss,disclose,or release any information related to the agreement or the sa unless it is privileged,within arbitration proceedings,made with consent,or required by law.finally,clause states that the parties will use binding arbitration to resolve their disputes and will not file a civil lawsuit or equitable action in any court against the other party except to compel or enforce arbitration.
following the execution of the sa,the district court dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice at kelly request.kelly soon discovered that a company golden had negotiated with to market their patents was in financial trouble,and he blamed golden for losing a potential contract with another client.rather than seeking arbitration under clause,kelly filed suit against golden in louis,missouri,county court.golden removed the case to federal district court and filed an answer and counterclaims.the parties consented to a bench trial before a magistrate judge.
kelly,proceeding pro se,consistently filed lengthy pleadings containing irrelevant and scandalous allegations that reflected his anger and personal feelings regarding the case.he frequently referred to golden and his counsel as liars.the district court warned kelly,both in the rule conference and in subsequent orders,that he should refrain from such personal attacks.it struck an unnotarized affidavit by kelly that contained impertinent and scandalous matter that was wholly irrelevant and also struck portions of kelly supplement and amendment to his original pleadings that contained vicious and highly personal attacks that could only have been included to embarrass,harass and oppress defendant and to prejudice the court.
notwithstanding the district court warning,kelly subsequent pleadings included numerous personal attacks on golden unrelated to the legal issues and sought to misuse discovery procedures.the district court rejected kelly attempt to depose some of golden friends,characterizing it as an attempt to vilify defendant in front of his friends.not content to confine his attacks to the courtroom,kelly sent golden and golden counsel inappropriate letters and faxes during the period december and february that contained numerous inappropriate,vituperative,and coercive comments,along with arguably defamatory statements.although he continued to insist that his purpose was to remove obstacles to his ability to make his product available to the world and thus reduce the spread of,kelly words and actions reflected a personal vendetta against golden.
the district court held the sa to be valid and enforceable and granted golden summary judgment on kelly recision and breach of fiduciary duties claims.golden then amended his counterclaims and moved for summary judgment,an injunction,punitive damages,and attorney fees.kelly then retained counsel and sought to compel arbitration.the district court denied arbitration as having been waived,granted summary judgment for golden on two of his breach of contract counterclaims and his prima facie tort counterclaim and granted attorney fees in the amount of,plus costs,and punitive damages in the amount of.the court enjoined kelly from making any further disparaging,derogatory,or defamatory statements.

we conclude that the district court did not err in finding that kelly had waived his right to arbitration.kelly,a lawyer,negotiated the terms of the sa,including the arbitration clause.he acted inconsistently with that right by litigating the merits of his lawsuit.kelly consistently encouraged the district court to resolve the entire dispute and failed to object or move to compel arbitration throughout a year of court proceedings.he vigorously pursued discovery and did not raise an arbitration claim until after the district court had ruled against him on all of his motions on the merits of the case.finally,golden was prejudiced by kelly delay in seeking arbitration.he incurred expense and experienced substantial delay as a result of the extensive litigation and would be required to extensively duplicate his efforts if he were now required to participate in arbitration.
