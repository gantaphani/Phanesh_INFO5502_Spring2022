under code of civil procedure section,the trial court denied a petition to compel arbitration.that section gives the court the discretion to deny enforcement of an arbitration agreement,and to order all parties to litigate in a single action,if the court determines that a party to the arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court case with a third party arising out of the same transaction,and there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact.we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court decision.we also reject the contention that the federal arbitration act prevents the trial court from exercising its discretion under code of civil procedure section.
factual and procedural background 
millie and severson,m s is a general contractor.m s contracted with presbyterian intercommunity hospital,presbyterian to construct a facility in whittier,california.m s in turn contracted with best interiors,best for the construction and installation of metal framing,gypsum board,and portland cement plaster construction for the facility,for a contract price of.
the facility was completed.but best claims that more than million of the contract price remains unpaid that it incurred additional construction costs because of various disruptions to the construction schedule and that the reasonable value of materials and services best actually furnished for which m s has not paid is more than million.best sued m s,presbyterian,and two building inspectors,steve seals and joseph alcantara 
best alleged that m s failure to manage,coordinate,and schedule the work properly interfered with,hindered,and delayed best work on the project.these disruptions significantly increased the nature,scope,and duration of best work.moreover,because the project was a healthcare facility,state law required an observation,inspection,and testing program,including an inspector of record ior hired by presbyterian and certified by the state to perform inspections during the construction.best alleged that improper and unnecessary inspections by the building inspectors presbyterian hired seals and alcantara disrupted and hindered its work.specifically,best alleged presbyterian obtained state approval for seals to serve as ior for the project,and that seals and presbyterian improperly allowed was not qualified or certified as an oversee and inspect the project and otherwise to perform the ior duties.best alleged that alcantara carried on his improper and illegal inspection activities with the full knowledge,consent,authorization,or ratification of seals,presbyterian,and m 
m s petitioned to compel arbitration of the dispute between m s and best and to stay best lawsuit pending arbitration,based on arbitration clauses in the subcontract between m s and best and in the prime contract between m s and presbyterian.best opposed the petition.best argued that seals and alcantara could not be compelled to arbitrate that arbitration would subject best to a risk of inconsistent results and that the court had authority under code of civil procedure section to refuse to enforce the arbitration clause 
the trial court initially granted m s petition however,after two more rounds of briefing and hearings,the trial court denied m s petition to compel arbitration.the trial court observed 
the main factual disputes involved whether m s improper management of the contract work caused best delay in completing the project whether the inspections seals and alcantara performed were improper and the nature of the legal relationship between presbyterian and the inspectors.
presbyterian agreed to participate in arbitration so long as the entire action was heard in that forum,but the inspectors were not parties to an arbitration agreement and did not stipulate to arbitration.
both seals and alcantara had filed for indemnity and declaratory relief.
the court concluded 
separating the claims to be judicially determined and those subject to arbitration would not serve judicial economy and more importantly,may lead to inconsistent results.citation.the issues between the parties overlap and would have to be heard and decided in both forums.multiple rulings will likely create problems.first,if a portion of the case is sent to arbitration in accordance with the contracts,the arbitrator could find that the inspectors acted as agents,thereby exposing presbyterian to liability.the inspectors interest would not adequately be represented in that forum.once agency was found,presbyterian would likely seek indemnity from the inspectors.the court,not bound by the arbitrator findings,would have to decide the issue of agency and might find that there was none.if it finds that there was no agency,presbyterian would still be bound by the inconsistent arbitration decision.second,the issue of whether the inspectors were at fault would have to be determined in both forums.the amount of fault assigned to them,if any,would likely differ.finally,the resolution of these issues also affects the finding as to whether presbyterian is independently liable for negligently hiring the inspectors and improperly ratifying their alleged misconduct.the somewhat unique facts of this case require,in the interest of judicial economy,that the various disputes between the parties be heard in the same forum.balancing the interests of the parties who signed a contractual arbitration agreement with those who did not,the court finds that equity rules in favor of denying the petition to compel arbitration and the action litigated in one forum.
m s filed a timely appeal from the trial court order.
discussion 
m s raises two arguments.first,m s contends that the federal arbitration act et faa governs its arbitration agreement with best,and the faa does not give the trial court discretion to deny arbitration.second,m s contends that,even if california law applies,the trial court erred in refusing to order arbitration because there is no possibility of conflicting rulings.we disagree on both points,and affirm the order 
a.the faa does not preempt section here.
the faa governs contracts in interstate commerce.unlike its california counterpart,the faa contains no provision permitting a court to stay arbitration pending resolution of related litigation involving third parties not bound by the arbitration agreement.volt information sciences,board of trustees,d volt.however,the united states supreme court has expressly held that the faa does not preempt the california statute,section,subdivision c hereafter,section c,where the parties have agreed that their arbitration agreement will be governed by the law of california.id.at.the court explained that the faa does not confer a right to compel arbitration of any dispute at any time it confers only the right to obtain an order directing that arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in the parties agreement.id.at,quoting.so,even if the faa applies because the subcontract affects interstate point we need not parties may agree that california law governs their agreement to arbitrate.
volt is illustrative,and controlling.in volt,a construction contract contained an agreement to arbitrate all disputes arising from the contract.the contract also contained a clause,providing that the contract would be governed by the law of the place where the project is located.volt,supra,at.that place was california.the supreme court affirmed a california court of appeal decision finding that,by incorporating the california rules of arbitration into their agreement,the parties had agreed that arbitration would not proceed in situations which fell within the scope of section c.volt,supra,at.the supreme court concluded that application of section c would not undermine the faa policies and goals id.at.
our own supreme court also has held that,where the parties both provided that california law would govern their arbitration agreement and agreed that the designation of california law would not be deemed an election to preclude application of the faa,if it would be applicable,the faa did not preempt the application of section c.cronus investments,concierge services cal th,d,cronus.
