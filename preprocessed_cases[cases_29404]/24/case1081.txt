this is an interlocutory appeal in a bankruptcy case.we find that the district court erred when it upheld a bankruptcy court denial of a motion to compel arbitration.
background 
the contracting company was the general contractor on the construction of certain improvements at universal city development partners ucdp theme park known as seuss landing.electric machinery enterprises,eme entered into a subcontract with and agreed to provide electrical work on the project.during the course of the work,suffered scheduling delays that impacted the completion of the work.ucdp refused to grant any contract time extensions for excusable delays therefore,both and eme were forced to expend additional costs to accelerate the work.submitted an amended claim to ucdp for these additional costs.as part of the amended claim,included as a claim the claimed additional costs submitted by eme in the amount of.also sought payment for additional change work that ucdp had directed and thereby eme to perform.the total amount that allocated to eme in its claim to ucdp was.
while was pursing these claims against ucdp,and eme entered into a tolling agreement,which tolled the applicable statute of limitations with respect to an action by eme against.the tolling agreement also acknowledged that during the course of the project,eme had incurred additional costs for change work and acceleration of contract performance.the tolling agreement stated that had submitted eme claimed costs as part of claims to ucdp,and was continuing to exhaust both and eme claims with ucdp.in the tolling agreement,and eme agreed that any issues,claims or defenses between them shall be resolved by binding arbitration under the construction industry rules of the american arbitration association and judgment shall be entered upon any award in such proceedings.
in june,entered into a settlement agreement with ucdp in which ucdp paid.following the settlement,informed eme that based on the prior payments made to eme,considered its subcontract with eme paid in full.both before and during the tolling agreement,had previously paid eme.
in may,eme had filed for chapter bankruptcy in the united states bankruptcy court for the middle district of florida.after settled with ucdp,eme filed an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court against alleging that owes eme in principal and in accrued interest pursuant to a subcontract agreement between the parties.in its complaint,eme claims that the suit is for turnover property of the estate.furthermore,eme claims that breached their contract and owed payment to eme based on a payment bond issued by.
eme moved for summary judgment,asserting that has a duty to turn over the undisputed amount of money that it owes eme.specifically,eme claimed that it is owed a percentage of the settlement proceeds that ucdp paid to.initial cumulative claim against ucdp was for approximately million,which included eme claim of approximately million.eme stated that this million represented of cumulative claim.therefore,eme claimed that it should receive of the received as a settlement,which is approximately.responded that during the course of the ucdp litigation,it learned that eme cost claim was substantially overstated and unsupported by eme own job cost records,and therefore,it had paid eme in full.also in response to eme claim,filed a motion to compel arbitration.the bankruptcy court held a hearing on both motions.
the bankruptcy court denied eme motion for summary judgment and found that this case is not a turnover action because it involves a disputed and unliquidated claim.the bankruptcy court also found that this case presents a constructive trust situation,because collected money in settlement for itself and for eme,and if does not distribute the proportion of the settlement owed to eme,will be unjustly enriched.however,the bankruptcy court acknowledged that the amount of money that owes to eme is a hotly disputed factual issue.having determined that a constructive trust existed,the bankruptcy court determined that it had jurisdiction over the res of the constructive trust,and that the determination of the amount of res in the constructive trust was a core bankruptcy proceeding.therefore,the bankruptcy court found that arbitration under these circumstances was not appropriate and denied motion to compel arbitration.the district court affirmed,and appealed.

discussion 
legal standard for the enforcement of a valid arbitration agreement 
the parties do not dispute that they entered into a valid arbitration agreement to resolve any and all claims or issues between them.the federal arbitration act faa provides,in pertinent part,that arbitration agreements shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.the faa establishes a federal policy favoring arbitration.see express,mcmahon,d.however,l ike any statutory directive the arbitration act mandate may be overridden by a contrary congressional command.id.thus,unless congress has clearly expressed an intention to preclude arbitration of the statutory claim,a party is bound by its agreement to arbitrate.davis southern energy homes,cir.the party opposing arbitration has the burden of proving that congress intended to preclude a waiver of a judicial remedies for the particular claim at issue.mcmahon,at.at.
in mcmahon,the united states supreme court promulgated a three factor test in order to determine congress intent the text of the statute its legislative history and whether an inherent conflict between arbitration and the underlying purposes of the statute exists.davis,at alteration in original quoting mcmahon,at.at.in applying the mcmahon factors,questions of arbitrability must be addressed with a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration.gilmer lane,d.applying the mcmahon factors to the bankruptcy code,we find no evidence within the text or in the legislative history that congress intended to create an exception to the faa in the bankruptcy code.see mintze am.fin,in re mintze,cir finding no evidence of such an intent in the statutory text or legislative history of the bankruptcy code.therefore,we look to the third factor of the mcmahon test and examine whether an inherent conflict exists between arbitration and the underlying purposes of the bankruptcy code.
the bankruptcy court found that the determination of the res of the constructive trust was a core proceeding over which the bankruptcy court had exclusive jurisdiction.the bankruptcy court relied on the united states supreme court decision in tennessee student assistance hood,d,for the proposition that a bankruptcy court in rem jurisdiction permits it to determin e all claims that anyone,whether named in the action or not,has to the property or thing in question.id.at.at second alteration in original.however,whether or not the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction,even exclusive jurisdiction,over a matter is a separate question from whether enforcing a valid arbitration agreement would pose an inherent conflict with the underlying purposes of the bankruptcy code.see mcmahon,at.at finding that the plaintiffs claim that the defendant violated b of the securities exchange act of was subject to arbitration even though district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over such violations.therefore,the bankruptcy court finding that it had jurisdiction over the matter does not end our inquiry,for a finding of jurisdiction does not in itself demonstrate that the faa inherently conflicts with the bankruptcy code.
courts addressing the issue of whether arbitration inherently conflicts with the bankruptcy code distinguish between core and proceedings.see hays merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.in general,bankruptcy courts do no
