in these consolidated proceedings,the parties to a wrongful termination action agreed to submit their dispute to binding arbitration,pursuant to an agreement by which the arbitrator was required to apply california law.the arbitrator issued an award in favor of the former employee,who then petitioned to confirm the award.the employer opposed,and moved to vacate the award,on the basis that the arbitrator had failed to correctly apply california law.the trial court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to review the arbitrator award for errors of law,and entered judgment in accordance with the arbitrator award.the employer appeals.no.a contractual provision requiring that the arbitrator apply california law does not mandate a different conclusion.there is no indication in this record that the arbitrator was applying any law other than that of california.it is only claimed that he did not apply that law correctly.we therefore will affirm.an arbitrator award is not reviewable for claimed errors of law.
after the trial court had entered judgment confirming the award,the former employee moved to amend the judgment to add as a defendant another corporation which was alleged to be an alter ego of the defendant.the trial court reviewed the evidence and concluded,based on multiple factors,that the alleged alter ego was,in fact,an alter ego of the defendant,and amended the judgment accordingly.both corporations appeal no,arguing only that the trial court erred in concluding that evidence of common ownership is insufficient,standing alone,to establish the corporations are alter egos.as the trial court ruling was based on many other factors,and the corporations fail to raise a proper substantial evidence challenge on appeal,we will affirm.
factual and procedural background 
defendant the eastman companies,llc tec is wholly owned by susan eastridge and her husband.tec focus was on the development of projects,especially in the field of education.in july,tec hired jeffrey baize to work on some established tec projects and also to develop new projects tec business model often involved creating new legal entities for each project for which it was awarded a contract.as part of his employment agreement,baize was to be given an ownership interest in any of the entities created for projects he developed.
baize obtained for tec a contract to develop a school the natomas project.rather than create a new entity in which baize had an ownership interest to handle the natomas project,tec assigned the project to an entity it had already created,tec natomas development corporation.the relationship between baize and tec deteriorated,and baize was ultimately terminated from tec employ.he brought suit against tec,seeking the compensation he was denied by not having been granted an ownership interest in the tec natomas development corporation.in addition to tec and tec natomas development corporation,baize also named as defendants three other tec entities which baize alleged were alter egos of tec and responsible for any damages awarded to him natomas eastridge public facilities corporation the eastridge companies educational facilities group,and concord eastridge.tec brought a against baize,alleging that he breached his employment agreement by failing to adequately perform his duties to tec,among other causes of action.
on july,the parties stipulated to submit all claims to binding contractual arbitration.the parties written arbitration agreement contained several clauses which are relevant to this appeal.they are the arbitrator shall have the authority of a sitting judge with respect to handling this matter and shall apply california law the arbitrator shall apply the substantive law and the law of remedies,if applicable of the state of california,as applicable to the issues presented in this case.the arbitrator is without jurisdiction to apply any different substantive law or the law of remedies and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary that may be contained in the rules the arbitrator shall be constrained by the rule of law and any arbitration award shall be based thereon.
an arbitration was held over ten days in november,resulting in an award in favor of baize,supported by a written decision.the arbitrator concluded baize was owed plus prejudgment interest and costs,and further concluded that all related tec entities were liable for baize damages on an alter ego theory.
on june,baize petitioned to confirm the arbitration award.tec and its related entities collectively the tec entities opposed the petition and moved to vacate the award.the tec entities raised several arguments to contest the validity of the arbitration award,only one of which they pursue on appeal.the tec entities took the position that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by failing to correctly apply controlling law.the tec entities did not argue that the arbitrator expressly based his decision on authority or equitable principles instead,they argued that the arbitrator decision was reviewable for errors of law because the arbitration agreement specifically provided that the arbitrator only had jurisdiction to apply california law.they believed that an improper application of california law was an act in excess of the arbitrator jurisdiction and therefore subject to court review.
the trial court confirmed the award,on the basis that the court lacked authority to review the arbitrator decision for errors of law.judgment was entered in favor of baize on june.
on august,baize moved to amend the judgment to include an additional tec entity,tecla development corporation tecla as a judgment debtor.in and,tec had been awarded development agreements for four school projects for the los angeles unified school district lausd.in july,when baize sent copies of his judgment to lausd for collection purposes,he learned that tec had assigned those four contracts to tecla when they were originally executed.baize sought to amend the judgment to include tecla on an alter ego theory.in addition to evidence of the assigned lausd contracts,baize motion relied on the following evidence the fact that tecla was owned by the same individuals who owned other tec entities the fact that tecla had the same attorney as other tec entities the fact that tecla had the same address as other tec entities the fact that tecla had the same employees as other tec entities deposition testimony apparently admitted at the arbitration demonstrating how money is funneled between tec and its related entities and documents in which concord eastridge,a company found by the arbitrator to be a tec alter ego,asserted that it was the company developing the four lausd schools.baize also submitted evidence that the individuals who had controlled the litigation on behalf of the tec entities were the same people who controlled tecla.
on august,the tec entities filed a notice of appeal from the judgment confirming the arbitration award.on august,the tec entities and tecla filed their joint opposition to baize motion to amend,arguing that their appeal of the judgment stayed proceedings in the trial court and deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to hear the motion.they also opposed the motion on the merits,relying solely on a declaration of susan eastridge,asserting tecla independence from the other tec entities.
the trial court granted the motion.in pertinent part,the trial court order stated the following in considering all of the facts presented,the court finds that tecla is within the tec family of entities and,thus,should be added as a party defendant.this determination is based on the following facts the president of tecla is also the ceo of tec the of tecla is also the vp of tec the secretary and treasure r of tecla is also the coo of tec tecla is wholly owned by susan e a stridge tecla and tec are represented by the same attorneys tecla operates out of the same offices used by tec and concord eastridge and tecla and tec share the same employees.these facts,when taken together,support a finding that tecla and tec are one and the same.accordingly,the court finds that adding tecla as a party defendant is proper.towards this end,the court
