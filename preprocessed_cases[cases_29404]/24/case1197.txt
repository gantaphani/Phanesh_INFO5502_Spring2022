does an arbitrator exceed his powers when he applies equitable defenses to excuse a party from performing a material condition of an agreement that provides the arbitrator may not modify or change any of the agreement material provisions we hold he does not.
celine gueyffier and ann summers,ann summers,a british retailer,had a franchise agreement under which gueyffier was to open an ann summers store in los angeles.the attempted store opening was a failure,leading to claims by each party that the other had breached their agreement.as the contract required,the matter was arbitrated,and the arbitrator found for gueyffier,concluding ann summers had failed to provide gueyffier with promised training,guidance and assistance.in his written award the arbitrator found that for gueyffier to have given ann summers written notice and at least days to cure these breaches,as the contract provided,would have been an idle act because the breaches were not curable.
the superior court confirmed the award,but the court of appeal reversed.the appellate court held the arbitrator had,by excusing gueyffier performance of the clause,violated the contract express prohibition against an arbitrator modifying or changing a material term of the contract and had thereby exceeded his powers within the meaning of code of civil procedure section,subdivision a the court therefore ordered the award vacated under that statute.
we conclude the court of appeal erred in its application of section.absent an express and unambiguous limitation in the contract or the submission to arbitration,an arbitrator has the authority to find the facts,interpret the contract,and award any relief rationally related to his or her factual findings and contractual interpretation.moshonov walsh cal th,d,advanced micro devices,intel cal th,d,moncharsh heily blase cal th,d.the parties here having included no effective limitation in their contract,as we discuss,the arbitrator did not exceed his powers by interpreting the contract to allow for equitable excusal of the condition or by making a factual finding that notice would have been an idle act.the award therefore was not subject to vacation under section,subdivision a.
factual and procedural background 
ann summers is a retailer of lingerie and sex toys organized under the laws of,and headquartered in,the united kingdom.gueyffier is a french citizen who resides in california.in january,the parties executed a written franchise agreement under which gueyffier was to own and operate an ann summers store in los angeles.
article of the franchise agreement provided franchisor shall not,and can not be held in breach of this agreement until i franchisor shall have received from franchisee,promptly after franchisee first learns of the alleged breach,a written notice specifying in detail the facts constituting the alleged breach and ii franchisor shall have failed to remedy the breach within a reasonable period of time after such notice,which period shall not be less than days this is a material term of this agreement and may not be modified or changed by any arbitrator in an arbitration proceeding or otherwise.
article of the agreement provided that,with certain exceptions inapplicable here,any controversy or claim between franchisor and franchisee arising out of or relating to this agreement or any alleged breach hereof was to be submitted to binding arbitration before the american arbitration association under that organization commercial arbitration rules.the arbitration clause further provided in no event may the material provisions of this agreement be modified or changed by the arbitrator at any arbitration hearing.
in march,gueyffier opened her ann summers store in the beverly center shopping mall.according to the arbitrator award,the shop met a harsh reception,with tomatoes being thrown at the store and insults being yelled at gueyffier.gueyffier quickly closed the store,though she later reopened in the same location under the name,what lies beneath.
in may,ann summers demanded arbitration and gueyffier counterclaimed.the american arbitration association international centre for dispute resolution appointed a single arbitrator,who conducted hearings on legal and factual aspects of the dispute from through.in february,by written award,the arbitrator ruled for gueyffier.ann summers,the arbitrator found,had failed to meet its obligations to provide operations manuals,training and assistance,and an advertising program.the consequence of the breach was the disastrous opening of the beverly center store.gueyffier was awarded as consequential damages for the breach.
with regard to article provision,the arbitrator found as follows by the time gueyffier was finally able to open the beverly center store,the effect of the breaches was not curable.giving written notice to provide operations manuals,training and assistance,and an advertising program within a reasonable period of time would have been an idle act.therefore,the requirement of giving sixty days written notice article is moot.
gueyffier and ann summers filed petitions to,respectively,confirm and vacate the award.the trial court granted gueyffier petition to confirm the award and entered judgment in accord with the award.
the court of appeal reversed.on the issue of whether the arbitrator had exceeded his powers,the court determined,first,that the arbitrator,in finding the notice requirement was moot,impliedly found plaintiff did not give notice of alleged breach.the question to be answered was whether the arbitrator exceeded his powers by excus ing the notice and cure requirement on mootness grounds.as both the requirement and the prohibition on modifying material terms of the agreement were set out explicitly in the contract,the court reasoned,the arbitrator modified and changed the explicit terms of the notice and cure requirement when he found it had been excused.since the arbitrator had no authority to modify or change the provision,his award had to be vacated under section.
we granted gueyffier petition for review.
discussion 
on petition of a party to an arbitration see,the superior court is to vacate an arbitrator award if t he arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted,subd.a.as we have explained in prior cases,however,this provision does not supply the court with a broad warrant to vacate awards the court disagrees with or believes are erroneous.
when parties contract to resolve their disputes by private arbitration,their agreement ordinarily contemplates that the arbitrator will have the power to decide any question of contract interpretation,historical fact or general law necessary,in the arbitrator understanding of the case,to reach a decision.moshonov walsh,supra,cal th at,d,advanced micro devices,intel,supra,cal th at,d,moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at,d.inherent in that power is the possibility the arbitrator may err in deciding some aspect of the case.arbitrators do not ordinarily exceed their contractually created powers simply by reaching an erroneous conclusion on a contested issue of law or fact,and arbitral awards may not ordinarily be vacated because of such error,for t he arbitrator resolution of these issues is what the parties bargained for in the arbitration agreement.moshonov walsh,at,d,quoting moncharsh heily blase,at,d.
an exception to the general rule assigning broad powers to the arbitrators arises when the parties have,in either the contract or an agreed submission to arbitration,explicitly and unambiguously limited those powers.advanced micro devices,intel,supra,cal th at,d.the powers of an arbitrator derive from,and are limited by,the agreement to arbitrate.citation.awards in excess of those powers may,under sections and,be corrected or vacated by the court.id.at,d.the scope of an arbitrator authority is not so broad as to include an award of remedies expressly forbidden by the arbitration agreement or submission.id.at,d.
the court of appeal held,and ann summers contends,that the parties did effectively limit the arbitrator powers they explicitly agreed in
