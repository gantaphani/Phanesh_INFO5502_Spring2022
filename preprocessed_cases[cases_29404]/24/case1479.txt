betsy lindsay,michael lindsay,and ultrasystems environmental,collectively,lindsay appeal from a judgment on a stipulated settlement agreement in favor of piotr lewandowski,joan lewandowski,and the hydro company collectively,lewandowski.lindsay argues the settlement agreement is unenforceable.we agree and reverse.
in december,the parties signed a stipulation for settlement following private mediation.one version,signed by most of the parties,states in the event of a dispute as to the terms of the settlement the parties agree to return to the mediator for final resolution by binding arbitration.the words by binding arbitration are a typed addition to form language that precedes it.another version,signed by michael lindsay and mary bennett,does not have this addition.
two provisions are at issue.one stated the parties agreed to binding arbitration of ultrasystems environmental systems,ultrasystems claims against the hydro company hydro.the word arbitration is typed in above the line,directly above the word mediation,through which a line is drawn.it was further agreed that any arbitration award for ultrasystems was to be set off against the amount lindsay owed lewandowski.
the other disputed provision is section lindsay pays to lewandowski the sum of with cash,payment terms,security arrangements and stipulations regarding in bankruptcy reasonably agreeable to both parties but to be submitted to binding mediation by judge polis ret.if no satisfactory agreement on terms in entered within five days of commencement of negotiations between the parties on this issue.shortly after the parties signed the stipulation for settlement,lindsay retained new counsel and took the position it was unenforceable.
in april,lewandowski moved for judgment on the stipulated settlement.code civ.he sought an order compelling arbitration of the claim,binding mediation to resolve the payment terms,and judgment enforcing the settlement.retired judge polis submitted a declaration in support of the motion.it described his retention as mediator,an initial mediation proposal,and his subsequent preparation of the stipulation for settlement.he said binding mediation was a procedure he regularly used t he parties have agreed in advance that in the event the parties fail to agree,i then decide these terms and conditions,typically by asking the parties to each submit to me their final offers,accompanied by their oral argument as to why i should select their version over all others.i then select as the final binding provision the term or terms of either one party or the other.retired judge polis said he described this process to both sides before they signed the stipulation for settlement.
eventually,the parties agreed to arbitrate the dispute on the understanding lindsay did not waive her position that the stipulation for settlement was unenforceable.on september,retired judge polis,acting as arbitrator,issued an award for hydro on all issues.
on december,the trial court granted lewandowski motion to compel arbitration of the payment terms dispute.the court found the parties have agreed to an alternate dispute resolution clause,and it ordered them to return to judge robert polis to resolve their dispute as to the terms of the stipulation to settlement,including the meaning of the term binding mediation 
lindsay responded by attempting to disqualify judge polis.on december,she sent lewandowski a notice of disqualification of judge polis to serve as arbitrator in the matter.the purported disqualification was based on a rule that a party shall have the right to disqualify one court appointed arbitrator without cause in any one arbitration former subd.c,eliminated in a revision which rewrote section and added by stats,ch.l the same provision now appears in,subd.b.lewandowski moved to compel adherence with the order to arbitrate.on february,the trial court found the notice of disqualification invalid and ordered the parties to proceed before retired judge polis.
on april,retired judge polis issued a binding mediation ruling.he concluded lindsay shall pay in cash forthwith,without any security agreement and without any stipulation regarding an attempt to make that amount dischargeable in bankruptcy since neither are needed with a cash payment.the ruling described the procedure used as follows b inding mediation is simply a normal mediation process within the frame work of an agreement in advance by the parties that any impasse reached shall be resolved by the mediator who will select and propose a compromise figure circumscribed by the last two bargaining positions conveyed before the impasse.at another point,retired judge polis said b inding mediation has only one accepted meaning,that is,that the parties who enter intend that there shall be an agreement at the end of it,even if the mediator must make the final call.that was the intent expressed here and that was the result.in a may,response to an inquiry from lewandowski,retired judge polis said the reference to lindsay in the ruling meant betsy lindsay,michael lindsay,and ultrasytems.
subsequently,the trial court granted lewandowski motions to confirm the arbitration award and the binding mediation award,and to enforce the stipulation for settlement.on september,judgment was entered awarding lewandowski against betsy lindsay,michael lindsay,and ultrasystems,along with other relief in favor of the various parties.
lindsay argues the stipulation for settlement is unenforceable for several reasons.we conclude one is parties never agreed on a procedure to resolve the payment therefore reverse.
section provides that where parties to pending litigation stipulate to settle the case orally in court,or in a writing signed outside of court,judgment may be entered pursuant to the terms of the settlement upon motion of one of the parties.a section motion is appropriate even when issues relating to the binding nature or terms of the settlement are in dispute,because,in ruling on the motion,the trial court is empowered to resolve these disputed issues and ultimately determine whether the parties reached a binding mutual accord as to the material terms.in re marriage of assemi cal th,d.
a settlement agreement,like any other contract,is unenforceable if the parties fail to agree on a material term or if a material term is not reasonably certain.weddington productions,flick th,d,consent is not mutual,unless the parties all agree upon the same thing in the same sense,subd.contract not specifically enforceable where terms are not sufficiently certain to make act to be done clearly ascertainable.leaving an unresolved term for future agreement is not invariably fatal,since a settlement may be enforceable if the parties agree the remaining issue will be decided by arbitration.see weddington productions,flick,supra,th at,d parties theoretically could confer arbitration authority on an arbitrator,even to the extent of allowing an arbitrator to write a licensing agreement for them.but that did not take place here.
we can not tell what the parties meant when they provided for binding mediation of the payment dispute.the settlement began as a mediation.it produced a stipulation for settlement that provides for resolution of a dispute as to the term of the settlement by return ing to the mediator for final resolution the version signed by michael lindsay and mary bennett or by return ing to the mediator for final resolution by binding arbitration the version signed by the remaining parties.it goes on to provide for resolution of the dispute by binding arbitration,and resolution of the payment term dispute by binding mediation.as to the latter,the reference to binding mediation is at odds with the general proviso for settling a dispute over the settlement terms by returning to the mediator for final resolution by binding arbitration one version.
about the only thing that is clear is that the parties did not regard binding mediation as the equivalent of arbitration.the stipulation for settlement originally provided for resolution of the hydro dispute by binding mediation,but mediation is crossed out and arbitration inserted in its place.that indicates the parties did not consider binding mediation the equivalent of arbitration.since there was no agreement on a recognized procedure to resolve the payment term dispute,the stipulation for settlement is unenforceable.
lewandowski argues the inconsistent references to different alternate dispute resolution procedures in the stipulation for settlement are irrelevant because section three refers only to binding mediation.but that does not answer the question of what the parties meant by binding mediation,and we are left with a contract that is uncertain regarding a material term.such a contract can not be enforced.
this resolution precludes any meaningful determination of the viability of the concept of binding mediation.there is a school of not altogether unappealing recognizes binding mediation as a perfectly acceptable means of dispute resolution.after all,why ca parties to a mediation provide that if they come to loggerheads on an issue,they agree to a binding resolution by the mediator acting as a arbitrator,under whatever process chooses a leading commentator has observed that where parties authorize a mediator to render a binding decision upon an impasse in settlement negotiations,the dispute resolution procedure then becomes,in effect,an arbitration.knight et,cal.practice guide alternate dispute resolution the rutter group.the same conclusion is reached by the only reported decision on the issue of which we are aware.there,a michigan court concluded binding mediation is functionally the same as arbitration,and it held a trial court has the same authority to review decisions following binding mediation as arbitration.frain frain.
but there are significant problems with the concept of binding mediation.while there are recognized rules governing contractual arbitration et,contractual mediation,et,and mediation programs cal.rules of court,rule et,there are none for binding mediation.the extant rules settle various issues,among them appointment of arbitrators and mediators,disclosure,disqualification,the powers of arbitrators and mediators,procedure,fees,confidentiality,and enforcement.there are also specific rules that deal with mixed alternate dispute resolution,where traditional mediation is followed by binding mediation.cal.rules of court,rule g.
if binding mediation is to be recognized,what rules apply the arbitration rules,the mediation rules,the mediation confidentiality rules,or some mix if only some rules,how is one to chose should the trial court take evidence on the parties intent or understanding in each case a determination that authorizes a create your own alternate dispute resolution regime would impose a significant burden on appellate courts to create a body of law on what can and can not be done,injecting more complexity and litigation into a process aimed at less.
we do not suggest that parties are prohibited from agreeing that,if the mediation fails,they will proceed to arbitration.and,should they so desire,they may agree that the same person may first act as mediator and,if he or she fails in this task,act as the arbitrator.whether or not this arbitrator née mediator may consider facts presented to him or her during the mediation would also have to be specified in any such agreement.all of which serves to underscore how uncertain the terms of the instant agreement were.
it will come as no surprise that the members of this panel have strong feelings about the efficacy vel non of binding mediation.but their expression here,where we are simply unable to find any meeting of the minds,would be an inappropriate excursion into issues unnecessary to resolution of the case before us.
in light of our conclusion the stipulation for settlement is unenforceable for lack of agreement on a procedure to resolve the payment term dispute,we also do not reach betsy lindsay other arguments against enforcement,or her argument that retired judge polis was properly disqualified.

i fully concur in the lead opinion but write separately because the term binding mediation is relatively new in the legal lexicon and because it is a deceptive and misleading term.given that numerous court rules empower the judiciary to require attendance and good faith participation in a settlement conference the old fashioned term for may easily think that the term binding mediation simply means they are compelled to attend and participate that all.they may not realize the term might be interpreted to mean that if a settlement is not reached,then,puff,the mediation becomes an arbitration.
i also write separately to more clearly register the oxymoronic character of the concept of binding mediation.as lawyers we should use precise is our tradition.a fuzz pr phrase like binding mediation is not worthy of us.
as all of us on this panel noted in vedanta society of california california quartet,th,d,the authors of text whether legislation,novels or settlement agreements generally do not want to contradict when they do,their whimsy should be relatively obvious from the text,the sun was shining on the with all his might and this was odd,because it middle of the night.id.at,fn,d.i can think of nothing more than binding mediation.mediation is by definition a voluntary process which achieves a voluntary result,and is meaningful in distinction to arbitration in its very voluntariness.or,to put it with more is distinctive from arbitration in its inherent lack of consequences.you go to mediation,you like it,you do,you settle,you do,no big deal.
now,granted,persons can voluntarily agree to a process which yields a result out of their roulette table comes to mind.but when the result of some sort of adjudication is binding,it is binding precisely because it is the product of a public court or private arbitration ultimately backed up by the government.a private decision maker with binding power is called an arbitrator.a private decision maker who simply tries to have parties come to some voluntary agreement is a mediator.a mediator with binding power is an arbitrator,not a mediator.see knight,et,cal.practice guide alternative dispute resolution the rutter group,parties sometimes authorize the mediator to render a binding decision in the event an impasse is declared with respect to settlement negotiations.the dispute resolution procedure then becomes,in effect,an arbitration.
unfortunately,the term binding mediation has come into existence because the madison avenue and mba types have taken over what we once called private judging.now we call it alternative dispute resolution because that is a softer and gentler term and implies that the parties will have their disputes resolved in a way that is mutually satisfactory not that they will receive a decision from a judge which one of the parties will not like.private judging implies a quasi trial process with all of the tension of a courtroom and the acrimony of litigation.although,alternative dispute resolution is virtually the same thing,it sounds softer.likewise,settlement conference is also a forbidden term.the public relations people like mediation because mediation implies that your matter or dispute will be resolved to your satisfaction.the term settlement conference sounds like a committee meeting where people get together and talk about a settlement,but nothing might happen.that of course is unacceptable after the parties have spent a lot of money to schedule the meeting.another term that the public relations people do like is arbitration,because arbitration implies that a decision will be made and not necessarily a decision one or both of the parties may like.hence,binding mediation has come into existence because it is kinder and gentler.but as this case demonstrates,it is arbitration.
the california rules of court define mediation as a process in which a mediator assists the parties in reaching a mutually acceptable agreement.and the voluntary aspect of mediation is further underscored in rule a mediator must conduct the mediation in a manner that supports the principles of voluntary participation and by the parties.the rule goes on to prohibit mediators from co
