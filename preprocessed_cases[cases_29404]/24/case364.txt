in this case we must decide when and under what circumstances courts should review a labor arbitrator decision.for the reasons given below,we hold that judicial involvement in the labor dispute in this case was premature.under the complete arbitration rule,the arbitrator should have been given the opportunity to resolve both the liability and remedial phases of the dispute between the companies and the union before it moved to federal court.we therefore vacate the district court order confirming the merits of the arbitrator liability decision and direct that court to return the dispute to the arbitrator to allow him to rule on the remedial issues and otherwise complete the arbitration task.
the dispute in this case arises out of a memorandum of understanding regarding job opportunities the jobs mou signed by the united mine workers of america the union and peabody coal company peabody coal as part of a wider collective bargaining agreement.peabody coal signed the jobs mou on behalf of itself and as a limited agent of its corporate parent,peabody holding company peabody holding,and several of peabody holding other subsidiaries,including black beauty coal company black beauty.the principal purpose of the jobs mou was to require companies within the peabody corporate family to give preferential hiring treatment to coal miners who were either working for or laid off by peabody coal.an arbitration clause in the jobs mou provided that a jobs monitor was to resolve any disputes involving the jobs mou,and that his decisions would be final and binding on all parties to the dispute.the jobs mou was to expire on december.
later in,peabody energy corporation peabody energy,the corporate parent of peabody holding and thus the ultimate parent of peabody coal and black beauty,initiated a spinoff of some of its mining operations to form a new entity called patriot coal corporation patriot.in conjunction with the spinoff,peabody coal became part of patriot.all but one of the peabody holding subsidiaries on whose behalf peabody coal had signed the jobs mou also became part of patriot.the one exception was black beauty,which,along with peabody holding itself,was retained by peabody energy.thus,following the spinoff,peabody coal no longer shared any corporate relationship with peabody holding or black beauty.
in,black beauty hired private mine operator united minerals company united minerals to conduct surface mining on black beauty property.black beauty and united minerals were.united minerals had no corporate relationship with peabody coal and was thus not subject to the jobs mou.shortly after black beauty began its work with united minerals,the union sent a letter to peabody energy and peabody holding stating that peabody holding and black beauty were still bound by the jobs mou preferential hiring requirements.peabody holding disagreed.it took the view that the spinoff of peabody coal from the rest of the peabody corporate family ended any obligation that peabody holding or black beauty the companies had under the jobs mou.because the union and the companies could not resolve this dispute among themselves,the union submitted the dispute to the jobs monitor.
the companies initially argued that the dispute was not even arbitrable under the jobs mou arbitration clause.it ultimately took a decision from this court to confirm that the dispute was in fact arbitrable.peabody holding united mine workers,cir.the union and the companies thus returned to arbitration to argue the merits of the dispute before the jobs monitor.
when the union and the companies returned to the jobs monitor they decided to bifurcate the dispute.as recounted by the jobs monitor in his written decision,the parties asked him to treat in this proceeding solely the question of whether peabody holding and black beauty continued to be bound by the jobs mou after the spinoff.the jobs monitor noted further that i f that question is resolved in the union favor,and the parties can not agree on an appropriate remedy for the peabody holding black beauty refusal to abide by the jobs mou,resolution of the remedy issue will be submitted to the jobs monitor.
after receiving arguments from both the union and the companies,the jobs monitor ruled that the jobs mou remained in force even though peabody coal no longer had any corporate relationship with peabody holding or black beauty.the jobs monitor then made a few related rulings,including that continued enforcement of the jobs mou would not run afoul of the national labor relations act nlra.the jobs monitor,however,deferred his decision on one notable issue.during the proceedings,the companies had argued that black beauty work with united minerals was actually exempt from the jobs mou by virtue of the fact that black beauty had signed its contract with united minerals before it became bound by the jobs mou.the union responded by noting that even if black beauty work with united minerals was exempt,black beauty or peabody holding may have contracted for other jobs that should have been covered by the jobs mou.the jobs monitor determined that he would defer answering this question until the remedy stage of these proceedings.at the conclusion of his decision,the jobs monitor stated that he would retain jurisdiction over this matter for the limited purpose of resolving any remedial issues on which the parties can not agree.
unhappy that the jobs monitor had found them subject to liability under the jobs mou,the companies sought to vacate the jobs monitor decision by filing a declaratory judgment action in the eastern district of virginia.the union filed a counterclaim to enforce the decision.the union also moved to dismiss the companies complaint,arguing that judicial review of the jobs monitor decision was not proper until arbitration before the jobs monitor was complete.both parties then filed cross motions for summary judgment on the merits of the jobs monitor liability decision.
the district court denied the union motion to dismiss.it first noted that there was some disagreement in the case law as to the nature of the judicial review provision on which the companies had premised their of the labor management relations act lmra,a.peabody holding united mine workers,d,e.while some courts describe their jurisdiction under section as limited to review of final arbitration awards,other courts believe congress conferred sweeping jurisdiction under section and merely contemplated judicial application of a prudential rule that would in practice limit review to final awards.id.
the district court ultimately decided that it did not need to determine if any limitation on judicial review under section to final awards was jurisdictional strictly speaking or merely prudential.it simply determined that the jobs monitor award is final as to liability and therefore reviewable.id.the district court reached this conclusion largely because the parties had agreed to bifurcate the liability and remedial facets of their dispute,and the jobs monitor decision had conclusively resolved the liability facet.id.at.
proceeding to the merits,the district court granted the union motion for summary judgment by enforcing the jobs monitor decision as to the companies liability under the jobs mou.id.at.the companies timely appealed this order.the union did not cross appeal the district court denial of its motion to dismiss,and instead sought only to defend the district court summary judgment order confirming that the companies were liable under the jobs mou.after the parties briefed this question,we asked for additional briefing on whether we should even review the jobs monitor liability decision in light of the fact that arbitration before the jobs monitor was not complete.it is on this threshold question that we now focus.
this case came to federal court by way of section of the lmra.section gives federal district courts jurisdiction over s uits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.a.supreme court pr
