circuit city stores,circuit city,appeals the district court denial of its motion to dismiss and compel arbitration of mohammed employment discrimination claims.the district court held that the arbitration agreement between circuit city and is unconscionable under washington state law,and thus unenforceable.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a b,see ferguson countrywide credit,cir,and we affirm.
background 
in june,applied for a job at a circuit city store in the state of washington.before circuit city would consider his application,was required to sign an arbitration agreement entitled circuit city dispute resolution agreement dra.by signing the dra,agreed to resolve all disputes arising out of his employment relationship with circuit city through arbitration in accordance with the circuit city dispute resolution rules and procedures drrp.
rule of the drrp in effect in the drrp stated that both the dra and the drrp could be amended on december of any year upon giving calendar days written notice to associates,provided that all claims arising before alteration or termination shall be subject to the dra and corresponding drrp in effect at the time the claim arose.emphasis added.
while was still employed by circuit city,the drrp was amended,effective december,the drrp.the drrp was essentially the same as the drrp,except that rule was amended to state that all claims arising before alteration or termination shall be subject to the dra and corresponding drrp in effect at the time the arbitration request form and accompanying filing fee is received by the company.emphasis added.the result of this modification would be that any arbitration filed in would be governed by the drrp in effect in,as opposed to the drrp in effect when the claim arose.
continued to work for circuit city after the modification until his employment was terminated in november.
on december,filed a complaint against circuit city in the united states district court for the western district of washington alleging violations of both federal and state laws.circuit city filed a motion to compel arbitration,which was denied,and circuit city appealed.
in an unpublished disposition,we reversed the district court decision and held that the district court improperly relied on duffield robertson stephens,cir,to hold that the compulsory arbitration contract was unenforceable to the extent that the district court relied on the knowing waiver requirement of prudential ins.lai,cir,our examination of the relevant contract reveals that the requirement was met as a matter of law and although we express no opinion as to the enforceability of particular provisions,we are unable to agree with the suggestion that illegal provisions so infected the contract as to render it invalid as a matter of federal law.circuit city stores.cir emphasis added i.we explicitly remanded the case for the district court to consider the validity of these contracts under state law.id.at.
effective december,long after was terminated by circuit city,and over three years into this litigation,the drrp was again amended the drrp.the drrp modified many of the provisions that have been deemed unconscionable or unenforceable in other proceedings.see circuit city stores,mantor,cir ingle,circuit city stores,adams,cir,cert.denied,d gannon circuit city stores,cir see also morrison circuit city stores,cir expressing serious doubts about the fairness and reasonableness of the drrp terms concerning remedies,the payment of arbitration fees,discovery,and the limitations period for requesting arbitration.
one week after adopting the drrp,circuit city renewed its motion to compel arbitration and argued that under the new drrp the arbitration agreement is enforceable.the district court held that the drrp,and not the or drrp,applies,and that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable because it is unconscionable under washington law.after its motion for reconsideration was denied,circuit city appealed.
standard of review 
the district court denial of a motion to compel arbitration is reviewed de novo.ingle,at.
discussion 
the federal arbitration act faa was enacted to reverse the longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration agreements and to place arbitration agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.gilmer lane,d.the faa applies to arbitration agreements,like the one here,that cover claims.see circuit city stores,adams,d.the faa provides that arbitration agreements generally shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,but courts may decline to enforce them when grounds exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.thus,generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening federal law.doctor,casarotto,d.
accordingly,we review arbitration agreement with circuit city in light of the liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d,and consider its enforceability according to the laws of the state of contract formation,see first options of chicago,kaplan,d ingle,at.
the parties dispute whether we previously decided that the arbitration agreement is enforceable the agreement is unconscionable under washington law and any unenforceable contract provisions are severable 
law of the case 
circuit city contends that our prior decision instructed the district court to determine if any particular contract terms are unenforceable under washington law,while enforcing the core contractual obligation to arbitrate.see i.we disagree.
the law of the case doctrine requires a district court to follow the appellate court resolution of an issue of law in all subsequent proceedings in the same case.united states ex rel.lujan hughes aircraft,cir.the doctrine applies to both the appellate court explicit decisions as well as those issues decided by necessary implication.united states cote,cir quoting eichman fotomat,cir.however,t he doctrine does not apply to issues not addressed by the appellate court.lujan,at.
our prior disposition consists of two paragraphs.the first addresses the validity of the arbitration agreement under federal law.by citing duffield,and prudential ins.lai,we determined that circuit city could compel arbitration of federal employment discrimination claims,and that knowingly agreed to arbitrate his federal claims.i.at.although we expressed no opinion as to the enforceability of particular provisions,we concluded that we were unable to agree with the suggestion that illegal provisions so infected the contract as to render it invalid as a matter of federal law.id.emphasis added.
the second paragraph discusses what we did not decide.we began with the general proposition that to be enforceable,an arbitration contract must meet the requirements of generally applicable state contract law.id.we then remanded the case for the district court to determine the validity of the agreement under washington state law.id.at.
the plain meaning of our decision is that the arbitration agreement is valid under federal law but the district court was to determine in the first instance whether it is valid under state contract law.we did not address whether the arbitration agreement is enforceable under state law and the district court followed our mandate by determining unconscionability under washington law.
ii.washington law of unconscionability 
unconscionability is a doctrine under which courts may deny enforcement of all or part of an unfair or oppressive contract based on abuses during the process of forming a contract or within the actual terms of the contract itself.david dewolf,et.practice series,contract law practice.washington recognizes two classifications of unconscionability,substantive and procedural.see zuver airtouch communications,wl,at citing nelson mcgoldrick,and schroeder fageol motors.
substantive unconscionablity involves those cases where a clause or term in the contract is alleged to be or overly harsh shocking to the conscience,monstrously harsh,and exceedingly calloused are terms sometimes used to define substantive unconscionability.procedural unconscionability is the lack of a meaningful choice,considering all the circumstances surrounding the transaction including t he manner in which the contract was entered,whether the party had a reasonable opportunity to understand the terms of the contract,and whether the important terms were hidden in a maze of fine print.
zuver,at,wl,at quoting schroeder,at,and nelson,at emendations in the original.see also adler fred lind manor,wl,at.
in washington,a contract generally may be invalid based on either substantive or procedural unconscionability.see mortenson timberline software,en banc tjart smith barney,recognizing that a contract may be unenforceable based on procedural unconscionability only see also zuver,at,wl,at.in the employment context,the washington supreme court,while hold ing that substantive unconscionability alone can support a finding of unconscionability,has recently decline d to consider whether procedural unconscionability alone will support a claim of unconscionability.adler,at,wl,at.
iii.substantive unconscionability 
whether a contract is substantively unconscionable is a question of law determined as of the time the contract was made,as opposed to the time when the contract is enforced.schroeder,at.
which drrp controls 
as a threshold issue,circuit city contends that rule of the drrps permitted it to amend the arbitration agreement each year,and that under the drrp,dispute is governed by the rules in effect when he files for arbitration.because has not yet filed for arbitration,circuit city contends that his dispute is governed by the most recent rules and procedures and that we should analyze the drrp to determine whether the agreement is enforceable.
we are not persuaded.even if we assume that circuit city validly amended the drrp and is seeking to enforce rule of the drrp,we could not conclude that the drrp applies to 
first,we have held that the modification provision of rule of the drrp is unenforceable under california law.see mantor,at ingle,at.the modification provision allows circuit city to alter the rules and procedures governing arbitration almost at will.for example,here,circuit city has attempted to implement new rules and procedures over three years after the onset of this litigation,and over four years after terminating employment.we conclude that rule,which permits this conduct,is substantively unconscionable under washington law and that the modification provision is therefore unenforceable.
second,even if we were to accept that the drrp requires us to look at the drrp in effect when files for arbitration,we would conclude that the drrp is not effective as to.
under washington law,contract modifications are subject to the general requisites of contract formation,offer,acceptance and consideration.thompson regis paper.employers in washington have been permitted to unilaterally amend or revoke policies and procedures established in an employee handbook.gaglidari denny,en banc.
t he handbook language constitutes the offer the offer is communicated by the dissemination of the handbook to the employee the employee retention of employment constitutes acceptance and by continuing to stay on the job,although free to leave,the employee supplies the necessary consideration.
id.citing pine river state bank mettille.however,an employer unilateral change in policy will not be effective until employees receive reasonable notice of the change and accept the change.id.
applying the principles set forth in gaglidari,we conclude that circuit city did not properly amend the drrp,at least as to.circuit city offer to amend the drrp consisted of posting a written notice at circuit city locations and by including a copy of the modification in its applicant packet.even if this provided reasonable notice to current and prospective employees,it was not reasonable notice to former employees like.that is,it is not reasonable to expect former employees of circuit city to check the postings at a circuit city store every december,nor is it reasonable to expect that a terminated employee would review an applicant packet,to determine if circuit city decided to amend its arbitration rules and procedures.thus,as to former employees like,there was no valid offer to amend the drrp.moreover,did not continue his employment with circuit city,sign an acceptance,or accept the modification of the drrp in any other way 
therefore,because no contract was formed between circuit city and regarding the drrp,the drrp never went into effect as to and the drrp controls the parties dispute 
substantive unconscionability of the drrp 
in mantor,ingle,and adams,we held that circuit city arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable under california law and rejected contract provisions forcing employees to arbitrate claims against circuit city,but not requiring circuit city to arbitrate claims against employees,ingle,at adams,at limiting remedies,ingle,at adams,at splitting costs and fees,mantor,at ingle,at adams,at imposing a statute of limitations,mantor,at ingle,at adams,at prohibiting class actions,mantor,at ingle,at regarding the filing fee and waiver of the fee,mantor,at ingle,at and giving circuit city the unilateral right to terminate or modify the agreement,mantor,at ingle,at.
california applies virtually the same definition of substantive unconscionability as washington.compare ingle,at stating that under california law,substantive unconscionability refers to whether terms of the agreement are so as to shock the conscience quoting kinney united healthcare,th,d,with nelson,at stating that under washington law,substantive unconscionability refers to contract terms that are or overly harsh and shocking to the conscience quoting schroeder,at.each of the provisions we held unconscionable under california law is present in the drrp at issue here.thus,we conclude that mantor,ingle,and adams are persuasive authority that the arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable under washington law.and,in fact,the washington supreme court recently cited ingle,at,and adams,at,with approval,in holding that a limitations provision in an employment arbitration agreement was substantively unconscionable.see adler,at,wl,at stating that w e agree with the ninth circuit 
moreover,the united states supreme court has explained that b y agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim,a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than a judicial,forum.gilmer,at.quoting mitsubishi motors soler,d.gilmer requires arbitration agreements to embody basic procedural and remedial protections so that claimants can effectively pursue their statutory rights.adams,at.in adams,we explained that circuit city arbitration agreement does not meet these minimum requirements because it limits the remedies that would otherwise be available in a judicial forum,and fails to ensure that employees do not have to pay unreasonable fees,costs,or expenses as a condition of access to the arbitration forum.id.here,we again conclude that circuit city arbitration agreement requires employees to forgo essential substantive and procedural rights and that the clauses regarding coverage of claims,remedies,arbitration fees,the statute of limitations,class actions,and modifications,render the arbitration agreement excessively and unconscionable.
iv.severability 
like california law,washington law grants courts discretion to sever unconscionable contract provisions or refuse to enforce the entire contract.compare ingle,at explaining that under california law the court may refuse to enforce the contract in its entirety with schroeder,at stating that under washington law the court may refuse to enforce the contract quoting.
in each of the california,ingle,and held that the unconscionable terms rendered the arbitration agreement unenforceable.in ingle,we specifically determined that the arbitration agreement was permeated with unconscionable provisions and was unenforceable in its entirety because a ny earnest attempt to ameliorate the unconscionable aspects of circuit city arbitration agreement would require this court to assume the role of contract author rather than interpreter.ingle,at see also adams,at reaching the same result regarding an earlier version of the arbitration agreement.applying washington law,we also conclude that the unconscionable provisions of the drrp pervade the entire arbitration agreement and any attempt to sever those provisions would render the procedure unworkable.
the recent cases of zuver and adler are not to the contrary.although in those cases the washington supreme court severed the unconscionable provisions and enforced the remainder of the arbitration agreements,that was because only two discrete provisions of the respective agreements were held to be unconscionable.see zuver,at,wl,at we can easily excise the confidentiality and remedies provisions but enforce the remainder.adler,at,wl,at in this case,however,the arbitration agreement contains just two substantively unconscionable provisions.the washington supreme court,however,acknowledge d that in instances where an employer engages in an insidious pattern of seeking to tip the scales in its favor in employment disputes by inserting numerous unconscionable provisions in an arbitration agreement,courts may decline to sever the unconscionable provisions.id.citing ingle,at because this agreement is permeated with unconscionable provisions,ingle,at,we hold that the entire arbitration agreement is unenforceable.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the arbitration agreement between circuit city and is substantively unconscionable.although we have serious doubts about whether the agreement is procedurally unconscionable as well,we do not decide this issue because the agreement substantive unconscionability alone renders it invalid under washington law.see adler,at,wl,at.therefore,the judgement of the district court is 
circuit city stores,circuit city appeals the district court denial of its motion to dismiss and compel arbitration of mohammed employment discrimination claims.the majority opinion affirms,holding that certain provisions of circuit city dispute resolution rules and procedures drrp in effect in are substantively unconscionable under washington law and that these unconscionable provisions pervade the entire arbitration agreement such that any attempt to sever those provisions would render the resulting procedure unworkable.op.at.
i believe that the majority opinion errs in its initial is,that it is the drrp in effect in that are at issue.rather,i believe that the modification provision in rule of the drrp in effect in is enforceable under washington law or,at the very least,that there is sufficient doubt as to certify that question to the washington supreme court and,thus,that it is the drrp in effect at the time ultimately files his arbitration request form and accompanying filing fee that govern the arbitration here.further,the drrp in effect in are not substantively unconscionable under washington law.accordingly,i would reverse or,at the very least,certify the relevant questions to the washington supreme court and,thus,respectfully dissent.
as the majority opinion sets forth,applied for a job at circuit city in june.before he submitted his application,he signed an arbitration agreement that bound to resolve all disputes arising out of his employment relationship with circuit city in accordance with the drrp.rule of the drrp in effect at the time applied for his job stated 
circuit city may alter or terminate the agreement and these dispute resolution rules and procedures on december of any year upon giving calendar days written notice to associates,provided that all claims arising before alteration or termination shall be subject to the agreement and corresponding dispute resolution rules and procedures in effect at the time the claim arose.an associate shall be deemed to have accepted a modification or termination of the dispute resolution agreement or the rules and procedures by accepting or continuing employment with circuit city after receiving notice of such modification or termination.
emphasis added.
at year end,circuit city amended rule continued working at circuit city until his employment was terminated in november.there is no issue raised by that he did not receive reasonable notice of the december,change to rule.indeed,as the majority opinion correctly notes,does not dispute that circuit city effectively implemented the drrp.op.at.
the december,amendment to rule,thus,rule of the drrp in effect in in relevant part 
circuit city may alter or terminate the agreement and these dispute resolution rules and procedures on december of any year upon giving calendar days written notice to associates,provided that all claims arising before alteration or termination shall be subject to the agreement and corresponding dispute resolution rules and procedures in effect at the time the arbitration request form and accompanying filing fee is received by the company.
emphasis added.as the majority opinion correctly concludes,t he result of this modification would be that any arbitration filed in would be governed by the drrp in effect in,as opposed to the drrp in effect when the claim arose.op.at.
the threshold and determinative question,then,is whether the drrp in effect in,when employment was terminated and his employment discrimination claim arose,govern the arbitration,rather than the drrp in effect at the time ultimately files with circuit city the arbitration request form and accompanying fee.the plain meaning of the modification provision in rule of the drrp in effect at the time employment was terminated in admits of no doubt if he sought arbitration and paid the arbitration fee immediately upon termination or at any time before december,his arbitration would be governed by the drrp in effect in.if he tarried,he ran the risk that newer arbitration rules would be adopted which would be less beneficial to him.on the other hand,delay could bring rules that would comparatively benefit him,which,in the event,is what happened.
nevertheless,the majority opinion concludes that the drrp in effect in are applicable for two reasons.first,according to the majority opinion,an employer unilateral change in policy will not be effective under washington law until employees receive reasonable notice of the change and accept the change and that circuit city did not provide reasonable notice to former employees like nor did continue his employment with circuit city,sign an acceptance,or accept the modification of the substantive arbitration rules of the drrp in any other way.op.at.second,according to the majority opinion,t he modification provision allows circuit city to alter the rules and procedures governing arbitration almost at will and,thus,rule,which permits this conduct,is substantively unconscionable under washington law and the modification provision is therefore unenforceable.op.at.
i believe that the majority opinion errs in both regards and,thus,believe that the drrp in effect at the time ultimately files with circuit city the arbitration request form and accompanying fee,rather than the drrp in effect in,govern the arbitration.
in concluding that an employer unilateral change in policy will not be effective under washington law until employees receive reasonable notice of the change and accept the change,op.at,the majority opinion relies solely on gaglidari denny restaurants,en banc.there,denny hired gaglidari to work as a bartender and,on her first day of work,provided her with a copy of the employee handbook.id.at.the employee handbook contained a provision stating that fighting while on duty was grounds for immediate dismissal,but provided for counseling review and review by a certain level manager for rule infractions not covered by the immediate dismissal provision.id.in,denny gave gaglidari an alcoholic beverage handbook,which contained a provision stating that fighting while on company premises,whether or not while on duty,was grounds for immediate dismissal.id.in,while off duty,gaglidari was involved in a fight at a denny and was fired shortly thereafter.id.at.gaglidari sued denny for breach of the employment contract as set forth in the employee handbook,and the jury returned a verdict for gaglidari.id.at.
on appeal,the washington supreme court reversed the judgment entered upon such verdict and remanded for a new trial,holding that the employee handbook gave rise to a contract but that its terms were modified by the alcoholic beverage handbook that gaglidari received in.id.at.although acknowledging that a n employer may unilaterally amend or revoke policies and procedures established in an employee handbook,the court cited to bankey storer broadcasting,for the proposition that an employer unilateral change in policy will not be effective until employees receive reasonable notice of the change.gaglidari,at.quoting bankey,the court continued an employer may,without an express reservation of the right to do so,unilaterally change its written policy from one of discharge for cause to one of termination at will,provided that the employer gives affected employees reasonable notice of the policy change.id.emphasis added.the court reasoned the reasonable notice rule of bankey is persuasive because it is unfair to place the burden of discovering policy changes on the employee.while the employee is bound by unilateral acts of the employer,it is incumbent upon the employer to inform employees of its actions.id.the court then concluded that the alcoholic beverage handbook did achieve a modification of the employment contract 
plaintiff receipt of the handbook satisfied the requisites of contract formation.defendant extended an offer by providing the handbook and training plaintiff on alcoholic beverage service in accordance with the requirements contained in the handbook.plaintiff accepted the offer by signing for the handbook and participating in the training.the consideration was plaintiff continuation of her employment.
the handbook also achieved a unilateral modification of defendant policies.plaintiff had notice of the provisions of the handbook because she signed a form saying she read it and understood it.
id.at internal citation omitted emphasis added.
with that background,it is clear that gaglidari is inapposite and that the requirement it announced is not nearly so broad as the majority opinion suggests.
first,contrary to what the majority opinion asserts,op.at,the requirement is satisfied by notice alone,regardless whether the employee accepts the change in policy.again contrary to what the majority opinion assumes,op.at,the sole articulated purpose of the requirement is not to afford the employee an opportunity to accept,reject or negotiate an offer from the employer.rather,as the court in gaglidari stated the reasonable notice rule of bankey is persuasive because it is unfair to place the burden of discovering policy changes on the employee.at emphasis added.in other words,it would be unfair to allow an an employee at be fired for a rule violation,if the rule had not been made known to her.thus,the court in gaglidari held alternatively that the p laintiff receipt of the alcoholic beverage handbook satisfied the requisites of contract formation and that,because the p laintiff had notice of the provisions of the handbook,t he handbook also achieved a unilateral modification of defendant policies.id.at.nothing in gaglidari varied the principles of employment the terms of employment and of its termination are set by the employer.
this interpretation of the scope and purpose served by gaglidari requirement was confirmed in govier north sound bank,wherein a bank presented govier with an employment agreement that changed the terms of her employment.govier refused to sign the agreement,was fired,and then sued for breach of contract under the prior terms of employment.id.at.the trial court granted the bank motion for summary judgment.id.on appeal to the washington court of appeals,govier contended that although the bank had presented her with the new terms,she did not have reasonable notice because she had not been notified of the changes a reasonable length of time before their effective date.id.at.she reasoned that the reasonable notice requirement is necessary to give the employee an opportunity to make a reasoned decision about whether to stay or leave.id.the court rejected this argument,holding that the purpose of the reasonable notice requirement is merely to inform employees of policy changes because it is unfair to place the burden of discovering policy changes on the employee.id.at emphasis in original 
thus,the fact that did not continue his employment with circuit city,sign an acceptance,or accept the modification of the substantive arbitration rules of the drrp in any other way,op.at,would have been irrelevant under gaglidari had been employed with circuit city at the time the modifications were made and,contrary to the majority opinion assertion otherwise,op.at,can be no less irrelevant under the circumstances here.as explained above,gaglidari requirement neither requires nor is premised upon the employee having an opportunity to accept,reject or negotiate changes in employment when those changes occur.further,it bears repeating,by virtue of continuing his employment with circuit city after the december,amendment to rule went into effect,assented to the modification provision itself.
second,the fact that may not have received reasonable notice of the modifications made to the substantive provisions in the drrp from to is likewise irrelevant under gaglidari.as explained above,the purpose of the requirement is to inform employees of policy changes because it is unfair to place the burden of discovering policy changes on the employee.gaglidari,at accord govier,at.this prevents situations in which employees are fired or suffer other adverse employment action on the basis of conduct that had been permissible but later was made impermissible by an unpublicized policy.see thompson,at.
thus,the requirement serves no purpose once the employment relationship has ended.why give notice of new rules to former employees who can no longer be fired for their violations to insist on the necessity of reasonable notice in such circumstances is to venerate an abstraction.see united states griefen,cir cessante ratione legis,cessat et ipsa lex.the reason of the law ceasing,the law itself also ceases.atu legislative council of washington washington,en banc same state ex rel.king county superior court of pierce county,the law being founded in reason boasts as its first cardinal principle that,when the reason for the law ceases,the law itself ceases.indeed,there appear to be no washington which the requirement was invoked when the change in employee policies occurred after the employment relationship had terminated.
here,there is no claim that employment was terminated because of a violation of the modification provision in rule of the drrp in effect in.likewise,the modifications made to the substantive provisions in the drrp from to of which occurred after employment was no bearing on why employment was terminated rather,they concern only the manner in which the arbitration is to occur.in brief as the reason for the requirement does not exist,neither does the rule.
third,unlike circuit city,the employer in gaglidari did not reserve its right to make changes to the employee handbook.the michigan case on which gaglidari relies in setting forth the requirement suggests that the requirement is limited to situations in which the employer does not make such a reservation 
an employer may,without an express reservation of the right to do so,unilaterally change its written policy from one of discharging for cause to one of termination at will,provided that the employer gives affected employees reasonable notice of the policy change.
gaglidari,at quoting bankey,at emphasis added.such reservations or disclaimers are under washington law.thompson,at t he employer may specifically reserve a right to modify employment policies or write them in a manner that retains discretion to the employer.
this distinction is not without substance given the discussion above explaining that the requirement is required not to permit for an acceptance or rejection of an employer offer by the employee,but rather because it provides th
