factual background 
in,plaintiff sharon mcgill opened a credit card account with defendant citibank,citibank and purchased a credit protector plan plan.under the plan,citibank agreed to defer or to credit certain amounts on mcgill credit card account when a qualifying event occurred,such as disability,unemployment,divorce,military service,or hospitalization.citibank charged a monthly premium for the plan based on the amount of mcgill credit card balance.
mcgill original account agreement did not contain an arbitration provision.in october,citibank sent her a notice of change in terms regarding binding arbitration to your citibank card agreement notice,which amended the original agreement by adding the following arbitration provisions either you or we may,without the other consent,elect mandatory,binding arbitration for any claim,dispute,or controversy between you and us called claims.all claims relating to your account or a prior related account,or our relationship are subject to arbitration,including claims regarding the application,enforceability,or interpretation of this agreement and this arbitration provision.all claims are subject to arbitration,no matter what legal theory they are based on or what remedy damages,or injunctive or declaratory relief they seek.this includes claims based on contract,tort including intentional tort,fraud,agency,your or our negligence,statutory or regulatory provisions,or any other sources of law and claims made independently or with other claims claims and remedies sought as part of a class action,private attorney general or other representative action are subject to arbitration on an individual,basis,and the arbitrator may award relief only on an individual,basis.this arbitration provision is governed by the federal arbitration act the faa.claims must be brought in the name of an individual person or entity and must proceed on an individual,basis.the arbitrator will not award relief for or against anyone who is not a party.if you or we require arbitration of a claim,neither you,we,nor any other person may pursue the claim in arbitration as a class action,private attorney general action or other representative action,nor may such claim be pursued on your or our behalf in any litigation in any court.
the notice stated that mcgill had the option to decline the arbitration provision and to continue using her credit card under the existing terms until the later of the end of her current membership year or the expiration date on her card s.mcgill did not decline and,according to citibank,the arbitration provision became effective on november.
in february,citibank sent mcgill a notice of change in terms,right to opt out,and information update notice,which informed her of changes to the arbitration provisions and to several other aspects of her account agreement.the notice contained an provision similar to the provision in the notice.again,mcgill did not opt out and continued using her credit card.in january,citibank sent mcgill a complete copy of her account agreement,which included arbitration provisions identical to those quoted above.
in,mcgill filed this class action based on citibank marketing of the plan and the handling of a claim she made under it when she lost her job in.the operative complaint alleges claims under the ucl,the clra,and the false advertising law,as well as the insurance code.for relief,it requests,among other things,an injunction prohibiting citibank from continuing to engage in its allegedly illegal and deceptive practices.
pursuant to the arbitration provision,citibank petitioned to compel mcgill to arbitrate her claims on an individual basis.the trial court granted the petition in part and denied it in part based on broughton and cruz,which together established the following rule agreements to arbitrate claims for public injunctive relief under the clra,the ucl,or the false advertising law are not enforceable in california.applying this rule known as the rule the trial court ordered mcgill to arbitrate all claims other than those for injunctive relief under the ucl,the false advertising law,and the clra.the court of appeal reversed and remanded for the trial court to order all of mcgill claims to arbitration,concluding that the faa,as recently construed by the united states supreme court in mobility llc concepcion concepcion,preempts the rule.
during oral argument in the court of appeal,mcgill asserted that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable because it purports to prohibit her from pursuing claims for public injunctive relief,not just in arbitration,but in any forum.the court of appeal did not mention this argument in its opinion.mcgill made the argument again in a petition for rehearing,which the court of appeal denied without addressing the merits of the issue.
mcgill filed a petition for review in this court,asserting the court of appeal erred in finding faa preemption of the rule,and the arbitration provision is invalid and unenforceable because it waives her right to seek public injunctive relief in any forum.for reasons explained below,we agree with her latter claim and we do not address the former.
ii.discussion 
we begin by summarizing the california consumer protection laws here at issue.the legislature enacted the clra to protect consumers against unfair and deceptive business practices and to provide efficient and economical procedures to secure such protection.civ.code.t o promote these purposes,the legislature directed that the clra be liberally construed and applied.ibid.after setting forth a list of unlawful methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices,the clra authorizes any consumer who has been damaged by an unlawful method,act,or practice to bring an action for various forms of relief,including a n order enjoining the methods,acts,or practices,subd.a.the clra also expressly declares that a ny waiver by a consumer of the clra provisions is contrary to public policy and shall be unenforceable and void.
the ucl addresses unfair competition,which mean s and include s any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising and any act prohibited by the false advertising law.bus.code.its purpose is to protect both consumers and competitors by promoting fair competition in commercial markets for goods and services.kasky nike,cal th.actions for relief under the ucl may be brought by various government officials and by a person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.bus.code.t he primary form of relief available under the ucl to protect consumers from unfair business practices is an injunction.in re tobacco ii cases cal th.in this regard,the ucl provides any person who engages,has engaged,or proposes to engage in unfair competition may be enjoined in any court of competent jurisdiction.the court may make such orders or judgments as may be necessary to prevent the use or employment by any person of any practice which constitutes unfair competition,as defined in this chapter,or as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property,real or personal,which may have been acquired by means of such unfair competition.bus.code.
the false advertising law makes unlawful untrue or misleading statements designed to induce the public to enter into any obligation to purchase various goods and services.bus.code.like the ucl,the false advertising law allows an action for relief to be brought by specified government officials and by any person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of a violation.bus.code.it also authorizes injunctive relief,stating any person,corporation,firm,partnership,joint stock company,or any other association or organization which violates or proposes to violate this chapter may be enjoined by any court of competent jurisdiction.the court may make such orders or judgments as may be necessary to prevent the use or employment by any person,corporation,firm,partnership,joint stock company,or any other association or organization of any practices which violate this chapter,or which may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property,real or personal,which may have been acquired by means of any practice in this chapter declared to be unlawful.ibid.
in broughton and cruz,this court discussed the nature of the injunctive relief available under these statutes.it distinguished between private injunctive relief,relief that primarily resolve s a private dispute between the parties broughton,supra,cal th at and rectif ies individual wrongs id.at,fn,and that benefits the public,if at all,only incidentally and public injunctive relief,relief that by and large benefits the general public id.at and that benefits the plaintiff,if at all,only incidental ly as a member of the general public id.at,fn.for example,the court explained in broughton,an injunction under the clra against a defendant deceptive methods,acts,and practices generally benefit s the public directly by the elimination of deceptive practices and will not benefit the plaintiff directly,because the plaintiff has already been injured,allegedly,by such practices and is aware of them.ibid.e ven if a clra plaintiff stands to benefit from an injunction against a deceptive business practice,it appears likely that the benefit would be incidental to the general public benefit of enjoining such a practice.ibid.likewise,the court explained in cruz,an injunction under the ucl or the false advertising law against deceptive advertising practices is clearly for the benefit of the general public it is designed to prevent further harm to the public at large rather than to redress or prevent injury to a plaintiff.cruz,supra,cal th at.to summarize,public injunctive relief under the ucl,the clra,and the false advertising law is relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the general public.broughton,supra,at.relief that has the primary purpose or effect of redressing or preventing injury to an individual plaintiff or to a group of individuals similarly situated to the plaintiff does not constitute public injunctive relief.
as noted ante,broughton and cruz collectively established the following rule agreements to arbitrate claims for public injunctive relief under the clra,the ucl,or the false advertising law are not enforceable in california.as also noted ante,in the proceedings below,the parties and the courts focused on the effect of this rule on citibank petition to compel mcgill to arbitrate her claims on an individual basis.the trial court applied the rule in declining to order arbitration of claims for injunctive relief under the ucl,the false advertising law,and the clra.the court of appeal,applying the high court decisions,concluded that the rule was preempted by the faa and ordered all claims to arbitration.
although we granted review to consider the court of appeal conclusion,it is now clear that the rule is not at issue in this case.as detailed above,late in the court of appeal proceedings,mcgill asserted that the arbitration provision purports to preclude her from seeking public injunctive relief in any forum.she repeats that assertion in this court,citing the following clauses of the arbitration provision a n award in arbitration shall determine the rights and obligations between the named parties only,and only in respect of the claims in arbitration,and shall not have any bearing on the rights and obligations of any other person,or on the resolution of any other dispute t he arbitrator will not award relief for or against anyone who is not a party the arbitrator may award relief only on an individual,nonrepresentative basis and neither you,we,nor any other person may pursue the claims in arbitration as a class action,private attorney general action or other representative action.at oral argument before us,citibank agreed with mcgill reading of the arbitration provision.
given the parties agreement,we do not independently analyze the arbitration provision,but proceed based on the parties shared view that it purports to preclude mcgill from seeking public injunctive relief in arbitration,in court,or in any forum.because,as citibank states,the parties elected to exclude public injunctive relief from arbitration,the rule which applies only when parties have agreed to arbitrate requests for such relief is not at issue,and we need not consider the rule vitality in light of the high court faa decisions.instead,the question before us is whether the arbitration provision is valid and enforceable insofar as it purports to waive mcgill right to seek public injunctive relief in any forum.
in answering this question,we first conclude that mcgill complaint does,in fact,appear to seek the type of public injunctive relief that broughton and cruz identified.the ucl claim alleges in part that citibank advertising and marketing of the plan is unfair,deceptive,untrue and misleading in various respects,and that citibank continue s to violate the ucl by selling the plan with advertising that includes false,misleading or deceptive information,and material omissions.for relief,it asks,among other things,for an order requiring citibank to immediately cease such acts of unfair competition and enjoining citibank from continuing to conduct business via the unlawful,fraudulent or unfair business acts and practices complained of herein and from failing to fully disclose the true nature of its misrepresentations.
the false advertising claim incorporates the allegations of the ucl claim and additionally alleges in part that citibank engaged in unfair,deceptive,untrue,and misleading advertising,relating to the plan,and disseminated or caused to be disseminated materially untrue,and misleading advertising statements with the intent to either directly or indirectly induce members of the public to purchase the plan.for relief,it requests,among other things,injunctive relief.
the clra claim incorporates the allegations of the ucl and false advertising law claims and additionally alleges in part that citibank made representations and omissions about the plan that were false,deceptive misleading,and that citibank continue s to violate the clra by making misrepresentations and concealing material facts relating to the plan and by selling the p lan based upon these misrepresentations and material omissions.for relief,it requests,among other things,injunctive relief.
more generally,the complaint prayer for relief requests,among other things a declaration that citibank violated the ucl,the false advertising law,and the clra by disseminating unfair,deceptive,or misleading advertising,and material omissions injunctive relief to ensure compliance with this section,pursuant to california business professions code sections et and california civil code section et entry of an order requiring citibank to immediately cease the wrongful conduct as set forth above and enjoining citibank from continuing to falsely advertise or conceal material information and conduct business via the unlawful and unfair business acts and practices complained of herein and entry of a judgment for injunctive relief.in light of these allegations and requests for relief,which citibank ignores,we disagree with citibank that mcgill has failed adequately to specify the actual nature of the injunctive relief she seeks or to explain how the public at large would benefit from that relief 
we also disagree with citibank that,because mcgill has not established that any of the alleged conduct she challenges is ongoing or likely to recur,she has failed to establish that the relief she seeks is,in fact,public injunctive relief.as detailed ante,mcgill alleges in her complaint that the conduct is ongoing.at this stage of the proceeding a motion to compel arbitration it is premature to consider whether she has established these allegations with proof or how her failure to do so would ultimately affect her request for injunctive relief.see aguilar avis rent a car system,cal th,plur.opn.of george,the mere fact that a defendant refrains from unlawful conduct during the pendency of a lawsuit does not necessarily preclude the trial court from issuing injunctive relief to prevent a posttrial continuation of the unlawful conduct.robinson u haul of california th,t here is no rule that a party discontinuance of illegal behavior makes injunctive relief unavailable.while voluntary cessation of conduct may be a factor in a court exercise of its equitable jurisdiction to issue an injunction,it is not determinative.in arguing otherwise,citibank,quoting green tree financial.randolph,asserts that the party resisting arbitration bears the burden of proving that the claims at issue are unsuitable for arbitration.but citibank cites no authority and we are aware of none applying this principle,which governs an effort to resist arbitration of a claim the parties agreed to arbitrate,to an effort to pursue a claim the parties excluded from arbitration.
we next address the following threshold issue whether amendments to the ucl and the false advertising law eliminated the ability of private plaintiffs like mcgill to seek public injunctive relief under those laws before,these statutes authorized action by any person acting for the interests of itself,its members or the general public.bus.code,former,as amended by stats,ch,ucl,former,as amended by stats,ch,false advertising law.in,the voters,by passing proposition,amended these statutes to provide that private individuals may file an action for relief only if they have suffered injury in fact and have lost money or property as a result of a violation bus.code,and pursue representative claims or relief on behalf of others only if they meet these standing requirements and compl y with section of the code of civil procedure,which relates to representative suits.the amended statutes also specify that these limitations do not apply to claims brought by the attorney general,or a ny district attorney,county counsel,city attorney,or city prosecutor in this state.ibid.in uncodified sections,proposition identified the f il ing of lawsuits by private attorneys on behalf of the general public as a misuse of the unfair competition laws,subd.b,west ann.bus.code ed.foll,hereafter annotated code,and stated the voters intent that only the california attorney general and local public officials be authorized to file and prosecute actions on behalf of the general public,subd.f.
we conclude that these provisions do not preclude a private individual who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of a violation of the ucl or the false advertising law bus.code,and who therefore has standing to file a private action from requesting public injunctive relief in connection with that action.a person who meets these requirements is fil ing the lawsuit or action on his or her own behalf,not on behalf of the general public,subds.b,f,ann.code,supra,at.this remains true even if the person seeks,as one of the requested remedies,injunctive relief the primary purpose and effect of which is to prohibit and enjoin conduct that is injurious to the general public.broughton,supra,cal th at.we find nothing in the ballot materials for proposition suggesting that voters,in stating their intent that only the california attorney general and local public officials be authorized to file and prosecute actions on behalf of the general public,subd.f,ann.code,supra,at,meant to preclude individuals who meet the standing requirements for bringing a private action from requesting such relief.on the contrary,the attorney general official title and summary explained that,under proposition,if an individual was actually injured by,and suffered loss because of,an unfair business practice,he or she could sue for private enforcement of the unfair business competition laws.voter information guide,official title and summary of.as we have already noted ante,an injunction is the primary form of relief available under the ucl to protect consumers from unfair business practices.in re tobacco ii cases,supra,cal th at see clayworth pfizer,cal th,i f a party has standing under the ucl,it may seek injunctive relief.
for several reasons,we also conclude that a request for such relief does not constitute the pursu it of representative claims or relief on behalf of others within the meaning of business and professions code sections or,such that compli ance with section of the code of civil procedure is required.first,reading the phrase on behalf of others bus.code,or as referring to the general public would create conflict with other parts of proposition.this reading would seem to authorize private individuals to proceed on behalf of the general public if they compl y with section of the code of civil procedure bus.code,which would conflict with the voters stated intent that only the california attorney general and local public officials be authorized to file and prosecute actions on behalf of the general public,subd.f,ann.code,supra,at,italics added.we must,if possible,harmonize all of the relevant provisions of proposition.spanish speaking citizens foundation,low th,construing.
second,we have held that the phrase compl y with section of the code of civil procedure bus.code,imposes a requirement that the action be brought as a class action.arias superior court cal th.this requirement has never been imposed with regard to requests to enjoin future wrongful business practices that will injure the public,and we find nothing in the ballot materials for proposition suggesting an intent to link or restrict such relief to the class action context.indeed,imposing this requirement would largely eliminate the ability of a private plaintiff to pursue such relief,because class certification requires the existence of both an ascertainable class and a community of interest among the class members washington mutual bank superior court cal th,and the general public fails to meet this requirement czap credit bureau of santa clara valley d.
supporting this conclusion is our decision in kraus trinity management services,cal th,which explained that under the ucl standing provision,not all actions brought on behalf of absent persons by a private party had to be certified as a class action.after noting that that standing provision authorized a ny person acting for the interests of itself,its members or the general public to seek ucl relief on behalf of the general public,we stated we use the term representative action to refer to a ucl action that is not certified as a class action in which a private person is the plaintiff and seeks disgorgement restitution on behalf of persons other than or in addition to the plaintiff.kraus,at,fn,italics added.it seems likely that when the voters,just a few years later in,revised the ucl standing provisions to require representative claims to be brought as class actions bus.code,they had in mind,not an action requesting public injunctive relief,but the kind of representative action we discussed in kraus,a ucl action that is not certified as a class action in which a private person is the plaintiff and seeks disgorgement restitution on behalf of persons other than or in addition to the plaintiff.kraus,at,fn,italics added.
having determined that public injunctive relief remains a remedy available to private plaintiffs under the ucl and the false advertising law,as well as under the clra,we next conclude that the arbitration provision here at issue is invalid and unenforceable under state law insofar as it purports to waive mcgill statutory right to seek such relief.civil code section provides any one may waive the advantage of a law intended solely for his benefit.but a law established for a public reason can not be contravened by a private agreement.consistent with this provision,we have explained that a party may waive a statutory provision if a statute does not prohibit doing so citation,the statute public benefit is merely incidental to its primary purpose citation,and waiver does not seriously compromise any public purpose that the statute was intended to serve citation.deberard properties,lim cal th.by definition,the public injunctive relief available under the ucl,the clra,and the false advertising law,as discussed in broughton and cruz,is primarily for the benefit of the general public.broughton,supra,cal th at see cruz,supra,cal th at.its evident purpose,the court said in broughton,is to remedy a public wrong,not to resolve a private dispute broughton,at,and any benefit to the plaintiff requesting such relief likely would be incidental to the general public benefit of enjoining such a practice.id.at,fn.accordingly,the waiver in a predispute arbitration agreement of the right to seek public injunctive relief under these statutes would seriously compromise the public purposes the statutes were intended to serve.thus,insofar as the arbitration provision here purports to waive mcgill right to request in any forum such public injunctive relief,it is invalid and unenforceable under california law.
citibank does not argue that the waiver is valid under california law.instead,it argues that a california rule precluding enforcement of the waiver would be preempted by the faa.according to citibank,the faa requires enforcement of the arbitration provision as written,regardless of what it says or implies about claims seeking public injunctive relief.a court,citibank asserts,may not avoid the faa by applying rules of contract interpretation to limit the scope of an agreement to arbitrate.
we reject citibank overbroad view of the faa.as citibank observes,the high court has stated that section of the faa requires courts to place arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other contracts citation and to enforce them according to their terms.concepcion,supra,at.however,the high court has qualified this statement by reference to t he final phrase of,which is known as the faa saving clause and which permits arbitration agreements to be declared unenforceable upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.concepcion,at.this clause,the high court has stated,indicates that congress purpose in enacting the faa was to make arbitration agreements as enforceable as other contracts,but not more so.prima paint flood conklin,fn,italics added prima paint.thus,arbitration agreements,l ike other contracts,may be invalidated by generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,west,jackson.they may not,however,be invalidated by defenses that apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.concepcion,at.
the contract defense at issue here a law established for a public reason can not be contravened by a private agreement civ.code,is a generally applicable contract defense,it is a ground under california law for revoking any contract.little auto stiegler,cal th,little ground for refusing to enforce a contractual term is that it would force a party to forgo unwaivable public rights.it is not a defense that applies only to arbitration or that derives its meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.as explained above,a provision in any contract even a contract that has no arbitration provision that purports to waive,in all fora,the statutory right to seek public injunctive relief under the ucl,the clra,or the false advertising law is invalid and unenforceable under california law.the faa does not require enforcement of such a provision,in derogation of this generally applicable contract defense,merely because the provision has been inserted into an arbitration agreement.to conclude otherwise would,contrary to congress intent,make arbitration agreements not merely as enforceable as other contracts,but more so.prima paint,supra,at,fn.
our conclusion is consistent with the high court statement that,b y agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim,a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than a judicial,forum.mitsubishi motors soler.this statement,this court has said,is as much prescriptive as it is descriptive.that is,it sets a standard by which arbitration agreements and practices are to be measured,and disallows forms of arbitration that in fact compel claimants to forfeit certain substantive statutory rights.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th.likewise,the high court has recently indicated that the faa does not require enforcement of a provision in an arbitration agreement that forbid s the assertion of certain statutory rights or that eliminates the right to pursue a statutory remedy.american express italian colors restaurant,italian colors see mitsubishi motors,at,fn.i n the event the arbitration and clauses operated in tandem as a prospective waiver of a party right to pursue statutory remedies for antitrust violations,we would have little hesitation in condemning the agreement as against public policy.consistent with this principle,we have held that the faa does not require enforcement of a provision in an arbitration agreement that,in violation of generally applicable california contract law,limit s statutorily imposed remedies such as punitive damages and attorney fees.armendariz,at.here,we likewise conclude that the faa does not require enforcement of a provision in a predispute arbitration agreement that,in violation of generally applicable california contract law,waives the right to seek in any forum public injunctive relief under the ucl,the clra,or the false advertising law.
citibank argues that the above principles apply only when enforcement of an arbitration agreement would lead to forfeiture of a federal statutory right.this is so,citibank asserts,because only federal statutes stand on equal footing with and therefore modify the faa,whereas a state law that is in conflict with federal law is preempted by the faa.
citibank argument is inconsistent with high court authority.in preston ferrer,the high court held that the faa preempts state laws that lodge in a judicial or administrative forum primary jurisdiction over claims the parties have agreed to arbitrate.in stating its reasoning,the court explained in part i t bears repeating that the petition to arbitrate presents precisely and only a question concerning the forum in which the parties dispute will be heard.citation.by agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim,a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral forum.citation.so here,the party resisting arbitration relinquishes no substantive rights the california talent agencies act or other california law may accord him.but under the contract he signed,he can not escape resolution of those rights in an arbitral forum.preston,at.this discussion would make no sense if,as citibank asserts,the fact an arbitration agreement purports to waive a substantive right under state law were irrelevant to whether the faa requires the agreement enforcement.
more fundamentally,citibank argument misunderstands the nature of the faa saving clause.as noted above,that clause provides that an arbitration agreement may be declared unenforceable upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.the high court has explained that this clause explicitly retains an external body of state law governing revocation.arthur andersen llp carlisle.under it,s t
