jerry grizzle,doyle motley and gary johnson,three principals in a corporation called warehouse,cdwi,appeal the district court order denying their motion to compel arbitration of the tort lawsuit partners,filed against them.the lawsuit accuses the three of negligence,negligent misrepresentation,and fraudulent misrepresentation arising out of four franchise agreements between cdwi franchisor and partners franchisee.the district court denied the motion on the grounds the three principals were not signatories to the franchise agreements between the two corporations,and the tort lawsuit was not covered by the agreements arbitration clauses.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
between and,cdwi and partners signed four franchise agreements to operate retail stores under the name cd warehouse.the purpose of the agreements was to sell new and used music compact discs cds.each franchise agreement contained an identical arbitration clause which stated,in relevant part except as provided in this agreement,franchisor and franchisee agree that any claim,controversy or dispute arising out of or relating to franchisee operation of the franchised business under the agreement which can not be amicably settled shall be referred to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the american arbitration association.in addition,each franchise agreement provided nothing in this agreement is intended,nor shall be deemed,to confer upon any person or legal entity other than franchisee,franchisor,franchisor officers,directors,and employees any rights or remedies under or by reason of this agreement.in each instance,the agreements were signed by david gott on behalf of partners and jerry grizzle on behalf of cdwi.
in april,a contractual dispute arose between the two corporations.partners filed suit against cdwi in iowa state court.cdwi removed the action to federal district court,where it was subsequently stayed pending arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clauses in the parties franchise agreements.the arbitration was never held,however,because cdwi filed for bankruptcy.
in may,partners filed this suit in iowa state court.whereas the first suit sounded in contract and was brought directly against the corporation cdwi,the second suit sounded in tort and was brought directly against the three individuals who comprised cdwi primary grizzle,its president and chief executive officer ceo doyle motley,its chief financial officer cfo and gary johnson,its chief operating officer coo.the complaint alleged negligence,negligent misrepresentation,and fraudulent misrepresentation.
the complaint alleged grizzle was negligent in nine specific ways,all related to the operation of the franchises for example,failing to protect the exclusive territories under the franchise agreements,failing to make improvements to software,failing to provide suitable and timely financing for capital improvements to the stores.similarly,the negligence allegations against motley and johnson all related to the operation of the franchises.the negligent misrepresentation count alleged all three defendants provided partners with false information to influence the franchise transactions between the parties,which caused damage to partners.the fraudulent misrepresentation count alleged all three defendants knew certain representations they made were false,and that they intended to deceive partners.
the three principals removed the case to federal district court and filed a motion to compel arbitration pursuant to the franchise agreements between partners and cdwi.they argued they could enforce the arbitration clauses between the two the fact they were not signatories to the the tort allegations against them arose from the contractual relationship between the two corporations,and the claims against them arose from the duties they performed while acting as officers of the signatory,cdwi.partners resisted the motion,contending the three principals could not enforce the arbitration clauses because they were not signatories and the tort claims against the officers did not fall within the scope of the arbitration clauses.
the district court denied the motion to compel arbitration concluding neither the claims nor damages sought in this case are the same as those sought against the corporation in that earlier lawsuit.grizzle,motley and johnson filed this timely appeal.
we review de novo the denial of a motion to compel arbitration.telectronics pacing,guidant,cir.a ny doubts raised in construing contract language on arbitrability should be resolved in favor of arbitration.id.at quoting moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.grizzle,motley and johnson contend they can enforce the arbitration clauses in the franchise agreements between cdwi and partners despite their status as nonsignatories.we agree.
a nonsignatory can enforce an arbitration clause against a signatory to the agreement in several circumstances.one is when the relationship between the signatory and nonsignatory defendants is sufficiently close that only by permitting the nonsignatory to invoke arbitration may evisceration of the underlying arbitration agreement between the signatories be avoided.ms dealer serv.franklin,cir quoting boyd homes of legend.another is when the signatory to a written agreement containing an arbitration clause must rely on the terms of the written agreement in asserting its claims against the nonsignatory.id.quoting sunkist soft drinks,sunkist growers,cir.when each of a signatory claims against a nonsignatory makes reference to or presumes the existence of the written agreement,the signatory claims arise out of and relate directly to the written agreement,and arbitration is appropriate.id.internal quotations omitted.
we believe both circumstances are present here.the relationship between signatory cdwi and the nonsignatory appellants is a close one.the tort allegations against the three appellants all arise out of their conduct while acting as officers of cdwi.evisceration of the underlying arbitration agreement will be avoided only by allowing the three principals to invoke arbitration.similarly,partners claims against the three appellants rely upon,refer to,and presume the existence of the written agreement between the two corporations.thus,arbitration is appropriate.
the authority cited by partners is inapposite.for example,flink carlson,cir,involved a signatory attempting to force a nonsignatory into arbitration.see id.at affirming district court stay of arbitration of a brokerage house claims against the individual representative who was not a signatory to the agreements in question see also merrill lynch inv.managers optibase,cir affirming district court grant of a preliminary injunction enjoining an investor from proceeding with arbitration against fund advisor who had not agreed to arbitration.
this is not such a case.this is a case where a nonsignatory with a close relationship to a signatory wants the other signatory to arbitrate a claim.the test for determining whether a nonsignatory can force a signatory into arbitration is different from the test for determining whether a signatory can force a nonsignatory into arbitration 
i t matters whether the party resisting arbitration is a signatory or not a willing nonsignatory seeking to arbitrate with a signatory that is unwilling may do so under what has been called an alternative estoppel theory which takes into consideration the relationships of persons,wrongs,and issues,b ut a willing signatory seeking to arbitrate with a that is unwilling must establish at least one of the five theories described in,am.arbitration ass n,cir.
merrill lynch,at internal citations and quotations omitted.the courts clearly recognize a nonsignatory ability to force a signatory into arbitration under the alternative estoppel theory when the relationship of the persons,wrongs and issues involved is a close one.see,astra oil rover navigation,cir holding a nonsignatory may compel arbitration against a signatory to an arbitration agreement because of nonsignatory close affiliation with the other signatory party to the agreement.
the dissent relies upon a case not cited by partners,m
