procedural history

discussion 
appealability 
giorgianni raises a threshold issue concerning appealability.the existence of an appealable judgment is a jurisdictional prerequisite to an appeal.jennings marralle cal th.giorgianni challenge is without merit.

although giorgianni concedes that an appeal from a judgment entered on an order confirming an arbitration award is proper code civ.proa,subd.d,she argues that crowley can not maintain this appeal because he did not challenge the award by moving to vacate or correct it or by requesting a trial de novo.she cites knass blue cross of california d knass in support of this contention.there,after the plaintiff filed suit against his medical insurer,the parties stipulated to binding arbitration.id.at.an award was rendered in favor of the insurer and a judgment was thereafter entered.ibid.the plaintiff did not file a petition to vacate or correct the award as required under the california arbitration act rather,he appealed from the judgment and claimed the award should be vacated due to an error of law.ibid.the court rejected the challenge,concluding the plaintiff had waived the right to contest the arbitration award by failing to petition to vacate it within days after service of the award,as required by code of civil procedure section.knass,at.
knass is inapposite.the parties here did not stipulate to binding arbitration,and crowley does not contend that the award contained an error of law.rather,he urges that it was nonbinding as provided under the mfaa and that he timely rejected it by filing the small claims action within days after its service.and he presented these challenges in opposition to giorgianni petition to confirm the award.under the circumstances,crowley preserved his objection to entry of judgment on the award,and knass has no application here.
moreover,giorgianni claim that crowley did not perfect the appeal because he purportedly did not request a trial de novo involves circular reasoning.under this view,the court determination that crowley filing of the small claims action was legally ineffective which was the premise for its rejection of crowley position and its confirmation of the award would be unassailable,because the assumed validity of the court conclusion would preclude an appeal.there is no justification for precluding a party right to appeal on this basis.kaatz city of seaside th,denying motion to dismiss founded on contention that shortened time limit for appeal in validation action applied,where appellant challenged trial court decision that suit constituted validation action.

the mfaa was enacted in to address the concern that fee disputes constituted the most serious problem between attorneys and their clients.see aguilar lerner cal th.the policy behind the mandatory fee arbitration statutes was to alleviate the disparity in bargaining power in attorney fee matters which favors the attorney by providing an effective,inexpensive remedy to a client which does not necessitate the hiring of a second attorney.citation.manatt,phelps,rothenberg tunney lawrence d,see also huang cheng th,mfaa purpose and policy are to ensure the fair resolution of attorney fee disputes.

discussion of claim of error 
contentions 
the parties agree that section c is the statute governing crowley rejection of the award and request for trial de novo that statute reads as follows if no action is pending,the trial after arbitration shall be initiated by the commencement of an action in the court having jurisdiction over the amount of money in controversy within days after service of notice of the award.after the filing of such an action,the action shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of part commencing with section of the code of civil procedure,concerning civil actions generally.italics added.giorgianni central position is that crowley purported rejection of the award was legally ineffective because it was filed in the wrong court,small claims court.the issue on appeal therefore is the proper definition of the phrase the court having jurisdiction over the amount of money in controversy in section c.
crowley contends that the fee dispute that was the subject of his small claims action was his claim against giorgianni for approximately in attorney fees.he filed his claim,including a de novo request,in small claims court,seeking,waiving any fees in excess of that amount.he contends therefore that he complied with section c,because the amount of money in controversy was,which was within the jurisdictional limit of the small claims court.
giorgianni responds that crowley purported de novo request was legally ineffective under section c,because it was not initiated in the court having jurisdiction over the amount in controversy in the fee arbitration.she claims that the amount in controversy was,the amount she claimed in the arbitration and fell within the purview of the unlimited jurisdiction of the superior court.in the same breath,giorgianni argues that because the amount of the award was,the matter was subject to unlimited superior court jurisdiction,presumably because the amount of money in controversy under section c was,well over the jurisdictional limit of the small claims court.she argues further that crowley filed in the wrong court because under the code of civil procedure,a dissatisfied party in an mfaa proceeding may seek a trial de novo by filing a rejection in small claims court only if the fee dispute involv es no more than five thousand dollars in controversy code civ,subd.a,a circumstance she claims was not present here 
rules of statutory interpretation 
our resolution of this appeal is dependent on construing the phrase amount of money in controversy in section c.in cases of statutory interpretation,where the language is clear,its plain meaning should be followed.citation.great lakes properties,city of el segundo cal d.we will give effect to statutes according to the usual,ordinary import of the language employed in framing them citations moyer workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,moyer and will apply common sense to the language at hand and interpret the statute to make it workable and reasonable.citation.wasatch property management degrate cal th.where the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous,we need not look to the legislature intent however,we are not precluded by this plain meaning rule from ascertaining whether a literal interpretation of the statute is consistent with its purpose.lungren deukmejian cal d,see also moyer,at court should discern legislative intent so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.
the legislative intent of a statute may be revealed from a review of b oth the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment.dyna med,fair employment housing com.cal d,dyna med.the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.citations.ibid.and in cases where the meaning of the statutory language is uncertain,the court may also consider the consequences of a particular interpretation,including its impact on public policy.citation.schatz,supra,cal th at.and the statute should be interpreted to avoid an absurd result.citations.wasatch property management degrate,supra,cal th at.
in this instance,the mfaa does not define amount of money in controversy in section c.similarly,the code of civil procedure does not define the term in controversy for purposes of determining when a party may reject a nonbinding mfaa arbitration award by filing a limited civil case code civ.proc,subd.a b,or an action in small claims court code civ.proc,subd.a.the in controversy language relevant for rejecting an mfaa arbitration award is not so clear and unambiguous that there is no need for construction,or to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature lungren deukmejian,supra,cal d at.but we are aware of no legislative history and the parties have cited none that assists us in construing the language of section c.accordingly,we will apply relevant principles of statutory interpretation to address giorgianni claim that section c should be interpreted to require the party initiating the action to base subject matter jurisdiction on the amount of the arbitration award giorgianni alternative position that such filing should be made in the court with jurisdiction over the amount demanded by the party in the mfaa arbitration and,after rejecting both of giorgianni contentions,ascertaining the proper meaning of amount of money in controversy in section c to determine whether crowley filed the request for trial in the proper court.
arbitration award does not define amount in controversy 
we address giorgianni assertion that crowley filed in the wrong court because the amount of money in controversy under section c is determined by the amount of the arbitration award,which,here,was well over the jurisdictional ceiling of the small claims court.we reject this contention.
the mfaa employs two distinct phrases with respect to filings in instances in which no action is pending.under section,subdivision b,a party seeking to confirm,correct,or vacate the award may do so by filing a petition in the court having jurisdiction over the amount of the arbitration award.clearly,this fixes subject matter jurisdiction by the amount of the award.in contrast,under section c,a dissatisfied party seeking to reject the award must file within days of service of the award an action in the court having jurisdiction over the amount of money in controversy.similarly,the small claims act code civ,et makes a distinction as to the jurisdictional grounds a party may assert for filing an action in small claims court after mfaa arbitration.a party may file a petition to confirm,correct,or vacate an mfaa arbitration award in small claims court if the award is one that does not exceed five thousand dollars code civ.proa,subd.a,while a party seeking to reject an award may do so in small claims court when the fee dispute involve es no more than five thousand dollars in controversy ibid.see also code civ.proa,subd.a b specifying limited civil case jurisdiction for petitions to confirm,correct,or vacate mfaa award where the arbitration award is thousand dollars or less code civ.proa,subd.a b declaratory relief action as a limited civil case proper t o conduct a trial after nonbinding mfaa fee arbitration where the amount in controversy is thousand dollars or less.
thus,when the legislature wishes to define subject matter jurisdiction by reference to the amount of the mfaa arbitration award,it does so unambiguously.see,subd.b code civ.proa,subd.a b,subd.a.plainly,the language amount of money in controversy in section c can not be reasonably construed as basing jurisdiction on the amount of the nonbinding mfaa arbitration award.dyna med,supra,cal d at rejecting construction of statute as authorizing fair employment and housing commission to award punitive damages,where review of other statutes disclosed that when the legislature intends to authorize an agency to award damages for discrimination,it does so expressly.
moreover,in certain instances,such a construction would have the effect of restricting the amount that could be claimed after the rejection of an mfaa arbitration award.for instance,if an attorney made a claim in the arbitration for fees or,conversely,if a client made a claim for refund of fees already paid of,but was awarded only,he or she would be forced to file the de novo request as a limited action if the amount of money in controversy language in section c were construed as meaning the amount of the arbitration award.the attorney or client rejecting the arbitration award would therefore be precluded from asserting the full amount of his or her claim.this circumstance flies in the face of the notion that an arbitration award under the mfaa is nonbinding if a dissatisfied party timely rejects it were giorgianni interpretation accepted,the award would effectively place an unwarranted ceiling on the amount of the claim de novo.
arbitration claim does not define amount in controversy 
giorgianni argues alternatively that the amount of money in controversy under section c is determined by the amount claimed by her in the mfaa arbitration.under this theory,crowley filed his rejection of the award in the wrong court because giorgianni arbitration claim was for approximately.we reject this position as well.
there is nothing in the mfaa that suggests that a party,in rejecting a nonbinding arbitration award where no action is pending,must refer to the amount that had been claimed by any party in the arbitration itself in determining the court having jurisdiction over the de novo request.indeed,there is no reference at all in the mfaa to the amounts claimed in the arbitration process.as noted,an award rendered after mfaa arbitration is nonbinding.schatz,supra,cal th at.accordingly,one dissatisfied with an award is entitled to a trial and if the party rejects the award,the case may,following mfaa arbitration,proceed by normal means.id.at see also aguilar lerner,supra,cal th at conc.opn.of chin,if arbitration is held but does not resolve the dispute,then the mfaa has played its role,and the matter would continue without it liska v.the arns law firm th,either party may reject the arbitration award and proceed with litigation.consistently with these principles,unless either the parties stipulate that the mfaa award will be binding or no party timely rejects the award,the award and determinations of the arbitrators shall not be admissible nor operate as collateral estoppel or res judicata in any action or proceeding,subd.e.thus,where an mfaa arbitration award is timely rejected,trial after arbitration is conducted de novo,essentially as if no arbitration had occurred.maynard brandon,supra,cal th at see also id.at.reference to arbitration claims in determining the proper court with jurisdiction to decide the dispute appears to be antithetical to the notion that rejection of a nonbinding award results in the matter proceeding as if no arbitration had occurred.
using the amount demanded in arbitration as the jurisdictional basis for a new action to reject an mfaa arbitration award would also promote uncertainty in cases where attorney and client have for monetary relief.if section c amount of money in controversy language were construed as the amount demanded in arbitration,where the,such as is the case here,involved the jurisdiction of different courts,the amount of one demand would constitute an unlimited civil case,while the other demand a limited civil case which demand would control the possibilities would include the amount of the arbitration demand by the party rejecting the arbitration award,by the party not rejecting the award,or that was the larger.the preservation of the right to reject a nonbinding mfaa award should not be the subject of such guesswork.
we also consider two statutory schemes outside of the mfaa.see people woodhead cal d,courts may be aided in interpreting ambiguous statutory language by referring to other statutes applying similar or analogous subjects see also smith rae venter law group cal th,court considers statutory language of settlement offer and judicial arbitration statutes in construing language requiring assessment of fees and costs under,subd.c,against unsuccessful party.in the context of judicial arbitration code civ.proc,et,a party electing to have a trial de novo by making a timely demand under the statute code civ.proc,subd.b wipes the judicial arbitration slate clean.a timely request for trial de novo operates to vacate the arbitration award in its entirety,putting the case at large as though no arbitration proceedings had occurred.southern pacific transportation mendez trucking,th,see also lewco iron metals,superior court th,cal.rule of court,rule c.similarly,after the california labor commissioner renders an order,decision,or award on an employee wage claim,a dissatisfied party may within days seek review by filing an appeal to the superior court,where the appeal shall be heard de novo.although denoted an appeal,unlike a conventional appeal in a civil action,hearing under the labor code is de novo.citation.a hearing de novo under labor code section literally means a new hearing,that is,a new trial.citation.the decision of the commissioner is entitled to no weight whatsoever,and the proceedings are truly a trial anew in the fullest sense.citation.post associates cal th,see also murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th.
further,reference to a demand made in mfaa arbitration to determine a court jurisdiction over subsequent proceedings after the award is rejected is inconsistent with the understanding of a trial de novo generally.a hearing de novo literally means a new hearing,or a hearing the second time.citation.such a hearing contemplates an entire trial of the controversial matter in the same manner in which the same was originally heard.it is in no sense a review of the hearing previously held,but is a complete trial of the controversy,the same as if no previous hearing had ever been held a hearing de novo therefore is nothing more nor less than a trial of the controverted matter by the court in which it is held.the decision therein is binding upon the parties thereto and takes the place of and completely nullifies the former determination of the matter.it is in a sense and is in fact a trial of the controversy in a court of law.collier wallis,astor cal d,see also black law dict.ed,trial de novo.a new trial on the entire case that is,on both questions of fact and issues of law conducted as if there had been no trial in the first instance.
thus,use of a prior demand in the superseded arbitration as the amount of money in controversy to establish the court jurisdiction for a de novo request under the mfaa is not consonant with the mfaa the notion that a proper rejection of an mfaa award results in a trial as if the nonbinding arbitration never happened common sense,because where there have been arbitration,there is the potential for uncertainty as to which demand will control in the filing of the rejection of the award the principle under other nonbinding arbitration statutes,judicial arbitration that proper rejection of the award results in a trial as if the arbitration did not occur or the understanding of de novo trials generally.we therefore reject giorgianni interpretation of the amount of money in controversy language in section c as requiring that a de novo request by initiation of a new action be based upon the amount previously demanded in the arbitration.
amount in controversy determined by plaintiff claim 
we have concluded that a party rejecting an mfaa arbitration award by filing a new action under section c need not determine the court with proper jurisdiction to decide the controversy by reference to the amount of the award or the amount demanded in the arbitration.it remains for us to decide what does amount of money in controversy mean in this context.
as noted above,neither the mfaa nor the small claims act defines the term in controversy as used in section c and in code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,respectively.but generally,the amount of the demand in the complaint is t he decisive factor in determining whether the court in which the action is filed has subject matter jurisdiction.people argonaut ins.d,see also minor municipal court d.as one court,quoting from an older decision of our high court,explained ordinarily the relief claimed when the action is instituted determines the jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter for the entire proceeding.citations.davis superior court d,quoting sellery ward cal d.
the legislature has intended that the small claims court be available to resolve minor civil disputes expeditiously,inexpensively,and fairly,code civ.proc,subd.b.that phrase,minor civil disputes,refers to the financial value of the claim to the individual plaintiff.city and county of san francisco small claims court d,construing former code civ.proc,the predecessor statute to code civ.proc.
we note further that in chapter of the code of civil procedure the chapter that precedes the small claims act,the statute establishing jurisdiction for limited civil cases includes the condition that t he amount in controversy not exceed thousand dollars.as used in this section,amount in controversy means the amount of the demand,or the recovery sought,or the value of the property,or the amount of the lien,that is in controversy in the action,exclusive of attorneys fees,interest,and costs.code civ.proc,subd.a.thus,the jurisdictional propriety of filing an action as a limited civil case is determined by reference to the plaintiff demand or the amount of recovery he or she seeks.see ytuarte superior court th,whether case qualifies as limited civil action determined initially by prayer or demand in plaintiff complaint.
for these reasons,in this case,we construe amount of money in controversy as provided in section c to mean the amount of demand or recovery sought by the plaintiff filing the rejection of the mfaa arbitration award.this interpretation of section c give s effect to statutes according to the usual,ordinary import of the language employed in framing them moyer,supra,cal d at,and make s the mfaa workable and reasonable wasatch property management degrate,supra,cal th at.it also harmonizes the provisions of the mfaa specifically,the different jurisdictional language appearing in section,subdivision b and section c by treating the jurisdictional component when a party initiates an action to confirm,correct,or vacate an award differently than when a party rejects an award by initiating a new action.
our conclusion is consistent with the statutory purpose of providing a speedy and economical procedure for resolving fee disputes aguilar lerner,supra,cal th at,while at the same time preserving the rights of both parties to judicial resolution of such disputes by making mfaa arbitration awards nonbinding unless the parties stipulate in writing to it being binding,subd.a or they both fail to timely reject the award,subd.b.see schatz,supra,cal th at,mfaa award presumed to be nonbinding.and in concluding that section c in controversy language should be construed by reference to the amount of the claim of the dissatisfied party filing the.de novo request,we are also mindful of the potential consequences of this particular interpretation on public policy.citation.schatz,supra,cal th at.our construction of the statute promotes the resolution of fee disputes on their merits a contrary interpretation here might preclude an attorney or client from exercising a statutory right to reject a nonbinding mfaa arbitration award by rendering as a nullity an otherwise timely de novo request that facially appears to have been filed in the proper court based upon the amount of that party claim.
conclusion 
we apply our construction of section c to the case before us.the amount claimed by crowley in the small claims action was an amount not to exceed for u npaid fees for services and costs expended.he confirmed this amount in controversy in the form attached to the complaint.the prayer of the complaint determines the amount in controversy.citation.minor municipal court,supra,d at.the small claims court therefore had subject matter jurisdiction over crowley de novo request pursuant to section c and code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,respectively,since the amount of money in controversy and the fee dispute involve ed no more than five thousand dollars in controversy.although not part of the complaint,to the extent that crowley claim against giorgianni for fees and costs exceeded as the claim in arbitration was approximately any lack of jurisdiction due solely to an excess in the amount of the demand is not fatal because the excess may be waived code civ.proc,subd.d see also jellinek superior court d,plaintiff intentionally waives excess damages over the small claims court jurisdictional limit when she chooses to file her case in the small claims court.
moreover,giorgianni is in no way prejudiced by crowley decision to file the de novo request in small claims court and waive any excess damages.she may preserve her affirmative against crowley to recover fees she previously paid him by bringing her own claim against crowley by filing an action in superior court presumably as an unlimited civil case,given the amount of her claim in arbitration and requesting that crowley small claims action be transferred to the court in which she files the action.see code civ.proc,subd.a see also code civ.proa,party to limited civil case filing in excess of jurisdiction of limited civil case must designate on pleading that action or proceeding is a limited civil case to be reclassified by.
our conclusion here takes into consideration a key component of the mfaa,namely,that a party dissatisfied with the arbitration award must make a timely and unequivocal rejection of it by filing a de novo request in the pending action,subd.b,or if no action is pending,by initiating a new action c.crowley made such a timely and unequivocal rejection of the award here.shiver,mcgrane martin liitell.app d,holding that clients had not complied with mfaa by timely rejection of award through filing within days of malpractice suit t
