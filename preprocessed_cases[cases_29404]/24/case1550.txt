the parties agreed to submit to the arbitrator a ll disputes,claims,or controversies arising from or relating to this contract or the relationships which result from this contract.and the dispute about what the arbitration contract in each case means,whether it forbids the use of class arbitration procedures is a dispute relating to this contract and the resulting relationships.hence the parties seem to have agreed that an arbitrator,not a judge,would answer the relevant question.citation.and if there is doubt about that the scope of arbitrable issues we should resolve that doubt in favor of arbitration.citation.

the question the contracts forbid class not fall into this narrow exception.it concerns neither the validity of the arbitration clause nor its applicability to the underlying dispute between the parties.t he question is not whether the parties wanted a judge or an arbitrator to decide whether they agreed to arbitrate the matter.citation.rather the relevant question here is what kind of arbitration proceeding the parties agreed to.that question does not concern a state statute or judicial procedures citation.it concerns contract interpretation and arbitration procedures.arbitrators are well situated to answer that question.given these considerations,along with the arbitration contracts sweeping language concerning the scope of the questions committed to arbitration,this matter of contract interpretation should be for the arbitrator,not the courts,to decide.citation.green tree financial bazzle,supra,at.at.
