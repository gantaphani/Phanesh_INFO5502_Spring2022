the defendant pfizer,pfizer herein appeals the district court ruling on its motion to dismiss the claims of plaintiff joseph simon simon.
pfizer argues that the district court erred in failing to dismiss simon complaint concerning allegedly improper refusal of,and interference with the attainment of,benefits under the company enhanced severance plan esp because the esp mandates that such disputes be decided in an arbitral,not judicial,forum and because simon failed to exhaust internal administrative remedies.we reverse,in part,affirm,in part,and remand for the reasons set forth in this opinion.
background 
simon was employed by company from until may of.prior to the merger of and pfizer in may of,adopted the esp,which was designed to protect the job security of its employees in the event of a merger with another company.the esp provides for the payment of enhanced severance benefits to certain eligible employees under limited circumstances that result in an activation event within two years of a change in control.this period is sometimes referred to as the protected period.an activation event is either a constructive termination or an actual termination other than for just cause.a change of control within the meaning of the esp occurred when pfizer and merged in may of.under the esp,termination for just cause is defined as termination for the commission of a wrongful action such as theft of company property or alcohol or drug abuse.a constructive termination is defined,in relevant part,in the esp as a substantive change in job duties or change in reporting relationship occurring after a change in control.under the esp,the plan administrator has the authority to interpret the esp terms.
near the end of the protected period,in may of,simon was terminated for accessing information contained in his manager computer without authorization.simon claims that the information accessed consisted of an organizational chart that he reviewed in an attempt to determine whether he was eligible for constructive termination benefits based on a change in his reporting relationship under the esp.simon further asserts that he was granted access to the area of the corporate network where he viewed this information and that no pfizer policies or procedures prohibited his conduct.
on july,simon submitted a request for benefits under the esp,alleging constructive termination based on an alleged change in reporting relationship and actual termination other than for just cause.by letter dated july,simon attorney notified pfizer that simon demanded reinstatement to his position at pfizer because his termination was,allegedly,in retaliation for,and an interference with,simon exercise and attainment of his rights under the esp.
in order for a plan participant to seek severance benefits under the esp based on constructive termination or to contest a termination for just cause,he must submit his claim s to the esp plan administrator.the plan administrator reviews all claims and renders a determination through a review process.the review process takes place in this order the participant completes a constructive termination form and files it with the plan administrator,who,after an internal review,forwards the claim to the esp advisory group the participant may appeal to the esp administrative committee and the participant may appeal to the senior vice president of corporate human resources.if the participant is not satisfied with the outcome of this review process,the esp flow chart indicates that arbitration may be initiated.the chart clearly states that a participant can proceed to arbitration only if the participant ha s completed the above three steps of the internal esp process.pursuant to the esp,any unsuccessful participant must submit his or her claim s to arbitration before the american arbitration association aaa regardless of whether they are claims of actual termination for just cause or constructive termination the results of arbitration are binding on pfizer and and on the participant.
simon commenced this suit in the eastern district of michigan on september,prior to resolution of his claims in the administrative process.his complaint contains counts for retaliatory discharge and discrimination in violation of erisa,codified at count i improper denial of plan benefits count ii,breach of fiduciary duty in violation of a count iii,and failure to provide timely and proper notice of cobra benefits pursuant to,count iv thereafter,on november,pfizer filed a motion to dismiss all counts of the complaint based on the esp mandatory arbitration provisions and on simon failure to exhaust his administrative remedies.alternatively,pfizer requested that the district court stay litigation of simon claims until the resolution of his claims filed with pfizer for benefits under the esp.
at the time of oral argument on pfizer motion to dismiss,simon administrative claims filed with pfizer for benefits for constructive termination and actual termination under the esp were winding through the administrative process established by the esp.pfizer represented to the district court that the esp advisory group informed simon by letter dated january,of its decision to deny simon claim for benefits based on constructive termination,thus completing the first level of review.pfizer motion to supplement the record,exhibit.pfizer further represented that it was continuing to follow the internal review procedures with respect to simon claim for benefits based on actual termination.
the district court denied pfizer motion to dismiss with respect to all but count iii breach of fiduciary duty.the district court refused to require exhaustion of administrative remedies as to simon erisa section count i and cobra count iv claims on the basis that said claims are statutory and are thus separate and apart from simon claim under the esp.the court ruled that simon failure to exhaust his administrative remedies was excused on the basis of futility for simon claim for wrongful denial of esp benefits count ii and also held that arbitration was not required the court did,however,dismiss simon fiduciary duty claim count iii.pfizer timely appealed the district court ruling,arguing that simon should be required to both exhaust his administrative remedies and arbitrate his claims 
on february,simon filed an administrative appeal from the denial of constructive termination benefits.simon then received a march,letter regarding his actual termination claim,advising him of the determination of the esp advisory group the first level of review that he had been terminated for just cause and was therefore ineligible for benefits under the esp.thereafter,the administrative committee,at the second level of review,again denied simon constructive termination claim on june.simon appealed both his constructive termination and actual termination claims to the final level of norton,senior vice president of corporate human june,attempting to skip the administrative committee review the second level of review of his actual termination claim.see pfizer motion to supplement the record,exhibit.
discussion 
appellate jurisdiction 
as an initial matter,we note that this court has appellate jurisdiction over all final decisions of the district courts,however,the district court partial denial of pfizer motion to dismiss is not a final order that is appealable under.see gulfstream aerospace mayacamas,d in general,an order denying a motion to dismiss is not final because it ensures that litigation will continue in the district court.notwithstanding,an appeal of such an order may be taken if it falls within the small class of orders that are final for purposes of under the collateral order doctrine established in cohen beneficial industrial loan.noting that the collateral order doctrine embraces the small class of orders which finally determine claims of right separable from,and collateral to,rights asserted in the action,too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.
an order that does not finally resolve a case fits within the collateral order doctrine if the order conclusively determine s the disputed question,resolve s an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,and is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.gulfstream aerospace,at.citations omitted.if the order at issue fails to satisfy any one of those requirements,it is not appealable under the collateral order exception.id.see decker ihc hospitals,cir.
in this case,the district court based its partial denial of pfizer motion to dismiss on two grounds,ruling that simon was excused from exhausting his administrative remedies on the basis of futility and finding that simon claims were not subject to arbitration.pfizer appeals on both grounds.because the district court ruling on the exhaustion issue is not conclusive with respect to simon underlying claims and because it is effectively reviewable on appeal from a final judgment it does not fit within the collateral order doctrine and thus this court does not have appellate jurisdiction to review the district court ruling on that ground however,because pfizer appeals,in part on the district court refusal to enforce,through dismissal or stay,an agreement to arbitrate,this court has independent jurisdiction over that question under the federal arbitration act faa,and rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure.
arbitration 
district court decisions on motions to dismiss under federal rules of civil procedure b and b are generally subject to a de novo standard of review.see,tahfs proctor,cir ziegler ibp hog market,cir.the standard of review for a district court decision regarding whether a dispute is arbitrable is also de novo.haskins prudential ins.of,cir.
pfizer attacks the district court ruling regarding the arbitrability of simon claims,arguing that his claim for wrongful denial of benefits under the esp count ii is expressly covered by the arbitration provisions of the esp,and that his statutory claims count i,iii and iv,while not expressly covered,are sufficiently connected to the claim of wrongful denial of benefits that arbitration should be required simon responds that the arbitration agreement contained in the esp is limited,applying only to disputes concerning constructive termination.
in support of this contention,simon points to language contained in section of the esp,which provides a ll disputed sic regarding the application of this section shall be submitted to an arbitration panel whose findings shall be binding on the company and the participant.section deals exclusively with constructive termination and the meaning and application of that term with respect to benefits eligibility.simon ignores,however,similar language contained in section of the esp,which clearly mandates arbitration with respect to disputes concerning termination for just cause.section is titled termination for just cause,and,likewise,states in pertinent part t he determination of whether alleged grounds for termination qualify as termination for just cause shall be made by an arbitration panel.thus,contrary to simon argument,the esp expressly mandates arbitration for disputes concerning both constructive termination and termination for just cause.
the central inquiry,therefore,is whether simon claims sufficiently fit within the esp arbitration clauses such that arbitration should be required with respect to simon esp claims,this court finds that they do and,thus,the district court decision denying pfizer motion to dismiss with respect to simon esp claims must be compulsory arbitration provision divests the district court of jurisdiction over claims that seek benefits under an erisa plan,such as the esp.see united steelworkers mead,cir refusing to consider the merits of a claim after determining the claim was within the scope of the parties arbitration agreement 
wrongful denial of benefits count ii 
count ii of the complaint alleges that simon was constructively and involuntarily terminated and that pfizer wrongly failed to respond to his requests for involuntary and constructive termination benefits under the esp.to the contrary,simon claims filed internally with pfizer were being addressed and any disputes regarding the resolution of said claims are clearly governed by the arbitration provisions in the esp.as noted above,the esp contains mandatory arbitration provisions governing all claims for benefits for constructive termination or actual termination for just cause.it is undisputed that simon has refused to proceed to arbitration as required with regard to any of these claims.under a de novo standard of review,and based on policies favoring arbitration this court finds that the district court erred in denying pfizer motion to dismiss with respect to simon claim for benefits under the esp count ii the subject matter of this claim must be arbitrated pursuant to the esp under which simon claims an entitlement to benefits.
erisa section count i and cobra claims count iv 
next,an inquiry must be made with respect to simon erisa section and cobra claims.
simon claims that the information he accessed on his manager computer without authorization for which conduct he was terminated was information pertaining to his eligibility for benefits under the esp.simon thus argues that he was terminated for attempting to determine his rights and benefits under the esp in violation of erisa section,see,which prohibits employer conduct engaged in for the purpose of interfering with an employee attainment of benefits.simon also alleges a cobra notice violation under,in that pfizer was tardy in providing simon notice of his cobra rights,elections and benefits.simon contends that,because these claims arise under erisa,they are not within the scope of the esp arbitration mandate.thus,this court must tangentially consider the narrow issue of whether erisa preempts arbitration under the faa.
this narrow issue has not yet been addressed by the sixth circuit,see eckel equitable life assur.soc.of the,d,noting that the sixth circuit had not yet addressed the issue however,the majority of courts considering this issue have held that disputes arising under erisa,including cobra claims,are subject to arbitration under the faa.see kramer smith barney,cir pritzker merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir bird shearson express,cir,cert.denied,d arnulfo sulit,dean witter reynolds,cir peruvian connection,christian,fabian fin.serv.kurt volk.profit sharing plan,southside internists group pc money purchase pension plan janus capital,glover wolf,webb,burk campbell,notwithstanding the foregoing,the following discussion reveals why this issue need not be resolved herein.
a longstanding principle of this circuit is that no matter how strong the federal policy favors arbitration,arbitration is a matter of contract between the parties,and one can not be required to submit to arbitration a dispute which it has not agreed to submit to arbitration.united steelworkers,local fireproofing,cir.see also at t,communications workers of america,d a rbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.bratt,noble int l,cir roney kassab,cir.this court has drawn a clear line between the extensive applicability of general arbitration provisions and the more narrow applicability of arbitration clauses tied to specific disputes.when faced with a broad arbitration clause,such as one covering any dispute arising out of an agreement,a court should follow the presumption of arbitration and resolve doubts in favor of arbitration.see masco zurich am.ins,cir.indeed,in such a case,only an express provision excluding a specific dispute,or the most forceful evidence of a purpose to exclude the claim from arbitration,will remove the dispute from consideration by the arbitrators.id.at internal quotations and citation omitted.however,when an arbitration clause by its terms extends only to a specific type of dispute,then a court can not require arbitration on claims that are not included.see bratt,at.
passing to the central inquiry,this court must determine whether the arbitration provisions contained in the esp herein at issue are broad enough to encompass simon erisa section and cobra claims.the esp does not contain a general arbitration provision under which the parties agreed to arbitrate all disputes arising from the employment relationship.the arbitration provisions in the esp are admittedly narrower and are contained specifically in the sections of the document concerning constructive termination and actual termination.in other words,only two types of disputes are subject to arbitration under the regarding the application of section dealing with constructive termination and disputes concerning the application of section dealing with termination for just cause.neither of these esp sections anywhere refers to erisa or cobra,and therefore,as an initial matter,it is clear that simon erisa section and cobra claims are not within the scope of any general or specific arbitration provision.even assuming that simon statutory claims arise from the same factual underpinnings as his claim for wrongful denial of benefits under the esp,it does not necessarily follow that the erisa claims must also be arbitrated.the question of whether or not simon erisa claims share facts with the arbitrable claims is not necessarily determinative of arbitrability of the erisa claims.
where one claim is specifically covered by an arbitration agreement,and a second claim is not,the arbitrability of the second is governed by the extent to which the second claim is substantially identical to the first.on the one hand,a party can not avoid arbitration simply by renaming its claims so that they appear facially outside the scope of the arbitration agreement.see fazio lehman,cir.in order to determine whether such renaming has occurred,a court must examine the underlying an otherwise arbitrable claim has simply been renamed or recast it will share the same factual basis as the arbitrable claim.however,a claim that is truly outside of an arbitration agreement likewise can not be forced into arbitration,even though there may be factual allegations in common.in particular,the determination that a claim require s reference to an arbitrable issue or factual dispute is not determinative.bratt,at.
bratt enterprises is particularly instructive as to how much factual overlap there may be without requiring arbitration of disputes not expressly subject to arbitration.in bratt enterprises,the arbitration clause covered disagreements relating to any of the amounts included in the closing balance sheet of an asset purchase agreement transaction.id.at.the parties ultimately had numerous disputes,and in a lawsuit filed by bratt enterprises,the defendant noble international,counterclaimed for breach of contract.part of the breach of contract claim centered around a provision under which bratt enterprises retained accounts payable in excess of million.noble international closing balance sheet reflected accounts payable of over million,but despite the million limit,bratt enterprises disputed and sought to avoid payment of the million difference back to noble.because the breach of contract claim by noble was therefore related to a balance sheet dispute,the district court ordered arbitration on the breach of contract claim in addition to the dispute over the actual accounts payable balance.id.at.
this court reversed,holding that 
w hile noble claim would obviously require reference to the closing balance sheet to determine matters of valuation should noble prevail on this issue,the dispute regarding the validity of the million limitation provision does not itself involve a disagree ment with any of the amounts included in the closing balance sheet.thus,this aspect of noble breach of contract claim is not within the scope of the arbitration clause and is,therefore,not arbitrable.
id.at.nor was this result altered by the fact that ordering arbitration on the dispute over the proper amount of accounts payable and refusing to order arbitration on the breach of contract claim resulted in piecemeal litigation.id.at.
as noted above,although simon claims are intermingled,this does not support the conclusion that arbitration is necessarily required.even if simon were terminated for just cause,he would not necessarily be ineligible for cobra benefits.although it is true that cobra expressly excludes termination for gross misconduct from the list of qualifying events,it does not follow that a termination for just cause under the esp would necessarily be a termination for gross misconduct.section of the esp states that termination for just cause shall mean termination for the commission of a wrongful act such as theft of company property or alcohol or drug abuse.this is not synonymous with the definition of gross misconduct,and different courts apply different standards.see,chatterjee school dist.of philadelphia,d,recognizing that there is no definition of gross misconduct.therefore,it is possible that the arbitrator could decide that simon had been terminated for just cause,while,in litigation,a court could determine that simon had not been terminated for gross misconduct and was,therefore,eligible for cobra notification and benefits.
returning to the question of whether arbitration is required because of the remaining degree of factual overlap,this case is sufficiently analogous to bratt enterprises so that the same result should be reached.simon erisa section and cobra claims require consideration of some factual issues that are subject to arbitration,but the claims have independent legal bases.the section claim and cobra claim are not simply claims for violations of the esp that have been recharacterized in order to avoid arbitration rather,they are independent claims that are statutorily authorized and that depend upon different legal standards.as discussed above,simon cobra claim could be resolved in his favor even if he loses the arbitration regarding his esp claims.in other words,there is no greater degree of issue overlap than was the case in bratt.in bratt,the actual amount of the accounts payable could have controlled the entire breach of contract dispute had the arbitrator determined that the amount was equal to the million cap and not in excess of it.the amount of recovery that noble international would be entitled to if it prevailed depended upon the figure the arbitrator assigned to the accounts payable.in this case,as in bratt,it is appropriate to permit litigation of the independent claims even though they may require some reference to the decision reached by the arbitrator.only the desire to avoid piecemeal litigation counsels in favor of requiring arbitration,and that desire is legally insufficient under bratt.
therefore,because simon erisa section and cobra claims are not covered by the arbitration clauses at issue,it is not necessary to address the question of whether erisa would an arbitration clause that did cover those claims.thus,based on the de novo standard of review,this court finds that simon erisa and cobra claims counts i and iv are not subject to arbitration in this case and,therefore,the district court did not err in failing to require arbitration with respect to those claims.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,this court reverses the district court with respect to denying pfizer motion to dismiss simon claim for benefits under the esp,affirms the district court decision regarding the arbitrability of simon section and cobra claims,and remands for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
