this is an appeal from a district court decision enforcing an arbitration award.the airline pilots association,international the association or alpa petitioned the district court to enforce an award on behalf of shahir selim against pan american airways corporation pan am.the district court granted that petition in full.we now affirm in part and reverse in part,with directions that the district court remand to the original arbitration panel for clarification of the award.
background 
shahir selim is an airline pilot.he worked for pan am under a collective bargaining agreement the agreement or cba.the association is the collective bargaining representative for the pilots employed by pan am.
the agreement provides for unresolved grievances arising under it to be submitted to binding arbitration before the pan am airway pilots system board of adjustment the board.grievances are heard by panels comprised of representatives of pan am and the association,along with one neutral arbitrator.
between august and october,selim filed five grievances against pan am.only two are relevant here 
failure to promote.selim was a flight engineer when he began working for pan am in.he submitted a permanent bid to be upgraded to first officer or,preferably,captain.he became a first officer in january.in march,pan am promoted to captain a pilot with less seniority than selim without giving him a chance to train for and be upgraded to captain upon completion of the required training.on august,selim grieved the company failure to promote him.
improper discharge.on october,while selim was preparing to board a pan am flight as a passenger,he took issue with instructions from flight personnel that he check baggage that he thought he could carry on.pan am fired selim on october,based on that incident.selim filed a grievance challenging his termination.
when the parties could not resolve selim grievances,the association pursued arbitration before the board.a board panel held hearings on all five grievances in may and june.it issued its decision and award the arbitration decision and award on november.
meanwhile,according to pan am,economic difficulties forced it to institute a furlough of its pilots,beginning in september.pan am claims that a pilot with selim seniority would have been placed on unpaid furlough on september,
the association claims pan am never notified selim before or after the board decision that he was being furloughed,as required by the agreement.according to the association,this failure to notify selim prevented him from grieving the furlough if he had thought it improper.the association also claims that if selim had been furloughed,rather than discharged,he would have been entitled to benefits he did not receive.it notes that there may be other factual issues or problems with pan am claim that selim would have been furloughed on the specified dates.
on may,pan am sent selim a letter notifying him that he was hereby recalled from furlough status and directed to report for active employment,effective june.selim returned to work as directed.meanwhile,the association maintained,and it has continued to maintain,that he was never in fact furloughed.
a.the arbitration decision and award 
in the november arbitration decision,the board resolved four grievances in selim and one against him the award concluded with a note by the neutral arbitrator stating concerning all of the above awards,i shall retain jurisdiction to resolve any financial matters if the parties are unable to agree.
as to the grievances relevant on appeal 
failure to promote.the board found that pan am should have chosen selim for captain training in march.it held that pan am failure to give him the opportunity to complete this training represented a continuing violation of his seniority rights.because selim had not filed his grievance until august,the board was reluctant to grant back pay for one and years since no official complaint had been made.the award therefore provided 
the company shall retroactively recompute the grievant wage scale to that of captain effective august,and he shall be selected for captain training for the next upgrade to captain 
improper discharge.the board found that,in the incident for which he was fired,selim had resisted a reasonable instruction to check his flight bag.the board determined that this conduct,while serious,was not as egregious as pan am alleged.it noted that grievant had never been warned,disciplined,or even counseled about his conduct previously.the board held that his conduct did not justify discharge for a first offense.it reduced the discharge to a day suspension.the award provided 
the termination of the grievant is set aside.he shall be reimbursed to service with retention of seniority and other benefits,but he shall receive a day suspension.
proceedings in the district court 
in april,the association filed this lawsuit to enforce the award.pan am had not then complied with any of the award requirements,despite several demand letters from the association.
on march,the association filed a motion for summary judgment supported by a statement of material facts not in dispute.pan am responded with an objection to the motion.in both its objection and its supporting memorandum of law,pan am maintained that there are genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment.pan am bolstered this claim with specific citations to supporting affidavits.it did not,however,support its legal memorandum with a separate statement of the material facts that it claimed were in dispute.
pan am argued,inter alia,that the award of captain pay to selim was improper because the agreement allowed only those who had completed captain training to be paid at that rate,and selim had not done so and any back pay award should not include pay for the time selim would have been on furlough if he had not been discharged.
on june,the district court granted the summary judgment motion in full.the district court adopted the association statement of facts.it deemed those facts admitted pursuant to rule of the local rules of the district of new hampshire because pan am did not include a statement of material facts as to which it contends a genuine dispute exists.
the district court rejected pan am argument that the retroactive award of captain pay to selim,prior to his completion of training,was inconsistent with the agreement and therefore exceeded the board authority.the court focused on arbitrators broad discretion in shaping remedies 
when an arbitrator is commissioned to interpret and apply the collective bargaining agreement,he is to bring his informed judgment to bear in order to reach a fair solution of a problem.this is especially true when it comes to formulating remedies.there the need is for flexibility in meeting a wide variety of situations.
citing united steelworkers of am.enter.wheel car,d.recognizing that the agreement did not provide specific remedies for breach of contract,the court held that the arbitrators had discretion to formulate an award to effectuate the purposes of the agreement.
the district court also rejected pan am argument that selim should not receive back pay for the period from september,through june,when he allegedly would have been on unpaid furlough if he had been reinstated on january,when the suspension authorized by the award expired.the district court refused to consider pan am claim that the back pay award should be understood not to include pay for that furlough period.the court explained that this partial defense to payment was not raised before the arbitrators nor in pan am answer or discovery plan.it held that 
defendant could have,and should have,raised this matter before the board either before the award or shortly thereafter.it is beyond the jurisdiction of this court to change the award,that is,to address the merits.the award is enforced as issued and plaintiff is to be paid effective as of january.

ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.boston maine of maint.of way employees,cir.
in reviewing a decision enforcing an arbitration award,we give great deference to the arbitration process,as we expect the district court to do.id.at.indeed,court review of arbitral decisions is extremely narrow and exceedingly deferential.bull hn info,hutson,cir internal quotation omitted.courts should vacate an arbitral award only in rare circumstances,such as when there was misconduct by the arbitrator,when the arbitrator exceeded the scope of her authority,or when the award was made in manifest disregard of the law.jci communications int l of workers,cir.
failure to promote 
pan am argues that the board can not have intended to award selim captain pay prior to his completion of captain training because that would be contrary to several cba provisions.therefore,pan am claims,the award is ambiguous and this issue should be remanded to the board for reconsideration.
the award provides that the company shall retroactively recompute the grievant wage scale to that of captain effective august.emphasis added.there is nothing ambiguous about this directive.
the award further provides that selim shall be selected for captain training for the next upgrade to captain.the simultaneous award of a retroactive raise and provision for future training confirms the board awareness that selim would receive captain pay before completing that training.moreover,the board acknowledged that grievant would have to successfully complete that training before he could actually serve as a captain there is no reason to believe the board did not mean what it said,and so no reason to send the promotion issue back to the board.
pan am argument therefore reduces to the claim that the board exceeded its authority by crafting a remedy that is inconsistent with the agreement.pan am points to the provision in the agreement that a pilot may not be promoted based on seniority unless he h as met the basic company qualifications cba section d.it also cites to the provision that a pilot pay is to be based on his status and longevity with the company.cba section emphasis added.pan am further notes that a pilot promoted to captain receives a raise only after successful completion of training,and the raise is retroactive only to the date training began.cba section f.
according to pan am,these provisions preclude paying anyone who has not qualified to serve as a captain at the captain rate.pan am points out that the board jurisdiction shall not extend to changes in rates of compensation covered by the agreement.cba c.therefore,pan am argues,the board exceeded its jurisdiction by requiring payment to selim at a rate to which he was not entitled under the agreement.
the district court was right to reject this argument.w here it is contemplated that the arbitrator will determine remedies for contract violations that he finds,courts have no authority to disagree with his honest judgment in that respect.united paperworkers int l union misco,d.the supreme court has recognized that in formulating remedies,arbitrators must have flexibility in meeting a wide variety of situations.enter.wheel,at.courts must not review the merits of an arbitration award.id.at.
nothing in the agreement establishes the appropriate remedy for a violation such as the one found here.it is unquestionably within the board jurisdiction to interpret the agreement as needed to resolve grievances and to determine appropriate remedies for any violation of it.where,as here,the agreement neither requires nor bars particular remedies,the arbitrator discretion is at its zenith.kraft foods,office prof l employees int l union,cir internal quotation omitted.the board had discretion to determine that selim ought not be penalized for pan am failure to provide him the opportunity to train for and become a captain.
pan am also argues that the board exceeded its jurisdiction by chang ing rates of compensation under the collective bargaining agreement.see cba c.on the contrary,however,the board did not change the rates of pay provided for under the agreement.instead,it determined what damages selim had suffered as a result of pan am breach of contract and crafted a remedy to compensate him for those damages.there is nothing extraordinary or problematic about such a remedy.kraft foods,at clause barring arbitrator from modifying collective bargaining agreement does not prevent arbitrator from crafting appropriate remedy to cure breach.
pan am argues that the award improperly placed selim in a position that he had no right to be in without having successfully qualified for it.the lone case it cites for this merely affirms a decision by a district court as distinguished from an arbitrator denying back pay in a particular case.cabarga cruz fundacion educativa ana mendez,cir approving denial of back pay where plaintiff neither asked for a chance to pass the test the employer denied him nor provided any evidence he would have passed it.cabarga does not hold,or even suggest,that back pay is never an acceptable remedy when an employer actions prevented an employee from satisfying some prerequisite to the position in question,much less that it is an unacceptable remedy in an arbitration.the case is simply inapplicable here,as we do not review the merits of an arbitrator decision.the question of whether this is an appropriate or fair remedy goes directly to the is thus well within the board discretion.
improper discharge 
the board reduced selim discharge to a suspension.the award provided that selim shall be reimbursed to service with retention of seniority and other benefits following his suspension.the suspension period expired january.
the parties agree that this means selim was to be reinstated with back pay as of january.they disagree as to what that means with respect to the period from september,through june,during which pan am claims selim would have been on furlough along with all other pilots of his seniority.
the district court refused to consider this argument.it held that defendant could have,and should have,raised this matter before the board either before the award or shortly thereafter.emphasis added.the court stated that it was beyond its jurisdiction to change the award,that is,to address the merits.the award is enforced as issued emphasis added.
in reviewing this holding,we distinguish between two substantive,one the district court did not address separately.first,what does the award mean does it require payment for the hypothetical furlough period,or is it ambiguous second,it is a separate question whether,if the award is ambiguous,pan am has forfeited its right to pursue its interpretation of the award.
we must determine whether each of these questions is for the arbitrator or the court in the first instance.
what the award means 
implicit in the district court holding that it could not change the award is the assumption that the award as issued meant what the association said the award meant.though claiming to avoid the issue of what the award required,the court simply adopted,without analysis or justification,the association reading of it.that is,the holding assumes that the award in fact requires back pay for all days after january,and not just those days that selim would have been paid absent his wrongful termination.
we find that pan am has raised a legitimate question as to how the award should be interpreted.the award is naturally silent as to how a furlough period should be treated,since that issue was never raised before the board.the board only selim should be reimbursed to service with retention of seniority does not directly mention back pay,much less address how it is to be calculated,in light of the hypothetical furlough period or otherwise.
while the board opinion establishes that the award for back pay is to begin days after selim wrongful termination,january,this need not mean that he is entitled to be paid from that day forward,without regard to any changes in circumstance or relevant external factors.pan am points out that the board approved disciplining selim for his conduct albeit less harshly than it had originally done.pan am thus argues that it is unreasonable to think the board intended selim to receive more than he would have received had he never been fired,a
