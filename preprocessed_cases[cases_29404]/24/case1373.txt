western pizza enterprises,western pizza,appeals the denial of its motion to compel arbitration of a complaint filed by octavio sanchez.the trial court determined that a provision in the arbitration agreement prohibiting class arbitration was unenforceable,that other terms of the agreement were unconscionable,and that the agreement could not be enforced.western pizza contends the enforceability of the arbitration agreement is a question for the arbitrator to decide the federal arbitration act faa et preempts california law to the extent that california law would prevent the enforcement of the agreement the class arbitration waiver does not impermissibly interfere with the employees ability to vindicate their statutory rights,and therefore is enforceable and the terms of the arbitration agreement are neither procedurally nor substantively unconscionable.we reject these contentions,conclude that the denial of the motion to compel arbitration was proper,and affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
factual background 
sanchez works as a delivery driver at a domino pizza restaurant owned by western pizza he drives his own car in making deliveries.his hourly wage has ranged from the legal minimum wage to approximately cents above minimum wage.western pizza reimburses him at a fixed rate of cents per delivery regardless of the number of miles driven or actual expenses incurred.
sanchez and western pizza are parties to an undated arbitration agreement.the record does not indicate when the parties signed the agreement.the agreement states that the execution of the agreement is not a mandatory condition of employment.it states that any dispute that the parties are unable to resolve informally will be submitted to binding arbitration before an arbitrator selected from the employment arbitration panel of the dispute eradication services,and that the arbitrator must be approved by both parties.it states that the parties waive the right to a jury trial.it also states that the arbitration fees will be borne by western pizza and,except as otherwise required by law,each party shall bear its own attorney fees and costs.
the arbitration agreement states that the arbitrator shall be responsible for resolving any disputes over the interpretation or application of this arbitration agreement.it also states,e xcept as expressly provided,the interpretation,scope and enforcement of this adr agreement and all procedural issues shall be governed by the procedural and substantive provisions of the federal arbitration act,et the faa,the federal decisional law construing the faa,and the rules of the arbitrator,provided the arbitrator rules do not conflict with the faa.
the arbitration agreement also provides a procedure for small claims if either party asserts that a dispute involves an amount in controversy that is too small to warrant resolution by standard arbitration procedures,the claim may be resolved by a summary small claims procedure the small claims procedure.the parties shall meet and confer to agree on whether the use of a small claims procedure is appropriate in light of the nature and amount of the claim and,if so,what dispute resolution procedures are most appropriate.to the extent the parties are unable to agree,the arbitrator shall decide whether and to what extent a small claims procedure shall apply.the small claims procedure may involve relaxed rules of evidence,the use of broad principles of equity in place of strict application of law,telephonic hearings,and such other economic procedures as the arbitrator deems appropriate under the circumstances of the dispute and consistent with due process.in no event,however,shall the arbitrator utilize a small claims procedure for a dispute involving a claim in excess of.
the arbitration agreement includes a waiver of class arbitration,stating the arbitrator shall not consolidate or combine the resolution of any claim or dispute between the two parties to this adr agreement with the resolution of any claim by any other party or parties,including but not limited to any employee of the company.nor shall the arbitrator have the authority to certify a class under federal rule of civil procedure rule,analogous state rules,or arbitrator rules pertaining to class arbitration,and the arbitrator shall not decide claims on behalf of any other party or parties.
the arbitration agreement also provides for the appointment of a referee code civ,subd.a to decide any issue in the event that any part of the agreement is determined to be unenforceable or any issue is determined to be nonarbitrable.it states that the referee fees will be paid by western mutual and that the referee will have no authority to certify a class or decide the merits of any third party claim.
trial court proceedings 
sanchez filed a putative class action complaint against western pizza in august.he alleges that western pizza does not record the number of miles driven by its delivery drivers but instead reimburses them at the rate of cents per delivery.he alleges that the drivers not only are not adequately reimbursed for their expenses incurred in the performance of their job duties,but also as a result are paid less than the legal minimum wage.he alleges counts for failure to reimburse job expenses,failure to pay minimum wage,failure to itemize wage statements,unfair business practices bus,et and conversion.
western pizza asked sanchez,through their respective counsel,if he would submit the dispute to binding arbitration and provided a copy of the arbitration agreement.sanchez counsel responded that the class arbitration waiver was unenforceable,that the agreement impermissibly restricted the right to discovery,and that the agreement purported to require the use of an arbitrator whose website included a testimonial by a former colleague of the defendant counsel who stated that the arbitrator had persuaded the plaintiff to settle for a very small sum.sanchez counsel stated that sanchez would submit to arbitration only if the class arbitration waiver and the provisions for small claims and a referee were stricken from the agreement and the arbitration proceeded as a class arbitration before jams or aaa.
western pizza moved to compel arbitration and stay the action code civ.it argued that both the faa and the california arbitration act,et required the enforcement of the arbitration agreement.sanchez argued in opposition that the class arbitration waiver was unenforceable under gentry superior court cal th,d,gentry and that the arbitration agreement as a whole was unconscionable because the small claims procedure allows disputes to be decided without strict application of law and using relaxed rules of evidence the arbitration agreement does not require a written arbitration award the arbitration panel designated in the arbitration agreement has only one arbitrator,alan saler,whose website includes a testimonial from an attorney at the former firm of western pizza counsel and the arbitration agreement includes no provision for discovery.
western pizza argued in reply that only an arbitrator could determine the enforceability of the class arbitration waiver or the unconscionability of the arbitration agreement as a whole,that the class arbitration waiver was not unenforceable under gentry,supra,cal th,d,and that the arbitration agreement was not unconscionable.
the trial court at the hearing on the motion cited gentry,supra,cal th,d,and murphy check n go of california,th,d murphy,and stated,we have an individual plaintiff with a small claim who would otherwise be unable to afford legal services,and the class action would be an appropriate mechanism by which he could,in effect,bundle his claim with other claims and make it more efficient and expedient.the court also stated that the small claims procedure did not allow discovery in cases where the amount in dispute was up to,and that the agreement waived other rights and was procedurally and substantively unconscionable.the court entered a minute order denying the motion.western pizza timely appealed the order 
contentions 
western pizza contends the enforceability of the arbitration agreement is a question for the arbitrator to decide the faa preempts california law to the extent that california law would prevent the enforcement of the agreement the class arbitration waiver does not impermissibly interfere with the employees ability to vindicate their statutory rights,and therefore is enforceable and the arbitration agreement is neither procedurally nor substantively unconscionable.
discussion 
applicability of the faa 
the faa compels judicial enforcement of a wide range of arbitration agreements in transactions affecting interstate commerce.terminix dobson,d.congress in enacting the faa intended to exercise the full extent of its authority to regulate interstate commerce,supra,at.the parties do not discuss whether sanchez employment involves interstate commerce and do not meaningfully discuss whether the faa applies to the arbitration agreement.both parties appear to assume that the faa applies.the arbitration agreement states that the faa governs the interpretation,scope and enforcement of this adr agreement and all procedural issues.we need not decide whether the faa applies by its own terms or the effect of the provision just quoted because our conclusions stated in this opinion are the same regardless of whether the faa applies,as we will explain.because the faa does not conflict with california law as applied in this case,there is no preemption.volt info.sciences leland stanford,d.
the enforceability of the arbitration agreement is a question for the court to decide 
section of the faa provides that a written arbitration agreement shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.thus,under the faa,the validity and enforceability of an arbitration agreement is governed by state law applicable to contracts generally.doctor associates,casarotto,d.
the faa was intended to overcome a historical judicial hostility to arbitration agreements.mitsubishi motors soler,fn,d.the faa preempts state laws,whether legislative or judicial,that are directed at and disfavor arbitration agreements in particular,but does not preempt state laws applicable to contracts generally.perry thomas,fn,d.rather,a state court may refuse to enforce an arbitration agreement,in whole or in part,to which the faa applies,based on generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability.doctor associates,casarotto,supra,at.discover bank superior court cal th,d,discover bank.
the california arbitration act code civ,et also compels the enforcement of valid arbitration agreements.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,armendariz.code of civil procedure section states a written agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy thereafter arising is valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.under california law,as under the faa,an arbitration agreement may be invalidated upon the same grounds as any other contract.armendariz,supra,at,d.in other words,although arbitration agreements ordinarily are enforced according to their terms,their enforceability is limited by the same general contract law principles governing the enforceability of any contract.discover bank,supra,cal th at,d.
under california law,the question whether an arbitration agreement is unenforceable,in whole or in part,based on general contract law principles is a question for the court to decide,rather than an arbitrator.discover bank,supra,cal th at,d,balandran labor ready,th,d see cable connection,directv,cal th,d.this includes the determination whether an arbitration agreement is unconscionable or contrary to public policy.discover bank,supra,at,d.discover bank concluded that the faa,and particularly the opinion by the united states supreme court in green tree financial bazzle,did not conflict with california law on this point and that the california rule therefore governs.
some opinions by the courts of appeal have suggested,without holding,that the enforceability of an arbitration agreement is a question for the arbitrator to decide if the arbitration agreement clearly and unmistakably so provides bruni didion th,d baker osborne development th,d baker murphy,supra,th at,d see also ontiveros dhl express usa,th,fn,d ontiveros.we need not decide whether such a clear and unmistakable provision would be enforceable because the arbitration agreement here does not clearly state that the arbitrator will decide whether the arbitration agreement is enforceable.rather,the provision that the arbitrator will resolve any disputes over the interpretation or application of this arbitration agreement does not appear to encompass disputes concerning the enforceability of the arbitration agreement based on unconscionability,public policy,or other grounds.
accordingly,we conclude,consistent with the rule stated in discover bank,supra,cal th at page,d,that the question whether the arbitration agreement is enforceable based on general contract law principles,including the question whether it is unconscionable or contrary to public policy,is a question for the court to decide rather than an arbitrator,regardless of whether the faa applies.
the class arbitration waiver is contrary to public policy and unenforceable 
gentry superior court 
the california supreme court in gentry,supra,cal th,d,decided two principal issues.first,gentry held that a class arbitration waiver in an employment arbitration agreement was contrary to public policy and therefore unenforceable if the waiver impermissibly interfered with the employees ability to vindicate unwaivable statutory rights.id.at,d.this holding was based on the general principle that courts will not enforce a contract that is contrary to public policy,rather than the principle of unconscionability.see id.at,d.second,gentry held that the arbitration agreement as a whole was procedurally unconscionable despite a provision allowing employees to opt out of the arbitration agreement within days.id.at,d.
gentry framed the first issue as,whether a class arbitration waiver would lead to a de facto waiver of statutory rights,or whether the ability to maintain a class action or arbitration is necessary to enable an employee to vindicate unwaivable rights in an arbitration forum.citation.gentry,supra,cal th at,d.gentry concluded that a class arbitration waiver is contrary to public policy and therefore unenforceable if the waiver would impermissibly interfere with the employees ability to vindicate unwaivable statutory rights.ibid.
gentry stated that the rights to minimum wage and overtime compensation under labor code section are unwaivable.gentry,supra,at,d.gentry stated class actions play an important function in enforcing overtime laws by permitting employees who are subject to the same unlawful payment practices a relatively inexpensive way to resolve their disputes t he requirement that numerous employees suffering from the same illegal practice each separately prove the employer wrongdoing is an inefficiency that may substantially drive up the costs of arbitration and diminish the prospect that the overtime laws will be enforced.id.at,d.gentry also stated that an employee who sues his or her employer individually is at greater risk of retaliation,that the risk of retaliation is likely greater for employees further down on the corporate hierarchy,and that statistics showed that retaliation against employees for asserting statutory rights under the labor code is widespread.id.at,d.gentry stated further that some workers may be unaware of their legal rights,particularly immigrants with limited english language skills,and that class actions may be necessary to ensure the effective enforcement of labor laws despite the fact that some claims may be large enough to provide an incentive for individual action.id.at,d.
gentry stated that a trial court determining whether a class arbitration waiver impermissibly interferes with unwaivable statutory rights must consider the modest size of the potential individual recovery,the potential for retaliation against members of the class,the fact that absent members of the class may be ill informed about their rights,and other real world obstacles to the vindication of class members right to overtime pay through individual arbitration.gentry,supra,cal th at,d.gentry continued if it concludes,based on these factors,that a class arbitration is likely to be a significantly more effective practical means of vindicating the rights of the affected employees than individual litigation or arbitration,and finds that the disallowance of the class action will likely lead to a less comprehensive enforcement of overtime laws for the employees alleged to be affected by the employer violations,it must invalidate the class arbitration waiver to ensure that these employees can vindicate their unwaivable rights in an arbitration forum.citation.ibid.
gentry stated further the kind of inquiry a trial court must make is similar to the one it already makes to determine whether class actions are appropriate.t rial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action linder thrifty oil cal th,d.class arbitration must still also meet the community of interest requirement for all class actions,consisting of three factors predominant common questions of law or fact class representatives with claims or defenses typical of the class and class representatives who can adequately represent the class.drug stores,superior court cal th,d.gentry,supra,cal th at,d.
gentry expressly declined to hold that all class arbitration waivers in cases involving overtime laws are unenforceable.gentry,supra,cal th at,d.instead,gentry emphasized the particularized inquiry that trial courts must undertake based on the facts in each case.id.at,d.gentry reversed the judgment by the court of appeal upholding the class arbitration waiver and remanded the case with directions to remand the case to the trial court to determine whether,in this particular case,class arbitration would be a significantly more effective means than individual arbitration actions of vindicating the right to overtime pay id.at,d.
gentry stated that like the generally applicable contract defense of unconscionability,the rule invalidating class arbitration waivers that impermissibly interfere with unwaivable statutory rights is an rule because it applies to class waivers in arbitration and nonarbitration provisions alike.citations.gentry,supra,cal th at,d.the rule therefore is not preempted by the faa.ibid.
standard of review 
a trial court determination whether a class arbitration waiver is enforceable based on whether class arbitration would be significantly more effective than individual arbitrations as a means to vindicate unwaivable rights,under the rule established in gentry,supra,cal th,d,depends largely on consideration of the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action id.at,d,in the particular case.in light of the similarity of this inquiry to the inquiry a trial court makes in determining whether a class action is appropriate ibid,we conclude that the standard of review of the court ruling is the same.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,any determination underlying any order is scrutinized under the test appropriate to such determination.
a ruling on class certification is reviewed for abuse of discretion.drug stores,superior court,supra,cal th at,d.because trial courts are ideally situated to evaluate the efficiencies and practicalities of permitting group action,they are afforded great discretion in granting or denying certification i n the absence of other error,a trial court ruling supported by substantial evidence generally will not be disturbed unless improper criteria were used citation or erroneous legal assumptions were made citation.citation.under this standard,an order based upon improper criteria or incorrect assumptions calls for reversal even though there may be substantial evidence to support the court order.citations.accordingly,we must examine the trial court reasons for denying class certification.any valid pertinent reason stated will be sufficient to uphold the order.citation.linder thrifty oil,supra,cal th at,d.similarly here,we will examine the trial court reasons for determining that the class arbitration waiver is unenforceable under the rule from gentry,supra,cal th,d,and review that determination for abuse of discretion.
c.the class arbitration waiver is unenforceable under the rule from gentry 
sanchez argued in opposition to the motion to compel arbitration that the class arbitration waiver was unenforceable under the test in gentry,supra,cal th,d,and that the arbitration agreement as a whole was unconscionable.the trial court stated at the beginning of the hearing,i note that plaintiff is on the same page as the court,and cited gentry and murphy,supra,th,d the court stated with respect to the analysis under gentry,we have an individual plaintiff with a small claim who would otherwise be unable to afford legal services,and the class action would be an appropriate mechanism by which he could,in effect,bundle his claim with other claims and make it more efficient and expedient.thus,the court determined that group action was likely to be significantly more effective than individual arbitrations as a means to vindicate the employees statutory rights.
an employee statutory right to reimbursement of job expenses is unwaivable,edwards arthur andersen llp cal th,d,as is the statutory right to receive minimum wage,gentry,supra,cal th at,d.because this action involves the enforcement of unwaivable statutory rights,the rule from gentry applies.gentry,supra,at,d.
our consideration of the factors from gentry,supra,cal th,d,supports the trial court decision.first,any individual recovery of the difference between the amounts paid for reimbursement of delivery expenses and the amounts actually incurred is likely to be modest.the same is true of any individual recovery for the alleged failure to pay minimum wage as a result.see id.at,d.second,the delivery drivers are low wage earners,and the potential for retaliation against members of the class who litigate or arbitrate individually is significant.see id.at,d.third,sanchez presented evidence that most of the drivers are immigrants with limited english language skills who are likely to be unaware of their legal rights see id.at,d.
we conclude that the evidence supports the reason stated for the trial court decision that the class arbitration waiver is unenforceable under the rule from gentry,supra,cal th,d.western pizza has not shown that the court applied improper legal criteria or made an erroneous legal assumption,and therefore has failed to show an abuse of discretion.
the arbitration agreement is unconscionable 
procedural and substantive unconscionability 
procedural and substantive unconscionability must both be present to justify the refusal to enforce a contract or clause based on unconscionability.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.procedural unconscionability focuses on oppression or unfair surprise,while substantive unconscionability focuses on overly harsh or terms.a m produce fmc d,com,west ann.ed.foll,the more procedural unconscionability is present,the less substantive unconscionability is required to justify a determination that a contract or clause is unenforceable.conversely,the less procedural unconscionability is present,the more substantive unconscionability is required to justify such a determination.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.
a finding of procedural unconscionability does not mean that a contract will not be enforced,but rather that courts will scrutinize the substantive terms of the contract to ensure they are not manifestly unfair or.citation.there are degrees of procedural unconscionability.at one end of the spectrum are contracts that have been freely negotiated by roughly equal parties,in which there is no procedural unconscionability.although certain terms in these contracts may be construed strictly,courts will not find these contracts substantively unconscionable,no matter how the terms appear to be.citation.contracts of adhesion that involve surprise or other sharp practices lie on the other end of the spectrum.citation.ordinary contracts of adhesion,although they are indispensable facts of modern life that are generally enforced citation,contain a degree of procedural unconscionability even without any notable surprises,and bear within them the clear danger of oppression and overreaching.citation.
thus,a conclusion that a contract contains no element of procedural unconscionability is tantamount to saying that,no matter how the contract terms,a court will not disturb the contract because of its confidence that the contract was negotiated or chosen freely,that the party subject to a seemingly term is presumed to have obtained some advantage from conceding the term or that,if one party negotiated poorly,it is not the court place to rectify these kinds of errors or asymmetries.gentry,supra,cal th at,d.
unconscionability under california law is a generally applicable contract defense and therefore applies to arbitration agreements regardless of whether the faa applies.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.discover bank,supra,cal th,d,held that a class arbitration waiver in a consumer credit cardholder agreement was unconscionable under california law id.at,d.discover bank held further that the faa did not preempt california law on this point,and stated that state courts are not obliged to enforce contractual terms that are found to be unconscionable or contrary to public policy under general contract law principles.id.at,d.
we independently review the trial court determination that a contractual provision is unconscionable if the material facts are undisputed,as here.gatton usa,th,d.
b.the arbitration agreement is procedurally unconscionable 
procedural unconscionability focuses on oppression or unfair surprise,as we have stated.oppression results from unequal bargaining power when a contracting party has no meaningful choice but to accept the contract terms.a m produce fmc,supra,d at.see spanogle,analyzing unconscionability problems.unfair surprise results from misleading bargaining conduct or other circumstances indicating that a party consent was not an informed choice.a m produce,supra,at.see spanogle,supra,at 
gentry held that an employment arbitration agreement was procedurally unconscionable despite the presence of a provision because there were indications that the plaintiff failure to exercise that option was not a free and informed decision.gentry,supra,cal th at,d.gentry stated that the plaintiff decision was not an informed decision because an explanation of the benefits of arbitration in an employee handbook failed to mention significant disadvantages of the particular arbitration agreement compared with litigation,and therefore was markedly and presented a highly distorted picture.gentry,supra,cal th at,d.the handbook stated that arbitration was much less expensive than litigation and that the arbitrator can award monetary damages to compensate you for the harm you may have suffered.id.at,d.it failed to disclose,however,that the arbitration agreement imposed shorter limitations periods a limitation on the duration of backpay awardable as damages a limitation on the amount of punitive damages and a provision stating that attorney fees generally would be borne by each party unless the arbitrator exercised his or her discretion to award fees to the employee,compared with a prevailing plaintiff entitlement to a fee award under labor section,subdivision a.gentry,supra,at,d.although the lengthy arbitration agreement disclosed all of those terms,gentry concluded that only a legally sophisticated party would have understood that these rules and procedures are considerably less favorable to an employee than those operating in a judicial forum.id.at,d.
gentry stated that the plaintiff decision likely was not made freely because the materials provided to the plaintiff clearly expressed the employer preference for arbitration.gentry,supra,cal th at,d.gentry stated given the inequality between employer and employee and the economic power that the former wields over the latter see armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,it is likely that circuit city employees felt at least some pressure not to opt out of the arbitration agreement.the lack of material information about the disadvantageous terms of the arbitration agreement,combined with the likelihood that employees felt at least some pressure not to opt out of the arbitration agreement,leads to the conclusion that the present agreement was,at the very least,not entirely free from procedural unconscionability.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
the record here does not indicate a distorted presentation of the benefits of arbitration to the degree that was present in gentry,supra,cal th,d.the arbitration agreement states that the purpose of the agreement is to resolve any disputes that may arise between the parties in a timely,fair and individualized manner,but otherwise does not extol the benefits of arbitration.the arbitration agreement does not limit the limitations periods,the remedies available,or the amount of punitive damages.it states,except as otherwise required by law,each party shall bear its own attorney fees and costs,and therefore incorporates any statutory right to recover fees rather than creating a presumption against a fee recovery.thus,the arbitration agreement neither contains the same types of disadvantages for employees as were present in gentry nor fails to mention such disadvantageous terms.moreover,the arbitration agreement expressly states that the agreement is not a mandatory condition of employment.
we conclude,however,that the record indicates a degree of procedural unconscionability in two respects.first,as in gentry,supra,cal th at page,d,the inequality in bargaining power between the employees and their employer makes it likely that the employees felt at least some pressure to sign the arbitration agreement.second,the arbitration agreement suggests that there are multiple arbitrators to chose from the employment arbitration panel of the dispute eradication services and fails to mention that the designated arbitration provider includes only one arbitrator.this renders the arbitrator selection process illusory and creates a significant risk that western pizza as a repeat player before the same arbitrator will reap a significant advantage see armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,mercuro superior court th,d.these circumstances indicate that the employees decision to enter into the arbitration agreement likely was not a free and informed decision but was marked by some degree of oppression and unfair surprise,procedural unconscionability.we therefore must scrutinize the terms of the arbitration agreement to determine whether it is so unfairly as to be substantively unconscionable.
c.the arbitrator selection provision is substantively unconscionable 
substantively unconscionable terms may take various forms,but may generally be described as unfairly.little auto stiegler,cal th,d,little.given the lack of choice and the potential disadvantages that even a fair arbitration system can harbor for employees,we must be particularly attuned to claims that employers with superior bargaining power have imposed,substantively unconscionable terms as part of an arbitration agreement.private arbitration may resolve disputes faster and cheaper than judicial proceedings.private arbitration,however,may also become an instrument of injustice imposed on a take it or leave it basis.the courts must distinguish the former from the latter,to ensure that private arbitration systems resolve disputes not only with speed and economy but also with fairness.citation.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.
sanchez contends the arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable in several respects.he cites the class arbitration waiver,the small claims provision,the absence of any provision requiring a written arbitration award,the designation of an arbitration provider consisting of a single arbitrator,and the absence of any express provision for discovery.in light of our conclusion that the trial court properly decided that the class arbitration waiver is contrary to public policy and therefore unenforceable,we need not decide whether that provision is unconscionable.see gentry,supra,cal th at,d,the validity of a class arbitration waiver was analyzed in the previous part of this opinion in terms of unwaivable statutory rights rather than unconscionability.
armendariz,supra,cal th,d,addressed some of the other bases for unconscionability asserted here.armendariz held that an employee can be compelled to arbitrate unwaivable statutory claims only if certain minimum requirements are satisfied the arbitration agreement may not limit the statutory remedies available id.at,d,the parties are entitled to discovery sufficient to vindicate the unwaivable statutory rights id.at,d,the arbitrator must provide a written decision revealing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based id.at,d,and the employer must bear all costs that are unique to arbitration id.at,d,see little,supra,cal th at,d.armendariz held that to the extent that the arbitration agreement was silent on these issues,these requirements must be implied as a matter of law.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,interpreted the agreement to provide for adequate discovery,a written arbitration award,and the employer payment of arbitration costs.to the extent that the agreement expressly limited these rights,armendariz held that the agreement was contrary to public policy and unenforceable.id.at,d,stated that a provision limiting damages was unlawful.
armendariz also held that the arbitration agreement was procedurally and substantively unconscionable.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.with respect to substantive unconscionability,armendariz considered the lack of mutuality of the agreement to arbitrate and a limitation on recoverable damages.the arbitration agreement lacked mutuality because it required employees to arbitrate their wrongful termination claims against the employer but did not require the employer to arbitrate any of its claims against employees.id.at,d.armendariz concluded that this provision was unfairly id.at,d,and concluded that the limitation on damages compounded the unconscionability of the arbitration agreement id.at,d.in its discussion of substantive unconscionability,armendariz did not consider those issues on which the arbitration agreement was silent where terms were implied as a matter of law.id.at,d,see also id.at,d,described the unlawful provisions as only an unlawful damages provision and an unconscionably unilateral arbitration clause.because those terms were implied as a matter of law,the absence of those express provisions was not unconscionable and provided no basis to deny the enforcement of the arbitration agreement.id.at,d,see little,supra,cal th at fn,d,stated that the absence of an express provision requiring judicial review was not unconscionable for this reason.
similarly here,we conclude that the absence of express provisions requiring a written arbitration award and allowing discovery does not render the arbitration agreement unconscionable.rather,those terms are implied as a matter of law as part of the agreement.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.
the small claims provision states that for claims that do not exceed,the arbitrator may apply relaxed rules of evidence,the use of broad principles of equity in place of strict application of law,telephonic hearings,and such other economic procedures as the arbitrator deems appropriate under the circumstances of the dispute and consistent with due process.an arbitrator ordinarily has broad discretion with respect to the procedures and law governing the arbitration.rules of evidence and judicial procedure do not apply to arbitration proceedings unless the parties otherwise agree.code civ,subd.d sy first family.partnership cheung th,d.arbitration procedures violate the common law right to a fair hearing only in the clearest of cases,when the applicable procedures essentially preclude the possibility of a fair hearing.graham,cal d,fn.moreover,a rbitrators,unless specifically required to act in conformity with rules of law,may base their decision upon broad principles of justice and equity,and in doing so may expressly or impliedly reject a claim that a party might successfully have asserted in a judicial action.citations.moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,moncharsh.we conclude that the matters authorized under the small claims provision are an ordinary incident of arbitration and that the small claims provision is not substantively unconscionable.
finally,an arbitration agreement must provide for a neutral arbitrator,supra,cal d at,see armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,stated that a neutral arbitrator is essential to ensuring the integrity of the arbitration process.in our view,the designation of a panel of arbitrators consisting of a single arbitrator selected by western pizza created a false appearance of mutuality in the selection of an arbitrator.moreover,the effective designation of a single arbitrator in what appears to be a standard arbitration agreement applicable to a large number of corporate employees gives rise to a significant risk of financial interdependence between western pizza and the arbitrator,and an opportunity for western pizza to gain an advantage through its knowledge of and experience with the arbitrator.see armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,mercuro superior court,supra,th at,d.we conclude that this provision is unfairly and substantively unconscionable.
the entire arbitration agreement is unenforceable 
a trial court may either sever an unconscionable or otherwise unlawful provision from an arbitration agreement and enforce the remainder,restrict the application of the provision so as to avoid unconscionable results,or refuse to enforce the entire agreement.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,citing.although a court has some discretion in this regard,a court may refuse to enforce the entire agreement only if the central purpose of the agreement is tainted by illegality.ibid.if the central purpose of the contract is tainted with illegality,then the contract as a whole can not be enforced.if the illegality is collateral to the main purpose of the contract,and the illegal provision can be extirpated from the contract by means of severance or restriction,then such severance and restriction are appropriate.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,accord,little,supra,cal th at,d.
whether a contract is severable in this regard is primarily a question of contract interpretation.whether a contract is entire or separable depends upon its language and subject matter,and this question is one of construction to be determined by the court according to the intention of the parties.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,quoting keene harling cal d.questions of contract interpretation are subject to de novo review unless the interpretation turns on the credibility of extrinsic evidence.parsons bristol development cal d.
armendariz stated that two reasons for severing or restricting illegal terms rather than voiding the entire contract are first to prevent parties from gaining undeserved benefit or suffering undeserved detriment as a result of voiding the entire when there has been full or partial performance of the contract.citations.second,more generally,the doctrine of severance attempts to conserve a contractual relationship if to do so would not be condoning an illegal scheme.citations.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.the overarching inquiry is whether the interests of justice would be furthered by severance.citation.id.at,d.
the arbitration agreement in provided for arbitration before the union of the party imposing the agreement,supra,cal d at.concluded that this provision was unconscionable because the arbitrator was likely to be biased in favor of that party.id.at.rather than invalidate the arbitration agreement in its entirety,concluded that the parties should be afforded an opportunity to agree on an arbitrator and,failing any agreement,the court on the petition of either party should appoint a neutral arbitrator pursuant to code of civil procedure section,supra,at.armendariz later explained that the statute,which provides for the court to appoint an arbitrator in the absence of an agreed method of selection by the parties,effectively authorized the re
