on october,rintin and domar entered the dominicana cement holding,shareholders agreement in order to set forth the rules by which each would participate in dominicana.domar was said to own of the stock in dominicana,and rintin.the agreement contained a section governing resolution of disputes,which included an arbitration clause stating any dispute which may arise from the interpretation,execution or termination of this agreement or from the breach thereof shall be submitted to arbitration according to the provisions of the florida international arbitration act and in compliance with the rules of the american arbitration association aaa.the agreement specified that florida law would govern the agreement.later amendments on april and,modified the agreement so that domar owned of the stock,rintin owned,and a third party,eurocaribic services,owned.the business purpose of dominicana was to hold of the stock of cementos colon,which had acquired ownership of a cement plant in the dominican republic when the plant was privatized in.the other shareholder in cementos colon was corporacion dominicana de empresas estatales known as corde,a company owned by the government of the dominican republic.corde later sold its interest in cementos colon.
after the privatization,rintin alleges that it discovered that domar,its affiliates,and related parties had engaged in wrongful conduct that diminished the value of rintin shares in dominicana.rintin filed lawsuits in the dominican republic against corde and affiliates of domar,seeking to set aside the sale of the cement plant to cementos colon,which would destroy the asset dominicana was formed to own lawsuits in panama against dominicana,seeking to nullify corporate actions of dominicana and criminal proceedings in switzerland and spain against officers of cementos colon and of domar grandparent corporation,holderbank,for fraud.
domar responded to this onslaught by filing a demand for arbitration before the american arbitration association,seeking,among other things,a declaration that rintin had breached the shareholders agreement by filing the foreign lawsuits an injunction against the lawsuits pending around the world and a forced valuation and of rintin shares of dominicana.rintin refused to submit to arbitration and instead filed suit in florida state court seeking a declaration that the matters domar raised before the aaa were not arbitrable.the florida courts ruled against rintin,holding that the shareholders agreement specified that disputes would be handled pursuant to the florida international arbitration act,under which the arbitrability of a dispute is to be decided by the arbitrators.rintin,domar,so d,quoting.stat.ch.the florida courts stayed judicial proceedings pending arbitration.id.at.
the arbitrators began by resolving the arbitrability issue.after hearings and briefing,the arbitrators held that the allegations of domar amended claim were subject to arbitration and that the allegations of rintin counterclaim were also arbitrable,with the exception of counts i,ii,and v,which charged that domar and third parties engaged in unlawful conspiracy.the arbitrators held that rintin third party claims against umar domar parent corporation,holderbank umar parent corporation,corde,dominicana,and certain officers of holderbank and colon were not arbitrable,as none of those parties were bound by the arbitration clause.
there followed a lengthy arbitration that lasted about four years.the arbitrators final award held that the shareholders agreement and the april and,amendments to it were made with unanimous consent of dominicana shareholders and were valid and binding on rintin.the arbitrators found that rintin had breached the shareholders agreement by filing multiple in various countries against domar and third parties,which challenge the basic agreements that govern dominicana and colon and,hence,their normal operations.the arbitrators held that the evidence established that the disagreements of rintin and domar threatened the future viability of dominicana accordingly,they ordered domar to buy rintin interest in dominicana for a price of,which included a premium designed in part to compensate rintin for giving up its foreign lawsuits.rintin investment in dominicana was about million.the arbitrators then ordered rintin to terminate definitively,irrevocably and unconditionally its lawsuits against domar,dominicana,umar,cementos colon,holderbank,corde,corporate officers ackerman and villanueva,and any other persons closely related to them.
rather than complying with the award,rintin then filed this suit to vacate the arbitral award,and domar to confirm the award.the district court found that domar met its burden for confirmation by tendering the agreement to arbitrate and the arbitral award.rintin,domar,d.the district court held that rintin did not meet its burden of establishing a basis for vacating the arbitral award under the florida international arbitration act.stat.ch.accordingly,the district court confirmed the award and ordered rintin to submit proof within days that it had terminated its lawsuits against domar,dominicana,umar,cementos colon,holderbank,corde,their corporate officers ackerman and villanueva,and any other entities or individuals closely related to the parties in that list.id.at.rintin has been held in contempt for failure to dismiss the lawsuits,and a warrant has been issued for the arrest of roberto prats,rintin principal.rintin,domar,d,appeal dismissed,wl cir.march.
rintin appeals,contending that the shareholders agreement is void and that the arbitrators granted relief in favor of in ordering rintin to terminate its foreign suits against domar and cementos colon corporate affiliates and officers of the corporate affiliates.

the florida international arbitration act closely hems in judicial review of arbitrators awards.stat.ch.lists the affirmative defenses available to a party seeking to avoid confirmation of these,rintin argues that it has established three 
a there was no written undertaking to arbitrate 
d the award is contrary to the public policy of the united states or florida and 
f the award resolves a dispute which the parties did not agree to refer to the arbitral tribunal 
florida law specifies our method for deciding whether rintin has established any of these three defenses.first,under the florida international arbitration act,when the parties have raised in the arbitration the issue of whether a written undertaking to arbitrate is valid and enforceable and the arbitrators have resolved the question,the tribunal decision is final,see task force on international arbitration,proposed florida international arbitration act
