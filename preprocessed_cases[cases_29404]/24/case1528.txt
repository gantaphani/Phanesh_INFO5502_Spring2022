the petition before us involves the uninsured motorist provisions in a motor vehicle policy of insurance.pursuant to a directive in insurance code section,subdivision f the subject insurance contract between the insurer and the insured in this case contains a provision that a both parties must decide by agreement whether the insured is legally entitled to collect damages from the owner or driver of the uninsured motor vehicle,and if so entitled,what amount of damages the insured is entitled to collect from such owner or driver,and b if the insured and insurer can not come to an agreement on those questions,then the questions shall be decided by arbitration 
we are asked to decide whether the insurer of someone who is involved in an accident with the owner or driver of an uninsured motor vehicle is required to arbitrate,with its insured,the amount of damages the insured is legally entitled to collect from such owner or driver if the insurer has already paid to its insured the full amount of benefits possible under the terms of the uninsured motorist policy provisions.specifically,the insured in this case has taken the position that the insurer had an opportunity to settle this case for uninsured motorist policy limits and chose not to do so in a timely fashion and is now afraid to have an arbitrator place a value on the case as such award may exceed the insured uninsured motorist policy limits which could expose the insurer to an excess judgment in excess of its policy limits.
as more fully discussed below,the insured argues that the amount of damages caused by the uninsured driver involved in her accident is relevant in determining the amount of damages,if any,which could be awarded to her in a suit against the insurer for bad faith in settling her uninsured motorist claim,and therefore the amount of the uninsured motorist liability should be arbitrated.this argument ignores the fact that even if there was bad faith in settling the insured uninsured motorist claim,any damages to which she might be entitled must arise from,and be the result of,the insurer bad faith conduct.thus,the personal injury and property damage caused by the accident are not relevant where the insurer has in fact paid full policy benefits.
it is clear that the provisions for arbitration in the parties insurance contract,and in subdivision f of section,address those situations where the issues of the uninsured motorist liability the amount of the insured damages resulting from such liability remain to be decided,so that the insurer can determine how much,if anything,to pay under the uninsured motorist provisions of the policy.here,by the time the insured filed her petition to compel arbitration,the insurer had already paid its policy limits to her.thus,by that time,the directives in the insurance contract and in section,subdivision f for arbitration had effectively been rendered moot and therefore arbitration is unnecessary since the arbitrator can not award more than the policy limits see fn,ante.
we therefore will grant the petition for writ relief filed by the insurer and direct the trial court to vacate its order of arbitration 
background of the case 
according to the record,the insured in this case,real party in interest barbara balen balen,was in a chain reaction accident while stopped at a stop light.she was the middle car,and thus was hit from behind and pushed into the car in front of her.her motor vehicle insurance policy with petitioner state farm mutual automobile insurance company state farm provides for uninsured motorist protection in the amount of per person,and a total of per accident.on march,balen attorney notified state farm that balen would be making an uninsured motorist claim under her policy.
on april,balen attorney wrote to state farm informing it that balen had suffered extensive injuries,as had her car,and thus balen was making a policy limits demand less credit for the uninsured driver contribution,pursuant to the terms of balen policy,to be paid by state farm on or before may.in a may reply,state farm informed the attorney that it was not in a position to accept a policy limits offer.the next day,balen attorney wrote to state farm,withdrawing balen offer to settle her claim for policy limits and demanding that state farm arbitrate.state farm wrote back saying it was turning the claim over to its attorneys for resolution.
on june,state farm attorney wrote to balen attorney,stating that state farm would conduct discovery prior to scheduling arbitration,and asking for a list of proposed arbitrators,as well as a list of any medical providers that had treated balen and of which state farm was not already aware.balen attorney submitted a list of proposed arbitrators to state farm counsel on june and august,and on september,the two attorneys agreed on a person to be the single arbitrator.
in a june,letter,balen attorney gave notice that because state farm did not accept balen april letter offering to settle for a policy limits payment to her by may,and because balen then withdrew such offer,her demand for settlement is presently.by rejecting our offer to settle within the policy limits,state farm has opened it sic policy up.in a july,letter to state farm attorney,balen attorney argued that although an arbitrator could not award balen any more than her policy limits,it would be within the arbitrator discretion to make a finding of the total value of the case and s hould the arbitrator determine that the value of balen case exceeds the policy limits,she would have an absolute right to sue state farm for that sum,plus any other damages she suffered.this would have the same effect as opening up the insurance policy.
on november,state farm attorney wrote to balen counsel saying that he had completed discovery of balen medical claims and based on his discussion with claims personnel at state farm,the insurer would pay the uninsured motorist policy limits less the.the attorney added that payment of such sum will,in effect,resolve the uim claim of your client.on november,balen attorney received a check from state farm in the amount of.there was no release enclosed with the check,the check did not contain language indicating it was in full settlement of balen claim,and no release was ever requested.however,the cover letter from state farm attorney stated enclosed you will find the settlement draft in the amount of.
in response,the next day,november,balen attorney wrote back to state farm attorney saying balen claim had not been settled by the check since balen offer to settle for had been rescinded by her,in writing,months earlier.nevertheless,said her attorney,i f you wish for us to keep the and allow us to preserve our rights to an excess award against state farm at a later time,then such is fine with us.this late gesture may help state farm to avoid an even greater adverse judgment.please clearly let me know what you want us to do.
thereafter,the attorneys noted in letters to each other their disagreement as to whether balen was entitled to have an arbitrator place a value on her case her attorney words given that state farm had already paid its policy limits,and state farm indicated it would not arbitrate.additionally,balen attorney indicated his intent to cash the check,and his view that the check represented only a partial settlement of balen claim.
balen filed a petition in the superior court of los angeles to compel arbitration.the trial court minute order on the petition states in part that the only issue raised was whether balen had a contractual right to arbitration.the court determined she did have such a right,granted her petition,and ordered the parties to arbitrate.
thereafter,state farm filed a petition with this court,seeking a writ directing the trial court to vacate the order compelling arbitration.we issued an order to show cause directing the parties to appear before this court to argue the merits of the issues raised by state farm petition.
discussion 
there is no controversy to be arbitrated.a.the dollar amount of balen accident damages is no longer relevant given state farm policy limits payment
