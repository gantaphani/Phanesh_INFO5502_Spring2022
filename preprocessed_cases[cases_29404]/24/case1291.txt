plaintiff portico management group,llc portico entered into a contract to purchase an apartment building owned by the trustees of the harrison children trust hct and harrison family enterprise ii hfe ii,a limited partnership.when the sale was not completed,portico sued the sellers for specific performance and damages.the matter went to arbitration,resulting in an arbitration award of over million in portico favor.although in its lawsuit portico properly named as defendants alan harrison and wei jen harrison as trustees of the hct,and hfe ii,the arbitration award was not against the trustees,but only against the hct and hfe ii.
in,a judgment confirming the arbitration award against the trust and the limited partnership was entered the trial court declined to accept a proposed judgment against the trustees.
portico did not seek to correct or modify either the arbitration award or the judgment to indicate the arbitration award and judgment were properly against the trustees nor did portico appeal from the judgment against the trust.instead,years of protracted litigation ensued.portico sought to enforce the judgment by levying on funds generated by the apartment building and to add as judgment debtors the successor trustees of the hct,and wei jen harrison as trustee of the wei jen harrison revocable trust whrt,to which hfe ii had transferred its share of the apartment building.in response,the successor trustees of the hct asserted a third party claim on the levied funds.
the trial court originally ruled in favor of portico,but later changed its mind and accepted the argument that the hct,as a trust,was not an entity and did not hold title to any property thus the judgment against it was unenforceable.the court also rejected the argument that wei jen harrison could be added to the judgment on an alter ego theory.the court awarded the successor trustees attorney fees as prevailing parties under the attorney fee provision of the purchase contract.
portico appeals.it maintains,as it has throughout the litigation,that it is proper to enter judgment against a trust and such a judgment is enforceable against the assets of the trust.portico contends that in granting various motions,the court,without jurisdiction,was permitting a collateral attack on the final judgment.it further contends the court judgments and orders addressing adding judgment debtors and the validity of the third party claim must be reversed due to these errors.it argues the trial court erred in denying its motion to add wei jen harrison,as trustee of the whrt,to the judgment on an alter ego theory.finally,portico claims the attorney fee award to the successor trustees must be reversed.
we find merit solely in portico contention of error regarding adding wei jen harrison to the judgment.in ruling on the motion,the trial court apparently misconstrued the motion and therefore erred.accordingly,we shall remand for further proceedings on that motion.in all other respects,we shall affirm.
background 
ithe parties and the purchase contract 
alan harrison and wei jen harrison were married in in,they created the hct for the benefit of their daughters,kim and lynn alan and wei jen were the general trustees of the hct.the couple invested in several apartment complexes over the years,one of which was the unit apartment complex in carmichael known as the continental.in,alan and wei jen divorced pursuant to a partial marital settlement agreement,the continental was placed in the hct.the hct owned percent of the continental.the remaining percent was owned by wei jen relatives.after the separation,wei jen purchased their interest.
in or,wei jen organized the limited partnership hfe ii,which held the percent interest in the continental.she planned to sell the continental and manage the properties through hfe ii.wei jen,as trustee asset manager of hct and as general partner of hfe ii,entered into a purchase agreement to sell the continental to portico.alan refused to sign the deed and closing documents.
the arbitration award and judgment 
in,portico brought suit for specific performance,breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,fraud,and negligent misrepresentation based on the failure to complete the sale of the continental.the complaint named as defendants alan and wei jen,individually and as general trustees of the hct,two special trustees of the hct,hfe ii,and wei jen as general partner of hfe ii.the complaint also sought to compel mediation and arbitration pursuant to paragraph of the purchase agreement.
portico motion to compel arbitration was granted.
the arbitration hearing was held october through october.in,the arbitrator issued a final award.the arbitrator found for portico on the breach of contract claim,as alan failure to sign the closing documents to permit the sale caused the sellers to breach the contract with portico.the arbitrator found,however,that portico had failed to carry its burden to show fraud and misrepresentation.noting that the action was brought against alan and wei jen personally and as trustees and against wei jen as general partner of hfe ii,the arbitrator found that the general trustees are not personally liable for their acts as trustees of an irrevocable trust.at all times,plaintiff knew it was dealing with a trust and a partnership.thus,the award in this case is against hct and hfe ii in proportion to their ownership interest in the continental and.portico had elected the remedy of damages rather than specific performance.the arbitrator awarded portico damages,attorney fees,and costs totaling.
portico petitioned to confirm the arbitration award.portico proposed a judgment that was against hfe ii and alan and wei jen as general trustees of the hct.after alan and wei jen objected to this form of judgment,the trial court directed portico to revise the proposed judgment.in august,judgment was entered against the hct and hfe reference to trustees.
the levy and third party claim of ownership 
to enforce the judgment,portico caused a writ of execution on the judgment to be issued.pursuant to this writ,a notice of levy was served on fpi management,fpi.portico sought to levy on all personal property of the hct and hfe ii,including rents from the continental and all monies in the continental apartments operating account at wells fargo bank.
fpi turned over to the levying officer.this sum represented percent of the monies in the continental account that were dispersible under hud requirements.fpi noted the owner of percent of the continental was not named in the levy 
meanwhile,kim and lynn,alan and wei jen adult daughters and beneficiaries of the hct,had petitioned the court for appointment as cotrustees of the hct.in march of,after the arbitration but before the award issued,kim and lynn were approved and appointed interim successor cotrustees of the hct.
kim and lynn filed a third party claim of ownership,pursuant to code of civil procedure section et,on the property described in the notice of levy served on fpi and wells fargo bank.they argued that no judgment had been entered against their predecessors,alan and wei jen as trustees of the hct.instead,the judgment was entered against the hct,which was not an entity or person capable of owning title to property.
portico applied for a temporary restraining order enjoining transfer of the levied funds and an order setting a hearing to determine the validity of the third party claim.the court issued a temporary restraining order,which did permit fpi to make mortgage payments,and pay taxes and other ordinary operating expenses.
motions to add judgment debtors 
portico moved to add kim and lynn,as successor trustees,as judgment debtors.portico argued kim and lynn claim that a judgment can not be entered against a trust failed under law.nonetheless,if the court concluded portico could not enforce the judgment against the successor trustees without adding them as judgment debtors,portico asserted the court had power under section to do so.portico also sought to add wei jen,as trustee of the whrt,and the whrt itself as judgment debtors.portico asserted that despite the lis pendens it had filed on the continental in,wei jen purported to transfer hfe ii percent interest in the continental to wei jen as trustee of the whrt.as a result of this purported transfer,fpi refused to deposit with the sheriff percent of the funds it held,on the grounds that such funds did not belong to hfe ii.portico argued the purported transfer was an obvious effort to frustrate portico efforts to enforce any resulting judgment against hfe ii.
in opposition,wei jen argued portico knew in that title to the continental had been transferred.in,portico took wei jen deposition and from the questions it was apparent that portico knew about the transfer.nonetheless,despite this knowledge,portico did not amend its complaint to allege the property had been transferred and to add alter ego allegations.nor did portico make any effort to modify or correct the arbitration award.instead,portico waited over three years to amend the judgment.
portico withdrew its motion to add wei jen as a judgment debtor,but brought the motion again later in the second motion,portico argued wei jen and the whrt were alter egos of hfe ii.it relied on her deposition in a debtor examination in which she conceded she,hfe ii,and the whrt were all the same entity.portico argued there was no consideration for hfe ii transfer of its percent interest in the continental.
in response,wei jen declared there was consideration for the transfer,as she had assumed a note,gave up her interest in hfe ii,and assumed responsibility for a claim by the listing brokers over the failed sale.
initial rulings,final rulings,and judgment 
on december,the trial court tentatively granted portico motion to add kim and lynn,successor trustees of the hct,as judgment debtors.on december,the court ruled on the petition for an order determining the validity of the third party claim,treating it as a motion to amend the judgment.finding that it was clear the arbitrator intended to order judgment against alan and wei jen in their capacity as trustees of the hct,but not in their individual capacities,the court ordered the judgment amended to reflect that it was against alan and wei jen as trustees of the hct.since kim and lynn were now successor trustees of the hct,a second amended judgment would be entered against them.the court found that portico was entitled to enforce its judgment against the trust property.
in early january,alan made an ex parte application to stay entry of the amended judgment.he argued his due process rights were violated as there was no notice that an amendment of the judgment was being considered.
the court denied the motion to stay without prejudice,but indicated that it would not sign the amended judgment until all motions to vacate or reconsider were filed,stating that all disputes were still pending.
alan,wei jen,kim and lynn filed various motions to vacate,for reconsideration,and for a new trial.
on february,the trial court issued several tentative rulings.again,the court ruled in favor of portico.these rulings denied kim and lynn motion for a new trial or reconsideration,alan motion to vacate,and wei jen motion for a new trial or reconsideration.the last tentative ruling granted portico request to add wei jen as a judgment debtor the court found wei jen and the whrt were alter egos of hfe ii.
in the final rulings in march,however,the court changed its mind.alan motion to vacate was granted.the court found the arbitrator made a mistake in naming the hct as the judgment debtor,but the arbitrator decision was not subject to judicial review.the court vacated its orders that amended the judgment and indicated a second amended judgment could be entered against kim and lynn.
similarly,the court granted wei jen motion for a new trial or reconsideration and kim and lynn motion for the same.the court found it had no authority to correct the arbitrator error.
the court denied portico motion to add wei jen as a judgment debtor.the court found wei jen could not be added as an alter ego of the hct 
portico motion for clarification,correction reconsideration was denied.the court found portico failed to offer new facts,circumstances or law,and so had failed to comply with the requirements of section for a motion for reconsideration.
on april,the court issued two judgments.the first granted the third party claim of kim and lynn as to the,finding the claim was valid.the temporary restraining order was vacated and dissolved.this judgment was later amended nunc pro tunc to correct a clerical error.the second judgment denied the motion to add judgment debtors.
the court denied portico motion for a new trial.
portico appealed from the two april judgments.
attorney fee award 
kim and lynn moved for attorney fees under the attorney fee provision in the purchase contract.they asserted they were prevailing parties and sought in fees and in costs.
the court granted the motion.
portico appealed from the order awarding attorney fees,as well as from the amended judgment correcting a clerical error in one of the april judgments.
discussion 
ithe arbitration award and judgment against the hct 
the key dispute in this case is the effect of the judgment having been entered against the hct,rather than against its trustees.portico contends that under law it is proper to enter judgment against a trust and since the trial court believed otherwise,its judgments and orders must be reversed.the harrisons counter that a judgment against a trust is unenforceable because a trust is not an entity it can not sue or be sued,or hold title to property.the harrisons are correct on this point.the hct was not a proper judgment debtor.
in contrast to a corporation,which the law often deems a person,a trust is not a person but rather a fiduciary relationship with respect to property.citations.ziegler nickel th.legal title to property owned by a trust is held by the trustee a trust is simply a collection of assets and liabilities.galdjie darwish th.a n ordinary express trust is not an entity separate from its trustees.powers ashton d.
a trust itself can not sue or be sued.presta tepper th.as a general rule,the trustee is the real party in interest with standing to sue and defend on the trust behalf.citations.estate of bowles cal.app th.a claim based on a contract entered into by a trustee in the trustee representative capacity,may be asserted against the trust by proceeding against the trustee in the trustee representative capacity,italics added.
a trust does not fall within the statutory definition of a judgment debtor.a judgment debtor is the person against whom a judgment is rendered.a trust is not included within the definition of person.
since the hct is not a separate entity,does not itself hold title to any property,and is not a judgment debtor,a judgment against the hct is meaningless and can not be enforced.to be enforceable against the trust property,the judgment should have been entered against those who held title to such property the trustees.
in arguing that it is proper to enter judgment against a trust,rather than against its trustees,portico relies on language in cases that suggest judgment was entered against a trust itself.in none of these cases,however,was the issue whether judgment could be entered against the trust,or the effect of such a judgment.the statements,therefore,are dicta,and imprecise dicta at that.for example,in jans nelson th,at page,cited by portico for the proposition that judgment may be entered for a trust,in setting forth the procedural history of the case,the court stated we directed entry of judgment against the trust and in favor of the bank in the full amount of the debt we need look no further for context than to the remainder of that same sentence we noted that the trustee was entitled to seek contribution against other coguarantors.jans nelson,supra,th at.it is clear that judgment was entered against the trustee 
portico also quotes from haskett villas at desert falls th,the statute words plainly state that the enumerated types of claims may be asserted against the trust portico,however,again omits the remainder of the sentence,which reads by proceeding against the trustee in the trustee representative capacity,whether or not the trustee is personally liable on the claim,italics in original.
these cases show merely that many courts use a shorthand,albeit technically incorrect,description for a judgment against trustees in their representative capacity,referring simply to a judgment against a trust.we noted this practice of referring to the trust as a party rather than referring to the trustee in roberts.lomanto th,footnote in the trial court,and on appeal,lomanto labels the parties the cable trust and the lomanto trust.as roberts points out,however,a trust is not an entity distinct from its trustees and capable of legal action on its own behalf,but merely a fiduciary relationship with respect to property.citation.we therefore refer to roberts and lomanto,the persons who took the actions that led to this litigation,as the parties.selective quotation of imprecise language does not provide authority that a judgment entered against a trust,a nonentity that can not hold title to property,is enforceable against trust assets.it is not.
portico further contends jensen hugh evans cal d is on point.in jensen,judgment was entered against the two trusts id.at.even if judgment were entered against the trusts rather than the trustees,jensen is distinguishable because it involved a different type of trust,an unincorporated business or massachusetts trust.id.at.in business trusts the object is not to hold and conserve particular property,with incidental powers,as in the traditional type of trusts,but to provide a medium for the conduct of business and sharing of its gains.d corporations.unlike traditional trusts,a business trust may be treated as a separate entity.for example,business trusts are treated as corporations for tax purposes,subd.b.they are treated as a person and may be judgment debtors under the bankruptcy code.in re sung soo rim irrevocable intervivos trust.because business trusts are not traditional trusts,general trust law,applicable here,does not apply to them.
finally,portico relies on the law revision commission comment to probate code section.probate code section provides the question of liability as between the trust estate and the trustee personally may be determined in a proceeding under section.the law revision commission comment reads in part it is permissible,and may be preferable,for judgment to be entered against the trust without determining the trustee ultimate liability until later.while e xplanatory comments by a law revision commission are persuasive evidence of the intent of the legislature brian superior court cal d,such comments,like all statutory interpretation,must be read in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.see del cerro mobile estates city of placentia th.the immediately preceding statute,probate code section,makes clear that a claim against a trust may be asserted against the trust by proceeding against the trustee in the trustee representative capacity nothing in the law revision commission comment changes the rule that a trust is not an entity and any action by or against the trust must proceed through the trustees.a judgment against trust assets must be asserted the same way,against the trustees in their representative capacity,as it is the trustees who hold title to the property held in trust.
portico contends the arbitrator was free to ignore the technicalities of trust law and enter an award against the trust.an arbitrator has broad discretion to fashion any appropriate remedy as long as that remedy has a rational relationship to the contract.advanced micro devices,intel cal th.but the arbitrator powers in fashioning a remedy are not at issue.the legal effect of a judgment entered against a trust,a nonentity,is at issue.a judgment against a trust,rather than against its trustees,is not enforceable.the arbitrator did not have the power to change the law.
the failure to bring suit properly against the trustees to obtain specific performance for the sale of property held in trust was not fatal in galdjie darwish,supra,th.there,the named defendants were the darwishes as individuals the darwishes were not named in their capacity as trustees of their revocable living trust.the property at issue was held in the trust.the court ruled in favor of plaintiff and ordered the darwishes to specifically perform the contract and sell the property to plaintiff.galdjie darwish,supra,th at.on appeal,the darwishes argued the judgment could not bind the trust because the trust was not named in the complaint,nor was it specified that the darwishes were sued in their capacity as trustees of the trust.id.at.
after a thorough review of the common law and statutory law,the court concluded from the above authorities it is clear that the proper procedure for one who wishes to ensure that trust property will be available to satisfy a judgment,whether for damages for breach of contract or for specific performance,should sue the trustee in his or her representative capacity.we do not believe,however,that this results in an ineffectual judgment due to the specific facts of the case before us.the judgment did not give respondent the right to attach property owned by appellants as individuals it entitled him to receive a piece of real property owned by the trust by obtaining appellants signatures on a deed.courts have held that where a trustee signs a contract of sale or deed without reference to his or her representative capacity,the contract or deed is enforceable against the trust.citations.galdjie darwish,supra,th at.
the court noted that a revocable inter vivos trust is a probate avoidance device,but does not prevent creditors of the settlors who are often also the trustees and the sole beneficiaries during their lifetimes from reaching trust property.ibid.the evidence before us establishes that the trust is a revocable inter vivos trust,that appellants are the sole trustees and,that as beneficiaries,they have the power during their lifetimes to direct the sale of the real property owned by the trust.in view of the above authorities,their signatures as individuals on the title deed as required by the judgment entered herein is sufficient to convey good title from the trust.id.at.
galdjie does not aid portico.first,unlike the revocable intervivos trust at issue in galdjie,the hct is an irrevocable trust in favor of the trustors children,so the trust property was not the property of the trustors or,at the time of the breach of contract,the trustees.more importantly,the judgment in galdjie was a proper judgment it was against the darwishes,persons who qualified as judgment debtors,albeit wrongly named as individuals rather than trustees.here,in contrast,the judgment was against the hct,a nonentity that was not a party to the lawsuit or arbitration and could not be a judgment debtor.
faced with an arbitration award against the hct containing such an obvious error,portico had several possible remedies.portico could have applied to the arbitrator to correct the award within days of service of a signed copy of the award.portico had days to petition the court to correct the award.in,at the final hearing,the trial court lamented it did not have authority to send the matter back to the arbitrator.had portico timely taken appropriate steps,remand to the arbitrator would have been an appropriate remedy.see mossman city of oakdale th,where arbitration award unenforceable due to ambiguity,remand to arbitrator for clarification.further,portico could have appealed from the judgment after the trial court rejected the proposed judgment naming the trustees.
this case again teaches the cautionary lesson noted in roehl ritchie th.if anything is confirmed by the instant appeal,it is the significance of the process of confirming an arbitration award.the time to make sure that the i are dotted,t are crossed,and that the award decides all necessary issues in a single,final and award is before the award is confirmed,not after.that is the best way to ensure that an arbitrator decision is truly the end,not the beginning,of the dispute.citation.roehl ritchie,supra,th at.
is there a cautionary lesson perhaps it is this formalities matter,particularly when dealing with the informality of arbitration.the process of judicially confirming an arbitration award is the time when it is necessary to dress up what otherwise can be a casual occasion.be sure the arbitration award properly covers the submitted issues and the proper parties before wrapping it in the judicial cloak of confirmation.roehl ritchie,supra,th at.
having accepted and confirmed the arbitration award against the hct,without any attempt to have either the arbitrator or the court correct it to name the trustees as the proper parties portico is bound by the terms of the arbitration award.a n arbitrator decision is not generally reviewable for errors of fact or law,whether or not such error appears on the face of the award and causes substantial injustice to the parties.moncharsh heily blase cal th,moncharsh.in reaffirming this general rule,we recognize there is a risk that the arbitrator will make a mistake.that risk,however,is acceptable for two reasons.first,by voluntarily submitting to arbitration,the parties have agreed to bear that risk in return for a quick,inexpensive,and conclusive resolution to their dispute.id.at.a second reason why we tolerate the risk of an erroneous decision is because the legislature has reduced the risk to the parties of such a decision by providing for judicial review in circumstances involving serious problems with the award itself,or with the fairness of the arbitration process.moncharsh,supra,cal th at.the court noted the procedure for correcting an award under section moncharsh,supra,at,a procedure portico did not attempt.
having determined that a judgment against the trust itself is ineffective to reach assets held in trust because the judgment must be against the trustees,we turn to portico other arguments,which we discuss post in the unpublished portion of our opinion.
collateral attacks on judgment and related arguments 
in late,the trial court ruled it would amend the judgment to add the trustees of hct as judgment debtors.in response,the harrisons filed various motions in to vacate and for reconsideration,which were eventually granted.portico characterizes these motions as collateral attacks on the judgment.portico contends that since the judgment was final,the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant the motions,which it characterizes as collateral attacks.
the motions were intended to keep the judgment as it was against the hct and not the trustees.portico does not explain how these motions were a collateral attack on the judgment.presumably,portico relies on its assertion that a judgment against a trust is sufficient to reach assets held in trust.as discussed ante,we have rejected that argument.accordingly,we reject portico collateral attack argument as well.
in a similar vein,portico contends that even if the arbitrator made an error in concluding that trust law permitted a judgment against the trust,the trial court lacked jurisdiction under moncharsh,supra,cal th,to entertain alan argument about that error.we disagree.alan was not seeking to have the court review the arbitration award and change the judgment portico was.alan argument went only to the effect of the judgment confirming the arbitration award.he argued that since the judgment was against the trust,not the trustees,it was not enforceable against trust assets.alan did not seek review of the arbitration award with the intent of changing of the award he sought only to keep the award as the arbitrator made it.in accepting alan argument,the trial court did not go against moncharsh.
portico contends the various motions were procedurally improper.it argues they were untimely because they were months after the judgment and they failed to offer new facts orlaw,as required under section.these motions,however,did not address the judgment.instead,they addressed the december ruling to amend the judgment,secured by portico.further,they were in response to the court ruling in january.in that ruling,the court denied alan motion to stay the amended judgment,but indicated the court would not sign the amended judgment until all motions to vacate or reconsider were filed.the court set a briefing schedule for any objection to the judgment and indicated it would reconsider its ruling.the court deems all disputes in this matter to be pending until further order of the court.a trial court has authority to reconsider a prior ruling.to do so,it should inform the parties,solicit briefing,and hold a hearing.le francois goel cal th.that is what happened in this case.there was no procedural impropriety,and no error.
motion to grant third party claim 
portico contends the trial court erred in granting kim and lynn third party claim on the levied funds.portico contends kim and lynn,as successor trustees,are not third parties.
section permits a third person claiming ownership or the right to possession of property to make a claim on levied property if the interest claimed is superior to the creditor lien on the property.
portico creditor lien on the levied property was based on its judgment against the hct.as a general rule a judgment or levy reaches only the interest of the debtor in the property because a judgment creditor can acquire no greater right in the property levied upon than that of its judgment debtor.citations.regency outdoor advertising,carolina lanes,th.since the hct did not own the levied trustees the hct was not a judgment debtor,the judgment did not give portico a valid claim to the levied property.kim and lynn,as successor trustees,owned the property and had an interest superior to that of portico.the trial court did not err in granting their third party claim.
motion to add successor trustees as judgment debtors 
while portico contends the judgment is enforceable as is,and binding on the successor trustees,it also argues the trial court erred in denying its motion to add kim and lynn,in their capacity as successor trustees,as judgment debtors.portico contends the trial court had authority to add the successor trustees as additional judgment debtors under section and such addition was appropriate because they acquired an interest in the lawsuit when they were named successor trustees of the hct.
section of the code of civil procedure grants to every court the power to use all means to carry its jurisdiction into effect,even if those means are not set out in the code citation.under section,the court has the authority to amend a judgment to add additional judgment debtors.citation.nec electronics,hurt d.judgments are often amended to add additional judgment debtors on the grounds that a person or entity is the alter ego of the original judgment debtor.citations.this is an equitable procedure based on the theory that the court is not amending the judgment to add a new defendant but is merely inserting the correct name of the real defendant.citations.ibid.
here,portico did not rely on the alter ego doctrine to add the successor trustees.instead,it sought to add them simply as successors to the original trustees,alan and wei jen.if the judgment had named alan and wei jen as trustees as judgment debtors,no motion to add kim and lynn would be necessary the successor trustees would be bound by a judgment against their predecessors.the powers of a trustee are not personal to any particular trustee but,rather,are inherent in the office of trustee.it has been the law in california for over a century that a new trustee succeed s to all the rights,duties,and responsibilities of his predecessors.citations.moeller superior court,supra,cal th.
further,as discussed ante,portico attempt to amend the judgment to name the trustees as judgment debtors had previously been rebuffed.in seeking to confirm the arbitration award,portico submitted a proposed judgment against wei jen harrison and alan harrison,as general trustees of the harrison children trust,and harrison family enterprise ii the court,by judge loncke,rejected this proposed judgment instead,judgment was entered against hfe ii and the hct.portico sought to have judge mcmaster overrule judge loncke on this point.
it is often said as a general rule one trial judge can not reconsider and overrule an order of another trial judge.there are important public policy reasons behind this rule.for one superior court judge,no matter how well intended,even if correct as a matter of law,to nullify a duly made,erroneous ruling of another superior court judge places the second judge in the role of a appellate court.the rule also discourages forum shopping,conserves judicial resources,prevents one judge from interfering with a case ongoing before another judge and prevents a second judge from ignoring or arbitrarily rejecting the order of a previous judge which can result in a violation of due process.people riva th,fns.omitted.
the trial court did not err in denying portico motion to add kim and lynn as judgment debtors 
motion to add wei jen as judgment debtor 
portico contends the trial court erred in denying its motion to add wei jen and the wei jen harrison revocable trust as judgment debtors on the theory that they were alter egos of hfe ii portico relies on wei jen testimony in her deposition that she used hfe ii as her checking account,the transfer of the interest in the apartment complex was from me to me,and there was no consideration for transfer of the percent interest in the continental from hfe ii to wei jen,as trustee of the whrt.
the alter ego doctrine is premised on the theory that the person in charge of a single enterprise consisting of several alter ego entities is typically concerned with the total amount of his assets held by all entities,not with the specific amount held by any particular one.greenspan,supra,th.portico provided evidence that wei jen treated hfe ii,the whrt,and herself as one entity.
wei jen does not dispute her testimony on which portico relies instead,she contends substantial evidence supports the trial court ruling.she contends denial of the motion to add her as a judgment debtor,on the theory that she was the alter ego of hfe ii,was proper because portico knew of the transfer of an interest in the continental from hfe ii to wei jen since july and delayed too long to assert claims arising from the transfer the arbitrator found wei jen not liable for the breach of contract wei jen was not an alter ego of hfe ii because she gave consideration for the transfer of the percent interest in the continental and res judicata precludes adding wei jen as a judgment debtor.
under section,the trial court is authorized to amend a judgment to add additional judgment debtors.citations.as a general rule,a court may amend its judgment at any time so that the judgment will properly designate the real defendants.citation.judgments may be amended to add additional judgment debtors on the ground that a person or entity is the alter ego of the original judgment debtor.citations.hall,goodhue,haisley barker,marconi conf.center bd.th.amendment of a judgment to add an alter ego is an equitable procedure based on the theory that the court is not amending the judgment to add a new defendant but is merely inserting the correct name of the real defendant.citations.such a procedure is an appropriate and complete method by which to bind new defendants where it can be demonstrated that in their capacity as alter ego of the corporation they in fact had control of the previous litigation,and thus were virtually represented in the lawsuit.citation.carr barnabey hotel th.

the remedy provided under section to add judgment debtors was available to portico.the remedy applies to a judgment confirming an arbitration award.greenspan,supra,th at.further,the alter ego doctrine may be used to reach trust assets.while the doctrine does not apply to a trust,it may apply to a trustee.id.at.in greenspan,the appellate court found the trial court erred in concluding that the alter ego doctrine could not be used to reach the assets of a trust plaintiff properly sought to add the trustee under section as the alter ego of the judgment debtor.id.at.
wei jen contends the equitable remedy of section was not available to portico because portico unreasonably delayed in seeking to add wei jen as trustee of the whrt.wei jen relies on alexander abbey of the chimes d.in that case,a judgment was entered in february and a motion to add judgment debtors was made in december.alexander abbey of the chimes,supra,d at.the appellate court found the trial court abused its discretion in granting the belated motion to add a judgment debtor as an alter ego absent a reasonable explanation for the nearly delay.id.at.wei jen contends here portico gave no reason for waiting two years to assert a claim based on the transfer of the interest in the continental.
the relevant timeline is as follows the complaint was filed in march and the motion to compel arbitration was granted that august.the transfer from hfe ii to wei jen as trustee occurred in february.wei jen gave portico a copy of the deed evidencing the transfer during discovery in july.the arbitration took place in october and the award was issued in may.the judgment confirming the award was entered in september.portico first moved under section to add wei jen,as trustee of the whrt,as a judgment debtor in november.
as this timeline shows,alexander is distinguishable as there the plaintiff waited seven years after judgment to add the alter ego.here,the motion was first made a few months after judgment.portico had no obligation to litigate wei jen alter ego status in the arbitration because it was unrelated to the liability determinations made in arbitration.greenspan,supra,th at.the remedy provided by section is simply a means of satisfying a judgment ibid.nothing indicates that portico was aware of wei jen alter ego status before portico filed suit.see greenspan,supra,th at if,before filing suit,plaintiff reasonably believes an alter ego relationship exists,complaint should include alter ego allegations and name alter egos as defendants.
wei jen complains that portico knew of the transfer in,two years before the arbitration took place.she argues portico had ample notice and time to amend its complaint to add the whrt as a defendant.wei jen ignores the effect of section under that statute,an amendment to the complaint was not required portico had the option to amend its complaint to add the new owner of the continental or continue the action against the original owners of the continental.portico complaint sought specific performance or damages due to the failed sale of the continental,so the continental was the subject matter of the action when a party transfers an interest in the subject matter of a pending action,the proceeding may be continued in the name of the original party.citations.luster collins th,citing predecessor statute to section.
