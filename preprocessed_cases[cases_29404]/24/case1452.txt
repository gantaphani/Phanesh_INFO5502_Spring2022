discussion 
the talent agencies act 
the talent agencies act act,et regulates the activities of a talent agency,a person or corporation who engages in the occupation of procuring,offering,promising,or attempting to procure employment or engagements for an artist or artists,subd.a.artists include persons rendering professional services in television enterprises,subd.b.
section,subdivision a,of the act states that i n cases of controversy arising under this chapter,the parties involved shall refer the matters in dispute to the labor commissioner,who shall hear and determine the same,subject to an appeal within days after determination,to the superior court where the same shall be heard de novo.
section of the act states that n o person shall engage in or carry on the occupation of a talent agency without first procuring a license therefor from the labor commissioner.the plaintiff contends that defendant was an unlicensed talent agent,and therefore their agreement is void and defendant is barred from recovering the compensation he is seeking under the contract.the defendant asserts that he was acting as a personal manager,not as a talent agent,and he is not barred from recovering compensation for his services.
the question before us is who has original jurisdiction to make the determination as to the validity of the parties contract.defendant contends that the question of the contract validity should be determined by the arbitrator,and the trial court therefore erred in refusing to compel arbitration.we disagree.
the parties contract included a standard aaa arbitration clause,including a stipulation that the parties are to arbitrate any attack on the validity or legality of the contract.however,as interpreted by the courts,section,subdivision a,vests exclusive original jurisdiction in the commissioner to resolve issues arising under the the issue of whether or not an individual such as defendant is a personal manager or an unlicensed talent agent.in styne stevens cal th,d,styne,the supreme court held that the commissioner exclusive original jurisdiction applies even where the act is first raised by the artist as a defense to a claim for breach of contract by the personal agent.id.at,d.in the present case,defendant asserted a claim that plaintiff had breached his contract and plaintiff submitted the petition to determine controversy to the commissioner to determine the issue of whether the contract involved the services of a talent agency.the commissioner found that plaintiff had raised a colorable defense to defendant claims,based on an alleged violation of the act.the administrative procedures before the commissioner must be resolved before resort may be had to another tribunal.contrary to defendant suggestion,the fact that plaintiff is a sophisticated individual,with significant legal experience does not alter the decision of styne or the procedure to follow.
as explained in styne stevens,supra,cal th at page,d,it is appropriate for the commissioner to resolve the dispute between the parties,for t he commissioner expertise in applying the act is particularly significant in cases where,as here,the essence of the parties dispute is whether services performed were by a talent agency for an artist.in addition,the commissioner interpretation of a statute he is charged with enforcing deserves substantial weight.at,d.in the present case,defendant commenced an arbitration seeking damages for breach of contract.in styne,the action was initiated in superior court.we find the distinction to be of no consequence.
the trial court here correctly applied buchwald superior court d.buchwald in refusing to order arbitration and staying the proceedings until the commissioner resolved the question before him.the facts of buchwald are on point to the case at bar.in buchwald,the rock band known as jefferson airplane claimed that section made their contract with their manager,matthew katz katz,void because the manager had obtained employment for them without being licensed as a talent agent.katz sought arbitration based upon an arbitration clause in his contract.the band filed a petition to determine controversy with the commissioner,contending that katz was an unlicensed talent agent.the band also brought an action in superior court,attempting to prevent katz from proceeding with arbitration.id.at.the court of appeal held that the commissioner had exclusive original jurisdiction over the controversy based upon the band petition,and that the exhaustion doctrine applied.id.at.in the present case,defendant sought to compel arbitration with plaintiff.then plaintiff sought an order staying the arbitration and sought to require defendant to exhaust his administrative remedies before the commissioner.as in buchwald,the trial court properly granted plaintiff request.
defendant is unable to distinguish the facts in the present case from the facts in buchwald and attempts to argue that buchwald is no longer good law and has been overruled by styne.however,the styne opinion repeatedly cites buchwald.defendant relies on footnote in styne in support of the argument that buchwald has been overruled.styne at footnote states that the talent agencies act specifically allows parties to provide in their contract that disputes thereunder shall be resolved by private arbitration,rather than by the commissioner.nothing in our reasoning restricts this right.sty
