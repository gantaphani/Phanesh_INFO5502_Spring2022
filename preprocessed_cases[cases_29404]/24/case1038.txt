software,appeals the district court decision compelling arbitration,in ohio,of a dispute arising under a software licensing agreement.before reaching the merits of this appeal,we must address two potential problems with the district court jurisdiction.first,we conclude the district court had subject matter jurisdiction based upon the federal question presented by claim asserted under the copyright act.in reaching this conclusion,we adopt the second circuit analysis for distinguishing between claims alleging breach of a contract involving copyrighted matters and those asserting an actual controversy under the federal copyright act.second,although this court has previously held,in ansari qwest communications,cir,that a district court does not have the authority under the federal arbitration act faa,to compel arbitration in another district,this was not a jurisdictional prerequisite,but was instead a venue requirement that the parties have waived in this case.reaching the merits,we affirm the district court decision to compel arbitration.

whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction.
federal courts have an independent obligation to determine whether jurisdiction exists,even in the absence of a challenge from any party,and thus a court may sua sponte raise the question of whether there is subject matter jurisdiction at any stage in the litigation.arbaugh y h,d.while the parties in this case never questioned the federal courts subject matter jurisdiction over this action,the district court itself raised its own concern about it,but ultimately concluded it did have subject matter jurisdiction.see software,d at.after considering the issue,we agree.

this court reviews de novo whether subject matter jurisdiction is proper in this case.australian gold,hatfield,cir.
in its complaint,invoked the federal courts subject matter jurisdiction under,which provides that t he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states and a,which further provides that t he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to patents,plant variety protection,copyrights and trademarks.such jurisdiction shall be exclusive of the courts of the states in patent,plant variety protection and copyright cases.emphasis added.because the only claim alleged was its claim under the copyright act,the district court subject matter jurisdiction rests solely on that claim the district court concern with its jurisdiction was that,while pled a claim under the copyright act,that claim was based upon allegations implicating the parties and agreements.if copyright claim was actually a claim that just happened to involve copyrighted material,then it would not be sufficient to invoke the district court subject matter jurisdiction.see software,d at.nevertheless,the district court concluded that it had subject matter jurisdiction in this case because had,in its complaint,requested a remedy expressly provided under the copyright act.id.in reaching this conclusion,the district court relied on second circuit authority.see id.citing bassett mashantucket pequot tribe,cir,and harms eliscu,cir.we agree with that authority and take this opportunity to adopt the second circuit analytical approach.
the second circuit has set forth t he most frequently cited test for determining whether an action arises under the copyright act.adcom group,cir.it is that not every complaint that refers to the copyright act arises under that law for purposes of a.bassett,at quoting a.in particular,the federal grant of a copyright has not been thought to infuse with any national interest a dispute as to ownership or contractual enforcement turning on the facts or on ordinary principles of contract law.id.quotations,alteration omitted.
whether a complaint asserting factually related copyright and contract claims arises under the federal copyright laws for the purposes of section a poses among the knottiest procedural problems in copyright jurisprudence.melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright a,at such claims characteristically arise where the defendant held a license to exploit the plaintiff copyright,but is alleged to have forfeited the license by breaching the terms of the licensing contract and thus to infringe in any further exploitation.
district courts in the second circuit had previously sought to 
resolve the issue of jurisdiction under section for hybrid claims raising both copyright and contract issues by attempting to discern whether the copyright issues constituted the essence of the dispute,or whether instead the copyright issues were incidental to the contract dispute.
that approach,however,left a class of plaintiffs who suffered copyright infringement bereft of copyright remedies.plaintiffs whose federal lawsuits were dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that their copyright claims were incidental to their contract claims had no way either to obtain an adjudication of infringement or to obtain relief provided by the copyright act,because the act confers exclusive jurisdiction over copyright claims on federal courts.such plaintiffs would be deprived of the injunctive relief,impoundment remedies,statutory damages,and attorneys fees provided by the copyright act.that approach had the added defect of requiring a federal court to make findings at the outset of the litigation that could not be discerned from the complaint but instead required a deep understanding of the dispute not usually gained until the case had been heard at trial.
id.at citations omitted.
the second circuit solution to this jurisdictional problem was to establish a test that focused on whether and how a complaint implicates the copyright act.id.at.thus,the analysis turns on what is alleged on the face of the complaint.id.at.applying that test,a suit arises under the copyright act if the complaint is for a remedy expressly granted by the act,a suit for infringement or,the complaint asserts a claim requiring construction of the act.id.at quotations,alterations omitted see also id.at.this test is essentially a reiteration of the complaint rule that federal jurisdiction exists only when a federal question is presented on the face of a properly pleaded complaint.scholastic entm t,at.
we join a number of other circuits in adopting the second circuit approach to this difficult jurisdictional issue see bassett,at citing authority see also scandinavian satellite prime tv,also adopting second circuit analytical approach.
applying the second circuit test to this case,it is clear that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over copyright claim under a,in its complaint,specifically alleged a claim under the copyright act for copyright infringement,see,and sought actual damages and profits or,in the alternative,statutory damages,as well as costs and attorney fees specifically provided for under the copyright act,see id.based upon those allegations,the district court properly concluded that it had subject matter jurisdiction over copyright claim.see bassett,at holding federal court had subject matter jurisdiction because plaintiff had alleged copyright infringement and sought injunctive remedy provided for by the copyright act see also mca television,at holding federal court had subject matter jurisdiction over copyright infringement claim seeking preliminary injunction and damages provided for by the copyright act rano,at holding federal court had subject matter jurisdiction over claim seeking injunction,impoundment,damages and profits,and attorney fees provided for under copyright act arthur young,at holding federal court had subject matter jurisdiction over claim alleging copyright infringement and seeking damages and injunctive relief under copyright act vestron,at holding federal court had subject matter jurisdiction over claim for copyright infringement seeking an injunction,damages and profits,costs and attorney fees under copyright act.
whether the colorado district court could compel arbitration in ohio.
this case presents a second possible jurisdictional problem.in ansari,we held that a district court does not have authority to compel arbitration in another district see at.yet,in this case,the colorado district court granted reynolds motion to compel arbitration in ohio.at the time,neither party questioned the district court authority to do so the question presented by this appeal,then,is whether the rule announced in ansari is jurisdictional that is,whether the district court was without any power to adjudicate reynolds motion to compel arbitration.we conclude that ansari did not state a jurisdictional prerequisite rather,ansari rule is one of venue which the parties in this case have waived by not raising the issue before the district court see harris capital fund,llc grillo,cir unpublished treating ansari as addressing venue.
standard of review 
we review this possible jurisdictional problem de novo.see huerta gonzales,cir noting we review issues of jurisdiction de novo.
ansari based its decision that a district court did not have the authority to compel arbitration in another district on the language of.see ansari,at.section addresses motions to enforce arbitration agreements by compelling arbitration and specifically provides that t he hearing and proceedings,under such agreement to arbitrate,shall be within the district in which the petition for an order directing such arbitration is filed.other circuits have referred to this language in as a venue provision.see dumont saskatchewan gov t,cir doctor,stuart,cir merrill lynch,pierce,fenner,smith,lauer,cir int l,antilles car rentals,cir farr cia.intercontinental de navegacion de cuba,cir see also john hinchey thomas burch,the effect of clauses on a district court power to compel arbitration,disp.resol,venue of motion to compel,disp.resol.most relevant to this case,the third and seventh circuits specifically referred to as a venue provision even as they held that under mandatory language,a district court could not compel arbitration in another district.see lauer,at int l,at.
and courts have analogously treated other,similar faa provisions as venue requirements.in cortez byrd chips,bill harbert construction,d,for example,the supreme court specifically addressed as venue provisions.id.at.like,specify in which court certain arbitration proceedings under the faa should take place in cortez byrd chips,the supreme court held that were permissive rather than restrictive venue provisions.see at.although this court,in ansari,distinguished the permissive venue provisions at issue in cortez byrd chips,from,which instead uses mandatory language,see ansari,at,that distinction does not make any less a venue provision.
congress has established general venue statutes in charles alan wright,et,federal practice and procedure see also id.moore federal practice a ed.in addition,however,congress has also created special venue statutes.see charles alan wright,et,federal practice procedure.a special venue statute,expressly covering venue of a particular kind of action,will control over the general venue statutes,but provisions in the general statutes are read as supplementing the special statute in the absence of contrary restrictive indications in the special statute.id.emphasis added footnotes omitted see also id.moore federal practice b referring to restrictive venue provisions as exclusive.it may be that mandatory language makes it a restrictive rather than a permissive venue provision.see cortez byrd chips,at.discussing distinction between permissive and restrictive venue provisions in concluding are permissive venue provisions ansari,at.however,parties can waive objections under restrictive venue provisions,just as they can under general venue provisions.see radzanower touche ross,d noting i t has long been settled that the restrictive venue provisions of the national bank act,can be waived by a defendant bank interstate commerce comm atl.coast line,d noting waiver applied to interstate commerce act restrictive venue provisions am.chem.paint dow chem,cir addressing whether parties had waived objection to venue under,providing for exclusive venue in patent infringement cases luper capital conveyor in re lee way holding,noting e ven restrictive venue provisions can be waived see also charles alan wright,et,federal practice and procedure noting party can waive venue provided by restrictive,as well as general,venue provisions.
further,treating these faa provisions as venue provisions makes sense in light of the fact that the faa does not itself confer subject matter jurisdiction.see moses cone mem l,at.nukem,at.and in fact,an earlier provision of addresses the need for a jurisdictional basis independent of the faa,indicating that a party seeking to compel arbitration may do so in any united states district court which,save for such arbitration agreement,would have jurisdiction under title,in a civil action or in admiralty of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the parties.finally,serves the purposes venue statutes traditionally serve that is,it refers to locality,the place where a lawsuit should be heard.charles alan wright,federal practice procedure.
for these reasons,we conclude that ansari holding that a district court does not have authority to compel arbitration in another district is a statement addressing venue under the faa and the parties in this case have waived any objection to venue because they failed to raise the issue in the district court.see generally stjernholm peterson,cir noting parties can waive objection to venue by failing to raise the issue in timely manner before district court charles alan wright,et,federal practice procedure.

in this case,and reynolds agreed to arbitrate any dispute that occurs between the parties arising out of or related to the agreement or its negotiation,execution or performance,whether such dispute is in contract,tort or otherwise.in substance,through the licensing agreement,granted reynolds 
a perpetual,fully,worldwide right and license

on a basis in the automotive industry and automotive after market including manufacturers,body shops,and parts suppliers,and to other businesses under common control with an automotive sublicensee and

the agreement also anticipated that reynolds could obtain updated software in the future.along these lines,agreed that in the future it would provide to reynolds,at no cost to reynolds,all updates,upgrades and enhancements to the software,so that reynolds may evaluate whether it is appropriate to make each such upgrade or enhancement generally available to its customers.if reynolds chose to do so,it could then purchase those upgrades.
subsequent updates,upgrades,enhancements and new products provided by isi will be made available to reynolds and become a part of the isi software and documentation,provided the fees which may be no greater than fees payable by other dealers,distributors or resellers of the isi software are agreed upon by the parties at that time.
two years later,in april,reynolds obtained updated software,release,as part of the parties maintenance agreement for the software had previously sold reynolds through the agreement.the agreement provided that,in exchange for reynolds payment of an annual maintenance charge of plus a subscription fee for each licensee,would provide subscription and maintenance service which includes revisions,updates and enhancements,repair of warranty defects,new versions and releases of the software,and continuing education covering the software.
the agreement did not contain an arbitration clause.but it did include a merger clause providing that t his agreement is the exclusive statement of the entire agreement between and reynolds and supersedes all prior oral or written representations or agreements between the parties,except the software licensing agreement dated may,between information solutions,and reynolds,as to the subject matter hereof.emphasis added.
the agreement further provided that either party could terminate the annual maintenance agreement after giving the other party ninety days notice.after reynolds notified that it was electing to terminate that agreement effective april,asserted that reynolds would no longer have any license to use release software.reynolds,on the other hand,argued that it retained a license to use that updated software because release had been incorporated into the agreement perpetual license.that dispute underlies this litigation.
the specific question presented to the district court by reynolds motion to compel arbitration,then,was whether this dispute arose out of or was related to the agreement and was thus subject to that agreement arbitration provision.in concluding that this dispute did arise out of or was related to the agreement,the district court recognized that that agreement not only granted reynolds a perpetual license in the earlier version of software,but it also specifically provided for the possibility that reynolds would acquire later updated versions of the software from the agreement section provides that s ubsequent updates,upgrades,enhancements and new products provided by will be made available to reynolds and become a part of the isi software provided fees are agreed upon by the parties at that time.software,d at quotations omitted.the district court then noted that there were several plausible interpretations of the relationship between the parties and agreements.first,as argued,the agreement could be a licensing agreement for release that was completely separate from the perpetual licensing agreement.see id.at.if so,the license terminated when reynolds chose to terminate the maintenance agreement.see id.second,as reynolds argued,through the agreement section,the updated release that it obtained from through the agreement might have become part of the isi software for which reynolds had a perpetual license under the licensing agreement.if so,the maintenance agreement might be just maintenance agreement whose later termination had no effect on the perpetual license,which included release.see id.or the agreement might have established the fees reynolds had agreed to pay for the updated release,which again had been incorporated into the original licensing agreement perpetual license.see id.at.acknowledging these plausible arguments,the district court concluded that,because reynolds the license to use the updated release software fell within the agreement and therefore had been incorporated into the original agreement perpetual merit,the dispute underlying this litigation arose under that agreement and was thus subject to arbitration.see id.at.we can not improve on the district court analysis in light of the strong presumption of arbitrability,we agree fully with the district court decision.
in challenging the district court decision on appeal,relies almost exclusively on this court decision in riley manufacturing anchor glass container,cir.but riley does not require a different result 
in riley,this court addressed a situation involving two agreements between the same parties,the first containing a provision requiring arbitration and the second one without any arbitration provision.see id.at.these agreements were between riley manufacturing riley,a company that produced sun tea jars with copyrighted ornamental designs stenciled on them,and anchor glass container anchor,riley glass jar supplier.id.at.in,riley and anchor entered into a manufacturing and distribution agreement manufacturing agreement under which riley agreed to provide all of anchor needs for sun tea jars and anchor agreed to use reasonable efforts to market riley sun tea products.id.quotations omitted.
that manufacturing agreement expired in.see id.at.in,riley threatened to sue anchor for copyright infringement after it purportedly discovered that anchor was still using riley copyrighted designs.see id.the parties then entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the copyright dispute.see id.that settlement agreement provided,among other things,that the parties waived any and all claims either party now has or could ever have or become entitled to,which might arise under the manufacturing agreement.id.quotations omitted.the settlement agreement also include d a series of provisions designed to reestablish a manufacturing relationship between riley and anchor,as well as a merger clause that indicated that the settlement agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto and cancels,terminates and supersedes any and all prior representations and agreements relating to the subject matter thereof.id.at quotations omitted.this settlement agreement had no arbitration provision.see id.
eight months after entering into the settlement agreement,riley again purportedly discovered that anchor was selling sun tea jars with riley copyrighted designs.see id.this time,riley sued anchor,alleging,inter alia,copyright and claims.see id.in response,anchor asserted that the original manufacturing agreement required the parties to arbitrate this dispute.see id.at.the district court disagreed and denied anchor motion to compel arbitration.see id.at.
on appeal,this court reversed.see id.at.in doing so,we concluded that the merger clause in the later settlement agreement,which provided that the settlement agreement cancels,terminates and supersedes any and all prior representations and agreements relating to the subject matter thereof,id.at emphasis added,did revoke the prior right of the parties to demand arbitration under the manufacturing agreement,but only as to the specific subject matter of that later settlement agreement,id.at.the parties would retain the right to arbitrate any dispute under the manufacturing agreement that was not considered part of the subject matter of the later settlement agreement see id.
riley is clearly distinguishable from this case.first,while the original agreement in riley had expired by its own terms,the original licensing agreement in this case between and reynolds expressly continues in effect.the parties do not dispute this.moreover,although both the later agreement in riley and the agreement at issue in this case had merger provisions,those provisions are completely different.in riley,the parties merger provision cancels,terminates and supersedes any and all prior representations and agreements relating to the subject matter thereof.id.at.the merger clause in this case,on the other hand,specifically excepted and reynolds original contract t his agreement is the exclusive statement of the entire agreement between and reynolds and supersedes all prior oral or written representations or agreements between the parties,except the software licensing agreement dated may,between information solutions,and reynolds,as the subject matter hereof.emphasis added.riley,then,does not support challenge to the district court decision to compel arbitration in this case.
iii.conclusion 
for these reasons,we affirm the district court decision.
like the district court,we rely on the undisputed allegations of the parties for these background facts.
the agreement was between,its parent company,information software,isi,and reynolds.the agreement references to isi included both isi and.
the faa provides that i f any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of the united states upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration,the court in which such suit is pending,upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration under such an agreement,shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement,providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration.as explained in greater detail below,sets forth the procedures by which a party can seek to enforce an agreement to arbitrate.
a provides that a n appeal may be taken from a final decision with respect to an arbitration that is subject to this title.
a case arises under federal law within the meaning of if a complaint establishes either that federal law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.empire healthchoice assurance,mcveigh,d alteration,quotations omitted.
although the district court indicated also asserted the district court had subject matter jurisdiction based on diversity,see software,d at,that can not be the case because the parties are not and the auto dealers sued are colorado corporations.see a,c see also radil sanborn camps,cir noting that,to establish subject matter jurisdiction under,a party must show that compete diversity of citizenship exists between the parties and that the amount in controversy exceeds.also asserted a claim,but it did so under colorado law.the district court would have had supplemental jurisdiction to consider this colorado law claim,see,only if it had subject matter jurisdiction in the first place.see nicodemus union pac,cir noting that,under,i f any one claim within plaintiffs complaint supports federal question jurisdiction,a federal court may assert jurisdiction over all the claims,including any alleged claims,arising from the same core of operative facts.so the question of whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to consider action turns solely on claim asserted under the federal copyright,although reynolds,as a defendant,later invoked the federal arbitration act,that act itself does not confer federal jurisdiction over a proceeding.see moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d energy nukem,cir federal procedure.see also charles alan wright,et,federal practice and procedure ed.rather,there must still be an independent basis for the district court subject matter jurisdiction.see moses cone mem l,at.see also federal procedure.wright,et,federal practice procedure.
in the same vein,the ninth circuit has noted that,although t he federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to copyrights,it is well established that just because a case involves a copyright does not mean that federal subject matter jurisdiction exists.federal courts have consistently dismissed complaints in copyright cases presenting only questions of contract law.as a result,the federal courts walk a fine line between usurping the power of the state courts and providing redress for copyright infringement.this balancing act is further complicated by the interdependence of contract and copyright claims,which can camouflage the genuine issues to be entm t,fox entm t group,cir quoting citations omitted see also charles alan wright,et,federal practice procedure a suit on a contract does not arise under the copyright laws even though a copyright may have been the subject matter of the contract.most disputes about ownership of a copyright do not arise under the copyright laws for purposes of jurisdiction,although there can be a different result if the case raises an important issue of interpretation of the copyright act.footnotes omitted.
the second circuit noted that jurisdiction might also exist,perhaps more doubtfully,in a third category of case,where a distinctive policy of the copyright act requires that federal principles control the disposition of the claim.bassett,at quoting harms,at see also scholastic entm t,at stating second circuit rule to require the district court to exercise jurisdiction if the complaint asks for a remedy expressly granted by the copyright act the complaint requires an interpretation of the copyright act or federal principles should control the claims.
in an analogous situation,this court,in ausherman stump,cir,previously held that federal courts did not have jurisdiction under a over a suit brought on a contract involving patents.at.in reaching that conclusion,this court focused on the complaint as pled,noting that the complaint does not set forth a valid patent infringement claim,despite the fact that ausherman had liberally sprinkled the word infringement throughout his pleadings.id.the approach this court took in ausherman is consistent with the second circuit test we no
