this appeal represents one part of a larger dispute between global naps,a competitive local exchange carrier clec,and verizon new england,an incumbent local exchange carrier ilec,in their attempt to reach an interconnection agreement under the telecommunications act of tca,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of.the tca sets up detailed procedures for the creation of interconnection agreements in order to serve the tca goal of fostering competition in local telephone markets.those procedures allow competing carriers to gain access to the incumbent carrier telecommunications network and facilities and govern the terms and fees of that access.
global naps appeals from the district court judgment affirming a february,order of the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy dte,the state commission given the power to arbitrate disputes over interconnection agreements under the tca.b.the february,administrative order followed an earlier december,dte order deciding the arbitration between verizon and global naps.that arbitration had been initiated by global naps after a period of negotiation with verizon failed to produce an agreement on all issues.
the challenged february order allowed a remedial motion by verizon to force global naps to sign an interconnection agreement consistent with the terms of the dte earlier december arbitration order.verizon brought this motion because global naps had balked at the december arbitration order,said it was not bound by the result of the arbitration,and that it was instead exercising what it thought was its unconditional right under i of the act to adopt the terms of an interconnection agreement verizon had with sprint,which preexisted global naps arbitration request.
the merits of the underlying december arbitration order from the dte are not before us.the merits issue before us is whether in its february order the dte acted in violation of i of the tca in precluding global naps from nullifying and avoiding the effect of the binds global naps and verizon to an instead opting into the terms of an older agreement verizon had signed with sprint.if global naps were free to so opt in,that would moot the challenge to the underlying december arbitration order.we find that the dte february order was not in violation of the tca and affirm the district court.
before the passage of the tca,local telephone service was provided mainly by monopolies,such as verizon.these monopolies,the ilecs,owned all networks and facilities including telephone lines,poles,trunks,attendant to the provision of local telephone service.see at t iowa utils,d.a purpose of the tca was to end the local telephone monopolies and create a national telecommunications policy that strongly favored competition in local telephone markets.see.telecomm.regulatory bd.of,cir.
section of the tca imposes obligations on both competing carriers and incumbent carriers.section a imposes a duty on all carriers to interconnect directly or indirectly with the facilities and equipment of other telecommunications carriers.a.the tca imposes on an incumbent carrier more stringent duties,including the duty to permit other carriers to interconnect with its facilities,to provide other carriers with access to elements of its local network on an unbundled basis,to sell to other carriers at wholesale prices the services that it provides to its customers,and to negotiate interconnection agreements in good faith,at see c.
section provides the procedures for the creation of interconnection agreements interconnection agreements govern the terms and conditions by which clecs may gain access to the ilecs local telephone network and facilities,thus allowing the clecs to provide competing local telephone service.incumbents and competitors may negotiate freely an interconnection agreement,and both parties have a duty to negotiate in good faith.c.if the parties reach an agreement through negotiation,that agreement need not satisfy the substantive requirements of b and c.id.a.if after a period of negotiation the parties are not able to come to an agreement on some issues,either party may petition a state commission to decide those open issues in arbitration.id.b.the commission then has the authority to decide the open issues between the parties,and to impose conditions on the parties for the implementation of the terms of arbitration into an agreement.id.b c.in deciding those issues,the commission must ensure that such resolution and conditions meet the requirements of section of this title,including the regulations prescribed by the federal communications commission pursuant to section.id.c.further,either party refusal to negotiate or to cooperate with the state commission acting as arbitrator constitutes a breach of its duty to negotiate in good faith.id.b.
in addition,the tca requires ilecs to allow any requesting clec to adopt the terms and conditions of any interconnection agreement it has with any other clec,provided that agreement has been approved by the requisite state telecommunications commission.id.i.
once a negotiated or arbitrated agreement is completed,it must be submitted to the state commission for approval.id.e.the commission may reject any negotiated agreement if it discriminates against a third party carrier or if its implementation is not consistent with the public interest,convenience,and necessity.id.e a.the commission may reject an arbitrated agreement if it fails to meet the substantive requirements of,including the fcc implementing regulations,or the pricing standards set forth in d.id.e b.that commission decision is subject to federal judicial review 
in any case in which a state commission makes a determination under this section,any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of section of this title and this section.
verizon and global naps began the negotiation process for a new interconnection agreement in early,because their previous agreement was approaching expiration.on july,global naps filed a petition with the dte to arbitrate several issues on which the parties could not agree.the dte issued an order on december,resolving all open issues and ordering the parties to incorporate the arbitrated terms into an agreement and file that agreement with the dte within days,or by january.the dte allowed the parties joint motion for extension of time to file the agreement until january.
on december,global naps brought an action in federal district court challenging the merits of the dte arbitration determination the merits of that december,dte order are not before us.
on january,global naps informed verizon that,rather than entering into the agreement embodying the dte arbitration decision,it would seek to adopt the terms of a preexisting december,agreement verizon had with sprint sprint agreement.global naps contended that it has an unconditional right to do so pursuant to i.global naps said its adoption of the preexisting sprint agreement was consistent with the arbitration order,under which global naps retained its i rights.
on january,global naps informed the dte of its intention to opt into the sprint agreement,in place of the arbitrated agreement.in response,on january,verizon filed a motion with the dte to approve the arbitration order,seeking,in essence,to force global naps to execute an agreement consistent with the arbitration order,or alternatively,should the dte allow global naps to opt into the sprint agreement,to order that the agreement be modified to reflect the dte legal and policy determinations set forth in the arbitration order.
on february,the dte granted the initial portion of verizon motion and ordered the parties to sign and file an agreement consistent with the initial arbitration order.that february,order is the subject of this appeal.all parties agree that this order left global naps free to challenge the substance of the december,arbitration order.
in the february order,the dte rejected global naps claim that it retained the unconditional right to opt into the sprint agreement even after the dte issued its arbitration order.the dte first held that a final arbitration order pursuant to b is binding on both parties noting that it had always required that arbitration be binding on both parties.it held that its rule that arbitrations be binding on both parties was consistent with fcc regulation.see h.further,the dte noted that the fcc local competition order,which embodies the fcc initial interpretation of the statute,stated that the states may consider the fcc rules when implementing their own standards for arbitration.see local competition order,wl.
further,the dte held that since the arbitration order directed the parties to file an agreement containing the arbitrated terms,and provided no alternatives,global naps attempt to opt into the sprint agreement was in violation of that earlier order.the dte held that t he i adoption process permits a clec,during the negotiation process,to opt into another carrier contract,not to do so after a decision has been reached through arbitration.
it also noted that global naps interpretation of the tca was contrary to public policy,as it would allow carriers to game the system by always attempting to arbitrate,and if unhappy with the results,merely to opt into an existing agreement the dte ordered the parties to file an agreement consistent with the initial arbitration order within seven days.the parties signed and entered an agreement consistent with the court ruling,under global naps protest.the dte did not,contrary to global naps assertion,hold that a party to an arbitrated agreement can never exercise rights under i.it also did not,contrary to verizon assertion,hold that a party subject to a valid arbitration order could never,under i,take advantage of terms in a previously available agreement.
on march,global naps filed a second action in district court,this time challenging the dte february order.
on march,all parties to the second litigation global naps,verizon,and the dte filed a joint motion to consolidate global naps two actions.in that motion,the parties proposed that the district court rule on global naps challenge of the dte february global naps is permitted to opt into the sprint to ruling on its challenge to the dte underlying arbitration merits of the arbitration agreement.the district court granted the motion and accepted the parties briefing schedule,under which the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment in the first action on the issue whether i would permit global naps to opt into the sprint agreement despite the existence of the dte arbitration order to the contrary.the district court granted verizon and the dte motions for summary judgment,and denied global naps motion.global naps timely appealed.
appellate jurisdiction 
the parties agree the federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction to review state agency determinations under the tca for compliance with federal law,pursuant to.verizon,public serv.comm of,d.see also,e.
verizon initially argues that this court lacks appellate jurisdiction to hear global naps appeal due to the lack of a final judgment under and lack of standing in global naps.the dte does not join verizon in arguing lack of appellate jurisdiction or lack of standing,but briefs the case on the merits.
verizon argues that the district court ruling was not a final judgment because global naps two actions were consolidated,thus rendering them one case,and the grant of summary judgment disposed of only one of the two consolidated cases.this argument is without merit.the disposition of one case in a consolidated action is a final and appealable judgment unless the cases were consolidated for all purposes.see bay state hmo management,tingley,cir.in moving to consolidate these cases,the parties expressly requested that the district court review the february,dte order before proceeding with its review of the december,order,and the district court agreed to do so review of the merits of the december,arbitration order was,in essence,stayed pending the court determination of the challenge to the second dte order the parties proposed completely separate briefing schedules for the review of the two consolidated cases.verizon claim that the cases were consolidated for all purposes is wrong and verizon last minute assertion is inconsistent with how it presented its case in the trial court.
these circumstances bring the case squarely within the bounds of in re massachusetts helicopter airlines,cir.there,this court determined that the claims in a consolidated action remained separate,and therefore a rule b determination was not required for appellate jurisdiction to be proper,because e xcept for the consolidation of the cases for the convenience of and trial procedure,the cases maintained their separate identities throughout the litigation.separate judgments were entered in each of the five cases.id.at.we found this to be consistent with the theory behind consolidation,which was a procedural mechanism meant to serve the purposes of judicial economy and convenience of the parties,as here,but not to alter the substantial rights the parties had in the separate actions id.
verizon relies on a notation in the district court docket from the clerk of court that the second complaint,the present case,was consolidated for all future proceedings,and that this removes it from the massachusetts helicopter rule.see bay state hmo management,tingley.the reality of the situation is that the consolidation was for purposes of convenience and efficiency.
verizon also urges us to overrule massachusetts helicopter in favor of the ninth circuit rule in huene united states,cir,also followed in trinity broad.eller,cir and spraytex,homax.the advantage,it says,of the ninth circuit rule is that it provides a bright ruling in a consolidated case may be appealed until there is an ultimate final judgment on all matters.that is true.the disadvantage of the rule is that it may cause injustice on particular facts,and the rule acts as a disincentive which may prevent consolidation for purely pragmatic reasons of convenience and efficiency.
in any event,our adherence to the massachusetts helicopter rule was reaffirmed more recently in bay state hmo management,at.as a panel,we are not free to overrule circuit precedent.the district court grant of summary judgment is a final order within the meaning of.
verizon challenge to global naps standing to pursue an appeal is also without merit.verizon claim of lack of standing seems to be predicated on the notion that,if global naps is allowed to opt into the sprint agreement,the dte will construe the sprint agreement in a manner consistent with the terms of the arbitration order,and thus global naps will be no better off.
global naps disagrees,and recites injury to itself.further,verizon position is contrary to its position below in several respects.among them is that verizon requested from the dte that,should the dte allow global naps to adopt the sprint agreement,then the agreement be modified to adopt legal and policy determinations made in the arbitration order.if the sprint agreement were not materially different from the challenged agreement,such modification would not be necessary.indeed,global naps would not be trying to join the sprint agreement.further,the possibility that the dte might construe the sprint agreement consistently with the december arbitration order,and that doing so would be upheld against a likely challenge,is insufficient to render global naps without standing in this case.we reject the lack of standing argument.
interpretation of the tca i 
the precise legal question under review is narrow,though one of first impression in the circuit courts of appeals does a competing carrier have an unconditional right,under i of the tca,to avoid the terms of a final arbitration order from a state telecommunications commission,adjudicating a dispute between the clec and ilec,by seeking to opt into the terms of a previous interconnection agreement that the ilec has with another clec this is an issue of federal statutory interpretation of the tca we agree with the dte and the district court that the tca grants no such right.
standard of review 
this circuit has not previously articulated precisely the standard of judicial review of state agency determinations under the tca.issues of law,as here,are subject to de novo review.telecomm.regulatory bd.of,cir,and we apply that standard to state agency determinations under the tca 
in interpreting a statute,we begin with the text.bedroc united states,d.section i states 
a local exchange carrier shall make available any interconnection,service,or network element provided under an agreement approved under this section to which it is a party to any other requesting telecommunications carrier upon the same terms and conditions as those provided in the agreement.
i.in urging the court to hold that i gives it an unconditional right to avoid the terms of an arbitration order and opt into a previously available agreement,global naps points out that the text of i does not state expressly when and under what circumstances the incumbent must make interconnection agreements available to other competitors.from this silence,global naps argues it is free to opt in at any time it chooses.but i does not expressly state what global naps reads it to mean either.at best,i is ambiguous on the subject,if that section is read alone.the absence of an express statement in i does not end the matter the section must be read in light of the structure and intent of the statute.global naps broad reading of i is incorrect,because that reading brings i,under the circumstances of this case,into direct conflict with,and in important aspects negates,several other sections of the tca.
global naps reading is inconsistent with the basic arbitral power vested in the state commission.section b,entitled agreements arrived at through compulsory arbitration,allows for either party to an interconnection agreement to petition a state commission for arbitration of open issues,and grants powers to the state commission to carry out the arbitration.id.b.
global naps reading is also inconsistent with the power of state commissions to make their arbitral decisions binding on both parties.section b c requires the state commission to resolve each issue set forth in the petition and the response,if any,by imposing appropriate conditions as required to implement subsection c of this section upon the parties to the agreement.id.b c.in turn,subsection c,among other things,states that a state commission shall provide a schedule for implementation of the terms and conditions by the parties to the agreement.id.c.by allowing the commission acting as arbitrator to place conditions on both parties for the implementation of interconnection agreements,it is clear that b c intends for arbitration orders to be binding on both parties.
global naps responds that arbitration orders are not binding because generally under the tca,the obligations on clecs are not equal to or reciprocal with those on ilecs and so arbitration decisions are equally asymmetrical in their results.global naps also makes a broader argument that the fcc regulations,and the tca generally,create asymmetrical rights and obligations on competitors and incumbents,and those greatly tip the scale in favor of competitors.it argues that under incumbents are required to enter into interconnection agreements,but competitors are not.thus global naps argues that,to the extent there is ambiguity as to the scope of i,it should be construed broadly in favor of competitors and against the incumbent,consistent with the asymmetry created by the statute and regulations as a whole.
this argument,however,ignores the important fact that b is not one of the areas of the tca that creates asymmetrical obligations on the parties.section b allows either party to the negotiation to petition for arbitration.section b allows the state commission to impose conditions on both parties in order to carry out the arbitration.and b creates a duty for both parties to cooperate with the arbitration at the risk of breaching the duty both parties have,under a,to negotiate in good faith.there is no basis for global naps reading i as somehow turning the parallel obligations that run throughout b into merely obligations.
further,global naps reading is in conflict with the statutory duties of good faith and cooperation with the commission as arbitrator.the tca,at b,states 
the refusal of any other party to the negotiation to participate further in the negotiations,to cooperate with the state commission in carrying out its function as an arbitrator,or to continue to negotiate in good faith in the presence,or with the assistance,of the state commission shall be considered a failure to negotiate in good faith.
id.b.in attempting to void the terms of a valid arbitration order,it is clear that global naps is refusing to cooperate with the dte,in violation of its duty to negotiate in good faith 
global naps responds by asking the court to read an implicit limitation on the good faith requirement of b that clecs are not bound by the terms of b if they attempt to opt into a previously available contract.global naps says that this is the effect of i.but i says nothing of the sort.rather,it is written in terms of an obligation on the part of ilecs to make agreements available to potential clecs,not as an unconditional right on the part of clecs to modify their clear obligations under earlier subsections of.we read the sections consistently,and conclude that i is not an implicit limit on the binding effect of the arbitration provisions of b.in this context,there is nothing ambiguous about the terms of b c and b.
global naps argument is also inconsistent with the judicial review provisions in the tca,for determinations made by a state commission 
in any case in which a state commission makes a determination under this section,any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an action in an appropriate federal district court to determine whether the agreement or statement meets the requirements of section of this title and this section.
e.if any party aggrieved by a determination feels the arbitral determination is contrary to the tca,its remedy is through judicial review,not.
in addition to our reading of the statutory sections,there is another source of law to consider fcc regulations interpreting the statutory sections at issue,albeit on different points.the fcc interpretation is relevant in two senses.first,under c,the dte itself must ensure that such resolution and conditions meet the requirements of section of this title,including the regulations prescribed by the commission pursuant to section.id.c.second,to the extent there is ambiguity in the statute,present here in i but not in b c and b,deference is due to the fcc reasonable interpretation.chevron,natural res.def.council,d 
the fcc has not interpreted the statute on the precise question before us.that is not surprising,since the issue is one of the power of a state commission.the tca is an interwoven whole and the fcc interpretation of related strands of the weaving is relevant,at least by analogy.
both sides cite to the fcc regulation interpreting i,found at,in support of their interpretation of the statute.the regulation,b,provides two express limitations to a clec opt in rights under i an incumbent need not make available the terms of an interconnection agreement to a particular competitor if it shows that the costs of providing a service will be greater to the requesting competitor than it was to the original negotiating party,or if it shows that the provision of that service is technically infeasible.b.in addition,there is a third limitation c states that incumbents must make terms of interconnection agreements available to other competitors only for a reasonable time after their approval by the state commission.
the fcc regulation itself rejects global naps premise that i grants an unconditional right to clecs to adopt the terms of any interconnection agreement the ilec has with another clec.the obligation of ilecs to make those agreements available to other clecs is itself subject to conditions,and the restrictions are three such conditions contemplated by the regulation 
the requirement under c i
