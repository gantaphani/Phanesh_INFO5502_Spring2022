if an arbitrator withdraws from an arbitration proceeding for no stated ethical reason following evidence and argument,and offers to continue mediation efforts but refuses to render an arbitration award,does the doctrine of arbitral immunity protect the arbitrator from suit we hold that because such conduct defeats rather than serves the adjudicatory purpose of arbitration,arbitral immunity does not apply.
background 
plaintiff morgan phillips,appeals from the judgment dismissing its claims against defendants john bates,and jams,the trial court entered the judgment after sustaining defendants demurrer to morgan phillips first amended complaint without leave to amend,on the ground that morgan phillips claims are barred by the doctrine of arbitral immunity.we reverse.
morgan philips operative pleading is its first amended complaint.we set forth the facts in accordance with the standard governing demurrers we assume the truth of all facts and accept as true all facts that may be implied or inferred from the facts alleged.thaler household finance th,d.
morgan phillips,a retailer of specialty bedding products,contracted with two suppliers for mattresses and box springs made according to morgan phillips specifications.in october,after discovering that the suppliers were not manufacturing the products as specified,morgan phillips sued the suppliers.the parties retained jams and bates to mediate the dispute.in september,bates assisted the parties in reaching a settlement.the stipulation for settlement provided that d isputes regarding this matter will be submitted to bates for binding resolution.
in,morgan phillips again became dissatisfied with the suppliers products,and invoked the dispute resolution clause of the stipulation for settlement.jams and bates entered a contract with morgan phillips that was partly written,oral,and implied by law.under the contract,jams and bates agreed to conduct a binding arbitration pursuant to the dispute resolution term of the settlement agreement.
on or about september,bates held a hearing at which morgan phillips produced an actual demonstration of settlement merchandise cut open to reveal that the bedding did not conform to the requirements of the settlement agreement.after this evidence was presented,bates continued the hearing to october,and specifically informed the parties at that time that if the parties were unable to settle the dispute before the next scheduled arbitration session bates would exercise his authority as arbitrator to render a binding arbitration decision.in addition,bates specifically instructed counsel for the suppliers that at the next hearing counsel should be prepared to rebut the evidence proffered by morgan phillips and further,requested that morgan phillips prepare an updated damage study from its economic expert.bates was specifically and directly informed that morgan phillips was in severe financial distress as a result of the breach,and that there was a substantial risk that morgan phillips would be unable to continue in business if the dispute was not decided promptly.
when the arbitration reconvened on october,morgan phillips offered evidence of laboratory testing showing that the suppliers merchandise breached the settlement agreement,and also submitted an updated damage study.bates then gave the suppliers the opportunity to present evidence in their defense.when the suppliers finished,all evidence had now been submitted to bates for determination of the dispute.bates did not request that either side present any additional evidence or to prepare any written statement of the evidence or legal argument.the arbitration hearing was now concluded and the case was now ready for bates arbitration decision.
bates then separated the parties into different rooms and met with each side separately in an apparent effort to settle the case without rendering an arbitration award.over the course of next few hours,and until the lunchtime break,bates shuttled back and forth between the parties to discuss various alternative resolutions.however,as the lunchtime break was ending,bates suddenly announced,with no lawful justification,that he decided to withdraw as the arbitrator.bates thereafter failed and refused to issue a binding arbitration award.
bates conduct was part of an unlawful plan and scheme to coerce morgan phillips to settle the dispute in order to relieve bates from his duty and responsibility to enter a binding arbitration award.knowing of morgan phillips dire financial situation,bates tried to coerce morgan phillips into an unfavorable settlement by unlawfully withdrawing as the designated arbitrator,and then informing morgan phillips that he was willing to stay on and mediate the dispute,knowing full well that morgan phillips had no other alternative if it hoped to continue in business.bates acted with malice,oppression and specific intent to injure morgan phillips.
further,jams advertises to the general public that it employs arbitrators who make decisions in a timely and manner.jams fails to disclose,however,that its arbitrators secretly retain the right to abandon the arbitration for no lawful reason without rendering an award.
based on these allegations,morgan phillips alleged two causes of action against both jams and bates the sixth,for breach contract,and the seventh,for negligent breach of the duty to provide binding arbitration services.morgan phillips alleged one cause of action against jams alone the eighth,a representative action for unfair competition and false advertising,in violation of business and professions code sections and.
jams and bates demurred to the first amended complaint on several grounds,including that morgan phillips claims were barred by the doctrine of arbitral immunity.adopting that reasoning,the trial court sustained the demurrer to the sixth through eighth causes of action without leave to amend.

arbitral immunity does not bar morgan phillips claims 
as we have noted,morgan phillips alleged two causes of action against both jams and bates the sixth,for breach contract,and the seventh,for negligent breach of the duty to provide binding arbitration services.the factual core of these claims is the allegation that bates improperly withdrew from the arbitration proceeding,without cause,following evidence and argument in order to coerce a settlement,and refused to render an arbitration award.morgan philips alleged one cause of action against jams alone the eighth,for unfair competition and false advertising,in violation of business and professions code sections and.the basis of this claim is jams allegedly deceptive public representations that its affiliated arbitrators will render binding arbitration decisions.
morgan phillips contends that arbitral immunity does not bar these claims.we agree.
