puliyurumpil mathew thomas appeals the district court order granting carnival corporation motion to compel arbitration and the order denying his motion to remand this case to state court.thomas originally brought suit against carnival,his former employer which operated cruise lines in florida waters,in florida state court for damages arising from injuries he sustained in a onboard a carnival ship.he sued for negligence under the jones act count i unseaworthiness of the ship and failure to provide prompt and adequate maintenance and under general maritime law of the united states counts ii and iii,and failure to pay wages under the seaman wage act count iv 
relying on the arbitration clause of its most recent seafarer agreement with thomas in conjunction with the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards the convention,carnival filed to remove the suit to federal court and have the district court compel the parties to arbitrate.the district court granted these motions,finding that the convention applied and that the arbitration provision of the seafarer agreement was enforceable.
thomas appeals this decision and argues that it should be reversed on several grounds.first,thomas argues that the convention does not apply in this case because two of its four jurisdictional prerequisites have not been met.specifically,he argues that the requirement that any agreement to arbitrate must be in writing was not met because the governing seafarer agreement at the time of his injuries did not contain an arbitration clause.as to the convention provision that it only applies to commercial contracts,he argues that seamen employment contracts are not considered commercial contracts.
alternatively,thomas notes that even if all of the jurisdictional requirements are met,the convention provides that courts need not enforce an arbitration clause when to do so would be contrary to the public policy of that country.thomas invokes this affirmative defense,arguing that forcing him to arbitrate in a forum that would apply law constitutes a prospective waiver of his statutory rights and,thus,the arbitration clause violates public policy.
finally,thomas argues that his statutory claims based on the seaman wage act and jones act are outside the scope of the convention.he asserts that both statutes are at odds with the convention and,as more recently passed and amended statutes,they supersede all prior inconsistent treaties including the convention.
background 
thomas was employed by carnival as a head waiter on one of its cruise ships,the imagination,which flew a panamanian flag of convenience on november,thomas slipped and fell on a wet substance in the dining room,dropping a coffeepot.he injured his spine and right shoulder and burned his leg.the seafarer agreement in effect at that time did not contain any arbitration provision the old agreement.thomas received what he alleged was substandard medical care from the onboard physician,who only addressed the leg burn.due to the injuries,he was signed off the vessel soon after,but on regular vacation time rather than medical leave.during this period,he was not given any maintenance or cure payments,nor was he treated for his neck and shoulder injuries.in january of,thomas again signed on to the imagination.over the course of the next several months,thomas repeatedly visited the shipboard physician where he claims that he initially was told that he did not have injuries later was treated only with analgesic balm and pain killers and eventually was signed off the vessel,again due to injuries and again on regular vacation leave.before being signed off from the ship,there were many days thomas could not properly execute his duties because of his shoulder and neck pain,and he consequently lost pay.
on october,thomas again returned to the imagination and executed a new seafarer agreement with carnival that did contain an arbitration clause the new agreement,which specified that any disputes would be arbitrated in the philippines and resolved under panamanian law.just over two months later,in december of,the shipboard physician determined that thomas previous injuries from rendered him unfit for continuing with his duties,and he was officially discharged for good.thomas was given a medical with a payment and commenced receiving medical treatment.after his medical,he received maintenance and cure payments for approximately three months,but those ceased in april of.
discussion 
convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards 
the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,also known as the new york convention,is a treaty that requires courts of a nation state to give effect to private agreements to arbitrate and to enforce arbitration awards made in other contracting states the united states,as a signatory to the convention,enforces this treaty through chapter of the federal arbitration act faa,which incorporates the terms of the convention the convention act 
we review de novo a district court order to compel arbitration pursuant to the convention act.bautista star cruises,cir.unless there is an affirmative defense that prevents the application of the convention act,the court should compel the parties to arbitrate,providing the following jurisdictional prerequisites are met 
there is an agreement in writing to arbitrate the dispute 
the agreement provides for arbitration in the territory of a signatory of the convention 
the agreement arises out of a legal relationship,whether contractual or not,that is considered commercial and 
one party to the agreement is not a united states citizen,or the commercial relationship at issue has some reasonable relation with a foreign state.
there is no dispute that the second and fourth jurisdictional prerequisites of the convention have been met.accordingly,we first consider thomas argument that the first and third jurisdictional prerequisites have not been met and then consider his affirmative defenses.
ii.jurisdictional prerequisites of the convention 
a.the agreement must arise out of a commercial legal relationship.
thomas argues that seaman employment contracts are not commercial contracts and therefore are expressly exempt from arbitration under the convention.however,as thomas has acknowledged,we have previously held that seaman employment contracts are commercial.bautista,at.while thomas submits that this decision was wrong and should be reconsidered,we are bound by our prior precedent.accordingly,we find that this jurisdictional requirement is met.
b.there must be an agreement in writing to arbitrate the dispute.
thomas also argues that there is no agreement to arbitrate this dispute,in writing or otherwise,because the injuries that gave rise to all of his claims occurred before the new agreement containing the arbitration clause was executed.in the alternative he argues that,even if some of the claims are subject to the arbitration clause,the court erred in ordering arbitration of all his claims,which included those clearly arising out of his first term of employment while his old agreement was in effect.carnival responds that the arbitration clause governs because the suit was brought after the new agreement was signed.carnival also suggests that the arbitration clause is retroactive.
the arbitration clause at issue provides that 
any and all disputes arising out of or in connection with this agreement,including seafarer service on this vessel shall be referred to,and finally resolved by arbitration 
emphasis added.the effective date of this provision stated that 
t he employment relations between the parties shall be governed by the terms of this agreement commencing on the date the seafarer first signs on board the assigned vessel after signing this agreement october,and continuing for a period of time which shall not exceed a maximum service period of months.
thomas brought four claims carnival was negligent both in causing the accident resulting in his injuries and its immediate medical response the vessel was unseaworthy at the time of the accident he did not receive the amount of maintenance and cure due to him from his injury he has not received all the wage payments due to him from his employment.
the district court ordered arbitration,noting that plaintiff claims all arise out of his employment on the imagination and interpreting the new agreement to require arbitration of all disputes arising out of plaintiff services on the vessel.we believe the district court erred in this analysis.there is no doubt that thomas claims arose out of his employment on the imagination,but the relevant question is whether they arose out of or in connection with this new agreement,as set forth in the arbitration clause.it is not enough that the dispute simply arose from his work on the imagination,or arose after the new agreement was signed,for that matter.the disputes must have some actual relation to the new agreement,irrespective of what ship the claims originated from and when suit was brought.
as is clear from the face of thomas original complaint,his claim of negligence under the jones act count i and unseaworthiness count ii are allegations that involve only the events stemming from the in to the existence of,and with no connection to,the new agreement.he could have brought the exact same negligence and unseaworthiness claims had he never executed the new agreement or signed back on to the imagination.in fact,had thomas signed on to any vessel other than the imagination under an agreement with similar terms as the new agreement,it would be patently clear that the arbitration its language referring to disputes arising from this vessel would not apply to his negligence and unseaworthiness claims originating from the imagination.
as to the maintenance and cure claim count iii,the issue is slightly more complicated.initially the claim clearly had no connection to the new agreement because thomas was owed maintenance and cure from the moment of his injury.however,the fact that he attempted to return to work multiple times,the last attempt of which was governed by the new agreement,requires further analysis.specifically,we must address whether his return to work at any point either terminated carnival maintenance and cure obligations or created multiple maintenance and cure claims governed by different seafarer agreements.we believe it did neither.
in ascertaining the extent of the coverage of this claim,we have held that the touchstone inquiry to determine if an obligation has been terminated is whether the seaman has recovered to a condition.see brown aggie millie,cir federal maritime law does not require an injured seaman to forfeit payments of either maintenance or cure if there remains a reasonable possibility that further treatment will aid in restoring him to his condition.we have subsequently explicitly ruled that the point for maintenance and cure is not that at which the seaman recovers sufficiently to return to his old job but rather the time of maximum possible cure.lirette k b boat rentals,cir.from this record,it does not appear that thomas has reached maximum possible cure.the fact that thomas unsuccessfully attempted to return to work during his employment or signed a new contract has no bearing on his maintenance and cure claim arising from his initial injuries it did not terminate carnival existing obligations nor did it create multiple claims.accordingly,the maintenance and cure claim does not arise out of or in connection with the new agreement.
as to the seaman wage act claim count iv,the issue is the closest.this act,inter alia,provides that seamen are entitled to the balance of their wages by the earlier of hours after the cargo has been discharged or four days after the seaman himself has been discharged.f.based on the briefs,it is unclear from what period of employment thomas claims he is owed.if it is for his employment term on the ship before october,is governed by the old this also does not arise out of or in connection with the new agreement.however,to the extent he claims wages for any period of time that occurred after the new agreement was signed,that aspect of the claim may be covered under arbitration.unlike the other claims,such a component would fairly be said to be in connection with the new agreement because thomas would not have been entitled to any further wages but for signing this contract.
thus,no claim but this last meets the writing requirement of the convention,unless,as carnival argues,the arbitration clause is retroactive.however,we find that the new agreement was not intended to be retroactive such that it supersedes any previous agreements.in contract interpretation,we can glean intent not only from what is said but what is not said.the new agreement,which was quite thorough,notably did not specify that disputes arising out of or in connection with this or any previous agreement,including seafarer service on this vessel shall be referred to,and finally resolved by arbitration.we think if the parties had intended retroactivity,they would have explicitly said so.see,sandvik ab advent int l,cir before a party to a lawsuit can be ordered to arbitrate and thus be deprived of a day in court,there should be an express,unequivocal agreement to that effect.
reading the contract on its face,as we must,we are required to separate thomas claims into those that arise out of or in connection with the new agreement and those that do not.although it would be more efficient to try all claims together,the supreme court has stated that efficiency does not trump resolution in the proper forum the arbitration act requires district courts to compel arbitration of pendent arbitrable claims when one of the parties files a motion to compel,even where the result would be the possibly inefficient maintenance of separate proceedings in different forums.dean witter reynolds byrd,d.the corollary is that a court can not shoehorn pendent claims into arbitration based on its own views of economy and efficiency.id.because the jones act negligence claim,the unseaworthiness claim,the maintenance and cure claim,and part of the seaman wage act claim as it pertains to any obligations incurred before october,do not fall under the convention,they are eligible to be litigated.accordingly,the district court erred in compelling arbitration as to those claims.
however,a claim for seaman wages under thomas most recent term of employment is covered under the new agreement.thus,as to this portion of the claim,we must consider thomas affirmative defense under the convention that the enforcement of the arbitration clause should be precluded as a violation of public policy.
iii.affirmative defenses under the convention 
article v of the convention provides specific affirmative defenses to a suit that seeks a court to compel arbitration including the following 
recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award may also be refused if the competent authority in the country where recognition and enforcement is sought finds that t he recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of that country.
article v b.citing to supreme court precedent,thomas argues that the arbitration clause,which forces him to resolve any disputes in an arbitral forum that must apply law,effectuates a waiver of his statutory rights in violation of public policy and,therefore,should not be enforced both parties rely on the two cases from the supreme court that discuss the concerns expressed in this particular affirmative defense under the convention.
in mitsubishi motors soler,mitsubishi,a japanese car manufacturer,brought suit against its puerto rican distributor over a dispute related to their sales agreement and sought enforcement of the agreement arbitration clause,d.in the counterclaim,the distributor included a count alleging sherman act violations.the distributor sought to exempt this claim from the reach of the arbitration clause on the grounds that arbitration was not an appropriate forum for antitrust claims and the public interest in the statutory scheme of the sherman act would not be vindicated the court found that enforcing such an agreement in the international context would not violate public policy because the parties had agreed that american law would,in fact,be applied to the antitrust claims in the japanese arbitration proceedings.the court specifically noted that counsel for mitsubishi conceded at oral argument that american law would apply to the antitrust claims and represented that the claims had been submitted to the arbitration panel in japan on that basis.id.at.thus,statutory rights,while not being heard by a federal judge,were nonetheless not being ignored or violated but specifically protected 
to be sure,the international arbitral tribunal owes no prior allegiance to the legal norms of particular states hence,it has no direct obligation to vindicate their statutory dictates.the tribunal,however,is bound to effectuate the intentions of the parties.where the parties have agreed that the arbitral body is to decide a defined set of claims which includes,as in these cases,those arising from the application of american antitrust law,the tribunal therefore should be bound to decide that dispute in accord with the national law giving rise to the claim.and so long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate its statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum,the statute will continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function.
id.at.emphasis added.the court did,however,note that if the and clauses operated in tandem as a prospective waiver of a party right to pursue statutory remedies,we would have little hesitation in condemning the agreement as against public policy.id.at.
the agreement choice of an arbitrable forum,by itself,is not a cause for concern.as the supreme court said,statutory rights can be vindicated in arbitration as well as in court 
by agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim,a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than a judicial,forum.it trades the procedures and opportunity for review of the courtroom for the simplicity,informality,and expedition of arbitration 
mitsubishi,at.
the important question,however,is choice of law what law will apply in that arbitral forum as noted,in mitsubishi,the party seeking to compel arbitration conceded that law would apply in the arbitration of the antitrust claims there.in this case,however,there is no such assurance in either the new agreement or the representations of carnival counsel that law will apply.on the contrary,the new agreement explicitly states that panamanian law will apply.
the supreme court revisited the question of whether an international arbitration clause could violate public policy in vimar seguros y reaseguros sky reefer,which involved a dispute between a new york fruit distributor and a japanese carrier,d.the distributor had purchased oranges from a foreign supplier and contracted with the carrier to transport them to the united states by cargo ship.the fruit arrived with significant damage and the distributor sued the carrier to recover its losses.the carrier moved to stay the action and to compel arbitration in japan pursuant to the arbitration clause in the bill of lading in conjunction with the enforcement provisions of the faa the distributor argued that the arbitration clause was unenforceable under the faa because,inter alia,it would violate the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa the enactment of the hague to compel arbitration would violate public policy.specifically,it claimed that the foreign arbitrators would apply the japanese enactment of the hague rules,which would significantly lessen the carrier liability in violation of the central guarantee of cogsa.id.at.the court noted that,the relevant question,therefore,is whether the substantive law to be applied will reduce the carrier obligations to the cargo owner below what cogsa guarantees.id.it then held,
whatever the merits of petitioner comparative reading of cogsa and its japanese counterpart,its claim is premature.at this interlocutory stage it is not established what law the arbitrators will apply to petitioner claims or that petitioner will receive diminished protection as a result.the arbitrators may conclude that cogsa applies of its own force or that japanese law does not apply so that,under another clause of the bill of lading,cogsa controls.
id.at.the court again noted,however,that w ere there no subsequent opportunity for review and were we persuaded that the and clauses operated in tandem as a prospective waiver of a party right to pursue statutory remedies,we would have little hesitation in condemning the agreement as against public policy.id.quoting mitsubishi,at.
vimar presented a slightly different scenario than mitsubishi.in the latter there was no doubt that american law would apply in vimar,although at the time of the appeal,it was unknown which country laws would govern,it was possible that law might apply,and given that the proceedings were at an interlocutory stage,there would be another opportunity to review the case once the plaintiff sought enforcement of the award.in the case before us,however,it is undisputed that,regardless of the procedural posture of the case,law will never be applied in resolving the resolution of thomas claims.
the court,then,has held that arbitration clauses should be upheld if it is evident that either law definitely will be applied or if,there is a possibility that it might apply and there will be later review.the arbitration clauses that provided the bases for these holdings are in direct contradistinction to the arbitration clause in the present case,which specifies ex ante that only foreign law would apply in arbitration.there is no uncertainty as to the governing law in these proposed arbitral panamanian law will be applied.the new agreement provides 
this agreement shall be governed by,and all disputes arising under or in connection with this agreement or seafarer service on the vessel shall be resolved in accordance with,the laws of the flag of the vessel on which seafarer is assigned at the time the cause of action accrues,without regard to principles of conflicts of laws thereunder.the parties agree to this governing law,notwithstanding any claims for negligence,unseaworthiness,maintenance,cure,failure to provide prompt,proper and adequate medical care,wages,personal injury,or property damage which might be available under the laws of any other jurisdiction.
there is no dispute that the imagination flag of convenience is panamanian nor that thomas seaman wage act claim is a statutory remedy.thus,under the terms of the arbitration clause,thomas must arbitrate in the philippines under the law of panama.as the arbitrator is bound to effectuate the intent of the parties irrespective of any public policy considerations,these arbitration requirements have operated in tandem to completely bar thomas from relying on any causes of action.this inability to bring a seaman wage act claim certainly qualifies as a prospective waiver of rights,including one of a private litigant chief tools of statutory act wage penalty provision for late payments,see,mitsubishi,at.the provision wielded by the private litigant is a chief tool in the antitrust enforcement scheme,posing a crucial deterrent to potential violators.
moreover,there is no assurance of an opportunity for review of thomas seaman wage act claim.although we are at an interlocutory stage,the possibility of any later opportunity presupposes that arbitration will produce some award which the plaintiff can seek to enforce.but,in accordance with our holdings above,in this case thomas would only be arbitrating a single seaman wage act claim,one derived solely from a statutory scheme.if,applying panamanian law,thomas receives no award in the arbitral distinct possibility given the based nature of his will have nothing to enforce in courts,which will be deprived of any later opportunity to review.
despite our general deference to arbitration agreements in an era of international trade expansion,see id.at,the possibility of such a result would counsel against being deferential in this circumstance,as it is exactly the sort that the supreme court has described as a prospective waiver of parties rights to pursue sta
