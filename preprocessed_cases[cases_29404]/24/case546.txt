at issue in this appeal is whether to carve out an exception to the federal arbitration act faa,where,in admiralty cases,its enforcement would deny a party the ability to implead a defendant pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c.we conclude that the policy of liberal joinder in maritime cases embodied in rule c does not supersede the statutory right to enforce contractual arbitration guaranteed by the faa.the district court decision to the contrary must be reversed and remanded for the entry of a stay of litigation between texaco and mcdermott,pending arbitration.
background 
this case arises from an accident during the construction of texaco petronius oil and gas production facility in the gulf of mexico off the coast of alabama.a crane failed,causing a deck module to fall into the sea.the crane involved in this incident was owned and operated by ray mcdermott,mcdermott and had been designed and manufactured by amclyde engineered products company,amclyde.
in the wake of the accident,texaco sued amclyde,williamsport wirerope works,the manufacturer of the failed wire rope line,lowrey brothers rigging center,the seller of the failed line,and lloyd register of shipping,the classification society that inspected and certified the crane and line.because of a mandatory arbitration clause in its contract with mcdermott,texaco did not file a complaint against mcdermott.
the contract includes a dispute resolution clause stating that t he parties shall reserve any controversy or claim,whether based in contract,tort or otherwise,arising out of,relating to or in connection with the agreement pursuant to a mandatory process consisting of negotiation,mediation,and binding arbitration.this provision is mandatory.
texaco attempted to avail itself of this alternative dispute resolution provision,but was frustrated when amclyde tendered mcdermott as a defendant under federal rule of civil procedure c.the rule provides for liberal joinder in admiralty actions.texaco moved to strike the joinder.before the district court ruled on the motion to strike,mcdermott moved for partial summary judgment against texaco.texaco opposed this motion,asserting that the district court was obliged by section of the faa to stay the proceedings between texaco and mcdermott pending their arbitration.after hearing argument,the district court denied texaco motion to strike,denied its request for stay and granted mcdermott motion.texaco now appeals the district court denial of the requested stay.
discussion 
appellate review of the district court refusal to stay litigation pending arbitration is de novo.see hornbeck offshore coastal carriers,cir neal hardee food systems,cir.
as an initial matter,mcdermott argues that texaco appeal is not properly before this court.mcdermott contends that texaco never formally moved for a stay and that it never had a chance to oppose texaco informal request for a stay.we disagree.while texaco did not file any document captioned motion to stay,texaco gave both written and oral notice adequate to apprise both mcdermott and the district court that it was requesting a stay and of its supporting arguments.five pages of texaco memorandum in opposition to mcdermott motion for partial summary judgment are dedicated to the stay issue.additionally,the record indicates that texaco moved for a stay at the june,oral argument before the district court and that this motion was promptly denied without discussion mcdermott did not contest the stay issue during the hearing because the district court had already denied relief.procedurally,the issue is properly preserved and fully briefed for this court.
moving to the merits,the supreme court has observed that the faa is a congressional declaration of a liberal policy favoring arbitration.moses cone memorial hospital mercury construction,d.further,there is a strong federal policy in favor of enforcing arbitration agreements.dean witter reynolds byrd,d.the language of the faa is unambiguous 
if any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of the united states upon any issue referable to arbitration the court shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
the faa specifically applies to both maritime transactions and interstate commerce an application for arbitration by either party under section requests the district court to refrain from further action in a suit pending arbitration,and requires the court to first determine whether there is a written agreement to arbitrate between the parties,and then whether any of the issues raised are within the reach of the agreement.midwest mechanical contractors,commonwealth construction,cir.i f the issues in a case are within the reach of that arbitration agreement,the district court has no discretion under section to deny the stay.hornbeck,at.
here,an arbitration agreement governed by section of the faa exists between texaco and mcdermott.the arbitration clause is one this court has termed a broad agreement because it covers any dispute between the parties.as a result,any litigation arguably arising under such a clause should be stayed pending the arbitrator decision as to whether the dispute is covered.id.at.see also sedco,petroleos mexicanos mexican oil,cir of,cir 
in the absence of the rule c exception carved out by the district court,the dispute would have been subject to arbitration.however,the smooth operation of the arbitration process was disrupted by amclyde rule c tender of mcdermott as a defendant to texaco.mcdermott contends,and the district court accepted,that rule c trumps section of the faa,preventing enforcement of the arbitration clause.
the logical basis for the district court conclusion is unclear.there seems upon analysis to be no real conflict between rule c and the faa.
rule c was designed to expedite and consolidate admiralty actions by permitting a plaintiff to demand judgment against a defendant in favor of the plaintiff.as a consequence,the plaintiff is then required to assert his claims directly against the defendant.see charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.this unique liberal joinder policy served to reduce the possibility of inconsistent results in separate actions,eliminate redundant litigation,and prevent a third party disappearing if jurisdiction and control over the party and his assets were not immediately established.see id.at.
the faa purpose,as has been noted,is to enforce private arbitration agreements even if the result is piecemeal litigation,at least absent a countervailing policy manifested in another federal statute.dean witter reynolds byrd,d.as a tangential benefit,however,arbitration usually provides a speedier,more economical form of dispute resolution.
these two policies do not necessarily conflict.if arbitration goes forward between texaco and mcdermott,it need not hold up or interfere with the admiralty litigation between texaco and the other defendants.apportionment of liability exists whether or not mcdermott is impleaded under rule c.moreover,the essential functions of rule c are accomplished because mcdermott will have to face texaco directly as a defendant,albeit in arbitration.
a conflict arises only if rule c is held to thwart enforcement of the arbitration agreement pursuant to the district court order.that result allows amclyde,though not a party to the arbitration agreement,to override the contract and fundamentally thwart the purposes of the faa.further,to carve out a rule c exception to the faa could severely undermine maritime arbitration clauses,inspiring abuse and opportunistic behavior,as third parties are allowed or encouraged to do what the parties to a contract themselves are not to put aside a mandatory arbitration provision and force litigation.it is perhaps no accident that amclyde did not even file a brief in this appeal and by its silence rests on mcdermott arguments against enforcing the arbitration clause.
there is little caselaw to guide our analysis.however,in the only previous decision to analyze this precise issue,the court refused to create a r
