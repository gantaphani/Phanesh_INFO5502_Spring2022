representing american patriots and catalina,rutan filed a lawsuit against forward winsome.forward winsome against american patriots,catalina,delaney,and donald yu,catalina president collectively,the catalina parties.rutan eventually became counsel for delaney and yu,as well as american patriots and catalina.the catalina parties signed a supplemental retainer agreement dated october,which included a paragraph addressing the topic of fees that delaney interlineated before signing.the paragraph read as follows delaney additions are indicated by brackets our fees will continue to be charged on an hourly basis for all time actually expended and will be generally billed monthly with payment due within days of the date of the bill.it is my understanding that corporations are providing this defense free of charge to yu and delaney and,therefore,by signing this retainer agreement yu and delaney is sic not agreeing to pay rutan tucker.delaney deleted the following sentence although our agreement has been directly with the corporations,delaney has indicated he will assure payment to rutan tucker in the event the corporations are unable to pay us.
the supplemental retainer agreement also stated this letter and the letter of march,together shall constitute the entire agreement between rutan tucker and clients with respect to this matter.above the clients signatures was an acknowledgement stating,among other things,w e have read and understand the entire agreement including the discussions concerning the firm disclosure of conflicts of interest.we also agree to be bound by all the terms,covenants and conditions contained in this letter and the letter of march,delaney made no changes or interlineations to this language and signed the supplemental retainer agreement on behalf of himself personally as well as catalina and american patriots.
the forward winsome case went to trial and resulted in a significant jury verdict against the catalina parties.
the arbitration 
delaney,american patriots and catalina filed a lawsuit against rutan for legal malpractice.rutan petitioned the court to compel arbitration pursuant to the parties retainer agreements.in october,the trial court ordered the malpractice claims submitted to final binding arbitration before the american arbitration association aaa.rutan filed a demand for arbitration,seeking recovery of its attorney fees incurred in the forward winsome litigation from delaney,american patriots,and catalina delaney,american patriots and catalina filed a counterclaim for legal malpractice.
richard chernick was appointed as arbitrator.the arbitration hearing was held from november to november.during the arbitration,rutan dropped its claim against delaney personally for recovery of the attorney fees incurred in the forward winsome litigation,conceding that delaney interlineations on the supplemental retainer agreement absolved him of liability for those fees.the issue of liability for attorney fees to the prevailing party in the arbitration remained.
the arbitrator rendered an interim award on january,finding in favor of rutan on all claims,and determining that rutan was the prevailing party in the arbitration and entitled to recover its attorney fees and costs incurred in the arbitration.at the request of the arbitrator,the parties submitted written argument as to the amount of attorney fees incurred and rutan right to recover fees from delaney personally.
the arbitrator issued a final award on march,the march final award,which repeated the interim award with respect to the analysis of the parties claims and also resolved the issues of the attorney fees and costs to be recovered by rutan.the march final award determined that delaney was personally liable for rutan attorney fees and costs incurred in the arbitration.in reaching this decision,the arbitrator interpreted the language of both retainer agreements,considered the arguments and evidence presented by the parties,and determined that delaney interlineations did not affect his rights and obligations regarding the payment of fees and costs incurred in connection with the arbitration.
the body of the march final award addressed delaney claim for malpractice against rutan yet delaney name was omitted from the relevant paragraph under the heading award,which read as follows.respondents american patriots,a delaware,and catalina toys,a california,shall take nothing on their counterclaims for legal malpractice against rutan tucker,llp and milford dahl.
on april and,rutan requested in writing that the arbitrator amend or correct the march final award to add delaney name to paragraph of the award.the arbitrator issued a corrected final award dated april,the april corrected final award,apparently without having received delaney opposition to rutan request.the parties agreed the arbitrator should withdraw the april corrected final award and consider delaney opposition,which he did.
on april,the arbitrator issued a new final award the april final award.the april final award was the same as the march final award,with two exceptions.first,delaney name was listed in the relevant paragraph of the award section,indicating the arbitrator also found against delaney with regard to his malpractice claim against rutan.second,the arbitrator included a discussion of his authority to change the march final award,stating the earlier omission of delaney name was a mistake and not an attempt to leave unresolved delaney malpractice claim.
the judgment 
on june,rutan filed a petition to confirm the april final award or,in the alternative,to correct or amend the march final award.delaney opposed the petition to confirm and filed a petition to vacate all three of the awards issued by the march final award,the april corrected final award,and the april final award.
following a hearing,the trial court granted rutan petition to confirm the april final award and denied delaney petition to vacate.the trial court entered judgment on the arbitration award.delaney appealed.
discussion 
i.the trial court properly refused to vacate the arbitrator award of attorney fees against delaney.
delaney argues the judgment must be reversed because the arbitrator exceeded his authority by awarding attorney fees in favor of rutan and against delaney.he contends his interlineated changes to the supplemental retainer agreement removed any liability on his part to pay rutan attorney fees and costs incurred in the arbitration as well as in the underlying forward winsome case.delaney argues the arbitrator was acting outside the scope of his authority by awarding fees and costs against him personally,and the april final award is therefore invalid.rutan contends the issue of delaney liability for attorney fees and costs was properly before the arbitrator,was within the scope of his authority,and was properly a matter of contract interpretation following the admission and consideration of evidence.
under code of civil procedure section,a final arbitration award may be vacated only under very limited circumstances.all further statutory references are to the code of civil procedure.here,delaney relied on section,subdivision a,which states subject to section,the court shall vacate the award if the court determines t he arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted.
moncharsh,supra,cal th,d,and the cases following it guide our analysis.in moncharsh,the supreme court concluded parties to an arbitration have a strong expectation of finality in the process,requiring that judicial intervention in the arbitration process be minimized.id.at,d.the court analyzed the historical development of the rule determining the basis upon which an arbitrator decision may be vacated.id.at,d.the court reiterated the general rule that courts must pay substantial deference to an arbitrator determination of his own authority.id.at,d.when an arbitrator acts beyond the scope of his authority,however,the court retains the power to vacate an award,but only if the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted,subd.a.these statutory and common law limitations on the ability of a court to change or vacate an arbitrator decision fulfill the public policy requirement that interference with the final decisions of arbitrators be minimized.
delaney argues modification of the supplemental retainer agreement eliminated the possibility of an award of any attorney fees to rutan from delaney.he contends the arbitrator therefore granted an unauthorized remedy and exceeded his contractual authority.the cases since moncharsh do not support delaney position.
in advanced micro devices,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court held an arbitration award must be upheld unless the relief granted bears no rational relationship to the arbitration contract.the award will be upheld so long as it was even arguably based on the contract it may be vacated only if the reviewing court is compelled to infer the award was based on an extrinsic source.id.at,d,original italics.in advanced micro devices,the arbitrator fashioned an equitable remedy for defendant breach of contract based on his interpretation of the parties contracts and in light of the testimony provided during a lengthy hearing.id.at,d.the trial court confirmed the award,but the court of appeal reversed,finding the arbitrator had exceeded his authority by creating a remedy with no rational nexus to the parties underlying contract.id.at,d.the supreme court reversed,holding courts may not review de novo the remedies fashioned in arbitration,due to the need for and expectation of finality and the nature of arbitration proceedings.a reviewing court is thus not in a favorable position to substitute its judgment for that of the arbitrators as to what relief is most just and equitable under all the circumstances.id.at,d.
similarly,in the present case,the arbitrator interpreted the retainer agreements to provide for an award of attorney fees against delaney for fees incurred in the arbitration proceeding.the arbitrator considered delaney handwritten changes to the supplemental retainer agreement.while delaney tries to style the arbitrator decision as one exceeding the limits of the powers conferred by the retainer agreements,he is really just arguing the arbitrator wrongly interpreted the written contract on the issue of liability for fees incurred during the arbitration itself.this contractual interpretation is precisely the type of decision by an arbitrator to which courts must grant deference.under moncharsh and advanced micro devices,this decision was within the province of the arbitrator.
the trial court did not,as delaney suggests,simply close its eyes to the arbitrator decision.it recognized the arbitrator decided the question of whether under the contract delaney owed attorney fees for the arbitration,as distinguished from fees owed to rutan for litigating the forward winsome case.the trial court correctly framed the issue and determined the arbitrator decision could not be vacated.
in support of his argument and in the face of moncharsh and advanced micro devices,delaney relies solely on thompson jespersen d.thompson.thompson was decided prior to the supreme court decision in moncharsh,and therefore has limited precedential value.furthermore,the facts of thompson differ significantly from those here.in thompson,neither the parties arbitration agreement nor the applicable arbitration rules provided for an award of attorney fees yet the arbitration panel awarded fees to the prevailing party.id.at.in the present case,in contrast,the retainer agreement and supplemental retainer agreement make numerous references to attorney fees,both in connection with the underlying forward winsome litigation and any later arbitrable disputes between the catalina parties and rutan.the issue in this case was whether certain language applied to delaney the arbitrator interpreted the contract on t
