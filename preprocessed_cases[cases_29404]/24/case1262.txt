factual and procedural background 
this litigation concerns the development of a condominium project at market street in san francisco the property.plaintiff is a limited liability company formed by joseph cassidy.cassidy is plaintiff sole member he is also the sole principal of centrix builders,a construction company.defendants are members or principals of members of market associates,llc market associates.all defendants except christopher flood live in ireland.
in august,market associates obtained a million construction loan from united commercial bank ucb to develop the property.the loan was documented with a promissory note and secured by a deed of trust recorded against the property.ucb required each defendant to execute an page agreement containing a personal continuing guaranty.
each agreement contained the following clause 
judicial reference.it is the desire and intention of the parties to agree upon a mechanism and procedure under which any controversy,breach or dispute arising out of this guaranty will be resolved in a prompt and expeditious manner.accordingly,any controversy,breach or dispute arising out of this guaranty and all loan documents executed by borrower,or relating to the interpretation of any term or provision of such documents,shall be heard by a single referee by consensual general reference pursuant to the provision of the california code of civil procedure,sections et.the parties shall agree upon a single referee who shall then try all issues,whether of fact or law,and report a statement of decision which either party may file with the clerk or judge and have judgment entered thereon.if the parties are unable to agree upon a referee within ten days of a written request to do so by any party,then any party may thereafter seek to have a referee appointed pursuant to the code of civil procedure sections and.the parties agree that the referee shall have the power to decide all issues of fact and law and report a statement of decision hereon,and to issue all legal and equitable relief appropriate under the circumstances before him or her.the parties shall promptly and diligently cooperate with one another and the referee,and shall perform such acts as may be necessary to obtain prompt and expeditious resolution of the dispute or controversy in accordance with the terms hereof.the cost of such a judicial reference proceeding shall be borne equally by the parties to the dispute.
defendants initialed each page of their respective agreement and signed directly beneath section.
by april,defendants defaulted on the loan.in june,ucb assigned the promissory note to plaintiff,who later acquired the property in a trustee sale.
the litigation 
in,plaintiff sued defendants for breach of the guaranty,seeking approximately million,plus interest plaintiff served flood and manning in and they appeared in.in april and june,plaintiff filed case management statements requesting a jury trial and estimating a jury trial in,manning,market associates and others sued the real estate agent who represented market associates in the purchase and sale of the property san francisco superior court,case no.in july,and over plaintiff objection,the court consolidated that case with the present action.the remaining defendants quigley,murphy,and walsh filed answers at various times in walsh appeared last and filed an answer in october.in their answers,defendants asserted various affirmative defenses,including unclean hands,estoppel and the illegality and unenforceability of the agreements.
in,defendants and market associates against cassidy,centrix builders,and others.the alleged claims for,among other things,fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,and interference with prospective economic advantage.as relevant here,defendants claimed cassidy wrongfully gained confidential and propriety information from them about the loan and the property and used it to purchase the note from ucb for a rate.
from september to august,plaintiff served defendants with form and special interrogatories,requests for admission,and requests for production of documents.plaintiff requests for production to manning sought categories of documents,including documents related to the loan and the property.in response,defendants produced approximately pages of documents.in,served plaintiff with special interrogatories,requests for admission,and requests for production of documents.plaintiff responses to the requests for production were deficient the court granted motion to compel and ordered plaintiff to provide documents by january.in late december,plaintiff responded to special interrogatories and requests for admission.
the motion for appointment of a referee 
in early december,plaintiff moved for appointment of a referee pursuant to section.plaintiff argued the agreements were legally enforceable removing this matter from the busy court calendar and alleviating the attendant fiscal costs to the court would promote the public interest and the and consolidated action had no factual or legal relevance to its complaint.cassidy plaintiff sole member submitted a declaration in support of the motion attaching the agreements signed by defendants.
in a declaration submitted in support of the motion,plaintiff counsel claimed serving,quigley,murphy,and walsh was difficult because these defendants were located and ireland and had to be served by means of the hague convention and because they evaded service.counsel characterized plaintiff attempts to serve these defendants as diligent and noted the difficulties in effectuating service in ireland.counsel declaration attached a may affidavit of service from an irish solicitor averring he tried to serve quigley three times on unspecified dates but failed to do so because quigley residence was surrounded by a gate and no one answered the door when he rang the doorbell.
defendants raised four arguments in opposition to the reference motion.first,they argued they did not knowingly and voluntarily waive their constitutional right to a jury trial because the reference provision did not implicate a waiver of one constitutional right to a jury trial.second,they urged the court to decline to enforce the reference provision under tarrant bell,supra,cal th because allowing a judicial referee to hear the personal guaranty claims would duplicate effort,increase costs,and create a risk of inconsistent findings without diminishing any aspect of the case load before the trial court.as counsel explained,plaintiff right to recover under the agreements was inextricably linked to the propriety of the transfer of the promissory note from ucb to cassidy and involved cassidy wrongful conduct leading to the transfer,which is at the heart of defendants against cassidy and centrix 
third,defendants contended plaintiff waived its right to seek a judicial referee by delaying service of process on defendants by nearly three years and by waiting over three years before seeking the appointment of a judicial referee.they also claimed the case would not be ready for trial any sooner with a judicial referee because plaintiff had stalled in responding to discovery and steadfastly refused to produce documents for six months,which necessitated an order compelling plaintiff to produce documents.
finally,defendants argued the agreements were unenforceable adhesion contracts containing unconscionable reference provisions.they claimed the agreements were procedurally unconscionable because they were presented in a manner,accompanied by the threat that no loan would be issued unless the guarantor signed the document as presented and they did not expect the agreements to operate to waive their jury trial rights.according to defendants,the reference provision was substantively unconscionable because it deprived them of their constitutional right to a jury trial and because it contained provisions demanded by ucb that,unbeknownst to defendants,engaged in unsound banking practices that could jeopardize the security underlying the guaranties,misconduct sufficient to warrant criminal and charges against ucb employees.
each defendant offered a declaration averring the agreements were presented in a manner without an opportunity for negotiation defendants did not receive any consideration in exchange for ucb desire that the agreements contain the reference provision defendants were not provided with any documents when they signed the agreements before they signed the agreements,no one explained what a judicial referee entailed or told them the reference provision would waive their rights to a jury trial and defendants did not agree to waive their right to a jury trial in any dispute arising from the agreement.flood further averred he was not represented by an attorney when he signed the agreement and that a ucb representative pressured him to sign it or else no construction loan would be issued.he further stated it would be financially impossible for him to pay for a judicial referee.
defense counsel submitted a declaration describing the circumstances surrounding cassidy purchase of the note for million and attaching an appraisal valuing the property at million.on information and belief,defense counsel asserted that when defendants defaulted on the loan,ucb refused to negotiate with them or with other prospective purchasers some of whom were offering million for the note because ucb was secretly negotiating with cassidy.counsel declaration attached various documents pertaining to the fdic seizure of ucb in november for,among other thing,allowing illegal friendly short sales conducted by ucb in.the declaration suggested one of these short sales involved cassidy.finally,counsel averred plaintiff had stalled in responding to discovery and steadfastly refused to produce documents.plaintiff delayed producing documents in response to a document request served in july,ultimately necessitating an order compelling plaintiff to produce documents filed on december.
in reply,plaintiff argued the judicial reference provisions were enforceable under california law and clearly and unambiguously informed defendants that all controversies would be resolved by a single referee.plaintiff further claimed it did not waive its right to seek judicial reference because it diligently attempted to serve the ireland defendants under the hague convention and moved for judicial reference shortly after the final defendant was served.finally,plaintiff contended the agreements and reference provisions were not unconscionable.
following a hearing,the court granted plaintiff motion for an order appointing a referee.shortly thereafter,plaintiff counsel declined to meet and confer about plaintiff responses to special interrogatories and requests for admission,claiming defendants challenge was if not moot,in abeyance pending appointment of a referee.any dispute over discovery must await appointment of a referee and a determination by the referee of the scope of permissible discovery.plaintiff counsel also advised defense counsel it would seek to limit the scope of discovery to the narrow issues at hand,namely the defendants obligations under the agreements and plaintiff damages under the defaulted construction loan after a referee was appointed.
the court denied defendants reconsideration motion and appointed a referee.this petition followed.we stayed the order granting the reference motion and issued an order to show cause why the relief requested in the petition should not be granted 
discussion 
judicial reference involves sending a pending trial court action to a referee for hearing,determination and a report back to the court.trend homes,superior court th,trend homes,disapproved on other grounds in tarrant bell,supra,cal th.a general reference directs the referee to try all issues in the action.the hearing is conducted under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings.in a general reference,the referee prepares a statement of decision that stands as the decision of the court and is reviewable as if the court had rendered it.the primary effect of such a reference is to require trial by a referee and not by a court or jury.citation.treo kettner homeowners superior court th,treo.
section authoriz es courts to transfer a dispute to a referee pursuant to a written agreement between the parties.grafton partners superior court cal th,grafton.pursuant to section,a referee may be appointed upon the motion of a party to a written contract that provides that any controversy arising therefrom shall be heard by a referee if the court finds a reference agreement exists between the parties a to hear and determine any or all of the issues in an action or proceeding,whether of fact or of law,and to report a statement of decision.b to ascertain a fact necessary to enable the court to determine an action or proceeding.
the reference provision waives defendants right to a jury trial 
defendants contend the reference provision does not waive their right to a jury trial because they did not have actual notice of,and did not engage in meaningful reflection before agreeing to,the purported waiver.the crux of defendants claim is paragraph can not and does not waive their right to a jury trial because it does not contain the words jury,jury trial,or waiver and,as a result,they did not know they were waiving their rights to a jury trial when they executed the agreements.
defendants urge us to establish a rule requiring predispute reference agreements to contain explicit language waiving the right to a jury trial.we decline to do so.section does not require the reference agreement to contain a jury waiver.as the court in woodside homes of california,superior court th woodside ii observed,a statute permitting agreement for a reference unambiguously results in a waiver of jury trial without the need to use those words.such a reference like arbitration entails dispensing with trial in the judicial forum,including jury trial.id.at see also pinnacle museum tower pinnacle market development us,llc cal th,pinnacle section allows appointment of a referee and hence waiver of a jury trial.
two courts have enforced reference provisions that did not mention the words jury,waiver,or trial.see greenbriar homes communities,superior court th,disapproved on another point in tarrant bell,supra,cal th woodside ii,supra,th at.of course,some reference clauses do contain such language,but the fact that some reference clauses contain waiver of jury trial language is not dispositive.see,woodside homes of cal.superior court th,woodside i by initialing below,the parties acknowledge that they have read and understand the foregoing and accept that they are waiving their right to a jury trial treo,supra,th at clause entitled,waiver of jury trial.
the california supreme court has concluded an otherwise enforceable agreement to arbitrate need not contain an express waiver of the right to jury trial madden kaiser foundation hospitals cal d,fn.omitted madden.in madden,the plaintiff argued the arbitration provision failed because it did not expressly waive the parties constitutional right to a jury trial.the madden court rejected this argument,explaining,to predicate the legality of a consensual arbitration agreement upon the parties express waiver of jury trial would be as artificial as it would be disastrous because w hen parties agree to submit their disputes to arbitration they select a forum that is alternative to,and independent of,the judicial a forum in which,as they well know,disputes are not resolved by juries.hence there are literally thousands of commercial and labor contracts that provide for arbitration but do not contain express waivers of jury trial.courts have regularly enforced such agreements id.at.the madden court declined to fetter the arbitration institution with artificial requirements that an arbitration provision itself must explicitly waive rights to jury trial.id.at.
our high court recently reaffirmed this principle and declin ed to read additional unwritten procedural requirements,such as actual notice and meaningful reflection,into the arbitration statute.pinnacle,supra,cal th at,fn.omitted ruiz podolsky cal th,citing madden with approval and noting arbitration agreements need not contain an explicit jury trial waiver.we reach the same conclusion here.we hold it would be anomalous to require such an express waiver in a predispute reference agreement,and we decline to read into section the requirement that a reference agreement explicitly waive rights to a jury trial.see badie bank of america th,badie effective jury trial waiver particularly in a nonadhesive contract,need not expressly state,i waive my right to a jury trial.
an agreement to arbitrate must,however,clearly and unambiguously show that the party has agreed to resolve disputes in a forum other than the judicial one,which is the only forum in which disputes are resolved by juries.badie,supra,th at.paragraph satisfies that test.it contains the heading judicial reference and advises that all disputes shall be heard by a single referee by consensual general reference pursuant to the provision of the california code of civil procedure,sections et.and that the referee shall then try all issues,whether of fact or law,and report a statement of decision which either party may file with the clerk or judge and have judgment entered thereon.paragraph further states t he parties agree that the referee shall have the power to decide all issues of fact and law and report a statement of decision hereon,and to issue all legal and equitable relief appropriate under the circumstances before him or her.this language is sufficient to show the parties here have agreed to resolve disputes in a forum other than the judicial one,which is the only forum in which disputes are resolved by juries.badie,at.
treo,supra,th does not assist defendants.treo held equitable servitudes created by a covenants,conditions,and restrictions cc r did not constitute a contract within the meaning of section.id.at.the treo court conclusion that cc r are not a written contract pursuant to section has no application here.we reject defendants claim that paragraph does not waive their right to a jury trial because it does not contain language explicit language regarding such waiver.
the reference provision is not unconscionable 
next,defendants argue the reference provision is unenforceable because it is procedurally and substantively unconscionable.unconscionability consists of both procedural and substantive elements.the procedural element addresses the circumstances of contract negotiation and formation,focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power.citations.substantive unconscionability pertains to the fairness of an agreement actual terms and to assessments of whether they are overly harsh or.citations.a contract term is not substantively unconscionable when it merely gives one side a greater benefit rather,the term must be so as to shock the conscience.citation.pinnacle,supra,cal th at.
the party resisting arbitration bears the burden of proving unconscionability.citations.both procedural unconscionability and substantive unconscionability must be shown,but they need not be present in the same degree and are evaluated on a sliding scale.citation.t he more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.citation.pinnacle,supra,cal th at.unconscionability is ultimately a question of law,which we review de novo when no meaningful factual disputes exist as to the evidence.chin advanced fresh concepts franchise th.
the reference provision reflects a low degree if any of procedural unconscionability.as stated above,procedural unconscionability requires oppression or surprise.oppression occurs where a contract involves lack of negotiation and meaningful choice,surprise where the allegedly unconscionable provision is hidden within a prolix printed form.citation.pinnacle,supra,cal th at.claiming there was oppression,defendants point to the declarations they offered in opposition to the reference motion,where they averred they were presented with the agreements in a manner felt they had no option but to sign the agreements to obtain the loan and believed the terms of the agreements were not negotiable.while this may be true,it does not carry the day for defendants because the adhesive aspect of a contract is not dispositive on the issue of unconscionability.serpa california surety investigations,th,serpa see also pinnacle,supra,cal th at,fn.
even if we do assume an imbalance in bargaining power,and that ucb,as the stronger party,presumably prepared the agreements with an eye to its own advantage,and even if we also assume that ucb would not have countenanced the striking of the reference provisions,defendants have nevertheless only shown a low level of procedural unconscionability because,as we discuss below,the elements of surprise or misrepresentation are not present.woodside i,supra,th at.
defendants claim of surprise is unavailing in light of greenbriar,where the third district court of appeal analyzed an identical reference provision and concluded there was no element of surprise.greenbriar,supra,th at,disapproved on another point in tarrant bell,supra,cal th.the greenbriar court determined the judicial reference provision at issue there was written clearly in the same sized font as the rest of the agreement,and is easily understood.the provision was not buried in the agreement,but in fact appeared at a location where the purchaser was almost certain to see it immediately above where the purchaser would sign the agreement.greenbriar,supra,th at,disapproved on another point in tarrant bell,supra,cal th.the same is true here.the reference provision was not obtained by a stealthy device such as the burial of the provision near the end of pages of text.woodside i,supra,th at.the reference provision was placed in a conspicuous location at the end of a relatively short contract 
nor was ucb as defendants suggest required to explain the reference provision to defendants.the reference provision clearly states that in the event of a civil action involving a dispute arising out of the guaranty,the action will be heard by a judicial reference.it cites the pertinent code of civil procedure section governing judicial reference,notes that only one referee will be appointed,and what explains what occurs if the parties can not agree on the referee.finally,the reference provision states the referee will have the power to decide all issues in the action,to report a statement of decision,and to issue all legal and equitable relief as appropriate.trend homes,supra,th at,disapproved on another ground in tarrant bell,supra,cal th.there is no evidence in the record that defendants lacked education,experience,or sophistication necessary to understand the guaranties.id.at.to the contrary,the evidence suggests defendants had significant experience in real estate transactions,an extensive real estate portfolio,and a substantial net worth.for example,defendant owned a percent interest in seven bay area properties and had a net worth of over million.defendants quigley,murphy,walsh,and manning owned a limited partnership with a net worth of over million.
given the low degree of procedural unconscionability,defendants are required to show a high degree of substantive unconscionability to render the reference provision unenforceable.serpa,supra,th at.they can not.the reference provision is not substantively unconscionable.the terms are not so as to shock the conscience,nor are they harsh or oppressive.the provision does not limit the amount or type of relief defendants can obtain.by means of judicial reference,the provision attempted to ensure the parties would have their rights enforced and arguments resolved in as efficient and fair a manner available to them,consistent with the rules of procedure and evidence that apply to a trial.even the referee fees were to be shared equally.greenbriar,supra,th at,disapproved on another point in tarrant bell,supra,cal th.
with the exception of defendant flood,none of the defendants made any attempt to establish the probable additional expenses of a judicial reference,if any,would be impossible or unreasonably difficult for them to pay,nor did they offer any evidence that the decision to agree to judicial reference was not economically sound from their point of view.woodside i,supra,th at,fn.omitted.while it may be true,defendants claim that they will suffer undue expense and inconvenience associated with travel from ireland as the reference proceeding and the trial progress at different times is unsupported by a citation to the record.
like other courts before us,we reject defendants claim that the reference provision was substantively unconscionable because defendants did not receive bargained for consideration in return for the inclusion of paragraph in the agreements.defendants did get something in addition for their jury waiver plaintiff matching waiver.woodside i,supra,th at.there is nothing in the record suggesting a truly neutral decision maker chosen under the agreements will not return a fair decision,or that,if the decision is in favor of defendants,the award will not represent complete and reasonable compensation for their damages.id.at.in addition,judicial reference provides economies both of time and expense.id.at see also treo,supra,th at noting amendment to section allowing parties by written contract to agree that any controversy arising therefrom be heard by reference was an attempt to lessen judicial delays that were at the time a serious problem.
the parties waiver of their right to a jury trial does not render the reference provision substantively unconscionable.trend homes,supra,th at.when parties agree to judicial reference,as opposed to arbitration,they retain nearly all of their procedural and constitutional rights,since the rules of evidence apply to the proceeding,which is conducted like a trial,and the parties retain appellate rights.the only right the parties agree to give up is the right to a jury trial.id.at.we conclude the reference provision is not unconscionable.
under the circumstances of this case,defendants have not established plaintiff waived its right to judicial reference 
defendants third claim is plaintiff waived any right to a reference.they have not cited,and our research has not disclosed,any case applying waiver in the context of judicial reference.in the absence of such authority,the parties urge us to apply cases regarding waiver of a contractual right to arbitration.
the legislature has enacted a comprehensive statutory scheme authorizing predispute arbitration agreements in section et.grafton,supra,cal th at.section part of this statutory scheme requires a court to enforce an agreement to arbitrate unless certain conditions have been met,including where t he right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner,subd.a.there are differences between arbitration and judicial reference,and section does not expressly apply to judicial reference.arbitration cases,however,are informative here.see trend homes,supra,th at noting there was no reason not to apply california supreme court authority on unconscionability of an arbitration agreement in the context of judicial reference,disapproved on another point in tarrant bell,supra,cal th woodside i,supra,th at review of arbitration statutes was justified in evaluating the enforceability of judicial reference provisions.moreover and apart from any statutory authority a party may waive its right to judicial reference.like other contractual rights,the right to judicial reference may be waived.see chase blue cross of california th,cinel barna th,c ontractual rights are subject to waiver,and waiver may be express or implied.we therefore look to authority concerning waiver of arbitration to determine whether plaintiff waived its right to judicial reference.
generally,the determination of waiver is a question of fact,and the trial court finding,if supported by sufficient evidence,is binding on the appellate court.citations.brown superior court th,brown.defendants urge us to apply an independent standard of review because the facts are undisputed and because only one inference may reasonably be drawn,the issue is one of law.citation.ibid.we decline to apply a de novo standard of review because the inferences to be drawn from the evidence on waiver are very much in dispute.where,as here,the facts are disputed,o ur function is to determine whether the trial court finding of no waiver is supported by substantial evidence.keating superior court cal d,overruled on other grounds in southland keating.we infer all necessary findings supported by substantial evidence citations and construe any reasonable inference in the manner most favorable to the judgment,resolving all ambiguities to support an affirmance.citation.lewis fletcher jones motor cars,th,lewis.
there is no single test for waiver of the right to compel arbitration.augusta keehn associates th,augusta,quoting berman health net th,berman.our high court,however,has articulated six factors a trial court should consider to determine whether a party has waived its right to arbitrate whether the party actions are inconsistent with the right to arbitrate whether the litigation machinery has been substantially invoked and the parties were well into preparation of a lawsuit before the party notified the opposing party of an intent to arbitrate whether a party either requested arbitration enforcement close to the trial date or delayed for a long period before seeking a stay whether a defendant seeking arbitration filed a counterclaim without asking for a stay of the proceedings whether important intervening steps,taking advantage of judicial discovery procedures not available in arbitration had taken place and whether the delay affected,misled,or prejudiced the opposing party.citations.agnes medical center pacificare of california cal th.
though some courts apply a more limited test,the party who seeks to establish waiver must show that some prejudice has resulted from the other party delay in seeking arbitration.berman,supra,th at,quoting davis continental airlines,th,applying a test.in addition,just as public policy favors arbitration,public policy should favor judicial reference.in a statutory judicial reference,parties have the advantage of a decision maker of the parties own choosing,who will schedule reliable hearing and trial dates with flexibility to accommodate competing scheduling issues.see kough,judicial references california lawyer,see also woodside i,supra,th at judicial reference provides economies both of time and expense.the parties retain the procedural rights of a civil trial court,including the right to appeal.parties may agree to a determination of all or only some of the issues in an action,whether of fact or of law,subd.a and a referee may be appointed to ascertain a fact necessary to enable the court to determine an action or proceeding,subd.b.it follows that a party argument that judicial reference has been waived should be subject to the same close judicial scrutiny as waiver of arbitration and the party seeking to establish a waiver bears a heavy burden of proof.agnes,supra,cal th at.applying these principles here,we conclude plaintiff has not waived its right to judicial reference because defendants have not demonstrated prejudice on the record before us.
defendants contend plaintiff delayed seeking judicial reference and exhibited litigation conduct inconsistent with an intent to proceed before a judicial referee.augusta,supra,th at.they are correct.these support a finding of waiver.plaintiff waited three years after filing the complaint,years after the first defendant appeared,and approximately six months after defendants to move for judicial reference.in addition,plaintiff requested a jury trial in two case management statements and obtained discovery from defendants before moving for reference see kaneko ford design citipark,d.
two other factors,however,favor plaintiff or do not apply.the litigation machinery had not been substantially invoked,nor were the parties well into preparation of a lawsuit before plaintiff notified defendants of its intent to seek reference.agnes,supra,cal th at.courts have concluded a party invoked the court litigation machinery where the party moved for summary judgment,participated in a mandatory settlement conference,and allowed the case to proceed to the brink of trial law offices of dixon howell valley th,or where the parties filed a motion for class certification and a motion to dismiss quevedo macy,d.while some discovery has occurred,plaintiff has not substantially invoked the litigation machinery.nor did plaintiff file a counterclaim without seeking a stay.agnes,supra,cal th at.
according to defendants,plaintiff delay in seeking reference compels a finding of waiver.we disagree.we can not conclude the delay was unreasonable under the circumstances present here,particularly given the difficulty plaintiff had in serving certain defendants in ireland.the cases upon which defendants rely to support their argument that plaintiff unreasonably delayed seeking to compel reference are inapposite.in the cases cited by defendants,there were additional reasons for finding prejudice in addition to delay.see,sobremonte superior court th,during month delay,defendant participated in hearings and status conferences,filed demurrers,engaged in expansive discovery,and forced the opposing party to spend over hours preparing for trial by waiting until one month before trial to compel arbitration augusta,supra,th at during delay,moving party conducted discovery,litigated discovery motions,and filed a demurrer.
notwithstanding plaintiff use of discovery procedures and its delay in seeking judicial reference,we conclude plaintiff has not waived its right to reference because defendants have not established prejudice.courts will not find prejudice where the party opposing arbitration shows only that it incurred court costs and legal expenses.citation.courts assess prejudice in light of california strong public policy favoring arbitration.citation.prejudice typically is found only where the petitioning party conduct has substantially undermined this important public policy or substantially impaired the other side ability to take advantage of the benefits and efficiencies of arbitration.citation.prejudice may be found where the petitioning party used the judicial process to gain information it could not have gained in arbitration,waited until the eve of trial to seek arbitration,or delayed so long that evidence was lost.citation.brown,supra,th at.
here,plaintiff did not wait until the eve of trial to seek reference and there is no indication in the record plaintiff delayed so long that evidence was lost.defendants claim they were prejudiced because plaintiff obtained extensive discovery,refused to provide meaningful responses to their discovery,and then expressed an intent to limit the scope of discovery before the referee.the test for prejudice is whether plaintiff used court discovery processes to gain information about defendants case which plaintiff could not have gained in judicial reference.berman,supra,th at.in other words,courts have found prejudice where a party availed itself of discovery mechanisms not available in arbitration.hoover american income life ins.th.here,defendants have the same right to discovery before a judicial referee as they do in court.trend homes,supra,th at.that plaintiff may,at some point in the future,seek to limit the scope of discovery before the referee is not dispositive where there is no indication the referee would be willing to limit discovery.defendants have not demonstrated plaintiff used the judicial process to gain information plaintiff could not have gained in judicial reference,particularly where the parties may avail themselves of all the judicial remedies in superior court and on appeal.see brown,supra,th at.
on the record before us,we can not conclude the evidence compels a finding of prejudice and,as a result,we must affirm the trial court ruling regarding waiver.lewis,supra,th at.
granting the reference motion was not an abuse of discretion under tarrant bell 
defendants final argument is the court abused its discretion by granting the reference motion because ordering reference would cause duplicative parallel proceedings,create a risk of inconsistent rulings,and would not promote judicial economy.defendants rely on tarrant bell,where the california supreme court held a trial court has discretion to refuse to enforce a predispute agreement providing that,in the event of dispute,a referee may hear and decide certain contested issues tarrant bell,supra cal th at and determined the trial court acted well within its discretion in basing its refusal to appoint a referee on the risk of inconsistent rulings and considerations of judicial economy.id.at.
in their reply,defendants argue the court operated under the misapprehension it lacked discretion to deny the reference motion.defendants point to the court comments at the hearing,claiming they demonstrate the court erroneously believed it had no discretion to deny a reference and,therefore,disregarded the factors highlighted in tarrant bell.under well established rules of appellate review,we need not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief.estate of bonzi th,fn.
assuming this argument is properly before us,we reject it on the merits.at the hearing on the motion,defense counsel argued this is another point that actually was not addressed in the tentative ruling that we put in our opposition papers.the consequences of granting a motion for judicial referee is going to cut this case in half.so the personal guarantee claims are going to be heard by a judicial referee,and the for indemnity and affirmative relief are going to be heard in the regular court system.this is addressed in tarrant bell saying it improper you should not have two separate parallel proceedings.counsel then listed a specific example illustrating how a bsolutely dispositive factual issues are going to come up in both the reference action and th
