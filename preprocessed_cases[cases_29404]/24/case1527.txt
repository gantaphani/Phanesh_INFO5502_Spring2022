this is an appeal from an order staying proceedings before the american arbitration association aaa based on the finding that the parties commercial dispute is not arbitrable and jurisdiction lies with the court.we hold that the parties agreement determines whether the court or the arbitrator decides if the dispute is subject to arbitration where the parties do not offer evidence extrinsic to the contract,on appeal we review the contract independently and the parties state a clear and unmistakable agreement that the arbitrator will decide whether the dispute is subject to arbitration when they incorporate into their agreement the aaa commercial arbitration rules which specify the arbitrator will decide arbitrability,and nothing in the parties agreement excludes from the jurisdiction of the arbitrator the decision whether the dispute must be submitted to arbitration.

the nature and procedural history of the parties disputes 
buyers hired chuckry,a former officer of seller dream theater,to run the business.some months after the purchase,buyers learned that chuckry had multiple sclerosis,which they believed to have negatively affected his ability to run the business.buyers claimed that sellers knew about chuckry illness and had a duty to disclose it to buyers before the purchase was consummated,and that sellers failure to disclose his disability caused buyers to suffer losses approaching.

discussion 
standard of review 
the issue of who should decide arbitrability turns on what the parties agreed in their contract.first options of chicago,kaplan,d freeman state farm mut.auto.ins.cal d.since the parties here introduced no extrinsic evidence,the trial court ruling regarding arbitrability is a conclusion of law,and we independently interpret the contract.merrick writers guild of america,west.d.coast plaza doctors hospital blue cross of california th,d.
b.the arbitrator and not the court will decide what disputes are arbitrable if the parties clearly and unmistakably state that is their intent 
in at t technologies communications workers,d,the court reaffirmed the basic principles of arbitration.the first two principles guide our conclusion in this case.the first principle is that arbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.citation.id.at.the second principle is that the question of arbitrability is for judicial determination u nless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise.id.at.
the arbitration clause at issue in at t technologies communications workers,supra,was part of a collective bargaining agreement.the court reasoned that the presumption of arbitrability furthers the national policy of peaceful resolution of labor disputes and achieves the parties presumed objectives in collective bargaining.at.the court recognized,however,that parties would be less inclined to enter collective bargaining agreements if arbitrators were empowered to decide disputes the parties never agreed to submit to arbitration.id.at.accordingly,regardless of policy considerations such as those at stake in collective bargaining agreements,the parties agreement determines what disputes will be arbitrated.
in first options of chicago,kaplan,supra,d,the court applied the same basic principles of arbitration in a case involving a commercial contract.the court found that arbitration is simply a matter of contract between the parties.id.at.when deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter including arbitrability,courts generally should apply ordinary principles that govern the formation of contracts.id.at.the court qualified this principle by finding it should not be assumed the parties intended the arbitrator to decide whether their dispute was arbitrable unless there is clear and unmistakable evidence that they did so.ibid.the first options court recognized that the question of who decides whether a dispute is subject to arbitration is rather arcane,and may not have been considered and agreed upon by the parties.id.at.the court held that,where the agreement is silent or ambiguous on that question,the court and not the arbitrator should decide arbitrability so as not to force unwilling parties to arbitrate a matter they reasonably thought a judge,not an arbitrator,would decide.ibid.
