peter prepared a document,dated september,which purported to be a working draft of the estate distribution agreement.this document incorporated the chart prepared during mediation and addressed other issues with respect to the property distribution.neither elizabeth nor jameson signed this document.
peter prepared a second document,dated october,labeled updated formalization of contract to exchange and purchase vacant commercial land interests.this,too,incorporated the chart prepared during mediation.elizabeth and jameson refused to sign this document,and their separate correspondence to peter indicated they each took the position that there was no agreement reached on august.

on march,and july,elizabeth filed petitions in the probate department as beneficiary and cotrustee of the jpl trust.no.the trust action.the march petition alleged that elizabeth and jameson,as a majority of the adult beneficiaries of the jpl trust,had voted to remove peter as cotrustee.it also alleged that from january to the present,peter had acted independently of the other trustees and for his own benefit by collecting rents and profits from the trust real property located in pearblossom,and that he had breached his fiduciary duty as cotrustee by failing to pay taxes on the pearblossom property.petitioner sought an order confirming peter removal as cotrustee and directing peter to fully account for rents and profits collected from the trust property and for expenses paid for the benefit of the trust.petitioner sought sanctions from peter based on his alleged misconduct and breach of fiduciary duty.

on june,during her deposition in the civil case,elizabeth refused to answer peter questions regarding the chart created during the august,mediation,and regarding conversations related to the chart which took place during the mediation.elizabeth moved for a protective order seeking to avoid disclosure of the chart or conversations which took place during the mediation.peter moved to compel elizabeth deposition testimony with regard to the chart.
the motion to compel was heard by judge kenneth freeman on august.under section,subdivision c,a written settlement agreement prepared in mediation is not made inadmissible or protected from disclosure if signed by the parties and a ll parties to the agreement expressly agree in writing to its disclosure.judge freeman found this exception to the mediation privilege was satisfied by the mediation and facilitation confidentiality agreement.that agreement,signed by the parties,stated that all matters discussed or agreed to in the mediation would be kept confidential and not disclosed,and not used in any litigation among them except as may be necessary to enforce any agreements resulting from the meeting
