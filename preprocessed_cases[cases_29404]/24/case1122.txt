in bowles russell,the supreme court held that as carried into practice by appellate rule a is jurisdictional and that courts lack power to create equitable exceptions.the question presented in this appeal is whether federal rule of civil procedure b remains available to circumvent the deadline in the appellate rule for reopening the time to file an appeal.appellant maintains there are unique circumstances explaining its failure to note a timely appeal the usual means of obtaining notice about the status of its case were unavailable because the case was sealed appellant counsel was diligent in attempting to discover the status of the case,by filing a written inquiry about pending motions and making oral inquiries of the clerk of the court and neither party obtained notice of the dismissal of the case until after the deadline in appellate rule a had passed.reading bowles narrowly,appellant contends that because the time limits in rule b are not jurisdictional,the unique circumstances exception applies and the district court therefore abused its discretion in denying relief pursuant to rule b.the holding in bowles,however,is broadly stated and appellant view that the district court retained power to recognize an equitable exception to the deadline rests on precedent expressly overturned by bowles.moreover,concluding that rule b is unavailable to allow appellant to file a timely appeal is in accord with the majority of circuits holding that with the amendment adding subsection,appellate a became the exclusive means of reopening the time to appeal.accordingly,we affirm.
in affirming we are cognizant of the unfairness of denying relief to appellant in this sealed case where none of the usual means of learning the status of its case were available and,as the parties agree and we will assume,appellant made diligent efforts through counsel to discover the status of its case.a sealed case generally presents special circumstances.neither the federal rules of civil procedure nor the district court local rules specifically address how parties shall be notified in sealed cases.not only is there no public docket in a sealed case,but the parties and their counsel also may not be able to access the sealed docket or receive electronic notification.the ad hoc procedures in appellant case were inadequate to ensure notice.the sealed docket stated electronic notice would not be given and listed participants to be notified by other means.no other means were employed.although counsel for the parties were also listed on page of the sealed docket as attorney s to be noticed,neither parties counsel received notice of the october,dismissal of the case.these circumstances explaining the parties failure to receive timely notice of the dismissal of the case are unique,not to be found in precedent addressing reopening of the time to appeal.this may be because the district court and the parties have made special arrangements for receiving notice in other sealed cases and those arrangements have worked.when they do not,through no fault of the parties and despite the best efforts of the parties to obtain information about the status of the proceedings,the civil justice system has failed in light of the implicit assumption underlying the federal rule on notice.d,that parties will have an easy way to determine the status of their case.the purpose of the civil rules set forth in rule contemplates a just as well as speedy resolution of disputes.given the mandatory deadline for reopening the time to file appeals in civil cases,it would be appropriate in light of bowles for the district court to adopt procedures to ensure that parties and their counsel,if any,in sealed cases receive prompt notice of final orders and judgments.

meanwhile,on june,the district court sealed the case upon joint consent motion of the parties.thereafter neither the district court sealed docket nor electronic notification were available to inform the parties of the status of pending and later filed motions.as it turns out,despite the filing by appellant counsel of a notice of inquiry on february,shortly after new counsel entered his appearance,inquiring about the pending motions,the parties represent that neither party or their counsel received notice of the district court october,dismissal of the case until may.see appellant br,appellee br.on may,upon a call to the district court judge chambers,a law clerk advised appellant counsel of the dismissal on the merits.

pursuant to rule b,a party may seek relief from a judgment or order for any other reason that justifies relief,upon a showing of extraordinary circumstances,kramer gates,quoting ackermann united states.the unique circumstances doctrine recognized in harris truck lines,cherry meat packers,and thompson ins,arose in view of the inequity of foreclosing appeals by parties whose failure to file timely notices of appeal results from reliance on the court as later clarified in osterneck ernst whinney,the doctrine applied only where a party performed an act,which if properly done,would postpone the filing deadline and had received specific assurance by a judicial officer that the act has properly been done.when the doctrine originated,the federal rules of civil and appellate procedure did not contain a more specific avenue of relief.it was not until that the rules were amended to add subsection to appellate rule a,setting forth a extension of the time to reopen the time to file an appeal when the moving party did not receive notice under federal rule of civil procedure d.see charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure,ed.wright miller.
