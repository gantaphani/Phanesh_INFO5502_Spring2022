for decades,the education code did not permit classified employees of public school districts to submit disciplinary disputes to binding arbitration.rather,the district governing board had broad and sole authority to make disciplinary decisions.in,the legislature addressed the subject.the result was a yet construed by the allows classified employees to arbitrate certain disciplinary matters,subd.e section e.
here,a school district summarily terminated a classified employee,declining to apply the progressive disciplinary steps set forth in the parties collective bargaining agreement cba.under the cba,progressive discipline was mandatory unless the employee wrongdoing was sufficiently serious.the discharged employee and the union submitted to arbitration the question of whether the employee wrongdoing was so serious as to excuse the use of progressive discipline.the arbitrator found in the employee favor and ordered his reinstatement with backpay and benefits.
the statute authorizes the district governing board to review an arbitration award under the standards imposed by the california arbitration act arbitration act code civ.see,e.in this case,the governing board reviewed the evidence presented at the arbitration hearing,disagreed with the arbitrator definition of serious,and issued its own decision,vacating the arbitration award and upholding the employee termination.
the employee and the union turned to the trial court for relief,filing a petition to confirm the arbitration award and to obtain a writ of mandate directing the governing board to reverse its decision and comply with the remedial portion of the award.the trial court granted the petition in its entirety.
we conclude that the arbitration award was final and binding in accordance with the terms of the cba.further,because none of the statutorily permitted grounds for vacating the award applied see code civ,the governing board erred in vacating it.even assuming that the arbitrator made an error of fact or law,the award can not be set aside on that basis.thus,the trial court properly confirmed the award and issued the writ of mandate.
background 
since,donald roberts has been employed by the bonita unified school district district.he began his employment as a maintenance mechanic and,in,became a lead maintenance mechanic in the district facilities department.roberts,a classified employee,was represented by the union,the california school employees association,bonita chapter csea.the district classified positions include certain jobs in the clerical,fiscal,maintenance,operations,food services,and transportation areas.classified employees are typically distinguished from certificated employees,who require a teaching certificate.see,subd.a.
on june,the district superintendent sent roberts a notice of termination and suspension without pay,specifying nine causes and reasons for suspending and discharging him.see.the causes included incompetence,dishonesty,insubordination,immoral conduct,evident unfitness for service,absent without authority,and violation of school laws.among the reasons were communicating regularly with staff members in rude,abusive,sexually explicit,and threatening language creating a sexually hostile work environment for two female employees refusing to do assigned duties failing to comply with supervisors directions permitting a subordinate to damage district equipment and to harass other maintenance department employees taking district property home for personal use destroying district property intimidating employees of the maintenance department on a regular basis and exposing the district to liability under state and federal antidiscrimination laws.the letter informed roberts that he would be suspended without pay effective upon the close of business on june,explaining that during the pendency of dismissal proceedings,you present an unreasonable risk of harm to district staff and district property.
roberts challenged the discipline through two methods.first,he requested a traditional hearing,authorized by statute,before the governing board.see,subd.c section c providing for hearing on disciplinary charges at option of employee.the proceeding would be conducted by a hearing officer appointed by the governing board.see district admin.the governing board would ultimately render a decision.see.
second,under the cba and the statute enacted in,e,roberts and the csea filed a grievance a claim that there exists an alleged violation,misinterpretation,or misapplication of the specific provision s of this agreement.cba.a grievance,if not informally resolved by the parties,is decided by an arbitrator,whose award stated in section of the cba final and binding.the cba also provided the arbitrator shall have no power to alter,amend,change,add to,or subtract from any of the terms of this agreement and shall therefore not have the authority to interpret or apply the agreement so as to change what can fairly be said to have been the intent of the parties as determined by generally accepted rules for contract construction.cba.further,p ast practice of the parties in interpreting or applying terms of this agreement may be relevant evidence cba.
under section of the cba,the district was required to use progressive discipline verbal counseling,verbal warning,written warning,and letter of shall not be bypassed unless the serious nature of the offense warrants it.that section continued whether or not the nature of the offense was so serious as to require bypassing progressive discipline steps may be submitted to arbitration.under section,a ctions for cause beyond a letter of reprimand including suspension and termination will be conducted in accordance with certain sections of the education code.
to streamline the decisionmaking process,the parties agreed to conduct the board hearing and the arbitration in a consolidated proceeding before a third party,richard calister,a labor disputes arbitrator.as memorialized in an august,letter from the district to the csea we agree that under the cba,if calister determines that the nature of the offenses against roberts is not so serious as to require bypassing progressive discipline steps,the termination decision can not stand we agree that under the cba,calister decision on whether progressive discipline can be bypassed will be binding on the parties and the governing board in accordance with the cba.however,once calister determines that the charges are sufficiently serious as to require bypassing progressive discipline steps,the matter is now covered by the education code calister now becomes the board hearing officer,and the balance of the hearing is not covered either by the rules of arbitration,or the district grievance procedure.the board is empowered by law to accept,reject or modify the findings and conclusions of the hearing officer.
calister conducted a evidentiary hearing on nonconsecutive days from september,to march.on july,he issued a award,concluding in part that t he nature of the offense s by roberts was not so serious as to require bypassing progressive discipline steps and in doing so the district violated section of the cba.calister also found that the only appropriate remedy is to effect the reinstatement of roberts to his former employment with back pay and benefits less interim earnings,if any.
as more fully explained in the arbitration award while it is clear that superintendent robert otto based his disciplinary determination upon his belief that roberts work interactions with supervisors and was markedly deficient and had been so for a considerable period of is no evidence that these were directly and properly addressed with roberts prior to otto making his determination that roberts employment should be summarily suspended and terminated.a careful review of the documentary evidence otto reviewed,weighed in light of the direct sworn testimony during this hearing of those making the allegations and roberts,does not support otto conclusion that roberts continued presence at work presented an unreasonable risk of harm to either district employees or its property so as to justify bypassing progressive discipline.the discipline imposed upon roberts simply does not comport with the mandates the district was under to utilize progressive and corrective discipline prior to imposing those disciplines.
in discussing the requirement of progressive discipline and the exception for serious offenses,calister stated what the cba contemplates as necessary to excuse the application of progressive discipline are some act or acts by an employee that are so outrageous and egregious as to either have required no prior warning that severe discipline would as an employee unprovoked forceful striking of a or supervisor,stealing district some similar outrageous conduct that any employee would or reasonably should know was not only prohibited,but would likely result in summary suspension and termination of their employment.the only alleged misbehavior of roberts that approaches this level of severity is associated with complaints by employees that they were legitimately fearful to be at work with him no employee should be required to work under conditions which are inherently unsafe and which pose an unreasonable risk to their health or safety.while unquestionably a number of employees presented otto with information expressing fear that roberts posed such a threat,a fair review of the evidence presented at this hearing in support of those allegations does not support a conclusion that the level of fear and apprehension expressed by them was reasonable and required that roberts be removed from district employment without the prior application of progressive discipline.
the arbitration award addressed the issue of credibility as follows the totality of testimony supports a conclusion that,at most,many employees found roberts to be unpleasant in his interactions with them,but none gave evidence that he behaved in a physically threatening manner towards them or uttered words which would reasonably lead them to conclude that his continued presence at work would be a legitimate threat to them.indeed,the major complaint related to their fear of roberts was the fact that he would have that look,unnecessarily glare at them which,coupled with their knowledge that he is a former united states marine and their belief that he maintained a collection of firearms,lead them to unreasonably conclude that roberts was literally ready to explode with violence against them.while roberts never denied his previous military service,he credibly denied and refuted any suggestion that he even made known whether he maintained firearms at his residence and there is absolutely no evidence that at any time roberts threatened any employee with violence of any kind,much less by use of firearms.while there was apparently a belief that roberts may have brought firearms to work in his vehicle,that again was unproven supposition,a rumor apparently believed by some employees,furthering their unsupportable conclusion that roberts presence at work was a threat to their safety and created a hostile work environment which could only be cured by permanently removing roberts from the workplace.to be fair to otto,he in significant part premised his determination that it was necessary to bypass progressive discipline and summarily terminate roberts employment upon the investigative summary reports he received which gave no assessment of the credibility of what was being reported.but at this hearing,the credibility of those employees and roberts was clearly before me for determination.
writing candidly,calister said while i readily acknowledge that i have no divining rod capable of separating truth from fabrication,i find a striking lack of credible evidence that roberts posed so serious a threat to the of other employees as to warrant his summary suspension and discharge without the prior application of progressive and corrective discipline.if,assuming employees were legitimately concerned about roberts at them,at the very least it was incumbent upon the district to make roberts aware that employees were apprehensive or fearful and thus provide roberts with an opportunity to which is at the very heart of the notion of progressive and corrective discipline which sanctions severe discipline only after an employee has been amply forewarned of the perceived misconduct and cautioned that unless it is corrected,discipline up to and including termination of employment will occur.
the award continued the other concerns otto had with roberts work from a serious lack of cooperation with supervision,failing to accomplish assigned work in a timely and correct manner,work performance inefficiencies including failure to properly coordinate the work of those assigned to him,to concerns that roberts engaged in use of abrasive,profane language and was demeaning in his remarks towards and plainly serious if true,all are of the kind and type that require the application of progressive and corrective discipline and do not,individually or collectively amount to behavior so egregious as to justify bypassing the cba mandate to apply progressive discipline.indeed,as to this litany of concerns which the district believes warrants discipline of roberts,it is striking that the record of this hearing contains no evidence that those deficiencies were brought to roberts attention in a timely manner that he was warned and admonished that unless they ceased and he improved,that he was crafting a path that would lead to his being disciplined,up to and including termination of his employment.
in his analysis,calister relied in part on the district failure to treat roberts alleged wrongdoing as serious,explaining the district alleged that roberts work activities and interactions involved his regularly communicating with,supervision and others using rude,obscene,vulgar,profane,sexually explicit and threatening language frankly,the record of this hearing is replete with the use of these kinds of remarks and dialogues by and among most of the male workers in the department and they occurred in locations and under circumstances where department management and supervision could not have been unaware it was occurring,but they did literally nothing to ensure that it stopped even when employees genuinely offended by it reported incidents to them.rampant inappropriate verbal bantering of these types were literally a daily event among roberts with department supervision apparently regarding it as a type of harmless idle chatter and teasing which was not inappropriate among an maintenance workforce which,to its credit if credit can ever be properly used in describing the use of such insults,apparently took care not to engage in while females,students or outside vendors were in the immediate area.management condoning of such behavior and then attempting to single out roberts for discipline for doing the same thing would be the height of impermissible disparate discipline.what emerges from a fair review of all evidence regarding the use of inappropriate,insulting and profane sexually charged language and behaviors was that the practice was rampant in the maintenance workforce and workplace,and roberts may not be fairly focused upon or disciplined for alleged participation in those behaviors.
the arbitration award then went into specifics pranks such as letting the air out of vehicle tires,placing and leaving rotting fish remains in vehicle interiors,spreading grease or other material on vehicle windshields and interior surfaces,sealing vehicle locks with glues,causing toilets to overflow while employees were seated on them,wrapping a vehicle with wire and chasing after attempting to pull down their pants,making and posting drawings and and sexually insulting posters including at least one of roberts were some of the childish pranks which regularly were allowed to occur among roberts with either the full knowledge of,if not participation in,by some who supervised roberts,or their negligent failure to be aware of these occurrences.while it is not for this hearing officer to lecture,if indeed responsible district management truly believes that such verbal and physical behaviors are not only wrong of themselves but dysfunctional to an effective workforce,then it needs to direct that a concerted and consistent effort be made to ensure employees that engaging in such activities is not only prohibited,but that to do so will lead to the application of progressive discipline which could result in loss of employment.suffice to say with respect to roberts,it would be entirely inappropriate to discipline him in any fashion based upon allegations of such misconduct by him.
the members of the governing board individually reviewed the arbitration award as well as the testimony and exhibits presented at the arbitration.on september,the board issued its own decision.it found that the arbitrator had exceeded his powers by improperly defining serious nature of the offense.see code civ,subd.a.relying on definitions from a dictionary,the board stated that the arbitrator had imposed his own personal definition of serious on the parties by equating serious offense with criminal act.the board expressly disagreed with that interpretation,concluding that roberts conduct was sufficiently serious to bypass progressive discipline.invoking its statutory authority,e,the board vacated the arbitration award.the board decided that roberts had been properly suspended and terminated.
on december,the csea and roberts collectively csea filed a verified petition in the trial court to confirm the arbitration award and to obtain a writ of mandate directing the district,board,and superintendent collectively board to reverse the board decision and provide the remedies set forth in the arbitration award.the board filed a verified answer.
subsequently,the csea filed points and authorities in support of its petition.the board filed papers in opposition.the administrative record was lodged.
the matter came on for hearing on may,and was taken under submission.on may,the trial court issued a statement of decision,confirming the arbitration award.on june,the trial court issued a writ of mandate directing the board to reverse its decision and to reinstate roberts with backpay and benefits.on the same day,the trial court filed a judgment,incorporating its statement of decision,granting the petition to confirm the arbitration award,and ordering the issuance of the writ.the board appealed.
discussion 
because this appeal involves the application of statutes to undisputed facts,we independently review the trial court decision.see emeryville redevelopment agency harcros pigments,th,d.
the board argues it was empowered by law to review the arbitration award under section of the code of civil procedure,and the arbitrator exceeded his powers by concluding that roberts wrongdoing was not sufficiently serious to bypass progressive discipline.in determining and applying its standard of it describes as not unfettered and not de novo the board did not treat the arbitration award as final and binding,believing that the final and binding provision in the cba was invalid under statutory and case law.this led to a board decision that failed to accord proper deference to the arbitration award.
we agree that the board had the authority to review the arbitration award but do not agree that the final and binding provision is invalid or that the arbitrator exceeded his powers in defining serious.the board offered no legitimate grounds for vacatur,and the trial court properly confirmed the award.
grounds to vacate an arbitration award 
the resolution of this appeal begins with an analysis of education code section,which provides in pertinent part a the governing board of a school district shall prescribe written rules and regulations,governing the personnel management of the classified service 
b any employee designated as a permanent employee shall be subject to disciplinary action only for cause as prescribed by rule or regulation of the governing board,but the governing board determination of the sufficiency of the cause for disciplinary action shall be conclusive.
c the governing board shall adopt rules of procedure for disciplinary proceedings which shall contain a provision for informing the employee by written notice of the specific charges against him or her,a statement of the employee right to a hearing on those charges,and the time within which the hearing may be requested 
e nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the governing board,pursuant to the terms of an agreement with an employee organization under chapter commencing with section of division of title of the government code,from delegating its authority to determine whether sufficient cause exists for disciplinary action against classified employees,excluding peace officers as defined in section of the penal code,to an impartial third party hearing officer.however,the governing board shall retain authority to review the determination under the standards set forth in section of the code of civil procedure.italics added.
as stated,roberts requested a hearing before the governing board on his suspension and termination.that type of hearing is governed by the regulations promulgated by the board.see district admin,c.the governing board appoints a hearing officer who,after the presentation of evidence,issues a recommended decision.see district admin.the board has the option of approving the hearing officer recommendation or making its own findings and conclusions.see ibid.either way,the governing board decision is,by statute,conclusive,subd.b section b see united steelworkers of america board of education d.united steelworkers turner board of trustees cal d,riggins board of education d,code civ.
roberts and the csea also exercised their right to file a grievance with the district,seeking to arbitrate the dispute under the cba.with this method of review,the parties select one person from a list provided by the american arbitration association aaa to serve as an impartial third party hearing officer,e see cba.the arbitrator is bound by the rules of the aaa.cba.under section of the cba,the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the district,the grievant and csea,with the exception of the board statutory authority to review the award under the arbitration act,specifically,section of the code of civil procedure see,e.
as relevant here,the arbitration act states that an arbitration award shall be vacated if any of the following applies 
the award was procured by corruption,fraud or other undue means.
there was corruption in any of the arbitrators.
the rights of the party were substantially prejudiced by misconduct of a neutral arbitrator.
the arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted.

validity of the cba arbitration provisions 
the board relies on board of education round valley teachers cal th,d,round valley,san mateo city school dist.public employment relations bd.cal d,san mateo,and united steelworkers,supra,d,for the proposition that the cba arbitration provisions are partially or totally invalid.not so.
round valley,supra,cal th,d,involved a provision in a collective bargaining agreement that required a school district to have just cause not to reelect a probationary teacher,mandated a statement of reasons for nonreelection,and established a grievance procedure to challenge nonreelection,with a hearing before an arbitrator.because education code section,subdivision b,permitted school districts to decline to reelect probationary teachers without a reason or hearing,the supreme court held that the bargaining agreement provision was in direct conflict with the education code and therefore invalid.accordingly,the trial court had properly vacated an arbitration award enforcing the provision.round valley,supra,cal th at,d,state personnel bd.department of personnel admin.cal th,d,statute authorizing arbitrator to review discipline of state employees in accordance with memorandum of understanding is invalid because state constitution vests state personnel board with authority to review disciplinary action.
in san mateo,supra,cal d,decided in,the high court determined whether the public employment relations board perb was correctly interpreting the educational employment relations act eera,as to what subjects could be included in a collective bargaining agreement between a school district and its employees.although the eera provided that t he scope of representation shall be limited to matters relating to wages,hours of employment,and other terms and conditions of employment,subd.a,the court agreed with perb that the subjects specifically listed in the statute were not all inclusive in light of the phrase matters relating to.san mateo,supra,cal d at.
the court noted,however,that the eera precluded a proposed contract clause that would replace,set aside,or annul a provision of the education code.san mateo,supra,cal d at,citing.as an example of such contract language,the court referred to section of the education code,which pertain s to causes and procedures leading to disciplinary action san mateo,at,saying,w here statutes are mandatory,as are these,a contract proposal which would alter the statutory scheme would be nonnegotiable because it would replace or set aside the section of the education code ibid.
in united steelworkers,supra,d,decided in,the court of appeal held that education code section particular,what is now subdivision b of that the governing board to make conclusive determinations regarding the discipline of classified employees,thereby rendering invalid a grievance procedure that allowed disciplinary disputes to be resolved through binding arbitration.see united steelworkers,supra,d at.the court also interpreted conclusive to mean that the governing board disciplinary decisions were,in essence,unreviewable in the courts.id.at.
as enacted in,education code section e permits classified employees to submit certain disciplinary disputes to arbitration pursuant to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.see stats,ch,stats,ch,amendments,deering ann.supp.foll.that is exactly what was done here.thus,united steelworkers and san mateo have been abrogated by statute to the extent they interpreted education code section b as a flat prohibition on the arbitration of disciplinary matters involving classified employees.whether there is continuing vitality to united steelworkers analysis of the conclusive nature of board hearings see,b is a question not before us.see united steelworkers,supra,d at.round valley,supra,cal th at,d,turner board of trustees,supra,cal d at,riggins board of education,supra,d at,code civ.for present purposes,it is sufficient to say that where,as here,the board reviews an arbitration award,judicial review of the board decision is available to ensure that the board complies with the arbitration act code civ,and protects the grievant rights.see round valley,supra,cal th at,d,code civ.
the parties in this case agreed that if the arbitrator determines that the nature of the offenses against roberts is not so serious as to require bypassing progressive discipline steps,the termination decision can not stand.the arbitrator so found.in addition,the arbitration award explained that any lesser discipline,such as verbal counseling or warnings,could not be imposed because the deadlines for such discipline,as dictated by the cba,had expired.
the board argues that education code section b invalidates the provision in the cba stating that the arbitration award shall be final and binding,apparently fearing that the provision narrows its review of the award.but nothing in the clear,unambiguous language of education code section b which governs board the cba final and binding provision,which applies to arbitration.and as more than one court has held,if an award is not final and binding,it is not an arbitration award.see saeta superior court th,d citing authorities moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,fn.moncharsh arbitration awards are final and binding even if parties agreement does not contain express provision to that effect.
further,a final and binding provision is not inconsistent with the statutory review of an arbitration award to determine if it should be vacated.in nonlabor contracts,that type of provision is common but does not bar judicial review of the award under the arbitration act.see,evans centerstone development th,d county coliseum authority cc partners th,fn,d delaney dahl th,d.and here,education code section e specifically authorizes the board to review an arbitration award under the statutory standards for vacatur code civ.
nevertheless,the board emphasizes that when education code section e was enacted,permitting classified employees to submit disciplinary disputes to arbitration,governor gray davis issued a press release stating that the arbitration award would be nonbinding.see governor press release.and in vetoing an earlier bill on the same subject,which did not provide for any board review of the arbitration award assem.bill reg.sess,governor davis wrote school district governing boards are given the responsibility to determine discipline for their classified employees and are held accountable for their actions.districts need to retain a wide range of authority in order to fully implement the state accountability objectives.responsibilities should not be delegated to an outside arbitrator the local voters can not hold accountable.governor veto message to assem.on assem.bill july,assem.reg.sess.
the board relies on this legislative history in arguing that the cba final and binding provision is invalid and that,as a result,it has broad discretion in reviewing an award under the arbitration act code civ.but given the universal finality of arbitration awards and the unmistakable language of education code section e,we conclude that the governor press release about the statute and his veto message addressing prior,substantially different legislation do not void the final and binding provision.see moncharsh,supra,cal th at fn,d.in determining what the legislature intended,it is that we must look first to the words of the statute,because they generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous our inquiry ends.if there is no ambiguity in the language,we presume the legislature meant what it said and the plain meaning of the statute governs.murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th,d,citation omitted see in re marriage of stephens d.where unambiguous language of statute conflicts with legislative counsel digest,statutory language controls.thus,education code section e is not a stealth prohibition on final and binding arbitration awards.
last,the board expresses concern about preserving its right to review disciplinary decisions under the hearing process authorized by education code section b and its own regulations see,c district admin.to be specific,the board appears to argue that the sufficiency of cause for discipline beyond a letter of and termination,as referenced in section of the not subject to arbitration,binding or otherwise.based on the facts and procedural history of this case,our holding is necessarily limited to the board authority to review an arbitration award where the parties dispute is confined to the serious offense exception to progressive discipline,as set forth in section of the cba.
as we read subdivisions b and e,respectively,of education code section,they authorize two distinct methods of challenging disciplinary action,the former under the auspices and regulations of the board,the latter by an arbitrator under the rules of the aaa and the provisions of the cba.here,the education code and the which the district was a roberts to pursue both methods,and he did.to simplify the process,the parties agreed to participate in a single proceeding in which calister would act as an arbitrator on a pr
