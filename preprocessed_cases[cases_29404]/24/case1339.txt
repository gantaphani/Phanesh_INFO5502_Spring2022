it is undisputed that a trial court may,in its discretion,refuse to compel arbitration between contracting parties where there are other individuals suing over the same matter and separate arbitration and court actions risk conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact.code civ,subd.c.the question presented here is whether the trial court is vested with comparable discretion when asked to compel a different form of alternative dispute resolution,trial by a private referee.code civ,et we conclude that the answer is yes.
there are several forms of alternative dispute resolution that contracting parties may use to settle disputes arising under their contract,including arbitration code civ,et and trial by a referee code civ,et.statutory law provides that an agreement to submit a controversy to arbitration shall be enforced unless specified circumstances exist.code civ.among those circumstances the court may refuse to enforce the arbitration agreement where a party to the arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court action with a third party,arising out of the same transaction or series of related transactions and there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact.code civ,subd.c.
the reference statute has a different structure.the reference statute does not have a general provision mandating enforcement followed by exceptions to enforcement,as does the arbitration statute.instead,the reference statute has a general provision making enforcement discretionary.a referee may be appointed if the court finds a reference agreement exists between the parties.code civ.
the question here is whether the trial court may refuse to enforce a reference agreement,as it may an arbitration agreement,where there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact.we conclude that the court has the discretion to refuse to enforce a reference agreement under these circumstances,or related considerations of judicial economy,and that no abuse of that discretion has been shown in this case.
spanish ranch i mobile home park the park is a hayward facility with sites.in october,current and former residents of the park sued the park owners upon allegations that the owners failed to properly maintain the common areas and facilities within the park,and otherwise subjected the residents to substandard living conditions.defendant monterey coast,is the current owner,and defendants tarrant bell property,llc,and spanish ranch i,are former owners.
in december,defendants moved to compel arbitration or,in the alternative,judicial reference.code civ.many of the plaintiffs had signed park leases containing an alternative dispute resolution adr provision.the parties dispute the exact number of plaintiffs subject to an adr lease provision.defendants put the number at while plaintiffs say.the exact number is not important here.it is sufficient to note that many,but not all,of the plaintiffs agreed to submit tenant disputes to adr 
there were several standard form leases used over the years at the park,with slight variation in the adr provisions,but those differences are not material.in substance,the leases state that it is agreed that any tenancy dispute with major exceptions for actions by the park owner shall be submitted to arbitration conducted under the provisions of code of civil procedure section et.dispute is defined to include claims regarding maintenance,condition,nature,or extent of the facilities,improvements,services,and utilities provided to the space,park or common areas of the park.the leases further state if these arbitration provisions are held unenforceable for any reason it is agreed that all arbitrable issues in any judicial proceeding will be subject to and referred on motion by any party or the court for hearing and decision by a referee a retired judge or other person appointed by the court as provided by california law,including code of civil procedure section,et costs for the arbitration or reference shall be advanced equally between the tenant and park owner.
plaintiffs opposed the motion to compel arbitration or reference on a number of grounds.plaintiffs argued that the adr provision is unenforceable as an invalid waiver of rights protected under the mobilehome residency law and law,subd.a,subd.a.plaintiffs also asserted that the adr provision is unconscionable because it exploits the weak bargaining position of mobile home residents and requires adr of the residents disputes while exempting unlawful detainer and other park owner actions from adr.finally,plaintiffs urged the court to refuse enforcement of the adr provision because its enforcement risked conflicting rulings on common issues of law and fact by sending the claims of some park residents to arbitration or reference,while others remained in the superior court for resolution.
in march,the court denied defendants motion to compel arbitration on two grounds the mobilehome residency law precludes waiver of a resident right to bring a civil action for a park improper maintenance of the common facilities,subd.a and there is the risk of inconsistent rulings on common issues code civ,subd.c.it will be recalled that the lease provided alternative forms of adr arbitration preferentially,but reference if the arbitration provisions are held unenforceable for any reason.the court,having held the arbitration provisions unenforceable,was asked by defendants to compel reference.
the court received supplemental briefing on defendants alternative request for reference and,in may,denied that request as well.the court found that sending some of the plaintiffs to a referee while others remained in the superior court risked inconsistent rulings.the court also found that splitting the action would defeat the purposes of the reference statute by duplicating efforts and increasing costs ordering two groups of plaintiffs to try their cases in separate but parallel proceedings would not reduce the burdens on this court or the parties,result in any cost savings,streamline the proceedings,or achieve efficiencies of any kind.the parties would be required to conduct the same discovery,litigate and ultimately try the same issues in separate but parallel forums.a general reference would thus result in a duplication of effort,increased costs,and potentially,delays in resolution.moreover,it would not reduce any burden on this court,which would almost certainly have to hear,and decide,all of the same issues.
defendants appealed the trial court march order denying their motion to compel arbitration,and that appeal is pending.code civ,subd.a.defendants also filed petitions for a writ of mandate to vacate the court may order denying their alternative motion to compel reference.we now turn to consideration of the merits of defendants petitions challenging the order denying reference.
ii.discussion 
parties may consent,either before or after a lawsuit commences,to appointment of a referee to hear and decide their dispute in whole or part.code civ,hereafter.section provides a referee may be appointed upon the agreement of the parties filed with the clerk,judge,or entered in the minutes,or upon motion of a party to a written contract or lease that provides that any controversy arising therefrom shall be heard by a referee if the court finds a reference agreement exists between the parties a to hear and determine any or all of the issues in an action or proceeding,whether of fact or of law,and to report a statement of decision.b to ascertain a fact necessary to enable the court to determine the action or proceeding.where a consensual reference is made,the court shall appoint as referee the person agreed upon by the parties and the referee fees shall be paid as agreed by the parties.code civ,subd.a.
we are here concerned with a predispute agreement in a lease that provides for a general reference with all issues to be decided by a referee.in a general reference,the referee prepares a statement of decision that stands as the decision of the court and is reviewable as if the court had rendered it.the primary effect of such a reference is to require trial by a referee and not by a court or jury.treo kettner homeowners superior court th,d.
a.a trial court has discretion to refuse enforcement of a predispute reference agreement 
section,by its plain terms,vests the trial court with discretion when the court is asked by a party to appoint a referee pursuant to a predispute reference agreement a referee may be appointed upon the motion of a party to a written contract or lease that provides that any controversy arising therefrom shall be heard by a referee.italics added.our role as judges is to effectuate legislative intent,and statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.miklosy regents of the university of california cal th,d.if the statutory language is unambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute controls.ibid.the word may usually denotes permissive action,in contrast to shall,which is ordinarily used in laws to express what is mandatory.hogya superior court d.the legislature is well aware of the distinction between the words shall and may.ibid.in interpreting the meaning of may in section,it is also significant that the legislature used both shall and may in legislating the use of trials by referees by,for example,stating that the court may appoint a referee pursuant to the parties predispute agreement while providing that the selection and payment of the referee shall be as agreed by the parties.code civ,subd.a.when the legislature has,as here,used both shall and may in close proximity in a particular context,we may fairly infer the legislature intended mandatory and discretionary meanings,respectively.in re richard cal d.
defendants argue that the trial court has no discretion to deny a motion to compel reference once a party requests reference and demonstrates the existence of a reference agreement.the permissive language of section,according to defendants,relates to the moving party desire for reference and not the court authority.it is the parties who may or may not request a reference.the court itself has no discretion in the matter and must order the reference if elected by the parties,defendants contend.defendants interpretation is contrary to the plain language of section.the statute provides,in relevant part a referee may be appointed upon the motion of a party to a written contract or lease that provides that any controversy arising therefrom shall be heard by a referee if the court finds a reference agreement exists between the parties.the statute does not say that a party may move for trial by referee but that the court may appoint a referee upon a party motion.the permissive language relates to the court conduct,not the parties conduct.respected commentators have so interpreted section the statutes authorizing appointment of referees make the appointment discretionary,not mandatory.knight et,cal.practice guide alternative dispute resolution the rutter group.
the legislative history of section confirms that the legislature meant to empower the trial court with discretionary authority to refuse enforcement of a reference agreement.while the statutory language is clear in expressing this legislative intent,we may also look to legislative history to confirm our construction of statutory language.hughes pair cal th,d.here,legislative intent on this point is unmistakable.
prior to,section authorized a court to order trial by referee upon the present agreement of parties to pending litigation.legis.counsel,assem.bill sess.summary.section was amended in to authorize a court to order trial by referee upon a predispute reference agreement when one of the parties moved to enforce the agreement.stats,ch.the state bar of california sponsored the bill to amend section and urged its adoption,arguing that this bill is needed because there is no present procedure for compelling a reference if one party unilaterally decides not to abide by a prior agreement that any dispute may be submitted to a referee.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill sess.april.the bill sponsor argued that court congestion makes reference an attractive remedy.ibid.
importantly,the bill as originally introduced required the court to enforce predispute reference agreements and was amended to give the court discretion to decide whether to enforce such agreements.the original version of the bill contained a separate paragraph on predispute reference agreements,stating parties to a written contract or lease may provide that any controversy arising therefrom will be heard by a reference and any party to such an agreement may move the court to compel the reference.if the court finds a reference agreement existing between the parties,the reference shall be ordered.assem.bill sess.march,italics added.an assembly committee report noted that law provided that a court may order a reference upon agreement of the parties and that the proposed bill would require a court to compel a reference if there is a agreement to refer.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill sess.april.committee staff commented should not the court have the discretion to decide that,despite the existence of the agreement,the issues would be more properly or efficiently decided by the judge therefore,should not this bill simply create a presumption that a court should compel a reference when parties have contractually agreed to one,thereby permitting the court to determine that such a reference would be inappropriate id.at.the legislators embraced this recommendation.the bill was amended to delete the mandatory language of the bill as originally introduced,and to use permissive language.assem.amend.to assem.bill sess.may.the amendment deleted the separate paragraph quoted above relating to predispute reference agreements and incorporated predispute agreements into the existing discretionary provision governing postdispute reference agreements.ibid.section was thus amended to read as it does now,in substantial form a reference may be ordered upon the agreement of the parties filed with the clerk,or judge,or entered in the minutes or in the docket,or upon the motion of a party to a written contract or lease which provides that any controversy arising therefrom shall be heard by a reference if the court finds a reference agreement exists between the parties.assem.amend.to assem.bill sess.may,original italics.the legislative history thus confirms that the legislature specifically intended to vest courts with discretion to deny predispute reference agreements,just as the court has discretion to deny postdispute reference agreements.
b.a trial court may consider the risk of inconsistent rulings and judicial economy in deciding whether to enforce a reference agreement 
defendants next argue that any discretion the court has to deny appointment of a referee is not unbounded.we agree.a trial court discretion is never unbounded.in its discretion is not the equivalent of if it wants to or if it feels like it.horsford board of trustees of california state university th,d.the scope of judicial discretion must be measured against the general rules of law and,in the case of a statutory grant of discretion,against the specific law that grants the discretion.id.at,d accord westside community for independent living,obledo cal d.discretion should be exercised in a manner that best effectuates the purposes of the law granting the discretion.horsford,supra,at,d.
the question thus becomes whether the grounds given by the court for its refusal to appoint a referee are consistent with the substantive law of section,read in light of the purposes and policy of the statute.see city of sacramento drew d.applying methodology to determine if court exceeded scope of statutory discretion.the court denied appointment of a referee upon finding that sending some of the plaintiffs to a referee while others remained in the superior court risked inconsistent rulings.the court also found that splitting the action would defeat the purposes of the reference statute by duplicating efforts and increasing costs ordering two groups of plaintiffs to try their cases in separate but parallel proceedings would not reduce the bu
