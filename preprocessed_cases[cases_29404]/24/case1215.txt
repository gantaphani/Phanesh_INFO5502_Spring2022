code of civil procedure section,subdivision c permits a trial court,under specified circumstances,to stay arbitration pending the outcome of related litigation.in volt information sciences,board of trustees of leland stanford junior,d volt,the united states supreme court held that the federal arbitration act faa,et,which applies to and favors the enforcement of arbitration agreements affecting interstate commerce,does not preempt the application of section,subdivision c where the parties have agreed that their arbitration agreement would be governed by the law of california.in this case,the parties agreed that their arbitration agreement would be governed by california law,but they further agreed that the designation of california law shall not be deemed an election to preclude application of the faa,if it would be applicable.as explained below,we conclude that,in this situation,the faa also does not preempt the application of section,subdivision c.
facts and procedural history 
in july,howard colman transferred a business,services,to a newly created company,concierge services,llc concierge.cronus investments,cronus,which is wholly owned by colman,has a percent interest in concierge,while westrec marina management,westrec owns the remaining interest.the transactions involved six agreements a limited liability company llc agreement between cronus and westrec,which created concierge a stock purchase agreement by which concierge bought the stock in colman preexisting company,an employment agreement by which concierge employed colman as its president a covenant not to compete and confidentiality agreement between colman and concierge a consulting agreement between cronus and concierge and a guaranty agreement executed by westrec of a promissory note payable by concierge to colman.
four of the six agreements provide for the arbitration of any disputes between the parties arising out of,in connection with,or in relation to the interpretation,performance or breach of this agreement the arbitration clause further specifies the designation of a situs or specifically a governing law for this agreement or the arbitration shall not be deemed an election to preclude application of the faa,if it would be applicable.the agreements also contained a clause providing that t his agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with and governed by the laws of the state of california,without giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions thereof.
problems arose after the execution of the agreements,resulting in colman discharge from his employment with concierge.on march,cronus sued concierge,westrec,westrec contracting,llc an affiliate of westrec,michael sachs chief executive officer of westrec,and william anderson and michael robbins principals in westrec.the complaint asserted claims for breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,conversion and fraud.after cronus filed its complaint,colman and cronus submitted a demand for arbitration to the american arbitration association aaa under the arbitration clauses in the underlying agreements.
concierge then filed a against colman,cronus,nelson colman colman father,and desert home services,desert,which is operated by nelson colman.the asserted claims for breach of contract,fiduciary fraud,unjust enrichment,and inducement of breach of contract.it alleged that colman and cronus improperly diverted business from concierge to colman father and desert.
colman and cronus then petitioned the superior court,under sections and,to stay the litigation and compel arbitration,contending that they had already demanded arbitration and that some of the implicated agreements containing an arbitration clause.
defendants,in turn,moved to stay the arbitration pending the outcome of litigation and to consolidate the arbitration proceeding with the underlying action under section,subdivision c section c.the trial court determined that some of the causes of action and controversies in the underlying action were not subject to arbitration only three of the eight were arbitrable some of the litigants were not parties to agreements containing an arbitration agreement and the lawsuit and arbitration proceedings contained overlapping issues of fact and law.to avoid the possibility of contradictory outcomes and promote efficiency in the resolution of disputes,the court denied the petition to stay litigation and compel arbitration,granted the motion to stay the arbitration proceedings pending outcome of the litigation,and consolidated the three arbitrable with the action for all purposes.
the court of appeal affirmed the trial court ruling.first,as a matter of contract interpretation,the court of appeal found that the not preclude language of the arbitration clause superseded the broader and more general provision and concluded that the parties intended that the faa apply to the fullest extent and without limitation in those contracts containing arbitration agreements.second,the court of appeal analogized a trial court authority to stay arbitration proceedings c to a court authority to stay lawsuits when resolving problems of multiple litigation,subd.a and found that section c is a neutral law derived from equitable principles applicable to all contracts.the court thus determined that,because section c on its face is an evenhanded application of state principles addressing the general problem of multiple litigation,the faa does not preempt its application.
in their petition for review,plaintiff cronus and colman hereafter appellants claim that the court of appeal erred in concluding that the faa does not preempt the application of section c.defendants hereafter respondents filed an answer to the petition,requesting that we determine whether the parties intended to incorporate section c into the arbitration agreements and whether the faa procedural rules apply in california courts.without limiting the issues,we granted review to determine,in this case,whether the faa preempts the application of section c.
discussion 
section c requires a court to order arbitration upon petition by one of the parties to an arbitration agreement,unless the court determines that c a party to the arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court action with a third party,arising out of the same transaction or series of related transactions and there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact.if the court makes such a determination,it 
may refuse to enforce the arbitration agreement and may order intervention or joinder of all parties in a single action may order intervention or joinder as to all or only certain issues may order arbitration among the parties who have agreed to arbitration and stay the pending court action pending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding or may stay arbitration pending the outcome of the court action 
the parties do not dispute that this case comes within the exception to the general rule of arbitration enforcement specified in section c.three of the parties to the court action concierge,colman,and cronus are parties to arbitrable agreements and the arbitration proceeding.but,the other seven parties to the court action westrec,westrec contracting,sachs,anderson,robbins,nelson colman,and desert are not parties to any arbitration agreement and thus are not amenable to arbitration.none of the parties appear to dispute that many of the claims in the lawsuit are nonarbitrable.on the other hand,the parties do dispute whether they intended that section c procedures would govern the enforcement of those contracts that contain the arbitration provisions.
under united states supreme court jurisprudence,we examine the language of the contract to determine whether the parties intended to apply the faa to the exclusion of california procedural law and,if any ambiguity exists,to determine whether section c conflicts with or frustrates the objectives of the faa.we first examine the underlying purpose of and the rights created by the faa and the applicable preemption principles.
a.the faa purpose 
in,congress passed the faa to overrule the judiciary longstanding refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate and to place such agreements upon the same footing as other contracts,where it belongs.citation.dean witter reynolds byrd,d byrd.the federal statute rests on the authority of congress to enact substantive rules under the commerce clause,requiring courts to enforce arbitration agreements in contracts involving interstate commerce.southland keating,d keating.here,the parties agree that the contracts at issue involve interstate commerce and,thus,fall within the coverage of the faa.
section,the primary substantive provision of the faa,provides a written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.
section is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary.the effect of the section is to create a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability,applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the act.moses cone memorial hospital mercury constr,d moses cone.thus,the faa establishes that,as a matter of federal law,any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver,delay,or a like defense to arbitrability.moses cone,supra,at.the policy of enforceability established by section of the faa is binding on state courts as well as federal courts.rosenthal great western fin.securities cal th,d,rosenthal.
however,the faa purpose is not to provide special status for arbitration agreements,but only to make arbitration agreements as enforceable as other contracts,but not more so.prima paint flood conklin,fn,d.in accord with this purpose,the high court has stated that state contract rules generally govern the construction of arbitration agreements.see,doctor associates,casarotto,d doctor associates s tate law,whether of legislative or judicial origin,is applicable if that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity,revocability,and enforceability of contracts generally first options of chicago,kaplan,d state law principles governing formation of contracts generally apply in deciding arbitrability issue terminix dobson,d states may regulate contracts,including arbitration clauses,under general contract law principles.t he federal policy is simply to ensure the enforceability,according to their terms,of private agreements to arbitrate.volt,supra,at.thus,the faa does not force parties to arbitrate when they have not agreed to do so see byrd,supra,at.or require them to do so under any specific set of procedural rules volt,supra,at.arbitration under the act is a matter of consent,not coercion,and parties are generally free to structure their arbitration agreements as they see fit.just as they may limit by contract the issues which they will arbitrate citation,so too may they specify by contract the rules under which that arbitration will be conducted.volt,supra,at.
preemption 
the faa contains no express provision,nor does it reflect a congressional intent to occupy the entire field of arbitration.citation.but even when congress has not completely displaced state regulation in an area,state law may nonetheless be to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal is,to the extent that it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.citation.volt,supra,at.
to ensure that arbitration agreements are enforced according to their terms,the faa preempts all state laws that apply of their own force to limit those agreements against the parties will or to withdraw the power to enforce them.see,perry thomas,d faa preempted california statute that rendered private agreements to arbitrate wage collection claims unenforceable by requiring judicial forum for resolution of those claims keating,supra,at.fn.faa preempted california statute that rendered agreements to arbitrate certain franchise claims unenforceable by requiring judicial forum for resolution of those claims.although state law may be applied to regulate contracts,including arbitration clauses,if that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity,revocability,and enforceability of contracts generally,citation courts may not invalidate arbitration agreements under state law contract principles applicable only to arbitration provisions,and that therefore disfavor such contracts,or single them out for suspect status.doctor associates,supra,at.for example,the high court found that a montana statute that made arbitration clauses unenforceable unless the contract provided notice of the arbitration clause in underlined capital letters on the first page of the contract directly conflicted with the faa the state law conditioned the enforceability of arbitration agreements on a notice requirement not applicable to contracts generally.doctor associates,supra,at.only generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening of the faa.doctor associates,supra,at.
in addition,the faa establishes a prophylactic rule governing ambiguities in arbitration clauses.section of the faa,applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the act,requires that questions of arbitrability be addressed with a healthy regard for the federal policy favoring arbitration.moses cone,supra,at.any doubts or ambiguities as to the scope of the arbitration clause itself should be resolved in favor of arbitration.id.at.see also volt,supra,at.
volt involved the application of section c to a lawsuit with interrelated arbitrable and nonarbitrable claims and parties who were not subject to the arbitration agreement at issue.the underlying contract,which covered the installation of an electrical system on the stanford university campus,contained an agreement to arbitrate all disputes between the parties arising out of or relating to this contract or the breach thereof.the contract also contained a provision that the contract shall be governed by the law of the place where the project is located,which was california.after disputes arose,volt demanded arbitration.stanford,in turn,filed an action in the california superior court against volt and other companies involved in the construction project with whom it did not have arbitration agreements.the trial court,ruling on stanford motion to stay the arbitration and volt motion to compel arbitration and stay the lawsuit,stayed the arbitration under section c.volt,supra,at.
the california court of appeal affirmed the trial court ruling,concluding that the provision incorporated california rules of arbitration into the contract.volt,supra,at.after acknowledging that the interpretation of private contracts is ordinarily a question of state law,which this court does not sit to review,the high court accepted the court of appeal construction that the provision incorporated the state arbitration laws,including section c.volt,supra,at.the court held that application of the california statute to stay arbitration would not undermine the goals and policies of,and is not preempted by,the faa in a case where the parties have agreed that their arbitration agreement will be governed by the law of california.volt,supra,at.there is no federal policy favoring arbitration under a certain set of procedural rules the federal policy is simply to ensure the enforceability,according to their terms,of private agreements to arbitrate.id.at.
d.the and arbitration clauses in this case.
in this case,the clause provides this agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with and governed by the laws of the state of california,without giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions thereof.the parties seem to agree that the broad provision generally incorporates california law,including the california arbitration act caa et,of which section c is a part.
mount diablo medical center health net of california,th,d mount diablo in which the provision was similar to the one their interpretation.there,the court stated the provision in the present case may be generic in the sense that it does not mention arbitration or any other specific issue that might become a subject of controversy,but it is nonetheless broad,unqualified and.it provides that the validity,construction,interpretation and enforcement of this agreement shall be governed by california law.the explicit reference to enforcement reasonably includes such matters as whether proceedings to enforce the agreement shall occur in court or before an arbitrator.chapter in which appears of title of part iii of the california code of civil procedure is captioned enforcement of arbitration agreements.an interpretation of the provision to exclude reference to this chapter would be strained at best.mount diablo,supra,th at,d.
thus,we agree that the is substantially similar to the provisions in mount diablo and california rules of arbitration into the contract.however,the contracts at issue in mount diablo and volt did not contain the arbitration clause here,which states the designation of a situs or specifically a governing law for this agreement or the arbitration shall not be deemed an election to preclude application of the faa,if it would be applicable.the parties agree that,as specified in the arbitration clause,the scope of the choice of law provision is specifically limited by applicable provisions of the faa and is nullified only where the faa provisions are inconsistent with the caa.respondents contend that the procedural rules of section c do not conflict with the faa procedural they do not apply in state with its substantive provision.appellants respond that we need not determine whether section c conflicts with the procedural provisions of the faa because application of section c would,nevertheless,contravene the substantive goals and policies of the faa.because we disagree with appellant premise,we first decide whether the procedural provisions of the faa conflict with section c.
section of the faa concerns the enforcement of arbitration agreements in a pending lawsuit.it requires the courts of the united states to grant a party request for a stay of litigation on an arbitrable issue,pending completion of the arbitration.section of the faa concerns petitions for enforcement of an arbitration agreement where one party refuses to arbitrate.it requires a united states district court to entertain an application to compel arbitration.
the language used in sections and and the legislative history of the faa suggest that the sections were intended to apply only in federal court proceedings.section refers to the united states district court and provides that it can be invoked only in a court that has jurisdiction under title of the united states code.this language indicates that congress intended to limit the application of the section to federal courts.in,as a purely clerical change,congress inserted united states district court in as a substitute for court of the united states.act of,ch,stat.both house and senate reports explained united states district court was substituted for court of the united states because,among federal courts,such a proceeding would be brought only in a district court.keating,supra,at,fn.dis.opn.of.
although united states code section is less clear,it would appear that courts of the united states under section means federal district courts,because state courts are courts in but not of the united states as commonly designated in federal law.keating,supra,at,fn.dis.opn.of.because sections and constitute part of the same enforcement scheme under the faa,the language in both sections should be interpreted consistently.keating,supra,at,fn.dis.opn.of,applies when the party resisting arbitration initiates the action applies to actions initiated by the party seeking to enforce an arbitration provision.moreover,before the minor amendment in section phrasing,a s originally enacted,referred,in the same terms as,to courts or court of the united states.keating,supra,at.dis.opn.of.the legislative history of the original enactment further suggests that sections and were intended to regulate federal procedures for the enforcement of arbitration agreements thus,the identical phrasing in the faa original procedural provisions together with its legislative history reflects a congressional intent that the two sections apply to federal courts.
further,the united states supreme court does not read the faa procedural provisions to apply to state court proceedings.w e do not hold that and of the arbitration act apply to proceedings in state courts.section,for example,provides that the federal rules of civil procedure apply in proceedings to compel arbitration.the federal rules do not apply in such state court proceedings.keating,supra,at,fn.in volt,the high court later confirmed that,while we have held the faa substantive provisions and applicable in state as well as federal court citation,we have never held that and,which by their terms appear to apply only to proceedings in federal court citations,are nonetheless applicable in state court.volt,supra,at,fn.reaffirming volt distinction between the procedural and substantive aspects of the faa,the court further described section c as determin ing only the efficient order of proceedings and not affect ing the enforceability of the arbitration agreement itself.doctor associates,supra,at.
finally,our interpretation that the procedural provisions of the faa and section do not conflict is consistent with our prior decision in rosenthal.rosenthal,supra,cal th,d.rosenthal dealt with the differences between the procedural provisions in section of the faa,designating that a jury decides the existence and validity of an arbitration agreement,and sections and,designating that a court decides that issue.we determined that the wording of section suggests it is limited to federal courts and the state procedural rules do not frustrate or defeat section policy of enforcement of arbitration agreements.rosenthal,supra,cal th at,d.we explained that t he federal policy of ensuring enforcement of private arbitration agreements,centrally embodied in section,is not its effectuation requires that courts have available some procedure by which a party seeking arbitration may compel a resisting party to arbitrate.section of the faa establishes one such procedure state law may or may not provide for other equivalent or similar procedures.rosenthal,supra,cal th at,d.like other federal procedural rules,therefore,the procedural provisions of the faa are not binding on state courts provided applicable state procedures do not defeat the rights granted by congress.citation.rosenthal,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.our statutes do establish procedures for determining enforceability not applicable to contracts generally,but they do not thereby run afoul of the faa section,which states the principle of equal enforceability,but does not dictate the procedures for determining enforceability.rosenthal,supra,cal th at,d.
appellants rely on specific language in volt and on the holdings of byrd and moses cone.volt stated where,as here,the parties have agreed to abide by state rules of arbitration,enforcing those rules according to the terms of the agreement is fully consistent with the goals of the faa,even if the result is that arbitration is stayed where the act would otherwise permit it to go forward.volt,supra,at.italics added.appellants argue that,in the absence of the state provision in volt,the volt court would have found that the faa preempts section c.however,in volt,the high court,for purposes of argument,simply assumed that the procedural rules of the faa and applied in state courts.volt,supra,at.we conclude that even if and of the faa are fully applicable in state court proceedings,they do not prevent application of code civ.proc.c to stay arbitration where,as here,the parties have agreed to arbitrate in accordance with california law.
similarly,in byrd and moses cone federal diversity cases,the
