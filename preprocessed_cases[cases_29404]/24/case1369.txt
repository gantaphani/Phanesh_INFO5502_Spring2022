facts and procedural background 
plaintiffs are seven registered representatives of the financial industry regulatory authority finra previously known as the national association of securities dealers or nasd.before this litigation arose,each plaintiff had been employed by defendants on a commission basis to assist clients with property transfers eligible for exchanges under the internal revenue code.each plaintiff had executed a registered representative agreement with defendants that included a clause declaring,any controversies or claims arising out of or relating to this agreement,or breach thereof,shall be resolved in arbitration in accordance with the code of arbitration procedures of the nasd 
this litigation arose from a dispute over plaintiffs commissions.plaintiffs left defendants employ and sued to recover the amount they believed was due under their respective contracts with defendants.defendants filed a against plaintiffs and also obtained a preliminary injunction that prohibited plaintiffs from soliciting defendants current and prospective clients,the issuance of which this court upheld in a prior appeal.mcl financial group,bak may,unpub.opn.
while the prior appeal was pending,the trial court issued a stay of the lawsuit and directed the parties dispute be arbitrated before a panel appointed by the finra.during a prehearing document production and information exchange,plaintiffs delivered documents to defendants.after doing so,plaintiffs discovered the material included pages of documents they claimed were subject to the privilege.plaintiffs sent defendants a letter informing them of the privileged documents,claiming they had been inadvertently produced,and demanding defendants return them immediately 
defendants returned the privileged material.but objector claims that before doing so,he made a cursory review of the documents,copied them,and then placed the copies in a sealed envelope,which he sent to a staff attorney with finra who was handling the case.objector also admits he create d a spreadsheet outlining key information culled from the limited information reviewed 
plaintiffs filed an emergency motion with the arbitrators for an order prohibiting defendants from using the privileged documents and seeking destruction of the documents unilaterally sent to finra objector filed a response for defendants,acknowledging they had agreed not to use the privileged documents he further claimed copying the documents was appropriate.
after a hearing,the panel issued an order that directed objector to pay plaintiffs counsel the sum of as a sanction for the copying of privileged documents and to execute an affidavit that neither he nor anyone in his office retained copies of the privileged material,that they did not give copies to anyone else,and that no other copies of the documents exist.objector submitted the requested affidavit.he also twice unsuccessfully sought reconsideration of the sanctions award.
ultimately,the arbitration panel conducted a hearing on the underlying issues and issued an award.in part,the award vacated a ll preliminary injunctions and confirmed the sanctions order issued against objector.
plaintiffs petitioned to confirm the award.defendants opposed the request and filed a petition to vacate the award,in part citing the sanctions order as a reason to do so.the trial court struck the portion of the arbitration award that vacated the preliminary injunction,but otherwise granted plaintiffs petition and entered a judgment confirming it with the sanctions order.by subsequent order the court also dissolved the preliminary injunction.
discussion 
judgment confirming the arbitration award 
relying on code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,objector argues the arbitration panel exceeded its powers by imposing sanctions on him and thus the trial court erred by confirming the arbitration award without vacating the sanctions.
first,we note objector relies on the wrong statutory remedy.code of civil procedure section authorizes the court to vacate the award if it determines one of the grounds listed therein exists.code civ,subd.a.here objector does not challenge the entire arbitration award.he asks only to vacate that portion of the a ward which upheld the s anctions o rder bold omitted.consequently,what he really seeks is a reversal of the judgment to correct the award and confirm it as corrected under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,which allows a court to do so when t he arbitrators exceeded their powers but the award may be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted 
objector asserts three grounds for his contention the trial court erred by not eliminating the sanctions order from the arbitration award.first he argues,because he merely appeared as an attorney for one of the parties to the arbitration,the panel lacked the authority to sanction him.second,he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the panel ruling.third,he contends the sanctions are invalid because the panel failed to comply with the requirements of code of civil procedure section before sanctioning him.
