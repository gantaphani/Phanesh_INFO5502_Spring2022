background 
in,research genetics,research genetics was the exclusive worldwide licensee of german patent number and corresponding patents and patent applications in the united states,europe,and japan collectively,the licensed patents relating to genetic identification,including patent no.the patent.on june,research genetics entered into a license agreement the agreement with promega which granted promega an exclusive,worldwide,license under the licensed patents for the human genetic identity market and the human clinical market and a nonexclusive license under the licensed patents for all other uses other than those exclusively reserved to research genetics.under the terms of the agreement,promega was required to pay research genetics an initial license issue fee and a royalty on all products sold pursuant to the exclusive license grant.additionally,under section of the agreement,promega had the right to sublicense the licensed patents.additionally,section of the agreement included an arbitration clause which provided that a ll controversies or disputes arising out of or relating to this agreement,or relating to the breach thereof,shall be resolved by arbitration.
the agreement also provided that the agreement could not be assigned by either party without the express written consent of the other party.in,in connection with research genetics merger into its parent company,invitrogen corporation invitrogen,promega granted written consent to assign research genetics rights under the agreement to invitrogen.in,promega granted invitrogen written consent to assign its rights under the agreement to ip holdings,a subsidiary of invitrogen.on november,invitrogen merged with applied biosystems ab,one of promega sublicensees,and changed its name to life technologies corporation life technologies.ip holdings remained a wholly owned subsidiary of life technologies.
after the merger with ab,life technologies obtained information that led it to conclude that promega had been paying less than it was required to pay on promega sublicensees sales of products incorporating the licensed patents.life technologies subsequently notified promega of its alleged noncompliance with the terms of the agreement.promega disagreed with life technologies calculation of the royalties due.after negotiations between the parties failed to resolve the issue,on may,life technologies demanded arbitration pursuant to section of the agreement,contending that promega failed to comply with section of the agreement and demanding an accounting of all sales of the licensed technology by promega sublicensees.
rather than submit to arbitration,on may,promega filed suit against life technologies in the united states district court for the western district of wisconsin,seeking a declaratory judgment of of life technologies claims under the agreement,and alleging,inter alia,infringement of five united states patents,including the patent.specifically,promega contended that the rights under the agreement had never been assigned to life technologies,and that life technologies was therefore not entitled to demand arbitration.in the course of preparing its responses to promega filings,life technologies discovered that ip holdings had not assigned its rights under the agreement to life technologies.accordingly,ip holdings served promega with a demand for arbitration on behalf of ip holdings.ip holdings also filed a motion to compel arbitration.
in response to ip holdings motion to compel arbitration,promega argued,inter alia,that there was a substantial question as to the continued existence of ip holdings and its authority to demand arbitration.in particular,promega alleged that it had been informed by life technologies that ip holdings was to be dissolved the district court denied ip holdings motion to compel arbitration without prejudice to allow for limited discovery on the questions of whether ip holdings was the current assignee of the agreement and whether ip holdings maintained its legal existence.during the course of discovery,ip holdings produced documentation demonstrating that invitrogen had assigned its rights under the agreement to ip holdings that promega had consented to the assignment and that ip holdings had not been dissolved and remained a corporation in good standing.following this limited discovery,ip holdings filed a second motion to compel arbitration.
on february,the district court entered an order compelling arbitration between promega and ip holdings with respect to those claims relating to the agreement.in its order,the district court found that ip holdings was the assignee of the agreement,remained in existence,and that it was irrelevant that promega alleged that ip holdings was merely a puppet of life technologies,noting that promega cite d no authority for the proposition that a corporation can not assert rights under a contract unless it has offices and employees or if all of its actions are directed by a parent company.arbitration order,slip op.at.the court further rejected the proposition that because ip holdings had intended to assign its rights to life technologies and because promega had not consented to that assignment,ip holdings could no longer demand arbitration.following the district court order compelling arbitration,promega infringement claims against life technologies and ab,as well as other claims relating to a separate agreement between promega and ab,remained pending before the district court.the district court order was certified as a final order pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.
