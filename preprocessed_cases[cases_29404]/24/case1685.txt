this is an interlocutory appeal of a trial court order denying an employer motion to compel arbitration under the company alternative dispute resolution policy.we recently held that arbitration agreements between an employer and an employee are enforceable when there is an agreement that is valid under traditional contract principles.in re halliburton.here,we consider whether an arbitration agreement between an employer and an employee is enforceable if the employer reserves the unilateral right to modify or terminate personnel policies without notice.the trial court denied the employer motion to compel arbitration,and the court of appeals affirmed.
we conclude that the arbitration agreement is ambiguous because it is not possible to determine from the document itself whether the unilateral termination right applies to the parties agreement to arbitrate,or only to personnel policies concerning the employment relationship.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

in november,webster was injured at work and subsequently filed a workers compensation claim.although his condition improved temporarily,his doctor eventually placed him on no work status.shortly thereafter,webster employment with davidson ceased.the parties dispute whether webster quit or was terminated.
webster sued davidson for wrongful termination under section of the texas labor code,alleging he was terminated in retaliation for filing a workers compensation claim.see.lab.code.davidson denied webster allegations and filed a motion to compel binding arbitration under the company alternative dispute resolution policy.webster responded that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable because it was illusory,unconscionable,and lacked mutuality.following a hearing,the trial court denied davidson motion without explanation.
davidson then filed an interlocutory appeal seeking to compel arbitration under the texas arbitration act,and a mandamus action to compel arbitration pursuant to the federal arbitration act.the court of appeals denied the petition for writ of mandamus,held that the arbitration agreement was illusory,and affirmed the trial court order denying davidson motion to compel arbitration.one justice dissented,concluding that the arbitration agreement was enforceable because both parties mutually agreed to arbitrate workplace injury disputes.id.at.the dissent observed that the reservation the company unilateral right to modify or terminate personnel policies without not render davidson promise illusory,because it was separable from the promise to arbitrate.id.at.
davidson asks us to reverse the court of appeals judgment and order the trial court to stay the trial pending binding arbitration pursuant to the texas arbitration act see.civ.prac.rem.code.
standard of review 
a party attempting to compel arbitration must first establish that the dispute in question falls within the scope of a valid arbitration agreement.in re oakwood mobile homes.if the other party resists arbitration,the trial court must determine whether a valid agreement to arbitrate exists.civ.prac.rem.code.the trial court determination of the arbitration agreement validity is a legal question subject to de novo review.in re kellogg brown root,dist,orig.proceeding.if the trial court finds a valid agreement,the burden shifts to the party opposing arbitration to raise an affirmative defense to enforcing arbitration.oakwood,at.
although we have repeatedly expressed a strong presumption favoring arbitration,the presumption arises only after the party seeking to compel arbitration proves that a valid arbitration agreement exists.see,prudential,marshall,high valley homes,fudge,wl,at april,no pet.memorandum opinion see also fleetwood,gaskamp,cir federal policy favoring arbitration does not apply to the determination of whether there is a valid agreement to arbitrate instead,ordinary contract principles are applied.arbitration agreements are interpreted under traditional contract principles.jenkens gilchrist riggs,no pet.pepe int l dev.pub brewing,dist,no writ see also first options of chicago,kaplan,d holding that,when deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate,courts generally should apply ordinary principles that govern the formation of contracts.thus,an employer attempting to enforce an arbitration agreement must show the agreement meets all requisite contract elements.employment does not preclude formation of other contracts between employer and employee,so long as neither party relies on continued employment as consideration for the contract.see light centel cellular,because employer always retains the option to discontinue employment at any time,the promise of continued employment is illusory and insufficient consideration for employee promise not to compete.here,the parties dispute whether the reciprocal promises to arbitrate are sufficient consideration to support enforcing the arbitration agreement.
we recently considered whether an arbitration agreement between an employer and employee was supported by sufficient consideration.see in re halliburton,at.we note,however,that the court of appeals decision and both parties submissions to this court occurred before we decided halliburton.in halliburton,the employer notified employees of a new alternative dispute resolution program that required both the employer and the employees to submit all disputes to binding arbitration.id.at.the terms included the employer right to modify or discontinue the program,but also required the employer to give its employees notice of changes and stated that any amendments would apply only prospectively.id.at.
we upheld the arbitration agreement between halliburton and its employee.id.at.we concluded that the employee employment status did not render the agreement illusory because halliburton did not rely on continued employment as consideration for the agreement.instead,mutual promises to submit all employment disputes to arbitration constituted sufficient consideration,because both parties were bound to the promises to arbitrate.id.at.
halliburton right to modify or terminate the policy did not allow the employer to avoid its promise to arbitrate because it was limited by express contract provisions.id.at.first,the policy stated that any changes only applied prospectively to unknown claims.id.and second,if halliburton terminated the policy,such termination required notice and applied to both halliburton and the employees rights.id.therefore,halliburton could not avoid its promise to arbitrate by amending or terminating the dispute resolution program.id.because the express terms of the policy provided that both the employee and halliburton were bound to their promises to arbitrate,we held the agreement was not illusory.id.at.here,we are asked to decide whether the terms of the agreement between davidson and webster are distinguishable from halliburton.
davidson argues that its dispute resolution policy is enforceable because,like halliburton,the agreement includes reciprocal promises to waive the right to litigation and submit all employment disputes to binding arbitration.see in re alamo lumber,antonio,pet.denied since the parties surrendered their rights to trial by jury,these mutual promises supply valid consideration.thus,davidson contends there is sufficient consideration to support the arbitration agreement.on the other hand,webster argues that the arbitration agreement is illusory because the express terms of the agreement provide that davidson was not bound by its terms.
it is clear that davidson and webster mutually agree d and contract ed to submit disputes to arbitration.at the end of the document containing their agreement,however,is the following statement the company reserves the right to unilaterally abolish or modify any personnel policy without prior notice.our resolution of this case depends on the relationship between those two provisions.
in construing this agreement,we first determine whether it is possible to enforce the contract as written,without resort to parol evidence.deciding whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court.coker coker.in construing a written contract,the primary concern of the court is to ascertain the true intentions of the parties as expressed in the instrument.r p enters.laguarta,gavrel kirk,city of pinehurst spooner addition water.to achieve this objective,we must examine and consider the entire writing in an effort to harmonize and give effect to all the provisions of the contract so that none will be rendered meaningless.universal credit daniel.no single provision taken alone will be given controlling effect rather,all the provisions must be considered with reference to the whole instrument.myers gulf coast minerals mgmt,citizens bank ry.a contract is unambiguous if it can be given a definite or certain legal meaning.columbia gas transmission new ulm gas.on the other hand,if the contract is subject to two or more reasonable interpretations after applying the pertinent rules of construction,the contract is ambiguous,creating a fact issue on the parties intent.id.
in this case,we can not give the arbitration agreement a definite or certain legal meaning because it is unclear whether davidson unrestricted right to unilaterally abolish or modify any personnel policies gives it the right to terminate the arbitration agreement without notice.emphasis added.stated more succinctly,is the arbitration agreement a personnel policy 
we can not answer this question by reading the agreement terms.the agreement is titled alternative dispute resolution policy on one line,and employment application language on the next.the document addresses several issues that refer specifically to the employment application process but have no bearing on alternative dispute resolution.for example,webster agreed to submit to a background check and physical examination.he promised to abide by company policies and acknowledged that his employment was.the personnel policy language is not in the first paragraph,which contains the promise to arbitrate,but appears only in the second paragraph,which discusses these other,unrelated employment issues.
in their attempt to construe the agreement,the court of appeals justices could not agree on the scope of davidson right to terminate the agreement.although silent on ambiguity,the majority held that the personnel policy language permitted davidson to terminate the arbitration agreement at any time.at although davidson agreed to submit any and all claims,disputes or controversies arising between it and appellee to arbitration,it explicitly retained the absolute right to modify or terminate the policy at any time.conversely,the dissent held that davidson unilateral right to terminate or modify personnel policies did not affect the parties separate agreement to arbitrate in fact,the dissent noted that i n the event the employer exercised that right to modify or terminate the employee retained the right to force arbitration on the issue.id.at emphasis added.if the dissent had interpreted the personnel policy language as applying to the arbitration agreement itself,webster would not have the right to seek arbitration on the issue following termination of the arbitration agreement.
the proper interpretation of this language is critical in halliburton,we rejected the argument that the arbitration agreement at issue was illusory because,among other things,it required ten days notice of any modification or termination and stated that any such amendment would apply prospectively only.at.thus,we held that halliburton can not avoid its promise to arbitrate by amending the provision or terminating it altogether.id.at.the termination provision in this case does not contain similar limitations.accordingly,we hold that the agreement is ambiguous and must be remanded to the trial court to determine what the parties intended by the clause the company reserves the right to unilaterally abolish or modify any personnel policy without prior notice.
we add a brief response to the dissents.the proper interpretation of this document has split both the court of appeals and this court.justice smith contends the agreement is unambiguous and clearly compels webster to arbitrate.justice schneider says the agreement is unambiguous but clearly illusory.we will not reiterate our thoughts on ambiguity,but believe it helpful to respond to some of the dissents concerns.both dissents assert that the title of the document must be considered insofar as it references arbitration,but they omit from consideration that portion of the title,and contents of the document,that pertain to personnel policies.justice smith determines that the document is primarily devoted to setting forth an arbitration policy,even though arbitration is discussed in only the first paragraph,which comprises less than fifty percent of the text and,as justice schneider points out,only two of fifteen sentences.at.the document is set out in full in this opinion,and we need not belabor the point.suffice it to say evidenced by the multiple disagreements about its meaning among this court agreement is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation.under our precedent,the document is ambiguous.columbia,at.
rather than follow this precedent,however,justice smith would enforce a deeply flawed agreement that he admits is far from a model of precise drafting.at.indeed,the document is rife with grammatical errors,misspellings,and omitted words.webster waived his right to trail by jury,even for claims based on the construction of he united states.he also agreed that t he arbitration tribunal shall be the sole and existence of its jurisdiction over all parties and issues,whatever that means.while we generally favor arbitration agreements,we should not reflexively endorse an agreement so lacking in precision that a court must first edit the document for comprehension,and then rewrite it to ensure its enforceability.
justice schneider implies that,because the parties do not contend the agreement is ambiguous,we may not hold that it is.this is contrary to texas law.see sage northdale constr,holding jury question was presented by ambiguity in construction agreement a court may conclude that a contract is ambiguous even in the absence of such a pleading by either party coker,at concluding agreement was ambiguous even though both parties asserted property settlement agreement was unambiguous and moved for summary judgment acadian geophysical,cameron,no pet.laubach georgetown v.the georgetown laubach trust,pet.denied arredondo city of dallas,pet.denied,yarbrough drive ctr.joint venture,paso,no pet.cent.oil louisiana land exploration,dist,pet.denied curbo state,no pet.
finally,justice schneider states that he is reluctant to send this matter back to the trial court because he can not imagine what such a hearing would look like.at.it is not necessary to speculate on the character of that proceeding the trial court will conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine the parties intent.see anglin,at noting that,if the material facts necessary to determine a motion to compel arbitration are controverted,by an opposing affidavit or otherwise admissible evidence,the trial court must conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine the disputed material facts see also armijo prudential ins,cir jenkins,concurring if arbitration agreement is ambiguous the issue then becomes a factual question,to be decided from external evidence of the parties intent,unless only one conclusion can be drawn from the undisputed evidence montgomery county cmty.coll.dist.donnell,ohio app d,holding that an ambiguity in the arbitration agreement must be resolved by an evidentiary hearing.
because we can not discern whether davidson unilateral right to terminate personnel policies applies to the agreement to arbitrate,we conclude that the arbitration agreement is ambiguous.we reverse the court of appeals judgment and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.app.d.
i respectfully dissent.the controversy in this case involves a company arbitration policy that an employee agreed to sign after beginning his employment.when the company sought to enforce the arbitration policy,the trial court denied the motion to compel arbitration.a divided court of appeals affirmed the trial court order.the court says that the wording in the arbitration policy is ambiguous and that the case should be sent back to the trial court to hear evidence concerning the parties intent.but i would not be as hasty as the court to send this matter back to the trial court because i can not imagine what such a hearing would look like.i would,in the first instance,hold that the policy provisions are not ambiguous.then,in the second instance,i would hold the employee is entitled to complete relief in this court.the arbitration promise made by the company is illusory,and because it is,i would affirm the court of appeals judgment denying the motion to compel arbitration.
chelsey webster webster went to work for davidson,davidson.a few days after beginning employment,webster signed the agreement that is at the heart of the controversy in this matter.the document,prepared by davidson,is titled alternative dispute resolution policy adr policy it is undisputed that webster was employed by davidson at the time he signed the agreement.
approximately eleven months after commencing his employment,webster was injured on the job.webster filed for workers compensation benefits.then,about one month later,davidson terminated webster.webster filed suit,alleging davidson fired him in retaliation for filing a workers compensation claim.davidson sought to enforce the arbitration clause contained in the adr policy that webster had signed.
a hearing on davidson motion to compel arbitration was held before the trial court.during the hearing,davidson introduced a copy of the arbitration policy signed by webster.davidson never signed the agreement.but,webster has never complained about the absence of davidson signature.
davidson had the initial burden of proof to establish the arbitration agreement existence and to show that the claims asserted against it fell within the arbitration agreement scope.see williams indus.earth dev,dist,no pet.if davidson had met its burden of proof,then the burden would have shifted to webster to show why the arbitration agreement did not apply.id.at the motion to compel arbitration hearing,the trial court properly considered the pleadings of the parties,the motion to compel arbitration,and responses.see jack anglin.tipps,the trial court may summarily decide whether to compel arbitration on the basis of affidavits,pleadings,discovery,and stipulations.but,the trial court heard no live testimony about the adr policy.id.noting that if the material facts necessary to determine the issue are controverted,the trial court must conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine the disputed material facts.
after considering the evidence,the trial court denied the motion to compel arbitration without stating a reason for the denial.the record must be construed in a light favorable to supporting the judgment.see keller nevel.davidson appealed,and the court of appeals affirmed the trial court.
in deciding the motion to compel arbitration,the trial court should have considered two issues was there a valid arbitration agreement and if so,did the agreement encompass the claim see in re oakwood mobile homes,dallas cardiology,mallick,pet.denied dalton contractors,bryan autumn woods,dist,no pet.the first of these issues is the subject of this appeal thus,we must decide if the trial court was correct in concluding there was no valid arbitration agreement.
standard of review 
we review a trial court decision to deny a motion to compel arbitration under a legal sufficiency or no evidence standard of review when factual findings are in dispute.see certain underwriters celebrity,writ dism.however,in this case,the only issue before us is the trial court legal interpretation of the arbitration clause no findings of fact were made.thus,de novo review is appropriate.see also nationwide of bryan,dyer,no pet.dalton contractors,at.
construction of the adr policy 
under the guise of a de novo review of the trial court legal interpretation of the agreement,the court may not create an agreement for the parties that is different from the one they entered.but,the court attempts to do just that.the adr policy expressly reserves davidson right to unilaterally abolish or modify any personnel policy without prior notice.the court raises ambiguity as an issue sua sponte and concludes that this unilateral termination provision in the adr policy is ambiguous because it is not possible to determine from the document itself whether the unilateral termination right applies to the parties agreement to arbitrate,or only to personnel policies concerning the employment relationship.at.but neither webster,davidson,the trial court,nor the court of appeals have suggested the language quoted above is ambiguous.i would hold that this language regarding the unilateral termination right unambiguously applies to the entire agreement,including the agreement to arbitrate.although ultimately the contract fails for lack of consideration see discussion below,it can not be said that the adr policy is ambiguous.
the adr policy is not ambiguous.
there are several reasons why the document can be unambiguously read so that the universal termination right language applies to the entire document.first,the document is entitled alternative dispute resolution policy,which suggests that the unilateral termination right contained within it would apply to arbitration,as the title would be applicable to the entire document.see neece realty,calvert,dissenting recognizing that the title of an agreement can have the legal effect of importing words into the contract.
secondly,the unilateral termination right applies to any personnel policy,and it is reasonable to conclude that an arbitration policy would fall under the category of a personnel policy.arbitration agreements are often a part of employee manuals or personnel policies.see,in re tenet healthcare,dist,orig.proceeding analyzing a legally binding arbitration agreement appearing in an employee handbook containing personnel policies.moreover,the adr policy was provided by an employer to be signed by an employee,suggesting it is a personnel policy.it is not only reasonable to believe the arbitration provision is a personnel policy of the company,it is unreasonable to reach any other conclusion.the court seems to suggest that the personnel policy must be one or the a policy,or an agreement.surely a reasonable interpretation is that it could be both.
webster even promises to abide by all of davidson policies in the adr policy,and it is reasonable to conclude that davidson wanted to retain the right to unilaterally terminate all parts of the adr policy because the policy did not specifically exempt the arbitration agreement from the unilateral termination right.
finally,neither davidson nor webster have ever argued that the unilateral termination right did not apply to the arbitration agreement.the actions of both the parties throughout their litigation reflect the belief that the arbitration policy is a personnel policy.they both came to the motion to compel arbitration hearing arguing about several issues,none of which ever raised the question of whether the arbitration policy was a personnel policy.all of their actions throughout the litigation are consistent with the notion that the right to unilaterally terminate applied to the arbitration policy.
webster and davidson do offer different interpretations of the unilateral termination clause.but their differences have nothing to do with factual issues rather,they differ in the legal significance of the arbitration policy.nevertheless,the fact that their explanations differ does not render the contract ambiguous.see columbia gas transmission new ulm gas,noting that an ambiguity does not arise simply because parties offer conflicting interpretations of the contract.for an ambiguity to exist,both explanations must be reasonable.id.conversely,a contract is ambiguous if its language is subject to two or more reasonable interpretations.see monsanto boustany.here,there is only one reasonable interpretation of the adr policy,and the court insistence that it is ambiguous flies in the face of rules of construction.
finding the adr policy ambiguous is contrary to rules of construction.
one of the basic tenets of contract interpretation is the assumption that the parties intend every part of an agreement to mean something.when construing a written contract,we are to ascertain the intent of the parties as expressed in the instrument.union fire ins.of pittsburgh,cbi indus,sunwest,pet.denied courts will enforce an unambiguous instrument as written,and ordinarily,the writing alone will be deemed to express the parties intentions.contracts are to be read as a whole,and an interpretation that gives effect to every part of the agreement is favored so that no provision is rendered meaningless or as surplusage.see westwind exploration homestate savings ass.
the court ignores these principles of contract interpretation when it concludes the agreement is ambiguous.davidson right to unilaterally abolish or modify any personnel policy without prior notice must be given its plain and ordinary meaning.thus,the unilateral termination language must mean that davidson can cancel or alter any personnel policy without informing webster.although i ultimately conclude that the adr policy is not binding because it is illusory,the agreement is not ambiguous.
c.the adr policy is unenforceable because it is illusory.
in my view,the unilateral termination right in the adr policy makes davidson performance optional as to the entire policy,and thus,renders the adr policy illusory.thus,i would find that the agreement between davidson and webster fails to rise to the level of a contract as it lacks consideration.
the adr policy does not contain consideration.
consideration is an essential element for a valid,enforceable contract.federal sign texas.if mutual,reciprocal promises are binding on both parties,they may constitute consideration for a contract.texas gas util.barrett,johnson title.
but,if the terms of a promise make performance optional,the promise is illusory and can not constitute valid consideration.light centel cellular of texas,when illusory promises are all that support a purported bilateral contract,there is no contract.restatement second of contracts cmt.e cmt.valid consideration exists if a party reserves the right to terminate an agreement with notice.see restatement second of contracts cmt.b,illus.but,a termination clause that allows a party to terminate the contract at will makes performance optional,and thus,makes any promise illusory.see light,at see also,tenet healthcare cooper,dist,pet.dism.
here,the adr policy reserves davidson right to unilaterally abolish or modify any personnel policy without prior notice.under the plain language of the contract,davidson reserved the right to abolish or modify any personnel policy.as explained above,the unilateral termination right would also apply to the agreement to arbitrate all claims.by retaining the right to terminate the adr policy at any time,davidson can avoid arbitration.thus,davidson is not bound to its promise to arbitrate,and its promise to avoid litigation does not amount to consideration.see in re halliburton,reciprocal promises are not sufficient if one party can avoid its promise.because there is no consideration for the adr policy,the agreement is illusory and unenforceable.
davidson attempts to create consideration fail.
in an attempt to create consideration where none exists,davidson claims that the language regarding the unilateral termination right complied with contractual mutuality requirements because,if davidson changed the adr policy,or abolished it altogether,the changes would have applied to both parties.however,because davidson alone had the unilateral right to terminate or change the agreement,the agreement is illusory.it is irrelevant that any changes made by davidson would apply to both parties.
davidson also argues that the promise to arbitrate is not illusory because,under halliburton,at,it is bound to resolve any dispute according to the adr plan in effect at the time the dispute arises.however,the express contract terms we relied on to find the halliburton agreement enforceable are missing here.the plain language of the halliburton adr plan required the employer to provide notice before enacting any modifications or terminating the plan.davidson suggests that because the agreement we upheld in halliburton required notice and prospective application,the same protective language can be implied here.i disagree.
in halliburton,we relied on the adr policy notice provisions to conclude that halliburton could not avoid its promise to arbitrate by amending the policy or terminating it altogether.halliburton,at.here,we can not imply the obligations that precluded halliburton from avoiding its promise to arbitrate.the agreement plain language establishes davidson unhindered right to modify or terminate the agreement without notice.it is not proper to imply terms that contradict the express contract language.see haws garrett contractors,gorbett.welding,the terms of an implied contract are inferred from the circumstances.
davidson further attempts to explain the unilateral termination language as simply acknowledging an employer right to make changes to employment terms,as in hathaway mills.but,the arbitration agreement language contradicts davidson explanation.
in hathaway,we held that an employer may enforce changes to an employment contract if the employer unequivocally provides notice of a definite change and the employee accepts the change by continuing employment.hathaway,at.here,the contract expressly allows davidson to effect a change in the adr plan terms without notice.thus,it is inconsistent to explain the reservation language as merely restating our holding in hathaway,because the arbitration agreement terms contradict the hathaway requirements.
additionally,whether an employer has satisfied the hathaway requirements is a separate inquiry from the determination of whether the arbitration agreement is enforceable under traditional contract principles.if an employer seeks to change the terms of an employment relationship by implementing an agreement to arbitrate all disputes,the employer must show the arbitration agreement,standing alone,satisfies all requisite elements of a valid contract.see light,at halliburton,at.this showing is separate from the employer duty to meet the hathaway requirements of notice and acceptance.id.
davidson attempts to create consideration via an alternate reading of the language of the agreement are not reasonable.when the meaning of an agreement is plain and unambiguous,a party construction is immaterial.associates,at.i would find the contract unenforceable because it fails for lack of consideration and is illusory.
the court incorrectly concludes that the unilateral termination right is ambiguous.
the court sends this case back for the trial court to consider parol evidence,finding that a fact issue exists concerning the applicability of the language in question to the arbitration agreement.but,as discussed above,the language unambiguously gives davidson the right to unilaterally terminate any part of the agreement.thus,there is no fact issue to be determined by the trial court and there is no need for parole evidence to be taken.
the unilateral termination right does not only apply prospectively.
although i agree with justice smith that the contract is unambiguous and the arbitration agreement is a personnel policy subject to davidson unilateral termination right,i can not agree that the right to abolish or modify personnel policies only applies prospectively with contemporaneous notice.the adr policy allows davidson to unilaterally abolish or modify any personnel policy without prior notice.justice smith looks to england to determine how to interpret the phrase without prior notice.
however,applicable precedent can be found closer to home.for example,in shumway horizon credit,we held that the language without prior notice waived the right to all notice.at.similarly,in musgrave hca mideast,cir,the court interpreted a contract providing that the employer had the right to terminate an employee service without prior notice.the fourth circuit concluded that this language states simply that the employee could be terminated during the probation period without notice.at.justice smith interpretation that without prior notice means with contemporaneous notice is not indeed,is caselaw from american jurisdictions.
justice smith is essentially inserting a qualifying phrase into davidson unilateral,unqualified right to terminate.even though the adr policy permits davidson to unilaterally abolish or modify any personnel policy without prior notice,justice smith interprets this as requiring contemporaneous notice.the agreement contains no such limitation.
justice smith also attempts to distinguish our holding in hathaway by noting that in that case,while we required an employer making a change to an employment policy to provide notice,we did not specify that the notice had to be given before the change was made.justice smith contends that under our decision in hathaway,notice could be either in advance of or contemporaneous with the policy change.however,justice smith misunderstands our holding in hathaway.in hathaway,we explained the employee must have knowledge of the employer proposed modification to an employment policy to constitute effective notice that is,the employee must know the nature of the changes and the certainty of their imposition.hathaway,at.requiring the employer to prove unequivocal notification of changes to the employment terms was based,in part,on fairness to the employee.see id.the requirement that an employee be aware that changes to the employment policy are certain to be imposed implies that there must be prior notice.it is unreasonable to conclude contemporaneous notice of a policy change is permissible under hathaway.indeed,permitting an employer to give contemporaneous notice of changed employment terms undermines hathaway concerns for fairness to an employee and stretches our holding in hathaway too far.
moreover,justice smith confuses the hathaway requirements for changes to an employment agreement with the requirements for a valid,enforceable arbitration agreement.they are two separate inquiries.even assuming justice smith is correct that davidson may give contemporaneous notice of a change to the terms of webster employment terms under hathaway,the arbitration clause of the adr policy remains illusory and unenforceable.if contemporaneous notice to cancel the arbitration agreement is permissible,davidson retains the right to discontinue performance at any time.under this scenario,there is no consideration,as davidson is not giving up a benefit or suffering a detriment.see,in re c h news,wl at christi,orig.proceeding.thus,the arbitration clause would still be illusory and unenforceable.
enforceable arbitration agreements must bind both the employer and the employee.
there is no mystery to drafting an enforceable arbitration agreement.capable counsel know that limitations on an employer right to terminate the agreement are necessary so the agreement is not illusory.see,in re tenet healthcare,at arbitration provision was enforceable because the right to terminate the agreement specifically excepted the arbitration agreement in re kellogg brown root,dist,orig.proceeding arbitration agreement enforceable because it provided that it could be amended or terminated by the company by giving at least days notice to employees and that such amendment would not apply to a dispute that had been initiated in re jebbia,dist,orig.proceeding.
in this agreement,however,there was no limitation to davidson right to terminate,amend,or cancel the agreement.the only consideration for the agreement was continued employment,which amounts to no consideration.light,at.thus,the arbitration agreement is illusory and unenforceable.
conclusion 
i disagree with the court determination that the arbitration agreement is ambiguous.i also believe the agreement is illusory.in halliburton,we said that an arbitration agreement terms must bind both the employer and employee if the agreement relies on mutual promises to arbitrate for consideration.davidson adr policy lacks the protections we relied on in halliburton to find the promises to arbitrate mutually binding.the unilateral right to modify or terminate the agreement without notice allows davidson to avoid its promise at any time.accordingly,i would hold that the arbitration agreement between davidson and webster fails to bind davidson,and thus,the promise is illusory and the agreement is unenforceable for want of consideration.i would affirm the court of appeals judgment.
i share the court view that the contract executed by the parties is far from a model of precise drafting,but i disagree that the phrase any personnel policy can not be given a definite legal meaning.like justice schneider,i believe that the arbitration policy falls within the ambit of the phrase any personnel policy.however,i disagree with the portion of justice schneider dissent that concludes the entire contract is unenforceable.
i would hold that the contractual provision allowing davidson to abolish or modify any personnel policy without prior notice applies to the company alternative dispute resolution policy,but that it does not waive webster right under texas employment law to contemporaneous notice of any change in davidson adr policy.the rules of contract interpretation counsel against construing termination clauses as being retroactively exercisable and in favor of interpreting contracts to be valid.because the relevant provision is properly construed as applying only prospectively to disputes arising after contemporaneous notice to webster of davidson decision to abolish or modify its adr policy,it does not render illusory the parties otherwise clearly enforceable arbitration agreement.
whether an agreement imposes a duty on the parties to arbitrate a dispute is a matter of contract interpretation and a question of law for the court.tenet healthcare cooper,dist,pet.dism.similarly,whether a contract is ambiguous is itself a question of law,highlands ins.we review questions of law de novo.el paso natural gas minco oil gas.in a de novo review,no deference is accorded to the lower court decision.quick city of austin.
the contract was the only evidence presented by the parties in the trial court.accordingly,the only issues on appeal are the legal questions of whether the contract is ambiguous and illusory.i apply de novo review to both.
the contract states that davidson reserves the right to unilaterally abolish or modify any personnel policy without prior notice.the court professes an inability to decipher whether the arbitration policy ratified by the contract is a personnel policy and,sua sponte,therefore concludes that the contract is ambiguous.however,uncertainty or lack of clarity is not enough to render a contract ambiguous.universal credit daniel,it must be conceded that there is an absence of artistry in the grammatical construction and punctuation of paragraph of the contract,but is its meaning when properly read and interpreted so dubious as to subject the contract to the charge of ambiguity,thereby justifying the court in calling into play the rule of strong construction against the author of an instrument we think not.preston ridge fin.servs.tyler,writ denied med.towers,luke episcopal,dist,writ denied.
contractual provisions must be considered with reference to the entire instrument.myers gulf coast minerals mgmt.the main heading of the parties contract reads alternative dispute resolution policy and the text below purports to determine the relationship between davidson and its personnel.see perry langbehn,title of an instrument,like every other portion of a contract,may be consulted in determining its meaning.in this context,we must give the phrase any personnel policy its natural and obvious import.see,pagel pumphrey,antonio,writ ref.
applying the foregoing rules of construction,it is clear that the arbitration policy memorialized in the contract is a personnel policy and that the disputed provision unambiguously provides that davidson has the right to abolish or modify its arbitration policy without prior notice.i simply can not conclude that an arbitration policy that governs the conditions of employment for personnel is not encompassed by the phrase any personnel policy,particularly when that phrase appears in a contract that is primarily devoted to setting forth an arbitration policy.
justice schneider asserts,and the court implies,that if the disputed termination provision does apply to davidson arbitration policy,the contract is illusory.because davidson retained the ability to unilaterally abolish or modify its arbitration policy at any time,the argument goes,it assumed no obligation to webster,and therefore davidson promise to arbitrate does not constitute consideration for webster reciprocal promise in my view,the provision without prior notice language does not disclaim the requirement set forth in hathaway general mills,of contemporaneous notice for modifications to the employment relationship.the provision is properly construed as applying only prospectively to disputes arising after contemporaneous notice to webster of davidson decision to abolish or modify its adr policy.
it is significant that the word prior precedes notice in the relevant provision.we must presume that each word in a contract has some significance and meaning.gates asher.for example,courts presume that words that follow one another are not intended to be redundant.see gulf metals,chicago ins,pet.denied in construing the phrase sudden and accidental,a temporal meaning was applied to sudden because accidental describes an unforeseen or unexpected event and ascribing the same meaning to sudden would render the terms redundant and violate the rule that each word in a contract be given effect.applying the foregoing texas case law,we must presume that the parties in this case did not intend for the phrase without prior notice to mean without any notice 
i have been unable to locate any texas or federal case law specifically addressing whether the phrase without prior notice should be given the same meaning as without notice.however,an english appellate court concluded 
a clause providing for termination of the scheme by the employer without prior notice means without notice in advance.those words do not suggest that notice does not have to be given to effect termination of rights under the contract of employment.the clause puts the employee on warning that the scheme might not be permanent and that the employer reserves the right to terminate it without giving advance warning,but it does not mean that the employer obligations can end without the employee being told.
bainbridge circuit foil uk,industrial relations law reports irlr.while authority authored on this side of the atlantic is obviously preferable,an opinion issued by an english appellate court can surely be considered on a question such as the one presented here that does not involve interpretation of a statutory or constitutional provision,but rather interpretation of three basic english words contained in a private employment contract.
consistent with the rule that each word in a contract be given effect,the phrase without prior notice contained in the parties contract should be interpreted to mean without notice in advance rather than without any notice.therefore,the without prior notice language does not disclaim the contemporaneous notice that is required by texas common law to effect a change in the terms of an employment relationship 
in hathaway,we held that the party asserting a change to an employment contract must prove two things notice of the change and,acceptance of the change.at.we noted that t o prove notice,an employer asserting a modification must prove that he unequivocally notified the employee of definite changes in employment terms.id.we did not indicate when the notice had to be provided,thereby implying it could be given either in advance of or contemporaneous with the policy change 
the hathaway requirements are applicable here because the parties sought to modify their employment relationship to include binding arbitration.the contract,including the arbitration agreement therein,is incident to the employment relationship between davidson and webster and refers to this relationship in several p
