appellant pedcor management company.employee welfare benefit plan pedcor challenges the district court class certification order for arbitration of claims brought by employer erisa plans plans against north american indemnity,nv nai.for the following reasons,we vacate and remand.
facts and proceedings 
nai is a insurance company that entered into reinsurance contracts with plans throughout the united states.the arbitration agreement of each of these contracts requires,in relevant part,that any dispute between the parties hereto in connection with the agreement be submitted to arbitration as a general matter each party chooses one arbitrator,and the two chosen arbitrators then select a third to constitute a panel and a rbitration shall be governed by the laws of the state of texas.there is no express provision in the clause regarding consolidation or class treatment of claims in arbitration.
this dispute arose when nai allegedly breached its reinsurance contracts with the plans by defaulting on payment of claims.nai originally sued american heartland health administrators ahha,the third party administrator of the plans,for negligent underwriting of the plans.several individual plans then successfully intervened as plaintiffs against nai.
the district court denied nai motion to dismiss its action without prejudice and entered a judgment in nai original suit against ahha the court subsequently held a hearing to discuss with the intervening plans the possibility of certifying a class for arbitration proceedings against nai.pedcor counsel,who had been granted leave to appear as amicus curiae in the proceedings,participated in the hearing and filed written suggestions advising against class certification.in preparation for arbitration,the court nevertheless certified a class to consist of all employer plans that bought reinsurance through north american indemnity,after january,whose claims have not been paid.pedcor timely appealed the certification order.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
as a general matter,we will reverse a district court decision to certify a class only upon a showing that the court abused its discretion,or that it applied incorrect legal standards in reaching its decision.thus,the certification order itself is reviewed for abuse of discretion,but whether the district court applied the correct legal standards is a question of law that we review de novo in this case,the questions whether the district court applied the correct legal standards or abused its discretion are pretermitted by recent supreme court precedent.
effect of greentree financial corporation bazzle 
in green tree financial corporation bazzle which was issued subsequent to the certification order and to the parties initial briefing in this court,the supreme court addressed a state court decision ordering class arbitration under state law in the context of an arbitration agreement that was silent about whether class arbitration was forbidden or allowed after concluding that the agreement did not expressly forbid class arbitration,a plurality of the court held that u nder the terms of the parties contracts,the the agreement forbids class for the arbitrator to decide.
it is well established that when we are confronted with a plurality opinion,we look to that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.in green tree,justice stevens,whose concurrence in judgment constituted the fifth vote,dissented to the extent that he would have permitted the state court decision allowing class arbitration to stand.he reasoned that the decision was correct as a matter of law,nothing in the court application of state law to allow class arbitration violated the faa,and he emphasized that the petitioner challenged only the merits of that decision,not whether it was made by the right nevertheless,justice stevens also stated that a rguably the interpretation of the parties agreement should have been made in the first instance by the arbitrator,rather than the court,and because justice breyer opinion expresses a view of the case close to my own,i concur in the judgment.
the basis on which justice stevens would have decided the the state court judgment was correct as a matter of to constitute the most narrow grounds on which the case was decided.the plurality specifically rejected the legal interpretation of the state court because it was a decision by the wrong.the grounds of the stevens concurrence also differed from the dissent which would have upheld the state court ability to make the decision but would have reversed on the merits of that court decision to allow class arbitration justice stevens did express his agreement,however,with the principle laid down by the plurality that arbitrators should be the first ones to interpret the parties agreement.as a result,the plurality governing rationale in conjunction with justice stevens support of that rationale substantially guides our consideration of this dispute.
in arriving at its decision,the plurality relied on two considerations.first,it found that the contract provision to submit to arbitration all disputes,claims,or controversies arising from or relating to this contract or the relationships which result from this contract reflected the parties intent to commit a broad scope of questions to arbitration,including the class arbitration question because that issue relat ed to the contract.second,the plurality reasoned that there exists only a narrow exception for certain gateway matters that parties normally expect a court rather than an arbitrator to decide,which include whether the parties have a valid arbitration agreement at all and whether a concededly binding arbitration clause applies to a certain type of controversy.as the question whether a contract forbids class arbitration concerns the kind of arbitration proceeding the parties agreed to,and not the validity of the arbitration clause or its applicability to the underlying dispute between the parties,the plurality concluded that arbitrators are well situated to answer that question.in sum,because the scope of the arbitration agreement itself was broad,and the issue there concerned only the kind of arbitration proceeding agreed to,the plurality,plus justice stevens,the court,held that this matter of contract interpretation should be for the arbitrator,not the courts,to decide.
the clarity of green tree arbitrators are supposed to decide whether an arbitration agreement forbids or allows class us to decide only whether the instant case is sufficiently analogous to green tree to come within its rule.that the district court ordered a type of class arbitration here is appellees assert that the district court did not have in mind a traditional class action,but rather a procedure with one arbitration panel and separate arbitration proceedings.this procedure,even if accurately described,does not alter the conclusion that the district court certified a class for arbitration.furthermore,the arbitration provision states in the event of any dispute between the parties hereto in connection with the agreement,such dispute shall be submitted to arbitration emphasis added.as in green tree,the scope of questions committed to arbitration in the arbitration provision of the reinsurance contracts is broad,and whether class arbitration is allowed is similarly a dispute in connection with the agreement.
two additional aspects of the court holding in green tree,which we address out of an abundance of caution,also fail to distinguish it from the instant case.first,although green tree held that whether an arbitration agreement forbids class arbitration is a question for the arbitrator to decide,the court nevertheless made the initial determination that the language of the arbitration agreement did not clearly forbid class arbitration the court stated that it must deal at the outset with the argument that the contracts forbid class arbitration,for if it is right,then the south carolina court holding that the contracts were silent is flawed on its own terms.this preliminary analysis appears to be in response to the dissent and petitioner argument to the
