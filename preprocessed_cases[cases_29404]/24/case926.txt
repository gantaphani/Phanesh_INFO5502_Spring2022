arnold rosenfeld appeals the district court confirmation of an arbitration award in favor of gruma corporation.rosenfeld was one of two class representatives in an action against gruma.the matter was submitted to binding arbitration,and the arbitrator found for gruma.the district court confirmed the arbitrator award over rosenfeld objection.
rosenfeld argues,first,that california law provides the standard for vacatur of the award second,that vacatur is required under california law because the arbitrator failed to disclose a ground for his disqualification and,third,that vacatur is required because the arbitrator exceeded his powers.we agree with the first argument,but disagree with the second and third.we therefore affirm the district court.
background 
appellant arnold rosenfeld is one of two plaintiff representatives in a class action against gruma.the plaintiff class members are drivers distributors who deliver products to gruma customers.each distributor signed a store door distributor agreement with gruma.the agreement states that the distributors are independent contractors.
dennis johnson filed a class action in california superior court against gruma in.the action alleged that gruma misrepresent ed to claimants and class members that claimants and class members were are independent contractors when they were are,in fact,employees.the complaint included claims of breach of contract,labor code violations including failure to pay agreed wages and overtime pay and failure to provide meal and rest breaks,and unfair business practices.gruma removed the suit to federal district court.upon gruma motion,the district court ordered the claims submitted to binding arbitration.
the case was assigned to arbitrator richard neal,a retired justice of the california court of appeal.on august,the arbitrator held that the california arbitration act governed the proceedings.the arbitrator then stayed the arbitration to allow a judicial determination whether the arbitration agreement permitted arbitration.the district court prohibited arbitration of claims and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.we vacated and remanded to the district court in light of the supreme court decision in green tree financial bazzle.see johnson gruma,fed.app x,cir.on remand,the district court returned the case to arbitration.
in march,the arbitrator certified a nationwide class action,designating johnson and rosenfeld as class representatives.after a hearing in april,the arbitrator reconsidered the certification and limited the class to gruma distributors in california.attorney paul grossman argued gruma case for reconsideration at the april hearing.on august,the arbitrator found for gruma,concluding that the distributors properly are classified as independent contractors rather than employees.the district court confirmed the arbitration award.
rosenfeld timely appealed.johnson did not appeal.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court confirmation of an arbitration award.poweragent data,cir.our review of the award itself is highly limited.see,moncharsh heily blase,cal th,i t is the general rule that,with narrow exceptions,an arbitrator decision can not be reviewed for errors of fact or law.
iii.discussion 
state or federal arbitration rules the arbitration clause in the parties agreement requires that arbitration be conducted and subject to enforcement pursuant to the provisions of california code of civil procedure sections through,or other applicable law.the specified code sections comprise the california arbitration act caa.the arbitrator interpreted this clause as an agreement that california arbitration rules would govern the conduct of the arbitration.
the parties dispute whether the district court should have applied the caa or federal arbitration act faa disclosure and vacatur standards when deciding whether to confirm the arbitration award.rosenfeld contends that because california law governed the arbitration,the district court should have applied the caa standards.gruma contends that because the arbitration agreement recognizes the application of other applicable law,the faa rules apply.
the caa and the faa provide different grounds for vacatur of an arbitration award.the caa provides that a court reviewing an arbitration award shall vacate the award if the court determines 
the award was procured by corruption,fraud or other undue means.
there was corruption in any of the arbitrators.
the rights of the party were substantially prejudiced by misconduct of a neutral arbitrator.
the arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted.
the rights of the party were substantially prejudiced by the refusal of the arbitrators to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause being shown therefor or by the refusal of the arbitrators to hear evidence material to the controversy or by other conduct of the arbitrators contrary to the provisions of this title.
an arbitrator making the award either a failed to disclose within the time required for disclosure a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator was then aware or b was subject to disqualification upon grounds specified in section but failed upon receipt of timely demand to disqualify himself or herself as required by that provision 
a.these statutory grounds are the exclusive grounds for judicial review of arbitration awards.moncharsh,cal th at.
the faa provides that a district court may vacate an arbitration award 
where the award was procured by corruption,fraud,or undue means 
where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators 
where the arbitrators were guilty of misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced or 
where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.
a.the scope of a confirmation proceeding applying these factors is extremely limited.wilson,cir see also hall street associates,mattel.
the agreement in this case is a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce that comes within the purview of the faa.see.the faa,while it does not itself create independent federal jurisdiction,creates a body of federal substantive law establishing and regulating arbitration agreements that come within the faa purview.wilson,at quoting moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr.when an agreement falls within the purview of the faa,there is a strong default presumption that the faa,not state law,supplies the rules for arbitration.sovak.chugai pharm,cir.to overcome that presumption,parties to an arbitration agreement must evidence a clear intent to incorporate state law rules for arbitration.fid.fed.bank,fsb durga ma,cir quoting sovak,at.
a general clause within an arbitration provision does not trump the presumption that the faa supplies the rules for arbitration.sovak,at see also fid.fed.bank,at.in fidelity federal bank,we considered an arbitration clause providing that controversies were to be resolved in accordance with the laws of the state of california and the rules of the american arbitration association.at internal quotation marks omitted.we saw no clear intent to incorporate california arbitration rules and therefore read the agreement as electing state substantive law and federal procedural rules.id.at see also sovak,at reaching the same conclusion under a similar arbitration provision.
in this case,however,the arbitration clause is more than a general provision.it requires arbitration to be conducted and subject to enforcement pursuant to the provisions of california code of civil procedure sections through,or other applicable law.the arbitrator read the arbitration clause to mean that the parties intended to be governed by the caa rules.we agree.the clause exhibits the parties clear intent that the caa procedures shall govern.
we have previously held that where the faa rules control arbitration proceedings,a reviewing court must also apply the faa standard for vacatur.fid.fed.bank,at where faa rules apply,w e look to the faa and federal law to de
