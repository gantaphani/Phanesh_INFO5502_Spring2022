the automobile mechanics local welfare and pension funds the funds administer welfare and pension benefits for the members of local.as part of its collective bargaining agreement cba with the union,vanguard car rental usa national car rental and alamo vanguard,through its predecessor in interest,agreed to make weekly payments to the funds for the benefit of each regular employee covered by the cba.vanguard does not deny this obligation,and it has not refused to make payments during the period in which this dispute has occurred.it is the contribution rate instead that is the bone of contention here.the funds take the position that vanguard was required to pay the increased contribution rate authorized by the funds board of trustees and made effective on august,vanguard says that it owes only the last rate authorized in the cba.to recoup the monies allegedly due,the funds filed suit in federal court under of the employee retirement security act of erisa,on march,arguing that certain agreements signed between vanguard and the funds gave the board of trustees the authority to raise the contribution rates.the parties filed for summary judgment.rather than addressing those motions,however,the district court dismissed the suit sua sponte,because it concluded that the dispute had to be arbitrated.
we agree with both parties that this dismissal by the district court was improper.enforcement of a forum selection clause including an arbitration clause is not jurisdictional it is a waivable defense that vanguard,in fact,waived.although the district court did not address the summary judgment motions,they are properly before this court.because the dispositive issue is one of contract interpretation,our review is de novo,and nothing prevents us from addressing this lone question,we hold that vanguard is entitled to summary judgment.the agreements do not give the funds the authority to raise the contribution rates until a renewed term has been ushered in by the signing of a new cba.
the facts underlying this case are not in dispute.on june,vanguard predecessor in interest entered into a cba with local.that cba expired on april.it obligated vanguard to pay money into the local pension and welfare funds on behalf of its employees.article of the cba,which deals with welfare benefits,provided 
the employer shall pay the sum of per week for each regular employee covered by this agreement who performs any work in such week into the automobile mechanics union local union industry welfare fund for the payment of health and welfare benefits as determined by the board of trustees the fund shall in all respects be administered in accordance with the trust agreement drawn.
referring to welfare benefits,article d adds that t he obligation to make the above contribution shall continue during periods when the collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated article,the provision for the pension fund,is similar the employer shall be obligated to contribute the sum of per week for each employee covered by this a greement to the pension fund of the automobile mechanics union local the fund shall in all respects be administered in accordance with the trust agreement drawn.both article d and article d obligate vanguard to make the contribution during periods when the collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated 
following the expiration of the cba on april,the parties entered into extension agreements that prolonged the cba through january.while the parties have not extended the term of the cba further since that date,they have continued to operate under its terms during this status quo period as provided by articles d and d.
on june,the same date that vanguard signed the cba with the union,it also entered into participation agreements with the pension fund and the welfare fund.two sections of these agreements are relevant here.a separate agreement was signed with each fund,but they conform in almost every respect.we quote from the agreement with the welfare fund.paragraph deals with the automatic renewal of the participation agreement 
this agreement shall remain in full force and effect for the full term of the current collective bargaining agreement between the employer or area wide employers and the union and shall be automatically renewed from time to time for terms coterminous with those of the aforementioned collective bargaining agreements.the rate at which contributions are to be made during any renewed term shall be that set by the board of trustees.
paragraph addresses the termination of the agreement by the employer 
an employer desiring to terminate this agreement must notify the fund office sixty days sic prior to the termination date of the existing collective bargaining agreement.if the employer fails to give timely notice to the trustees the employer shall be bound to the provisions of this agreement for the period of the next collective bargaining agreement and thereafter until proper notice is given but in no event less than three years unless terminated by the trustees.the rate at which contributions are to be made during any renewed term shall be that set by the board of trustees.
on august,the board of trustees of the funds informed vanguard that the contribution rates had been increased to for the welfare fund and to for the pension fund.although vanguard has continued to pay the and per week rates that it paid prior to august,it has refused to contribute at the increased rate.as a result,the funds filed this suit,alleging a violation of erisa,seeking an accounting,and requesting a judgment and an injunction requiring vanguard to pay the increased contribution rates.
vanguard filed a motion for summary judgment on june,and the funds did the same on august.rather than addressing those motions,however,the district court seized upon the arbitration clause in article of the cba signed between the union which is not a party to this case and the funds.noting the national policy in favor of arbitration and finding the dispute to be within the terms of article of the cba,the district court dismissed the suit,citing fed.civ.b improper venue.the funds brought this timely appeal.
right of action 
vanguard argues that we lack jurisdiction over the funds suit.that can not be right,unless the suit is so frivolous that it does not engage the power of the court.see steel citizens for a better environment,d,citing bell hood.it is possible,however,that these parties might not have a right of action under the statute if so,their suit is barred at the threshold.two provisions of erisa,and,and,are relevant here.section supplies the substantive right that the funds seek to enforce 
every employer who is obligated to make contributions to a multiemployer plan under the terms of the plan or under the terms of a collectively bargained agreement shall,to the extent not inconsistent with law,make such contributions in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plan or such agreement.
section e complements by authorizing certain parties to enforce the substantive right.it empowers various parties to bring actions under erisa,including the secretary of labor or a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary of a plan.the plaintiff funds are employee benefit plans,to which d gives the right to sue or be sued under erisa as an entity.we have found that such employee benefit plans may bring suit in federal court under e.see peoria union stock yards.retirement plan penn mutual life ins,cir see also laborers pension fund blackmore sewer construction,cir affirming result in suit brought by fund for unpaid monies under where claim was alleged under central states southeast and southwest areas pension fund kroger,cir same.
notwithstanding this apparent source of authority to sue,vanguard submits that the funds action has been foreclosed by laborers health welfare trust fund for northern california advanced lightweight concrete,d.there,an employees trust fund wanted to bring an action under of erisa to recover contributions to employee benefit plans that the employer refused to pay after the expiration of the cba that governed the contributions.the duty to continue making contributions during a status quo period that the trust fund sought to enforce derives from the duty to bargain in good faith under a of the national labor relations act the duty to bargain and to refrain from instituting unilateral changes in wages and working conditions under section a normally outlives the parties cba.an employer is required to maintain the status quo after the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement until a new agreement is reached or until the parties bargain in good faith to impasse.general service employees union nlrb,cir quoting nlrb emsing supermarket,cir quotations omitted see also nlrb katz,d.in advanced lightweight concrete,the supreme court held that does not give rise to any federal right to have an employer make contributions while negotiations are ongoing the question there was whether a charge that a refusal to make pension contributions during a status quo period violated the nlra was exclusively within the jurisdiction of the national labor relations board.see at.
questions involving an employer promised obligations to a employee benefit is,their obligations under the terms of the plan or under the terms of a collectively bargained agreement are not excluded from scope of the statute,nor are they matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of the nlrb.unlike the plaintiff trust fund in advanced lightweight concrete,the funds here do not rely on any alleged statutory duty vanguard might have to continue contributing during the status quo period.instead,the funds claim only that vanguard has violated a contractual duty stemming from the participation agreements.because this contract relates to a welfare benefit plan governed by erisa,the lawsuit falls within the federal question jurisdiction of the court.
forum selection clause 
to everyone surprise,the district court dismissed this case for improper venue,based on the existence of the arbitration clause.it raised that issue on its own and resolved the case on this basis without any briefing from the parties.stranger yet,it did so after vanguard had already waived whatever right to arbitration it might have had.we review the district court dismissal of the case on this ground de novo.see continental casualty american national ins,cir.both parties submit that the dismissal was improper.
it is not entirely clear whether a motion seeking dismissal based on a forum selection clause,including an arbitration clause,is better conceptualized as an objection to venue,and hence properly raised under rule b,or as a failure to state a claim,and thus properly raised under rule b.see generally charles wright and arthur miller,federal practice procedure at ed.wright and miller observe,however,that most of the decided cases use rule b as the basis for deciding such a motion.id.at.this court has followed the majority rule.see continental ins.orsula,cir.this is consistent with our view that the choice of an arbitral forum can be waived early in the proceedings,and generally is waived once the party who later wants arbitration chooses a judicial forum.see grumhaus comerica,cir cabinetree of,kraftmaid cabinetry,cir.
venue is primarily a matter of convenience of litigants and witnesses.firstar bank,faul,cir quoting denver rio grande brotherhood of trainmen,d citations omitted.as a result,an objection to venue can be waived or forfeited.american patriot ins.agency,mutual risk management,cir see also charles wright,arthur miller,and edward cooper,federal practice procedure ed.indeed,fed.civ.h provides that improper venue is waived as a ground of dismissal when not timely raised.forum selection clauses are similar they represent an ex ante determination by the parties themselves of the place that will be the most convenient for any litigation that may come along.arbitration clauses,the supreme court has held,are a species of forum selection clause.see vimar seguros y reaseguros,sky reefer,d.
district courts should not,as a matter of general practice,dismiss sua sponte either for improper venue or for failure to follow a forum selection clause.see wright,miller,and cooper,fed.prac.proc.b ecause of the waiver principle and the personal nature of the defense,it generally but not always is thought inappropriate for the district court to dismiss an action on its own motion for improper venue if there has been no objection from the party for whose benefit the privilege exists.in the analogous area of venue,our sister circuits have found sua sponte dismissal to be appropriate only under limited circumstances.see algodonera de las cabezas,american suisse capital,cir holding that district court must give parties the opportunity to present views,including willingness to waive venue,before dismissing janis ashcroft,cir holding that sua sponte dismissal is inappropriate gomez usaa federal savings bank,cir holding sua sponte dismissal to be appropriate only when extraordinary circumstances favor allowing the question to be raised on the court own motion stjernholm peterson,cir holding that sua sponte dismissal not allowed after waiver under fed.civ.h costlow weeks,cir holding that sua sponte dismissal is appropriate only where no responsive pleading has yet been filed.
dismissal on the court own initiative is particularly as an effort to enforce a contractual arbitration clause.the district court thought that the arbitration clause cut the other way.it commented that because the parties have previously agreed to arbitration,they should not now be allowed to turn their back on that agreement,in favor of litigation in the federal court.this assumes,of course,that the parties who are before the court are the ones who have agreed to arbitrate their disputes.the district court apparently took no notice of the fact that the participation agreements between vanguard and the funds do not contain arbitration agreements the arbitration agreement is in the cba between vanguard and local.arbitration,the supreme court constantly reminds us,is a creature of agreement.see,first options of chicago,kaplan,d.the court was thus mistaken when it assumed that the dispute before it was covered by an arbitration agreement.
even if the agreement to arbitrate between the employer and the union somehow carried over to the funds,and we do not see how it could,there is another problem with the court conclusion.like many other contractual rights,a contractual right to arbitrate may be waived,either expressly or implicitly.grumhaus comerica securities,cir.as they may do with other contractual clauses,litigants may turn their back on their right to enforce an agreement to arbitrate.the district court offered no reason why it had either the right or the duty to reject such a waiver.in all of the cases it cited in support of its dismissal,one party had moved to enforce the arbitration agreement and dismiss for lack of venue.
undoubtedly,the reason why vanguard did not file any motion asserting a right to arbitrate is because it had no right under its agreements with the funds.had it wished to do so,however,it had ample opportunity.it filed a response to the complaint in which it did not deny plaintiffs allegation that venue was proper in the northern district of illinois,saying instead that d efendant neither admits nor denies the allegations and legal conclusions concerning venue,for lack of sufficient information.although it made no motion to dismiss,vanguard motion for summary judgment,which said nothing about venue or arbitration,was an implicit waiver of any argument for dismissing on either of those grounds.finally,before this court vanguard has explicitly waived the forum selection clause as a defense.we too conclude that this was not an appropriate ground on which to dismiss this case.
the question remains what we should do at this point.one option is to remand the case for further proceedings before the district court,and the other is to decide the for summary judgment as a matter of first impression.federal courts of appeals have the authority under to provide relief when so doing would be just under the circumstances.this includes the prerogative to decide motions for summary judgment as a matter of first impre
