the detroit newspaper agency dna,which conducts joint operations for the detroit free press and detroit news newspapers,appeals two judgments of the district court in these related cases arising in the aftermath of a strike against the newspapers by the detroit typographical union,local the union.the union sued dna after the strike had ended to compel arbitration of the dna refusal to reinstate gary rusnell,who had a lifetime guarantee under a collective bargaining agreement.the dna appeals the district court judgment compelling the dna to arbitrate its refusal to reinstate rusnell.following the arbitrator decision to reinstate rusnell,the dna sued the union to vacate the arbitrator decision.the dna appeals the district court judgment denying its motion for summary judgment and granting the union for summary judgment to enforce the arbitration award.because these two cases concern common issues,we treat them in a single opinion.
we find that rusnell lifetime employment guarantee was a vested right that survived the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement.while suspended during the strike,this right could not be terminated by the dna except in accordance with the provisions of the lifetime guarantee agreement,including the arbitration provision of the last collective bargaining agreement.therefore,we affirm the district court judgment requiring arbitration of the dispute.we reject the dna objections to the arbitration award and affirm the judgement enforcing the award.
in,the union entered into separate but identical memoranda of agreement moa with the detroit free press and the detroit news.the dna,the entity formed to assume the joint operational responsibilities of the two papers,adopted both moas.each moa contained a lifetime job guarantee for certain named union members.rusnell is one of those named as having a lifetime guarantee.the moa states 
this guarantee shall be interrupted for the following reasons,for the duration of the incident,and restored at its conclusion 
strike or lockout.
disability of the guarantee holder.
suspension of work opportunities through an act of god which prevents composing room employees from working.
leave of absence of the priority holder.
time off for union business.
service in the armed forces.
this guarantee shall be terminated for the following causes 
resignation of the guarantee holder.
death of the guarantee holder.
just cause separation of the guarantee holder,unless restored to his position through the appeal provision of the labor contract.
attainment of birthday by the guarantee holder.
permanent suspension of publication.
the moa also includes a section titled memorandum to supersede and extend beyond labor agreement which provides that the provisions of the moa shall be ongoing and part of all future collective bargaining agreements and shall not be subject to amendment except by mutual consent of the parties.
the dna and the union entered a series of collective bargaining agreements cba incorporating the moa.the agreement to govern their relationship between and provided that an arbitrator would decide all disputes regarding the interpretation of any portion of the agreement.the cba also included a specific provision on job guarantees which stated that the guarantees will terminate on the occurrence of any one of the following death,retirement,voluntary separation,or discharge for cause.the cba further stated that the guarantee commitment shall endure beyond the term of any specific collective bargaining agreement executed between the parties.
on april,the cba between the parties expired,and on july,the union and other unions whose members were employed by the dna went on strike.during the strike,in response to violence on the part of members of some of the other striking unions,the dna filed an unfair labor practice charge against all of the striking unions,including the typographical union.as part of a consent order which applied to the union,the national labor relations board nlrb called on the strikers to cease and desist blocking or otherwise coercively interfering with ingress or egress to dna facilities in any manner or by any means including,but not limited to physical confrontation or intimidation,unlawful group trespass,mass picketing,stationary picketing,or placement of barriers,or star nails or other sharp object.app.at.the sixth circuit subsequently enforced the nlrb order.
rusnell participated in a demonstration during the strike in which strikers sat down in front of the detroit offices of the detroit news.the dna subsequently sent a letter to rusnell which stated 
you are being discharged from the detroit newspaper agency because of your conduct on august.
on that date you blocked the ingress and egress to the front entrance of the detroit news building.your conduct is even more egregious in that it violates a formal national labor relations board settlement agreement prohibiting such behavior.
this type of behavior will not be tolerated and is just and sufficient cause for your discharge.
in february,the union made an unconditional offer to return to work,and the dna began lifetime guarantee holders other than those who had turned during the course of the strike and those it had terminated for alleged strike misconduct.rusnell was among the employees the dna refused to reinstate.
in march,the union filed a grievance complaining about dna failure to rusnell and other employees whose cases have since settled.the dna refused to arbitrate the issues of whether rusnell had rights under the moa that survived the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement,whether those rights should be arbitrated,and whether it had just cause to terminate rusnell.the union brought suit in district court to compel arbitration.the dna argued that arbitration was not available as to the lifetime job guarantees because the guarantees were interrupted by the strike and thus during the course of the strike could be terminated at dna discretion.the dna also argued that in any event arbitration was not available because the collective bargaining agreement had expired before rusnell discharge.
on march,the district court granted the union motion for summary judgment to compel arbitration.the court recounted the standard for compelling arbitration,noting that it could not decline to order arbitration unless it could say with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.the court found that a strong argument could be made that the job guarantee provisions survived the mere expiration of any agreement.the court found unpersuasive the dna argument that rusnell termination was not subject to arbitration because the job guarantees did not apply during the strike.the court noted that the dna position presumed that the merits of the the guarantees applied during the be decided in its favor.since the court was apparently convinced that the union position on whether the guarantees were in force during the strike was at least arguable,it ordered arbitration.in a later order,the court characterized its march decision as determining that the parties had contracted to submit the subject matter of the grievance to arbitration.
the case thus proceeded to arbitration.the dna again disputed whether the dna was required to arbitrate rusnell termination.arbitrator robert mccormick ruled that the grievance was arbitrable.he found that the dna considered itself bound by the just cause provision of the lifetime job guarantee agreement when it discharged rusnell,pointing to the dna discharge letter to rusnell which stated that it had just cause to terminate him and to the fact that a dna lawyer had answered that correct when asked if just cause was the only issue in the arbitration.
furthermore,arbitrator mccormick found that the agreement itself did not permit the dna to terminate guarantee holders during a strike,since such a reading would render frivolous the termination exceptions stated in the moa.mccormick also found that the dna lacked just cause for terminating rusnell,since rusnell by himself had not blocked anyone ingress or egress to the building,promptly obeyed directions of detroit police officers,and was not arrested.the arbitrator refused to consider whether rusnell violated the sixth circuit and nlrb orders regarding blocking egress from the buildings,which he found were beyond the scope of the arbitrator authority which grows out of,and is limited to,the contract between the parties.
the dna subsequently filed suit in the district court to overturn the arbitrator award.the dna argued that it had not waived the issue of arbitrability,and that the arbitrator had improperly refused to consider the sixth circuit and nlrb orders in determining whether the dna had just cause to terminate rusnell.the union counterclaimed for enforcement of the arbitration award.
the district court enforced the arbitrator award.the court ruled that the arbitrator had employed permissible tools of contractual interpretation to conclude that a strike did not permit unilateral termination of a lifetime guarantee.the court read the guarantee as a compromise position under which the dna is protected from paying labor costs for guaranteed workers who strike while the strikers have the assurance that,absent just cause or other specified reason,they can return to their guarantees upon their return to work.the court found that the dna claim regarding the circuit orders was a reasonable claim of error,but that it was harmless since the newspaper would be unable to obtain a different outcome even if the alleged error is corrected.the court held that even if the arbitrator had considered the consent order of the nlrb and the sixth circuit enforcement,he would not have found that rusnell obstruct ed or interfere d with the newspaper entryway.as such,it can not be legitimately argued that he violated the terms of the consent orders.
the dna subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration.for the first time,the dna asserted that the district court lacked authority to order specific performance of the arbitration award enforcing the moa because the act bars injunctions requiring parties to specifically perform an employment guarantee.the district court ruled that did not prohibit it from enforcing the specific performance component of the arbitrator award.the court noted that precedent justified enforcing the reinstatement components of arbitration awards and that other courts had explicitly excepted arbitration awards from bar on ordering specific performance.
ii.analysis 
arbitrability 
in the first appeal,the dna charges the district court erred by requiring the parties to arbitrate rusnell grievance.the dna basic argument before the district court,and here,is that the strike interrupted the lifetime guarantees,and thus that there was no requirement during the interruption that the termination be for just cause or covered by one of the other termination provisions of the moa.as a result,dna asserts,the union request to arbitrate whether there was just cause for the dismissal could not be granted.
on appeal,the dna claims that the district court declined to rule definitively on arbitrability,and argues that this was an error.the dna also reiterates its argument that the lifetime guarantees were not arbitrable because the collective bargaining agreement had expired.the union counters that the dna waived its right to challenge arbitrability by arguing the issue in front of the arbitrator.
we review summary judgments compelling arbitration under a de novo standard.cincinnati typographical union gannett satellite information network,cir.the union argues that our standard for overturning arbitration much stricter also apply to our review of the district court judgment compelling arbitration.the union does not provide any analysis or precedent to support its claim,and we think that the language of cincinnati typographical union is quite clear on this point.therefore,we review the district court decision on arbitrability de novo.
the union argues that the dna waived its right to appeal arbitrability by arguing the issue of arbitrability without reservation before the arbitrator.however,the dna argued before the district court that the dispute was not arbitrable therefore,it has properly preserved the issue of arbitrability in its appeal from summary judgment ordering arbitration.the case relied upon by the union,vic wertz distributing teamsters local,cir,expressly distinguished itself from cases in which the issue of arbitrability is contested in the district court in an action to compel arbitration.id.at.nor do we find merit in the union argument that the dna failure to take an interlocutory appeal of the district court order to arbitrate somehow indicates it waived its right to appeal the order in a timely fashion.similarly,the union reliance on the arbitration record in which the dna apparently limited the issues before the arbitrator to substantive ones is inappropriate because those facts were not part of the record before the district court when it compelled arbitration.the dna has clearly not waived its right to appeal summary judgment as to arbitrability.
therefore,we turn to the question of the whether the district court committed reversible error when it ordered arbitration.the dna contends that the district court erred by refus ing to resolve whether there was a right to arbitrate the propriety of discharges that occurred during the strike.br.actually,the district court explicitly determined that the dispute was covered by the arbitration agreement and thus compelled arbitration.app.at.the district court thus fulfilled its obligations under at t technologies,communications workers,d it is the court duty to interpret the agreement and to determine whether the parties intended to arbitrate grievances.
federal labor policy strongly favors arbitration,and a n order to arbitrate should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.johnston boiler local lodge,international brotherhood of boilermakers,cir quoting united steelworkers warrior gulf navigation,d.the district court compelled arbitration because it could not say with positive assurance that the dispute was not subject to arbitration.this finding,as the district court noted,would not be inconsistent with an arbitrator subsequently deciding that under the merits and the specific facts of the particular grievance,it is not subject to arbitration.
as discussed in more detail below,we think that the union interpretation of the agreement is not simply one to which the agreement is susceptible,but is actually the only fair reading of the guarantee.as the arbitrator pointed out,the guarantee includes a list of circumstances in which the guarantees are interrupted and a list in which they are terminated.if an interruption permits the company to terminate guarantees without just cause,then the termination list is in some sense redundant.since ordinary principles of contract interpretation call for interpreting an agreement so as to give meaning to every stated provision,interruption can not provide the basis for termination.we think the parties intended interruption merely to provide a respite for the employer from paying wages and providing benefits to guarantee holders during one of the circumstances listed,in which the guarantee holder would be unable to contribute to the workplace in any real sense.the dna has provided no authority for the proposition that the interruption of a guarantee permits an employer to terminate a guarantee holder without just cause or one of the other listed grounds for termination.were we to accept the dna argument,it would mean that the employer could terminate the moa as to employees on disability leave,in the armed services,absent on union business,or during periods in which newspaper production was suspended because of an act of god.the unreasonableness of that conclusion is apparent.
as the fourth circuit has pointed out,arbitration makes particular sense in the context of lifetime employment guarantees.as that court explained
