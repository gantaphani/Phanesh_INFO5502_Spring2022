the district court,judge howard matz presiding,denied countrywide petition to compel arbitration.although the court found that ferguson raised a genuine dispute regarding the making of the arbitration agreement,it ruled that,assuming the agreement does exist the arbitration agreement is unenforceable because it is unconscionable under armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,cal and under the ninth circuit holding in duffield robertson stephens,cir,ferguson can not be compelled to arbitrate her title vii claims.
countrywide appeals the denial of its petition to compel arbitration 
unconscionabilitya.the district court correctly concluded that countrywide arbitration agreement was unenforceable because it is unconscionable under california law.
the faa compels judicial enforcement of a wide range of written arbitration agreements.section of the faa provides,in relevant part,that arbitration agreements shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds that exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.in determining the validity of an agreement to arbitrate,federal courts should apply ordinary principles that govern the formation of contracts.first options of chicago,kaplan,d.thus,generally applicable defenses,such as unconscionability,may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening of the faa.doctor,casarotto,d.
california courts may invalidate an arbitration clause under the doctrine of unconscionability.this doctrine,codified by the california legislature in california civil code a,provides 
if the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made,the court may refuse to enforce the contract,or may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause,or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.
this statute,however,does not define unconscionability.instead,we look to the california supreme court decision in armendariz,cal th,d,which provides the definitive pronouncement of california law on unconscionability to be applied to mandatory arbitration agreements,such as the one at issue in this case.in order to render a contract unenforceable under the doctrine of unconscionability,there must be both a procedural and substantive element of unconscionability.see armendariz,d,at.these two elements,however,need not both be present in the same degree.see a m produce fmc,d.thus,for example,the more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable.armendariz,d,at.
procedural unconscionability 
procedural unconscionability concerns the manner in which the contract was negotiated and the circumstances of the parties at that time.kinney united healthcare,th,d.a determination of whether a contract is procedurally unconscionable focuses on two factors oppression and surprise.oppression arises from an inequality of bargaining power which results in no real negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice.surprise involves the extent to which the supposedly terms of the bargain are hidden in the prolix printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce the disputed terms.stirlen supercuts,th,d.
in circuit city stores,adams,cir,cert.denied,d,we held that the arbitration agreement at issue satisfied the elements of procedural unconscionability under california law we found the agreement to be procedurally unconscionable because 
circuit city,which possesses considerably more bargaining power than nearly all of its employees or applicants,drafted the contract and uses it as its standard arbitration agreement for all of its new employees.the agreement is a prerequisite to employment,and job applicants are not permitted to modify the agreement must take the contract or leave it.
circuit city,at citing armendariz,d,at.see also stirlen,d at finding procedural unconscionability where an arbitration clause is part of a contract of adhesion in which the employee is presented with an employment contract on a take it or leave it basis.in the present case,as in circuit city,the arbitration agreement was imposed as a condition of employment and was.
countrywide contends that there was no element of surprise or oppression in its arbitration agreement because ferguson had ample time to consider alternatives to countrywide terms of employment and the contract was written in plain language.a california appellate court recently rejected these arguments,holding that whether the plaintiff had an opportunity to decline the defendant contract and instead to enter into a contract with another party that does not include the offending terms is not the relevant test for procedural unconscionability.see szetela discover bank,th,d.instead,california courts have consistently held that where a party in a position of unequal bargaining power is presented with an offending clause without the opportunity for meaningful negotiation,oppression and,therefore,procedural unconscionability,are present.in stirlen,the california court of appeal held that where the terms of the employment contract were cast in a take it or leave light and presented as standard provisions,the procedural element of unconscionability is satisfied.stirlen,d at.see also armendariz,d,at finding procedurally unconscionable a contract which requires,as a condition of employment,that employees waive their right to bring future claims in court.because ferguson was in a position of unequal bargaining power and was presented with offending contract terms without an opportunity to negotiate,the district court in the instant case correctly found countrywide arbitration agreement procedurally unconscionable.
substantive unconscionability 
substantive unconscionability focuses on the terms of the agreement and whether those terms are so as to shock the conscience.kinney,d at internal quotations and citations omitted.
just before oral argument was heard in this case,the california court of appeal held in another case that countrywide arbitration agreement was unconscionable.see mercuro superior court,th,d,review denied sub nom.mercuro countrywide,cal.lexis at cal.may.
during oral argument,counsel for countrywide conceded that the provisions of the arbitration agreement in the present case are the same as the provisions of the arbitration agreement at issue in mercuro.
coverage of arbitration agreement 
countrywide arbitration agreement specifically covers claims for breach of express or implied contracts or covenants,tort claims,claims of discrimination or harassment based on race,sex,age,or disability,and claims for violation of any federal,state,or other governmental constitution,statute,ordinance,regulation,or public policy.on the other hand,the arbitration agreement specifically excludes claims for workers compensation or unemployment compensation benefits injunctive other equitable relief for intellectual property violations,unfair competition the use unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets or confidential information.we adopt the california appellate court holding in mercuro,that countrywide arbitration agreement was unfairly and,therefore,substantively unconscionable because the agreement compels arbitration of the claims employees are most likely to bring against countrywide but exempts from arbitration the claims countrywide is most likely to bring against its employees.id.at.further,we agree with the reasons advanced by the california appellate court in mercuro and conclude that countrywide justifications for its arbitration agreement are not persuasive.
arbitration fees 
in armendariz,the california supreme court held that 
when an employer imposes mandatory arbitration as a condition of employment,the arbitration agreement or arbitration process can not generally require the employee to bear any type of expense that the employee would not be required to bear if he or she were free to bring the action in court.this rule will ensure that employees bringing discrimination claims will not be deterred by costs greater than the usual costs incurred during litigation,costs that are essentially imposed on an employee by the employer.
armendariz,d,at.
countrywide arbitration agreement has a provision that requires the employee to pay to naf national arbitration forum its filing fee up to a maximum of when the claim is filed.the company shall pay for the first hearing day.all other arbitration costs shall be shared equally by the company and the employee.countrywide argues that this provision is not so as to shock the conscience and,therefore,is enforceable.however,armendariz holds that a fee provision is unenforceable when the employee bears any expense beyond the usual costs associated with bringing an action in court.id.as indicated in ferguson opposition to the petition to compel arbitration and in her brief,naf imposes multiple fees which would bring the cost of arbitration for ferguson into the thousands of dollars moreover,on remand in circuit city,we held that a fee allocation scheme which requires the employee to split the arbitrator fees with the employer would alone render an arbitration agreement substantively unconscionable.circuit city,at 
in the alternative,countrywide concedes that the fee provision is unenforceable under armendariz,but maintains that it modified its fee provision after ferguson purportedly signed the arbitration agreement but before she filed her claims the modification,which provides that the company shall pay the remainder of the naf filing fee,and shall pay all other costs,was announced to countrywide employees via an sent on october,by countrywide vice president of human resources.
the district court found as a matter of fact that countrywide did not effectively modify the arbitration agreement to include the revised fee scheme.the arbitration agreement itself provides that this agreement can be modified or revoked only by a writing signed by the employee and an executive officer of the company that references this agreement and specifically states an intent to modify or revoke this agreement.countrywide provides no evidence that it has complied with these requirements,and thus the district court properly found that the october modification was ineffective.indeed,countrywide raised the same argument in mercuro,and the california court of appeal similarly concluded that the purported modification is invalid because countrywide did not follow its company modification procedure.mercuro,d at.
because the only valid fee provision is one in which an employee is not required to bear any expense beyond what would be required to bring the action in court,we affirm the district court conclusion that the original fee provision appears clearly to violate the armendariz standard.
discovery provision 
ferguson also argues that the discovery provision in the arbitration agreement is and,therefore,unconscionable.the discovery provision states that a deposition of a corporate representative shall be limited to no more than four designated subjects,but does not impose a similar limitation on depositions of employees.ferguson also notes that the arbitration agreement sets mutual limitations,no more than three depositions and mutual advantages,unlimited expert witnesses which favor countrywide because it is in a superior position to gather information regarding its business practices and employees conduct,and has greater access to funds to pay for expensive expert witnesses.
ferguson urges this court to affirm the district court ruling that the discovery provision is unconscionable on the ground that the limitations and mutual advantages on discovery are unfairly and have no commercial justification other than maximizing employer advantage,which is an improper basis for such differences under armendariz,d,at.countrywide argues to the contrary that the arbitration agreement provides for ample discovery by employees.
in armendariz,the california supreme court held that employees are at least entitled to discovery sufficient to adequately arbitrate their statutory claims,including access to essential documents and witnesses.armendariz,d,at.adequate discovery,however,does not mean unfettered discovery.as armendariz recognized,an arbitration agreement might specify something less than the full panoply of discovery provided in california code of civil procedure.id.
in mercuro,the california court of appeals applied the parameters set forth in armendariz to countrywide discovery provisions.it concluded that without evidence showing how these discovery provisions are applied in practice,we are not prepared to say they would not necessarily prevent mercuro from vindicating his statutory rights.mercuro,d a
