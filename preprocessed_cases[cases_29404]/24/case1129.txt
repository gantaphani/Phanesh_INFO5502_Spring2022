this case involves an action brought in district court by the united states postal service usps or postal service,under the postal reorganization act,b,to vacate an arbitrator award granting a grievance filed by the american postal workers union apwu or the union.the union grievance was filed under a collective bargaining agreement cba between usps and apwu,and it challenged the dismissal of an employee,lorraine daliessio,who had been employed by usps.the postal service argued to the arbitrator that,because daliessio was a probationary employee when separated from employment,she could be terminated without cause and without access to the grievance and arbitration procedures available to nonprobationary employees under the parties cba.
the parties agreed that the arbitrator had the authority to decide whether the grievance was arbitrable under the cba.the arbitrator ruled that daliessio grievance was arbitrable,because the grievant was not separated during her probationary period.the arbitrator reached this conclusion in part because the postal service had failed to give proper notice as required by the usps employee and labor relations manual elm when it purported to separate daliessio.finding no just cause,the arbitrator ordered daliessio reinstated with seniority and back pay.

background 
a.the national agreement 
the apwu and usps are parties to a collective bargaining agreement covering employees at postal facilities throughout the united states.the instant dispute is governed by the cba that was in effect between and.see collective bargaining agreement between american postal workers union,afl cio and united states postal service,the national agreement,reprinted in joint appendix.
article of the national agreement sets forth the parties procedure.a grievance under the cba is defined as a complaint by an employee or the union that involves the interpretation,application of,or compliance with the provisions of the contract.national agreement.in the event that a grievance is not resolved under the contractual grievance procedure,the matter may be submitted to a neutral arbitrator jointly chosen by the parties.id.at.cases involving interpretive issues of general application under the national agreement are arbitrated at the national level,and the resulting awards establish controlling precedent on the meaning of the national agreement.id.at.area level arbitration cases,as distinguished from national panel cases,are final and binding only on the parties to the individual case.id.
the elm also contains provisions relating to the terms and conditions of employment of employees covered by the cba.however,unlike the cba,the elm is not a product of collective bargaining between apwu and usps.the postal service may add to and amend the terms of the elm,but the union must be notified of any changes and it may challenge them on the ground that they conflict with the terms of the national agreement or are otherwise unfair,unreasonable,or inequitable.id.at.in addition,the parties have agreed that the provisions of the elm shall be continued in effect unless changed in accordance with procedures set forth in article.id.
the elm establishes,inter alia,detailed procedures covering the separation of probationary employees.under the terms of the elm,an appointing official must notify the employee in writing why she or he is being terminated and the effective date of the action,along with the appointing official conclusions as to the inadequacies of performance or conduct.elm,reprinted in.the elm requires that the notice of termination be given to the employee before the end of the probationary period.id.at.
under the cba,new employees are considered probationary for the first days of employment.pursuant to article of the national agreement,usps may separate employees during their probationary period without just cause.the cba provides 
the probationary period for a new employee shall be ninety calendar days.the employer shall have the right to separate from its employ any probationary employee at any time during the probationary period and these probationary employees shall not be permitted access to the grievance procedure in relation thereto.
national agreement.a.
for a time,usps and apwu officials disagreed over whether an employee who was separated during his or her probationary period could challenge the employer action under the cba grievance and arbitration procedures.the union contended that separations must comply with elm procedures and that claims of noncompliance could be brought to arbitration.the postal service disagreed,contending that article.a made it clear that probationary employees who were separated had no access to the cba grievance and arbitration procedures.in,in a usps action seeking to vacate an arbitrator award,the fourth circuit agreed with the postal service that the cba barred all arbitral challenges to the separation of probationary employees.see postal serv.am.postal workers union,afl cio,cir.
the matter finally came to a head in,when national arbitrator shyam das presided over an arbitration proceeding that concerned the meaning of article.a.in particular,arbitrator das was asked to decide what claims,if any,a probationary employee could pursue under the parties cba grievance and arbitration procedures to challenge a separation action taken within the employee probationary period.see in re postal,am.postal workers union and ass of letter carriers,case no.c award,das,arb.das award,reprinted in.arbitrator das concluded that probationary employees may not challenge separations on the grounds of alleged noncompliance with elm procedures.however,the das award also made clear that the union may arbitrate the question of whether an employee separation occurred during the probationary period.on this second point,arbitrator das noted that article.a has no application if the separation action does not occur during the probationary period.id.at.
arbitrator das also noted that article does not define what constitutes a separation under the cba.to fill this definitional void,he looked to the elm and ruled that 
the definition of separation is provided in section of the elm which states separations are personnel actions that result in employees being removed from the rolls of the postal service.
the parties agree that the das award provides the controlling arbitral precedent regarding the meaning of article.a,and that the das decision is binding on the parties to this dispute.
facts and proceedings below 
the facts as reported in the arbitrator award,the district court decision,and the record on appeal are straightforward and largely undisputed.lorraine daliessio was hired on november,as a flexible clerk in the computer forwarding unit at the philadelphia pennsylvania post office.decl.of vivian barnett,reprinted in at.daliessio day probationary period was scheduled to end on february.id.at.on december,at her day evaluation,daliessio supervisor,vivian barnett,informed her that she had been rated unacceptable in two key performance areas work quality and work quantity.id.at.on january,daliessio supervisor gave her an unsatisfactory rating and checked the box on an evaluation form indicating that she would not recommend daliessio for retention or rehire.daliessio declined to sign the form.her supervisor told her to clean out her locker,turn in her,and go home.daliessio did so,and did not return to work.id.at.
on february,supervisor barnett sent a letter to the manager of labor relations asking that action be taken to remove daliessio from the employment rolls effective january.id.at.on february,one day after daliessio probationary period ended,the manager of labor relations sent a letter to daliessio stating this will confirm your separation from the postal service as a result of lack of proficiency.notice of separation,reprinted in.the union filed a grievance to challenge the separation.the grievance was denied by the postal service and appealed to arbitration by the union.appeal to arbitration,reprinted in.
arbitrator loeb heard the grievance in late and issued a decision on january.in re postal serv.and am.postal workers union,no.d reg l award,loeb,arb.loeb award,reprinted in.the parties agreed that,under the das award,arbitrator loeb could properly decide whether the grievant was separated during her probationary period.the parties also agreed that if loeb determined that the grievant was not separated within her probationary period,her grievance on the merits was arbitrable.after explaining the controlling principles in the das award and then making findings regarding daliessio dismissal,arbitrator loeb concluded that daliessio claim was arbitrable because she was not separated until after her probationary period.loeb found that the grievant purported separation consisted of usps sending her home and telling her not to come back to work.however,in arbitrator loeb view,n either the recommendation nor the order not to return to work terminated the grievant.the supervisor,her manager and the manager of labor relations all recognized that was the case by their actions.id.at.
after concluding that the grievant was not separated during her probationary period,arbitrator loeb went on to discuss the elm.he observed,inter alia,that because the elm 
declare s that separation must take place during the employee probationary period and sets the conditions by which it must terminate the employee,the employer can not prohibit the grievant from accessing the grievance procedure on the basis of article to allege that she was not terminated during her probation.
id.at.in the end,arbitrator loeb concluded the plain fact of the matter is that the employer failed to terminate the grievant,as that term is understood in article,within her probationary period.id.at.finding no just cause for dismissal,the arbitrator ordered daliessio reinstated with seniority and back pay.
the district court granted summary judgment to usps and vacated the loeb award.see postal,d.characterizing the issue in the case as whether apwu grievance challenging daliessio termination was arbitrable,id.at,the district court held that the arbitrator decision exceeded the authority granted by the national agreement.id.at.
because the das award expressly disallows probationary employees access to grievance procedures for challenges to a separation based on with elm section,loeb reliance on those procedures to determine that daliessio was not terminated within the probationary period is misplaced.in fact,it runs directly counter to article.a as interpreted by the das award.
id.at.holding that t his flawed analysis constitutes manifest disregard of the national agreement,the district court vacated the arbitration award.id.at.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
our review of a district court decision on a summary judgment motion is de novo.we will affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to the postal service only if usps has demonstrated in view of all the facts and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the union,the party that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.teamsters local union united parcel,citation omitted.
unless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise,the question of arbitrability whether a agreement creates a duty for the parties to arbitrate the particular grievance is undeniably an issue for judicial determination.at t,comm ns workers of,d.it is undisputed in this case that the parties agreed to present the question of arbitrability to the arbitrator.therefore,judicial review of the arbitrator award here is strictly limited pursuant to the supreme court decision in enterprise wheel and its progeny.
we are only called upon to determine whether the arbitrator award draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.enterprise wheel,at.an arbitrator may not,of course,dispense his own brand of industrial justice.id.however,as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.misco,at.see also garvey,at.courts are not authorized to review the arbitrator decision on the merits despite allegations that the decision rests on factual errors or misinterprets the parties agreement.citation omitted.so long as the arbitrator award draws its essence from the parties agreement,the arbitrator has the right to be wrong and a court may not his decision.
b.the arbitrator award in this case 
there is some force to the postal service argument that,on the merits,arbitrator loeb award is questionable.it is undisputed that the das decision establishes the controlling law under the parties cba concerning the meaning of article.a.as noted above,arbitrator das ruled that article.a denies a probationary employee access to the grievance procedure to challenge his or her separation on the grounds of alleged noncompliance with the procedures in section of the elm.das award.the postal service contends that arbitrator loeb was faithless to this principle when he cited the elm in determining that daliessio was improperly separated.
although the postal service may have an arguable ground to disagree with the arbitrator decision,this is no basis for a court order vacating the loeb award.the question before this court is not whether the arbitrator decision is wrong on the merits,but whether his decision draws its essence from the parties cba.we hold that it does.
arbitrator loeb was asked to construe article.a of the national agreement.in so doing,he was plainly aware that he was bound by the das award.the loeb award discusses the das decision in some detai
