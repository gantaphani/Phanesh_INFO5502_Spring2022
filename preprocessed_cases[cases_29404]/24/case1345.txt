introduction 
petitioner rion alicia newton rodriguez rodriguez seeks writ relief from an order of the superior court of los angeles county granting the petition to arbitrate brought by real parties in interest sandy witzling,individually,and sandy witzling,collectively witzling and staying the action as to them.we grant the petition.
factual and procedural background 
rodriguez is a minor born in august to her mother,lee newton newton.on october,four days prior to newton routine gallbladder surgery,she executed a arbitration agreement arbitration agreement offered to her by real party in interest sandy witzling,in accordance with his custom and practice for all new patients.
the arbitration agreement included text as described in code of civil procedure section subdivisions a,b and c,applicable to agreements to arbitrate medical malpractice claims.the following provision appeared just above the signature line,in bold red type notice by signing this contract you are agreeing to have any issue of medical malpractice decided by neutral arbitration and you are giving up your right to a jury or court trial.see article of this contract.article stated that any dispute as to medical malpractice will be determined by submission to arbitration as provided by california law both parties to this contract,by entering into it,are giving up their constitutional right to have any such dispute decided in a court of law before a jury article of the arbitration agreement specified that it was the parties intention that the agreement was binding on all parties,including the patient children,whose claims may arise out of or relate to the medical services to be provided.in article,the arbitration agreement provided that it could be revoked by written notice delivered to the physician within days of signature and if not revoked the agreement would govern all medical services received by the patient.
on october,newton died during the recovery period,allegedly from a nick in her liver that witzling made during the surgery.rodriguez is the sole heir to newton estate.guardians ad litem were appointed for her in january.by and through her guardians ad litem,in january,she filed a complaint alleging,inter alia,medical death against witzling and others in july,witzling filed a petition requesting an order that the controversy be decided by arbitration.rodriguez opposed the petition based,in part,on her assertion that to permit a physician whose malpractice was the alleged cause of the patient death to enforce an arbitration agreement for which the statutory period had not expired as of the time of the death would be inconsistent with the policy underlying section and against public policy requiring that waivers of the constitutional right to a jury trial be voluntary,knowing and intelligent.in reply,witzling claimed that rodriguez guardian had legal standing to revoke the arbitration agreement and by failing to do so,the guardian waived the issue.
at the hearing on the motion on october,the trial court granted witzling petition and ordered a stay in proceedings as to witzling only until arbitration was completed the court issued its written order on october,pursuant to which the court also retained jurisdiction to enforce the arbitration agreement and confirm the arbitration award.
rodriguez asserts that,unless her petition is granted,she will be deprived of her constitutional right to a jury trial for the wrongful death of her mother.rodriguez contends that the trial court finding that she was bound by the arbitration agreement was erroneous because 
the arbitration agreement was insufficient to deny her a jury trial,in that it failed to include a procedure for rescission if the patient died within the rescission period 
rodriguez has a constitutional right to a jury trial that was not knowingly,intelligently or voluntarily waived 
public policy can not permit witzling to benefit by limiting public access to his professional record as arbitration would permit,but a jury trial would allow such access 
it was impossible for rodriguez to act during the rescission period in order to preserve her right to a jury trial,in that she was a minor who was the subject of a custody dispute and no guardian had been appointed by the court within the rescission period.
rodriguez requests that we either a issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing respondent superior court to vacate its orders of october,and to issue orders finding rodriguez is entitled to a jury trial,or b issue an alternative writ directing the respondent superior court to show cause why it should not vacate its orders of october,and issue orders finding that rodriguez is entitled to a jury trial.
discussion 
rodriguez contentions turn on the interpretation of the arbitration agreement and section,and the relevant facts are undisputed.therefore,we review the arbitration agreement de novo to determine whether it is legally enforceable against rodriguez.county of contra costa kaiser foundation health plan,th,d see also,mercuro superior court th,d.
an individual is granted a right to a jury trial by the california constitution,article i,section as follows trial by jury is an inviolate right and shall be secured to all in a civil cause a jury may be waived by the consent of the parties expressed as prescribed by statute.a waiver of the right to a jury trial must be knowing and voluntary.cal,art.i,people smith th,d.t he right to trial by jury is considered so fundamental that ambiguity in a statute permitting such waivers must be resolved in favor of according to a litigant a jury trial.grafton partners superior court cal th,d,quoting loranger nadeau cal,overruled on other grounds in reich purcell cal d.
california has a strong public policy,however,favoring arbitration over a jury trial or other litigation,in that arbitration is a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of resolving disputes and eases court congestion.pietrelli peacock th,d.as part of the medical injury compensation reform act,the legislature enacted section,the purpose of which is to encourage and facilitate arbitration of medical malpractice claims.reigelsperger siller cal th,d.
section provides a procedure for a patient and a health care provider to enter into an agreement to waive their rights to a jury trial and resolve medical malpractice claims by arbitration subdivision e of section states that such an agreement is not a contract of adhesion if the agreement complies with subdivisions a,b and c see horwich superior court cal th,d,bolanos khalatian d.the parties agree that the text of the arbitration agreement complied with the three subdivisions.
there is,however,no conclusive presumption that a person who signs a document containing text complying with the section requirements has in fact consented to arbitration as required to form an enforceable agreement.ramirez superior court d.the right to arbitration depends on a contract.county of contra costa kaiser foundation health plan,supra,th at,d see rosenthal great western fin.securities cal th,d.as for any contract to be valid,an arbitration agreement requires the mutual consent of the parties.lazarus titmus th,d.no enforceable agreement exists unless the parties signing the document act voluntarily and are aware of the nature of the document and have turned their attention to its provisions or reasonably should have turned their attention to its provisions.ramirez,supra,at,fn.in order to allow a patient sufficient time to rescind the agreement or,by his or her silence,confirm that his or her waiver is knowing and voluntary,section,subdivision c,requires that the patient be given a cooling off period after signing the agreement.during that time,the patient may rescind the agreement by giving written notice of rescission.
in this appeal,the parties focus primarily on the question of whether the document signed by newton is binding on her minor daughter,rodriguez.in our view,however,the threshold issue is raised by rodriguez contention that no valid waiver of the right to a jury trial was made.without a valid waiver,no enforceable arbitration agreement would exist.ramirez superior court,supr
