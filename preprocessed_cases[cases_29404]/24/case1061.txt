robinson was employed as a for southern pacific lines when,on november,he caused an unauthorized reverse movement of a locomotive without prior warning.following an investigation of the incident,robinson employment was terminated.on november,the united transportation union utu filed a complaint with southern pacific on robinson behalf,seeking reinstatement and back pay and benefits for time lost.after some delay,public law board the board was convened pursuant to the mandatory arbitration procedures of the rla,first i,to consider robinson grievance of southern pacific actions.
following review,the board found that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that robinson was guilty of the rules violation.because of his seniority and the fact that the incident did not pose a danger to any other worker,however,the board concluded that southern pacific termination of robinson was unreasonable,arbitrary,and capricious.the board then ordered robinson reinstated without back pay.in so doing,the board reasoned that although robinson rules violation did not warrant termination,it did warrant a lengthy suspension,and that the period between his dismissal and his reinstatement would be sufficient.
on april,robinson filed a complaint in federal district court against the board,up,and the utu,presenting several claims involving the procedure and result of the board arbitration of his grievance.the district court struck robinson initial complaint and ordered him to file an amended complaint.robinson complied,filing a second amended complaint on may.up filed a motion to dismiss under.b for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and b for failure to state a claim.utu filed a motion for summary judgment.the district court entered an order granting up motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.robinson public law bd,d.
on january,the district court granted robinson motion to file a third amended complaint,naming up and utu as defendants and asserting claims for a breach of duty and fair representation and petitioning for review of the board award.the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.the district court denied robinson motion for summary judgment,granted the summary judgment motions of up and the utu,and dismissed robinson petition for review for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.robinson union pac,d.although the parties posit the issues on appeal somewhat differently,we determine that the only issue before this court is whether the district court erred in concluding that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to review the board arbitration award 
initially,we must determine our standard of review of the district court decision.up moved,pursuant to.b and b,for summary judgment,alleging that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.it is permissible to move under either rule b for dismissal for failure to state a claim or.for summary judgment when the moving party requests that the court consider materials outside the complaint.state farm mut.auto.ins.dyer,cir.when the motion to dismiss is grounded in a lack of subject matter jurisdiction,however,the motion must be brought under rule b.id.seeking summary judgment on a jurisdictional issue is the equivalent of asking a court to hold that because it has no jurisdiction the plaintiff has lost on the merits.id.
an exception exists,however w hen,as here,subject matter jurisdiction is dependant upon the same statute which provides the substantive claim in the case.wheeler hurdman,cir.in such cases,the issue of jurisdiction and the merits of the case are considered to be intertwined.id.because we determine that the question of whether the board exceeded the scope of its jurisdiction in interpreting the parties collective bargaining agreement is both a jurisdictional issue and a substantive factual determination,and because the court relied on evidence outside the complaint,the motion was properly considered as one for summary judgment.see id.robinson burden of proof remains essentially the must present affidavits or other evidence sufficient to establish the court subject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.united states ex rel.hafter spectrum emergency care,cir.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard that would be used by the district court.id.at.we also review a claim of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.id.since federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,we presume no jurisdiction exists absent an adequate showing by the party invoking federal jurisdiction.id.
under the rla,employee grievances regarding termination are categorized as minor disputes and are to be resolved by arbitration.andrews louisville nashville,d.in this case,the arbitrator was a special adjustment board as provided for in second.the parties do not challenge the submission of this matter to the board,or the manner in which the board was selected.
title,section second of the rla provides that the board decisions shall be final and binding upon both parties to the dispute.an adverse decision may be appealed to the federal district court on only three grounds failure of the adjustment board to comply with the requirements of the railway labor act failure of the adjustment board to conform,or confine itself to matters within the scope of its jurisdiction and fraud or corruption.union pac.sheehan,d citing first q accord watts.union pac,cir.in sheehan,the supreme court stated,w e have time and again emphasized that this statutory language means just what it says.at.likewise,this court has emphasized that this statutory standard of review is among the narrowest known to the law.watts,at quotation omitted.of paramount importance to our decision here is our holding in watts that t he reviewing court is not to determine whether the board decision is correct,but may only consider its decision in light of the circumstances enumerated by the statute.id.on appeal,robinson asks the court to find the board decision to be incorrect and therefore outside its scope of jurisdiction.this we decline to do.
the board award was based on its interpretation of article j m of the parties contract of wages and working conditions.article j states 
j in case discipline is found to be unjust,the fireman or hostler involved,if dismissed will be reinstated with full pay for the time he has been out of service.full pay will mean one day pay for each hours at the rate pertaining to his class of service.if disciplines by demerit mark or reprimand,all such notations will be removed from his record.

here,the board found that although robinson acted carelessly,we do not find that anybody was endangered as a result of his failure to follow all the rules.id.at.for this reason,and because robinson had sixteen years seniority,the board concluded that up decision to terminate him was unreasonable,arbitrary,and capricious.id.at.the board then ordered that robinson be returned to full employment after being retrained,and that his discipline be a lengthy suspension equal to the time between his termination and his reinstatement.id.the thrust of
