appellant termorio termorio and appellee electrificadora del atlantico electranta,a public utility,entered into a power purchase agreement agreement pursuant to which termorio agreed to generate energy and electranta agreed to buy it.when appellee allegedly failed to meet its obligations under the agreement,the parties submitted their dispute to an arbitration tribunal in colombia in accordance with their agreement.the tribunal issued an award in excess of million dollars in favor of termorio.shortly after the tribunal issued its award,electranta filed an extraordinary writ in a colombia court seeking to overturn the award.in due course,the consejo de estado council of state,colombia highest administrative court,nullified the arbitration award on the ground that the arbitration clause contained in the parties agreement violated colombian law.
following the judgment by the consejo de estado,termorio and leaseco group,llc leaseco,an investor in termorio,filed suit in the district court against electranta and the republic of colombia seeking enforcement of the tribunal arbitration award.appellants contended that enforcement of the award is required under the federal arbitration act,faa,which implements the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,opened for signature june,reprinted in historical and statutory notes new york convention.the district court dismissed leaseco as a party for want of standing,dismissed appellants enforcement action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,and,in the alternative,dismissed appellants action on the ground of forum non conveniens.termorio electrificadora del atlantico,d.
we affirm the judgment of the district court.the arbitration award was made in colombia and the consejo de estado was a competent authority in that country to set aside the award as contrary to the law of colombia.see new york convention art.v e recognition and enforcement of the award may be refused,at the request of the party against whom it is invoked if that party furnishes proof that t he award has been set aside by a competent authority of the country in which,or under the law of which,that award was made.because there is nothing in the record here indicating that the proceedings before the consejo de estado were tainted or that the judgment of that court is other than authentic,the district court was,as it held,obliged to respect it.see baker marine nig.chevron nig,cir.accordingly,we hold that,because the arbitration award was lawfully nullified by the country in which the award was made,appellants have no cause of action in the united states to seek enforcement of the award under the faa or the new york convention.
background 
the facts in this case are carefully set forth in the district court published memorandum opinion.see termorio,d at.because the facts relevant to this appeal are undisputed,we have incorporated significant portions of the district court statement as a part of our background section.
defendant republic of colombia is a foreign state.defendant electranta,incorporated in to provide electricity services in and around barranquilla,colombia,was owned and controlled by colombia.consequently,it is an agency or instrumentality of colombia within the meaning of the foreign sovereign immunities act b.
in the,colombia atlantic coast experienced significant electricity shortages.in leaseco entered into discussions with electranta to modernize electranta operations and build a new power plant in colombia.a year later,leaseco and electranta formed two colombian entities seriatim first,coenergia,and then termorio.coenergia owned of all shares of termorio.initially,leaseco and electranta owned roughly equal shares of coenergia,so that they accordingly owned roughly equal shares of termorio.however,at the time of electranta complaint in june,leaseco and electranta were transferring sole ownership of the of the shares of termorio to leaseco.
at the heart of this lawsuit is the agreement between termorio and electranta executed in june.under this agreement,termorio agreed to generate energy and electranta agreed to buy it.in reliance on this agreement,termorio invested more than million to construct a power plant.the agreement also provided that any dispute between the parties would be resolved by binding arbitration in colombia.
however,in march,colombia announced a plan to sell the assets of all its atlantic coast utilities,including electranta,to private owners and other colombian utilities.on april,colombia began to privatize by creating a new company,electrocaribe,to receive and hold electranta assets and liabilities.however,at the behest of colombia,electranta did not transfer its duties under the agreement to buy power from termorio.electranta was left with obligations under the agreement to buy power,but no resources to do so.as a result,electranta failed to buy power from termorio and breached the agreement.this breach of the agreement,plaintiffs allege,had a direct effect in the united states affecting the extensive marketing of electrocaribe assets in the united states,by affecting the price of these assets,by causing united states purchasers to acquire a substantial interest in these assets,and by eliminating any obligation for electrocaribe to fulfill the agreement.
the agreement arbitration clause provides as translated 
any dispute or controversy arising between the parties in connection to the execution,interpretation,performance or liquidation of the contract shall be settled through mechanisms of conciliation,amiable composition or settlement,within a term no longer than three weeks.if no agreement is reached,either party may have recourse to an arbitral tribunal that shall be governed in accordance with the rules of conciliation and arbitration of the international chamber of commerce.the tribunal shall be made up of three members appointed by the chamber,and shall be seated in the city of barranquilla,colombia.the award,which shall be binding on the parties,must be rendered within a maximum term of three months.
pursuant to this provision,after defendants failed to meet their obligations under the agreement,the parties entered into a long arbitration process.on december,a tribunal of three arbitrators,applying icc procedural rules,determined that electranta breached the agreement at the direction of colombia.the tribunal ordered electranta to pay termorio an award of million usd.
neither the republic of colombia nor electranta has complied with the million arbitral award,and both have refused to pay any portion of it.plaintiffs allege that colombia and electranta have also sought to undermine the award in several other respects.
o n december,right after the tribunal issued the award,electranta filed an extraordinary writ with a court in barranquilla,seeking to overturn the award.in response the council of state vacated it.the council of state reasoned that the arbitration had to be conducted in accordance with colombian law,and colombian law in effect as of the date of the agreement did not expressly permit the use of icc procedural rules in arbitration.
in another action,plaintiff termorio filed two lawsuits in colombian courts to rescind the transfer of electranta assets and to hold colombia liable for breach of the agreement.a colombian court dismissed the first action on procedural grounds.the second count was still pending in the colombian court system as of march.
id.at internal footnotes,quotation marks,and citations omitted.
in the district court,appellants termorio and leaseco filed an amended complaint and application for confirmation and enforcement of arbitral award and for other relief.the appellants initially alleged four causes of action fraudulent conveyance,expropriation,an action to enforce the arbitration award,and breach of contract.by stipulation,however,the first two claims were dropped,leaving only the action to enforce the arbitration award and the breach of contract claim before the district court.appellees filed a motion to dismiss in which they raised numerous defenses,including,inter alia,that the award was properly vacated by a colombian court that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction by operation of the foreign sovereign immunities act and because the statute of limitations barred the suit that the complaint should be dismissed under the doctrine of forum non conveniens and that leaseco,an american corporation not party to the agreement,lacked standing to enforce the arbitral award.
the district court,after hearing arguments on the motion and reviewing the submissions of the included supporting memoranda,affidavits,sworn declarations,and the decisions of the colombian appellees motion to dismiss.the trial court ruled as follows 
a n accompanying order dismisses leaseco for lack of standing.the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs breach of contract claim both under the foreign sovereign immunities act and by operation of the applicable statute of limitations.although the court has subject matter jurisdiction over the remaining arbitral award enforcement claim,it is dismissed for failure to state a claim the colombian courts have vacated the award.in the alternative,the order dismisses the complaint on the ground of forum non conveniens.in this light,defendants remaining arguments regarding abstention,dismissal of colombia as a party,and service of process on defendants need not be addressed.
id.at.on appeal,appellants have abandoned their breach of contract claim.
because it is clear and undisputed that termorio has standing to bring this lawsuit,we need not address the standing of leaseco.military toxics project epa,if one party has standing in an action,a court need not reach the issue of standing of other parties when it makes no difference to the merits of the case.quoting ry.labor executives ass united states.in addition,because we hold that the district court properly dismissed appellants enforcement action under article v e of the new york convention,we find it unnecessary to determine whether the case might have been dismissed on the ground of forum non conveniens,the alternative basis announced by the district court.likewise,we find it unnecessary to address any presumptive claim asserted by appellants to allow suit against the republic of colombia or whether such a claim is barred by the relevant statute of limitations.the only issue of consequence before this court is whether the district court erred in dismissing appellants claim to enforce the disputed arbitration award.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
this court reviews de novo the district court dismissal for failure to state a claim,stewart educ.ass n.as to the alternative basis for dismissal announced by the district court,w e may reverse a forum non conveniens determination only for a clear abuse of discretion.tmr energy state prop.fund of ukraine,quoting piper aircraft reyno,d see also piper aircraft,at.the forum non conveniens determination is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.it may be reversed only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion.
b.the applicable international agreement 
as the district court noted,
t he united states has ratified and codified two conventions that allow courts in one country to enforce arbitral awards rendered in other signatory countries.see convention on international commercial arbitration,opened for signature,the panama convention reprinted after,and the convention on the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards the new york convention reprinted after.colombia is a signatory to both of these conventions.the new york convention provides that signatory nations are to recognize and enforce arbitral awards rendered in other nations.see new york convention art.iii.however,enforcement of awards may be refused if,inter alia,they were set aside by a competent authority in the country in which the award was made.see new york convention art.v e.
appellants maintain that the panama convention applies to this dispute because a majority of the parties to the arbitration agreement are citizens of states that have ratified the panama convention.see.however,codification of the panama convention incorporates by reference the relevant provisions of the new york convention see,making discussion of the panama convention unnecessary.
termorio,d at.we need not decide whether incorporates the new york convention,as opposed to other provisions of law related to the new york convention,because the relevant provisions of the panama convention and the new york convention are substantively identical for purposes of this case and neither party challenges the district court analysis.we therefore resolve this matter with reference to and using the language of the new york convention.
c.the validity of a foreign judgment vacating an arbitration award 
the supreme court has recognized an emphatic federal policy in favor of arbitral dispute resolution.mitsubishi motors soler,d see also dean witter reynolds byrd,d noting that where parties have seen fit to adopt arbitration clauses in their agreements,there is a strong federal policy in favor of enforcing them.and at least since this nation accession in to the new york convention,and the implementation of the convention in the same year by amendment of the federal arbitration act,that federal policy applies with special force in the field of international commerce.mitsubishi,at.internal citation omitted.as international trade has expanded in recent decades,so too has the use of international arbitration to resolve disputes arising in the course of that trade.id.at.the convention purpose was to encourage the recognition and enforcement of commercial arbitration agreements in international contracts and to unify the standards by which agreements to arbitrate are observed and arbitral awards are enforced in the signatory countries.scherk,d.and,as the court has noted,t he utility of the new york convention in promoting the process of international commercial arbitration depends upon the willingness of national courts to let go of matters they normally would think of as their own.mitsubishi,at.
the basic understanding of the new york convention is that e ach contracting state shall recognize arbitral awards as binding and enforce them in accordance with the rules of procedure of the territory where the award is relied upon,under the conditions laid down in the articles of the convention.new york convention,art.iii.under the convention,the critical element is the place of the award if that place is in the territory of a party to the convention,all other convention states are required to recognize and enforce the award,regardless of the citizenship or domicile of the parties to the arbitration.creighton gov t of the state of qatar,quoting restatement third of foreign relations law cmt.b.
although its purpose is to encourage the recognition and enforcement of commercial arbitration agreements in international contracts,the new york convention enumerates specific grounds upon which a court may refuse recognition and enforcement of an arbitration award.on this point,article v provides 
recognition and enforcement of the award may be refused,at the request of the party against whom it is invoked,only if that party furnishes to the competent authority where the recognition and enforcement is sought,proof that 
a the parties to the agreement were,under the law applicable to them,under some incapacity,or the said agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or,failing any indication thereon,under the law of the country where the award was made or 
b the party against whom the award is invoked was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case or 
c the award deals with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration,or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration,provided that,if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not so submitted,that part of the award which contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration may be recognized and enforced or 
d the composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties,or,failing such agreement,was not in accordance with the law of the country where the arbitration took place or 
e the award has not yet become binding on the parties,or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority of the country in which,or under the law of which,that award was made.
recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award may also be refused if the competent authority in the country where recognition and enforcement is sought finds that 
a the subject matter of the difference is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law of that country or 
b the recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of that country.
new york convention art.v.these provisions of the convention have been implemented by the faa.see the court shall confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said convention.
the convention provides a carefully crafted framework for the enforcement of international arbitral awards.under the convention,o nly a court in a country with primary jurisdiction over an arbitral award may annul that award.karaha bodas perusahaan pertambangan minyak dan gas bumi negara,cir karaha bodas ii.as the second circuit has noted 
the convention mandates very different regimes for the review of arbitral awards in the state in which,or under the law of which,the award was made,and in other states where recognition and enforcement are sought.the convention specifically contemplates that the state in which,or under the law of which,the award is made,will be free to set aside or modify an award in accordance with its domestic arbitral law and its full panoply of express and implied grounds for relief.see convention art.v e.however,the convention is equally clear that when an action for enforcement is brought in a foreign state,the state may refuse to enforce the award only on the grounds explicitly set forth in article v of the convention.

in this case,appellees point out that,because the arbitration award was made by a colombian tribunal convened in that country,pursuant to an agreement between colombian companies to buy and sell electrical power in that country,colombia is the nation with primary jurisdiction over this dispute.appellees argue further that,under the clear terms of the convention,appellants action to enforce the arbitration award fails to state a cause of action.on this latter point,appellees point to article v e of the convention,which provides that 
r ecognition and enforcement of an award may be refused,at the request of the party against whom it is invoked,if that party furnishes proof that t he award has been set aside by a competent authority of the country in which,or under the law of which,that award was made.
new york convention art.v e.pursuant to this provision of the convention,a secondary contracting state normally may not enforce an arbitration award that has been lawfully set aside by a competent authority in the primary contracting state.because the consejo de estado is undisputedly a competent authority in colombia the primary state,and because there is nothing in the record here indicating that the proceedings before the consejo de estado were tainted or that the judgment of that court is other than authentic,appellees contend that appellants have no cause of action under the faa or the new york convention to enforce the award in a contracting state outside of colombia.on the record at hand,we agree.
in reaching this conclusion,we generally subscribe to the reasoning of the second circuit in baker marine.in that case,baker marine,a barge company,executed a services contract with danos,a shipping concern.the contract contained a clause requiring the parties to arbitrate disputes or controversies arising under their agreement.following such a dispute,the parties submitted to arbitration before panels of arbitrators in lagos,nigeria.id.at.the panels awarded baker marine nearly million in damages,but the award was subsequently set aside by a nigerian court.baker marine then sought enforcement of the award in the united states district court for the northern district of new york.the trial court refused to recognize the award,citing article v e of the new york convention,as well as principles of comity.on appeal,baker marine argued that the trial court erred in refusing to enforce the award,because it had been set aside by the nigerian court on grounds that would have been invalid under law if presented in an american court.the appellate court rejected this argument and affirmed the trial court decision not to recognize the award,noting that the parties contracted in nigeria that their disputes would be arbitrated under the laws of nigeria.id.at.the court also remarked on the undesirable consequences that would likely follow from adoption of baker marine argument 
a s a practical matter,mechanical application of domestic arbitral law to foreign awards under the convention would seriously undermine finality and regularly produce conflicting judgments.if a party whose arbitration award has been vacated at the site of the award can automatically obtain enforcement of the awards under the domestic laws of other nations,a losing party will have every reason to pursue its adversary with enforcement actions from country to country until a court is found,if any,which grants the enforcement.
id.at quoting albert jan van den berg,the new york arbitration convention of towards a uniform judicial interpretation.the same principles and concerns govern here,where appellants seek to enforce an arbitration award that has been vacated by colombia consejo de estado.for us to endorse what appellants seek would seriously undermine a principal precept of the new york convention an arbitration award does not exist to be enforced in other contracting states if it has been lawfully set aside by a competent authority in the state in which the award was made.this principle controls the disposition of this case.
considerations of public policy 
appellants argue that courts in the united states have discretion under the convention to enforce an award despite annulment in another country,karaha bodas perusahaan pertambangan minyak dan gas,cir,because article v e merely says that r ecognition and enforcement may be refused if the award has been set aside by a competent authority in the primary state,new york convention art.v e emphasis added.more particularly,appellants contend that a state is not required to give effect to foreign judicial proceedings grounded on policies which do violence to its own fundamental interests.appellants br.at quoting laker airways sabena,belgian world airlines.appellants characterizations of the applicable law are understated and thus misguided.
appellants concede that baker marine is not incorrect in its holding that it is insufficient to enforce an award solely because a foreign court grounds for nullifying the award would not be recognized under domestic united states law.appellants br.at.rather,appellants allege that the district court should have exercised its discretion to enforce the arbitration award in this case,because,inter alia,the council of state decision was contrary to both domestic colombian and international law recognition of that decision would frustrate clearly expressed international and united states policy and the process leading to the nullification decision demonstrated the colombian government determination to deny plaintiffs fair process.id.
in advancing their claims,appellants rely heavily on in re chromalloy aeroservices.in that case,the district court addressed an arbitration agreement between the egyptian air force and an american in which the parties provided that the losing party would not seek review of the arbitration award.while the american company petition for enforcement of its award was pending before the district court,egypt filed an appeal with
