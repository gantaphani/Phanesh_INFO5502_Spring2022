betty lauricia brought an action against her employer,incorporated,alleging that microstrategy retaliated against her after she filed complaints with the equal employment opportunity commission and the department of labor.microstrategy moved to dismiss the action,contending that the lawsuit was premature because the eeoc issued lauricia a letter fewer than days after lauricia filed her eeoc complaint.microstrategy also sought to stay the action and compel lauricia to submit her claims to arbitration.the district court denied both motions,and microstrategy appeals we vacate the district court order and remand with instructions to compel arbitration.
lauricia was the head of microstrategy human resources department.during her employment,lauricia signed a document entitled employee acknowledgment form and agreement to arbitrate in which she acknowledged receipt of microstrategy employee handbook.the acknowledgment included a paragraph requiring lauricia to arbitrate a ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this employee handbook,procedures delineated in it,or the employment relationship otherwise cognizable at law and that could be the subject of legal action.
on march,lauricia filed a charge with the eeoc alleging age and sex discrimination.on march,lauricia filed a complaint with the department of labor wage and hour division alleging that microstrategy was violating the fair labor standards act by failing to pay overtime.on march,lauricia,through counsel,notified microstrategy of the filing of the charges.the next day,lauricia met with jonathan klein,microstrategy vice president and general counsel,at klein request.although lauricia alleges that microstrategy knew about the charges at the time of this meeting,there apparently was no discussion of the charges at that time.
later that day,microstrategy delivered to lauricia a letter placing her on paid administrative leave due to the conflict inherent to your continued active status while pursuing discrimination and wage and hour claims against the company.the letter also stated that the company view ed your conduct this afternoon,in engaging in discussions with counsel for the company without informing them of the pendency of these claims,as a breach of your duty of loyalty to the company,and reminded lauricia that disclosure of any confidential information to anyone outside the company would be a breach of her continuing obligations and duty of loyalty to the company.lauricia remained on administrative leave until she was terminated on august.
on march,two days after it suspended lauricia,microstrategy filed in federal district court an action against lauricia and her attorney microstrategy i.in that action microstrategy sought a declaration that it did not violate the fair labor standards act by placing lauricia on paid leave and that terminating lauricia would not violate the act,and microstrategy alleged that lauricia and her attorney should be held liable for stealing and disclosing trade secrets and other confidential information.the district court allowed microstrategy to depose lauricia for the limited purpose of identifying documents and records in lauricia possession.
on april,the district court dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction,concluding that there was no case or controversy because lauricia had not filed suit against microstrategy.that same day,microstrategy appealed the decision to this court and sought emergency injunctive relief,which we denied.before any briefs were filed,microstrategy moved to dismiss its appeal.the motion was granted,and the appeal was dismissed without prejudice.
on april,three days after the district court dismissed microstrategy i,microstrategy filed an action in virginia state court against lauricia and her attorney microstrategy ii,which included the same claims as alleged in the previous action.microstrategy obtained an order for writ of possession requiring lauricia and her attorney to turn over various documents that believed were confidential,and the sheriff seized the documents from lauricia attorney.lauricia subsequently responded to a set of interrogatories and requests to produce submitted by.see.
on may,lauricia filed a second charge with the eeoc the charge giving rise to this action,alleging that microstrategy had retaliated against her by placing her on administrative leave after she filed the initial charges.on may,the eeoc sent a letter to the parties stating that it had reasonable cause to believe a violation had occurred and inviting the parties to participate in the conciliation process.on may,the eeoc sent microstrategy a letter about possible conciliation remedies and gave the company until may to respond.lauricia,however,informed the eeoc that she did not wish to participate in the conciliation process and she requested that she immediately be issued her letter.the eeoc issued the letter on may.
on june,after receiving from lauricia a courtesy copy of the lawsuit she intended to file,microstrategy filed in federal district court a third action microstrategy iii microstrategy i,microstrategy ii,and microstrategy iii are sometimes collectively referred to as the prior actions.in microstrategy iii,microstrategy named lauricia and her attorney as defendants,sought a declaration that its conduct did not and would not violate title vii,the adea,or the fair labor standards act,and reasserted its claims.lauricia filed her action against microstrategy the next day.
in august,the district court consolidated the actions filed by microstrategy and lauricia.the court also dismissed the claims asserted by microstrategy,which had the effect of dismissing lauricia attorney as a defendant.microstrategy thereafter subpoenaed lauricia employment records from her former employers.
microstrategy first sought to compel arbitration in its motion to dismiss filed on july.microstrategy also contended in that motion that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the letter issued by the eeoc was premature and thus invalid.the district court denied the motions.the court first concluded that by virtue of its remarkably aggressive course of litigation against lauricia,microstrategy had waived its right to insist on arbitration.lauricia microstrategy,d.the court next concluded that the eeoc properly issued the letter upon lauricia request even though the letter was issued fewer than days after lauricia filed her charge.see id.at.
while we agree with the district court that microstrategy litigation strategy against lauricia was remarkably aggressive,we conclude that lauricia has failed to establish that microstrategy litigation activities were sufficient to amount to a waiver of its right to insist on arbitration.our resolution of the arbitration question makes it unnecessary for us to consider the validity of the notice.
before considering the merits of the waiver question,we must first address lauricia claim that no binding agreement to arbitrate exists.according to lauricia,the document containing the arbitration requirement is not binding because it was signed only by her,and not by the president of microstrategy.
the arbitration clause is found in the employee acknowledgment form and agreement to arbitrate,which lauricia signed to acknowledge receipt of microstrategy employee handbook.the portion of the acknowledgment requiring arbitration,however,does not include a requirement that the president of microstrategy sign the acknowledgment.that language appears only in the third paragraph of the acknowledgment,which states 
i acknowledge that the policies and practices set out in this handbook are not a contract of employment,and are not intended to imply a contractual relationship.i also agree that my employment is.i am free to terminate my employment at any time,with or without reason,and the company has the right to terminate my employment at any time,with or without reason.the only person authorized to enter into employment agreements on behalf of the company is the president,and any such contract shall be in writing 
emphasis added.lauricia argues that because the underlined language requires the president of microstrategy to sign all employment agreements,the agreement to arbitrate is not valid because it was not signed by microstrategy president.
the problem with this argument,of course,is that the employee acknowledgment form and agreement to arbitrate is not an employment agreement as contemplated by the paragraph.that paragraph is an effort to emphasize the nature of employment with microstrategy and to forestall claims by employees that,by virtue of certain handbook provisions or oral promises of employment for a definite term,they could only be discharged for cause.the paragraph makes clear that the only official authorized to enter into a contract for something other than employment is the president and that such a contract must be in writing.reading the language focused upon by lauricia in context,it is apparent that the writing and signature requirement applies only to contracts for employment.the employee acknowledgment form and agreement to arbitrate itself is quite obviously not such a contract and thus need not be executed by the president of microstrategy to be enforceable.see generally hilton head,cir concluding that arbitration clause included in form signed by employee acknowledging receipt of employee handbook was valid and enforceable because a mutual promise to arbitrate constitutes sufficient consideration for this arbitration agreement.
having concluded that the agreement to arbitrate is valid and binding,we now proceed to the question of whether microstrategy waived its right to insist on arbitration of lauricia discrimination claims.the district court concluded that microstrategy actions caused lauricia to suffer actual prejudice in that microstrategy was able to obtain discovery that was unavailable in arbitration.on appeal,microstrategy contends that most of the information it obtained could be obtained in arbitration and that lauricia failed to carry her burden of establishing that she suffered sufficient prejudice to support a finding of waiver.we agree.
under the federal arbitration act,a party may demand a stay of federal judicial proceedings pending exercise of a contractual right to have the subject matter of the federal action decided by arbitration,unless the party seeking arbitration is in default of that right.maxum,salus,cir see west.although this principle of default is akin to waiver,the circumstances giving rise to a statutory default are limited and,in light of the federal policy favoring arbitration,are not to be lightly inferred.maxum,at see also american recovery computerized thermal imaging,cir because of the strong federal policy favoring arbitration,we will not lightly infer the circumstances constituting waiver.a ny doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver,delay,or a like defense to arbitrability.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.
a party may waive its right to insist on arbitration if the party so substantially utiliz es the litigation machinery that to subsequently permit arbitration would prejudice the party opposing the stay.maxum,at.but even in cases where the party seeking arbitration has invoked the litigation machinery to some degree,t he dispositive question is whether the party objecting to arbitration has suffered actual prejudice.fraser merrill lynch pierce,fenner smith,cir emphasis added.neither delay nor the filing of pleadings by the party seeking a stay will suffice,without more,to establish waiver of arbitration.however,delay and the extent of the moving party activity are material factors in assessing a plea of prejudice.id.citation omitted.
we review de novo a district court conclusion that a party conduct amounts to waiver of the right to arbitrate,although the court factual determinations upon which the waiver finding was based are entitled to deference.see id.at.the party opposing arbitration bears the heavy burden of proving waiver.american recovery,at.
as noted above,delay in seeking arbitration is a factor to be considered when determining waiver.in this case,however,microstrategy delay in seeking arbitration was relatively short.although microstrategy filed three separate actions against lauricia before seeking arbitration,it requested arbitration approximately one month after lauricia filed her complaint,and the time between the filing of the first action and the arbitration request was less than six months.nothing in the record suggests that this delay,in and of itself,caused lauricia to suffer actual prejudice.see,maxum,at m ere delay,without more,will not suffice to constitute waiver.in re mercury constr,cir en banc i t is only when delay results in actual prejudice that it may amount to default within the federal arbitration act,aff sub nom.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.any delay by microstrategy in asserting its right to arbitration,therefore,is insufficient to support a finding of waiver.
whether microstrategy waived its right to insist on arbitration by virtue of its litigation activities is a more difficult question.when concluding that lauricia was prejudiced by microstrategy litigation activities,the district court took into account all of microstrategy activities in the prior actions.see lauricia,d at.most of microstrategy conduct in the prior actions,however,was in connection with its claims which sought to prevent lauricia from disclosing trade secrets or other confidential information.because these claims are distinct,both factually and legally,from lauricia discrimination claims,the litigation surrounding these claims can not support a finding that microstrategy waived its right to arbitrate the unrelated claims.see subway equip.leasing forte,cir a party only invokes the judicial process to the extent it litigates a specific claim it subsequently seeks to arbitrate.doctor,distajo,cir o nly prior litigation of the same legal and factual issues as those the party now wants to arbitrate results in waiver of the right to arbitrate.although microstrategy declaratory relief claims asserted in the prior actions involve the same legal and factual issues underlying lauricia claims against microstrategy,we can not conclude,as did the district court,that the mere inclusion of these claims permits us to factor into the waiver analysis microstrategy actions in connection with the distinct claims.as noted above,the bulk of the activity in the prior actions was directed toward the claims,and no decision on the merits of the declaratory relief claims was ever made in any of the actions.under these circumstances,we believe it was error for the district court to rely on the litigation of the trade secret claims to support its waiver finding.
to be sure,the litigation of the prior actions did involve many motions,responses,and other procedural maneuvers more than,according to lauricia,including a appeal by microstrategy of the district court dismissal of microstrategy and there is no doubt that the litigation involved the expenditure of substantial sums of money by all involved.in fact,because the state court in microstrategy ii refused to dismiss lauricia attorney as a defendant,lauricia was forced to hire another attorney to represent her in that action.but because the prior actions were primarily directed to claims unrelated to those asserted by lauricia,the expense and effort associated with those claims can not be used in support of the argument that microstrategy waived its right to arbitrate the discrimination claims.see doctor,at concluding that legal expenses incurred in connection with litigation of unrelated claims did not amount to prejudice sufficient to support a waiver finding rush oppenheimer,cir no waiver of the right to arbitrate can occur from conducting discovery on claims.alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.because neither the delay,nor the litigation surrounding the trade secrets claims,nor the expense associated with that litigation can support a finding of waiver,we are left with the district court conclusion that lauricia was prejudiced because the discovery obtained by micro
