this appeal arises from the interplay of federal court orders,public employee labor agreements,legislative approval of those agreements,and purportedly binding labor arbitration.
the department of personnel administration dpa negotiated with the service employees international union,local union,representing certain medical employees of the california department of corrections and rehabilitation cdcr.this produced two similar memoranda of understanding the mous increasing the salary ranges for some union employees by certain percentages,effective january.the legislature and governor approved these mous in september.
in october,the federal plata court ordered an increase in those same salary ranges by a larger amount than the mous,effective retroactively to september,
the dpa declined to apply the mou salary increases on top of the plata increases,generally taking the view that they had been superseded by the larger plata increases.the union filed a grievance,contending that the mou increases had to be applied to whatever salary ranges were extant on january,and therefore should be calculated on top of the plata increases.the dispute was submitted to a labor arbitrator,who sided with the union,and the trial court confirmed the arbitration award.
dpa and cdcr collectively,the state timely filed this appeal.on appeal,the state generally contends the arbitration award violates public policy because its effect is to pay salaries above the levels approved by the legislature.
based on two decisions of this court one decided after the judgment we agree with the state even if the arbitrator correctly interpreted the mous,salary increases still must be approved by the legislature to be effective.see california statewide law enforcement department of personnel administration th,d cslea department of personnel administration california correctional peace officers th,d ccpoa.
although the legislature was aware that the mous might be construed so that the mou salary increases would be calculated on top of the plata increases,the expense of such an interpretation was not explicitly presented to and approved by the legislature.accordingly,we must reverse with directions to the extent it interpreted an ambiguity in the mous,the arbitrator award must be confirmed however,to the extent that the arbitrator award mandates the agreement be enforced without unequivocal legislative approval,it violates public policy cslea,supra,th at,d and must be vacated.
further,the portion of the arbitrator award purporting to retain jurisdiction over this dispute must be vacated.as we shall explain,the union remedy,if any,is to obtain passage of a bill approving the higher salaries,a remedy squarely in the political realm.neither the arbitrator nor the judiciary has the power to implement the arbitration award.
background 
plata litigation 
after protracted litigation,the plata court found the state prison medical care fell below federal constitutional norms.on december,the plata court entered an interim order to increase compensation for some cdcr employees through recruitment and retention pay differentials,equivalent to a compensation increase of percent.
effective april,the plata court appointed a receiver to take over delivery of medical services to cdcr prisoners,and the receiver was granted power to renegotiate existing contracts,including contracts with labor unions.the plata court ordered that,if a state law or contract impeded remedial efforts,the receiver shall request the court to waive the state or contractual requirement that is causing the impediment.upon receipt of any such request,the court shall determine the appropriate procedures for addressing such request on a basis.
meanwhile,dpa and the union had been negotiating new mous regarding bargaining unit medical and social services bu,and bargaining unit registered nurse bu,and ultimately agreed on mous effective july,through june.these mous provided for equity increases to be added to the maximum salary rate of various salary ranges by percentages ranging from to percent,effective january,a separate percent general salary increase gsi was also provided,effective july,for all union classifications.
both mous reference the plata litigation,albeit in less than crystalline language as follows classifications receiving the plata differentials shall have their differential adjusted downward by a dollar amount that will result in the incumbents receiving the same gross monthly salary as was received prior to the general salary increase.the bu mou also states it is clearly understood that as the gsi of july,and the above step adjustments are implemented,the plata differentials shall be reduced accordingly to achieve parity in base salary,and a plata differential of ten percent above base salary.should the court order any additional adjustments,the parties shall meet and confer over the appropriate adjustments,if necessary,for classes.
costing summary and appropriation 
on june,dpa gave the legislature a costing summary stating as these step increases and the cola are implemented,the plata differentials will be adjusted so that the base salaries for plata classes remain higher than classes.if the court orders any additional adjustments,the parties shall meet and confer over the appropriate adjustments,if necessary,for classes.dpa cost estimates were relied on by the legislative analyst office lao,which itself prepared an analysis for the legislature,dated july,estimating the fiscal year cost of the mous and certain other agreements not here relevant of about million,although the union did not see dpa estimates until the arbitration a department of finance dof enrolled bill report for the legislature also describes a million cost for the first fiscal year.the lao analysis mentioned the possibility of court orders in general,and in particular mentioned the plata case in part as follows effective january,registered nurse classifications would have their top salaries increased by percent.these and other increases would be administered so that correctional and mental health nurses that received percent pay increases this spring as a result of court orders in the plata case would have pay levels percent over those of nurses in other departments.
the mous were approved by the legislature and governor,and became effective on september,in a bill the parties refer to as ab.stats,ch.ab also appropriated approximately million to pay for the various mous.
waiver of state law 
on september,the week after the mous were approved,the receiver moved for an order waiving state law.on october,the plata court granted the receiver unopposed motion,stating in part 
t he receiver developed adjusted salary ranges for cdcr clinicians that are more consistent with those paid by the state at hospitals operated by the university of california health care system.citation.the receiver and his staff then spent several weeks discussing this matter with defendants and the relevant state agencies.defendants did not dispute either the reasonableness of the recommended salary ranges or the necessity of implementing them promptly.they declined,however,to unilaterally implement them because of questions regarding constraints imposed upon them by state law 
although defendants could not implement the recommended salary adjustments promptly on their own,they invited the receiver to request a waiver of those state laws that posed obstacles to making the recommended salary adjustments in a timely fashion,and offered to assist the receiver in their implementation.
the plata order lists specific laws to be waived to permit the receiver to direct the implementation,adjustment and administration of the proposed salaries and structural changes to the pay system attached to his motion as exhibit and states the state reaffirmed support for the proposed salary adjustments and the need for a waiver given the requirements of california law.the order states the plata court could not permit the state to attempt to address the issue of inadequate salaries through normal collective bargaining channels because it has already had this opportunity and failed.the order also provides 
the following state law requirements shall be waived for the sole and limited purpose of enabling the receiver to direct the implementation,adjustment,and administration of the proposed salaries and structural changes to the pay system set forth in exhibit to the receiver motion for waiver.
california government code sections.
california code of regulations title,section.
in granting this limited waiver,the court clarifies that such waiver is not intended to relieve defendants or the state of any of their duties and responsibilities under california law,including the obligation to collectively bargain regarding salaries.
the statutes waived include those prescribing dpa duty to set salary ranges,and the state duty to bargain in good faith with unions.the plata order implements an percent increase in salary ranges,retroactive to september,and these raises took effect without legislative approval 
arbitration 
dpa later asserted that the plata raises,which exceeded those provided by the mous,in effect superseded the mous.the union took the position that the mou raises had to be calculated on top of the plata raises.
the parties submitted the interpretive dispute to binding arbitration,pursuant to mou grievance procedures.on july,the arbitrator entered an award agreeing with the union and ordering the following remedy the employees at issue shall be made whole for all lost income and benefits.the arbitrator retains jurisdiction over any dispute that may arise out of the implementation of the remedy.
trial court proceedings 
on july,the state petitioned to vacate the award,contending the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction by changing the salary structure approved by the legislature,and that the award interferes with the plata order.the union sought confirmation of the arbitrator award.
the trial court confirmed the arbitration award,and the state timely filed this appeal.the appeal lies.code civ,subd.d.
subsequent federal court proceedings 
after the notice of appeal was filed,the state moved in federal court to clarify the plata order,to specify that the employees who received plata pay increases in october should continue to receive those pay increases,but not the labor market adjustments bargained in the mous prior to the plata order.the union opposed this motion,partly calling it a thinly veiled attempt to get another bite at the apple.
on august,the plata court partly granted the state motion to clarify,but not in a way that helped the state.the plata court acknowledged that the mous became effective on september,and provided for salary increases effective january,but stated in part 
although the agreements became effective prior to the briefing on the receiver motion for waiver of state law,neither the receiver nor defendants briefing mentioned the future increases contained in these mous.
to date,dpa has not authorized payment of the mou increases because it has taken the position that the salary ranges in the court october,order superseded all previously negotiated salaries the case is currently pending on appeal before the california third district court of appeal.
the intent of the court order was to replace all salary ranges with the new ranges proposed by the receiver.the court was unaware at the time that any clinical salaries were due to be increased under collective bargaining agreements in january less than three months may well have denied those increases after such a short time had they been timely presented to the court however,no evidence of any such increases was presented to the court,and the court can not now say that it intended to waive something of which it was unaware.
the court did not and does not now approve any salary increases beyond those contained in exhibit to the receiver september,motion for waiver of state law,and no party has requested such an order,let alone made the required showing that such increases are required to remedy the constitutional issues in this case.however,the court did not and does not now prohibit any salary increases that are implemented consistent with state law.
on appeal,the union incorrectly asserts the plata court struck down the state argument.instead,as indicated in the above quotation,the plata court merely declined to resolve the issue presented by this appeal,because it was not timely presented to the plata court 
discussion 
we agree with the union that the arbitrator interpretation of the mous the plata order must be sustained,because it was not arbitrary.see part i,post.but,contrary to the union view,because the legislature did not approve the resulting higher salaries,the mous as construed by the arbitrator can not bind the legislature.therefore the arbitrator lacked authority to award relief,and perforce lacked authority to retain jurisdiction over the dispute.see part ii,post.finally,as we shall explain,the trial court finding that the state had not shown funds were not available to pay the higher salaries does not support confirming the arbitration award.see part iii,post.
the arbitral interpretation of the mous 
the parties stipulated that the correct interpretation of the mous was an issue properly before the arbitrator.however,the mou grievance procedures provided the arbitrator shall have no authority to add to,delete,or alter any provisions of this contract,or any agreements supplementary thereto,but shall limit the decision to the application of the contract to the facts and circumstances at hand.the trial court found that even if the arbitrator misinterpreted the mous,that would not provide grounds to set aside the award.we agree.because the mous did not unambiguously explain how a subsequent order in the plata case would be coordinated with the mou salary range increases,we can not say the arbitrator award was irrational or that it arbitrarily remade the contract.
a trial court shall vacate an arbitration award if the arbitration panel exceeds its powers and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision.code civ,subd.a.this can occur if the award violates a public policy.ccpoa,supra,th at,d see jordan department of motor vehicles th,d.but,with limited exceptions,an arbitrator decision is not generally reviewable for errors of fact or law,whether or not such error appears on the face of the award and causes substantial injustice to the parties.ccpoa,supra,th at,d.a trial court may vacate an award interpreting a contract if and only if it rests on a completely irrational construction of the contract citations or amounts to an arbitrary remaking of the contract.advanced micro devices,intel cal th,d.
an ambiguity exists when language as applied to a concrete dispute is reasonably susceptible of different,plausible,meanings.abers rounsavell th,d california state auto.inter ins.bureau superior court d,fn.
the mous are ambiguous as to their relationship to the plata increases.they provided for specific increases to the maximum salary ranges for specific employees,effective january.they became effective on september,with a gsi effective retroactively to july.however,as we described ante,the ranges also took effect before january.the state plausibly posits that the mou increases effectively became moot,because of the earlier and higher plata increases.the union plausibly posits that the mou increases were intended to increase whatever the maximum salary ranges were extant on january.
both candidates of meaning tendered by the parties are plausible,because although the mous mentioned the plata litigation,they did not clearly explain whether a plata court order raising salary ranges would add to the mou raises,or supersede them.therefore,the arbitrator interpretation,choosing between two plausible constructions,was not irrational.
accordingly,to the extent the judgment confirms the arbitrator interpretation of the mous,it must be affirmed.
arbitral power regarding state employee compensation 
the union contends our prior decisions limiting the scope of arbitral power regarding state employee compensation are distinguishable and do not bar the arbitral relief granted in this case.although the facts of our prior decisions differ from this case,the principle we announced is fully applicable,and compels a partial reversal.
in ccpoa,supra,th,d,an mou contained a scrivener error,and an arbitrator reformed the mou to correct the error.ccpoa,supra,at,d.the trial court vacated the award on the ground that the arbitrator had exceeded her powers,because the drafting error was unknown to the legislature and governor when they approved the mou.id.at,d.
we affirmed,because,in changing the terms of the mou after it was approved by the legislature,the arbitrator exceeded her powers by violating the dills act and the important public policy of legislative oversight of state employee contracts.ccpoa,supra,th at,d.we explained that reformation due to mutual mistake is not a proper remedy if it prejudices the rights of a third party.ccpoa,supra,at,d,citing hess ford motor cal th,d,see.the mou grievance procedures in ccpoa precluded the arbitrator from altering the agreement,to assure the legislature that the mou it approves is the parties actual contract,that there are no agreements to which it is not privy,and that the mou will not be altered subsequently.ccpoa,supra,th at,d.
the trial court herein distinguished ccpoa as follows 
the fact that the legislature approved the mous distinguishes this case from ccpoa,supra,th d,in which the court held the arbitrator exceeded his authority by reforming an mou and enforcing terms that were never submitted to the legislature.here,it is undisputed that the terms of the mous were submitted to and approved by the legislature.thus,to some extent petitioners argument reduces to the proposition that an arbitrator interpretation of language in a contract approved by the legislature is equivalent to an arbitrator action reforming a contract to contain terms never approved by the legislature.were that the law,the rules pertaining to arbitral finality would be seriously compromised in every case involving the interpretation of language contained in a contract to which the state is a party.
however,this narrow construction of ccpoa proves untenable in light of a subsequent decision of this court.
in cslea,supra,th,d,an mou reclassified certain union members from miscellaneous to safety status a status conferring enhanced retirement benefits and that mou was approved by the legislature.cslea,supra,at,d.however,that mou did not state whether or not the reclassification would apply to prior service.an arbitrator concluded the reclassification applied retroactively,and the arbitral award was confirmed by the trial court.id.at,d.
we reversed in part,summarizing our holding as follows 
w e defer to the arbitrator decision,based on extrinsic evidence,that the agreement between dpa and cslea to move employees of unit into safety member retirement status included an agreement to apply the new status retroactively to encompass all prior service credit by members employed as of july.however,the mou presented to the legislature did not contain language that the change to safety member status would apply retroactively to convert prior miscellaneous member status to safety member status senate bill was silent as to whether the benefit would apply retroactively to prior service and the legislature was not provided with a fiscal analysis of retroactive application of the agreement.because the part of the agreement giving unit employees retroactive safety service credit was never explicitly presented to the legislature for approval,as required by the dills act,the arbitrator erred in concluding that senate bill mandates retroactive safety member retirement benefits.accordingly,we will reverse the judgment to that extent.the retroactive part of the agreement may be enforced only if it and its fiscal consequences are explicitly submitted to,and approved by vote of,the legislature.cslea,supra,th at,d.
the arbitrator in cslea had found a fiscal analysis presented to the legislature expressly noted the possibility of retroactivity.cslea,supra,th at,d.the trial court had upheld the award,because the arbitrator did not reform the parties agreement in a manner that changed the provisions approved by the legislature.cslea,supra,at,d.applying a deferential review,we accepted the arbitrator conclusion that both dpa and cslea intended the agreement to apply retroactively to prior service credit at the time the agreement was negotiated.id.at,d.nonetheless,we rejected the view that by filling in the silence of the mou in cslea,the arbitrator was merely interpreting that mou 
n othing in senate bill or section defining certain employees as safety members,effective july,indicates the legislature approved conferring the safety member retirement status retroactively to cover prior miscellaneous member retirement service credit.such approval is necessary under the dills act.citations.consequently,to the extent that the arbitrator award mandates that the agreement be enforced without unequivocal legislative approval,it violates public policy for the same reasons as in ccpoa,supra,th d.
cslea believes that this is a flawed and interpretation of ccpoa because the parties in that case neglected to eliminate a contract provision due to a scrivener error and,thus,the legislature approved a contract that included a provision the arbitrator later deleted to conform to the intent of the contracting parties.here,in contrast,the agreement is silent on the point whether the safety member retirement benefit will be retroactive.but that is the point.
the legislature enacted senate bill to effectuate an mou that did not contain the parties entire agreement.the arbitrator rectified this after the fact by construing the mou as bestowing retroactive safety member retirement service credit for prior miscellaneous member service credit.that ccpoa involved a deletion from the express written terms of the mou,whereas this case involves an addition to the express written terms of the mou,is a distinction without a difference.
section was enacted to enable unit to qualify for safety member retirement benefits in accordance with the parties mou.absent language in the written mou stating the benefit would be retroactive,we can not say that section was intended to do anything more than give unit members safety retirement benefits effective july.stated another way,we can not say that the legislature approved the unwritten agreement to bestow the safety member benefits retroactively.indeed,the arbitrator found the enabling bill,which echoed the march agreement,was silent on whether the benefit was intended to apply retroactively to cover an employee previous service in a classification that was being reclassified from miscellaneous to state safety.
cslea and the superior court appear to believe that it is sufficient the legislature was aware the benefit could be conferred retroactively in light of certain statutes and enrolled bill reports 
however,the mere fact the legislature was aware that dpa might determine to credit the miscellaneous service as safety service does not mean that the legislature was aware the parties negotiated mou actually included an unwritten agreement for retroactivity.cslea,supra,th at,d.
we then summarized the applicable rule as follows 
simply stated,it is not sufficient that the legislature was aware dpa could agree with cslea to make the safety member retirement credit retroactive.the legislature had to be informed explicitly that dpa and cslea did enter into such an agreement,be provided with a fiscal analysis of the cost of retroactive application of the agreement,and with said knowledge,vote to approve or disapprove the agreement and expenditure.
because senate bill and the materials provided to the legislature regarding the bill did not state that the reclassification would be applied retroactively and did not contain a fiscal analysis of the cost of the retroactive application of safety member status for all employees in unit,fn.we must vacate that portion of the arbitration award as violating the public policy embodied in the dills act.cslea,supra,th at,d.
here,in the instant case,the union correctly states that the legislature was advised the plata order could potentially im
