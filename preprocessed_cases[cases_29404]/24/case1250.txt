in this employment dispute,defendant redfin corporation appeals from the trial court order denying its motion to compel arbitration of the claims asserted in plaintiff scott galen class action lawsuit.the court concluded plaintiff claims are based on alleged statutory violations and are therefore not encompassed by the parties contractual agreement.additionally,the court found that even if the claims fall within the agreement,the agreement arbitration provision is unconscionable and therefore invalid.we now reverse.
factual background and procedural history 
defendant provides residential real estate brokerage services for home buyers and sellers.the company is based in seattle,washington.plaintiff lives in danville,california.
on august,the parties entered into a field agent independent contractor agreement agreement.the agreement is approximately three and a half pages long,with two columns on each page.the document is a form contract drafted by defendant.pursuant to the agreement,defendant engaged plaintiff as a contract field agent cfa.the parties agreed that plaintiff,as a cfa,would perform duties and services hereunder as an independent contractor.in this capacity,plaintiff was to spend part of his work time doing work activities in the field and away from an office,including but not limited to taking prospective residential home buyers on home tours,providing access to properties for home inspections and appraisals,conducting open houses at homes that were for sale,as well as driving to and from various properties associated with these assignments throughout his assigned territor y.either party could terminate the agreement without cause with five days written notice.additionally,plaintiff was required to bear certain costs,such as auto insurance and membership in a multiple listing service mls.
on january,plaintiff filed the instant complaint on behalf of himself and other similarly situated individuals,alleging defendant improperly classified him and other cfa as independent contractors when they were actually serving as employees under california law.plaintiff alleged claims under the labor code and unfair competition laws ucl for unpaid overtime,missed meal and rest periods,inaccurate and untimely wage statements,waiting time penalties,and unreimbursed business expenses.
on april,defendant filed a motion to compel arbitration.in its motion,defendant noted paragraph of the agreement requires all disputes be submitted to mediation and binding arbitration.it also noted the agreement provides that it is to be governed,construed,and enforced in accordance with the laws of the state of washington 
paragraph provides,in part all disputes among the parties arising out of or related to this agreement which have not been settled by mediation shall be resolved by binding arbitration within the state of washington if the parties can not agree upon an arbitrator within twenty days from the date written demand for arbitration is served,the party demanding arbitration may commence an action for the limited purpose of obtaining appointment of an arbitrator by the superior court of the state of washington for king county.any arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the american arbitration association aaa then in effect,although the arbitration need not be conducted by the aaa.any arbitration award may be enforced by judgment entered in the superior court of the state of washington for king county.
on april,plaintiff filed his opposition to the motion to compel arbitration.he asserted that because his misclassification claims were and not otherwise dependent upon the existence of the agreement,the arbitration clause did not apply and arbitration could not be compelled as a matter of law.he further asserted the clause was invalid due to the combined procedural and substantive unconscionability of its terms.he also argued that the washington state provision did not apply to this dispute.in an accompanying declaration,he stated his belief that his right to redress was unduly burdened by the agreement requirement that he pay all of defendant attorney fees if he loses at arbitration.he also asserted traveling to washington state to attend an arbitration would impose an excessive financial burden.
on may,the trial court denied defendant motion to compel arbitration.the court held the arbitration clause was governed by the federal arbitration act faa.faced with whether washington or california state laws apply to construe the scope of the arbitration provision,the court resolved the issue under california law because the action was brought in california and the arbitration provision clause expressly disclaimed the application of washington conflict or choice of laws law.the court also found that,under california law,the arbitration clause did not apply to plaintiff statutory claims because those claims were based on statutes and not on the parties contract.alternatively,the agreement was ruled unconscionable due to unrebutted evidence of substantial procedural unconscionability,and some albeit less substantive unconscionability.this appeal followed.

ii.the arbitration agreement encompasses plaintiff claims 
we first address whether the trial court erred in concluding plaintiff causes of action do not fall within the scope of the arbitration provision.plaintiff contends his misclassification claims arise from the labor code and not from any terms set forth in the agreement.he asserts the assessment of whether he and the purported class were misclassified will turn on statutory factors set forth by california law and not any rights afforded by the agreements.he further contends his employment status must be proven independent of the agreement through other company documents or witness testimony.defendant counters that the work for which plaintiff seeks compensation in this lawsuit was specifically described in,and performed as a result of,the agreement.additionally,the business expenses that he seeks reimbursement for were specifically referenced and assigned to the cfa under the terms of the agreement.
paragraph of the agreement initially states in the event that any disputes arise regarding the interpretation or enforcement of this agreement,such disputes shall be resolved as follows italics added.the paragraph goes on to discuss the use of good faith negotiations followed by mediation,if necessary.in the event mediation fails or is refused,the agreement provides that all disputes arising out of or related to this agreement which have not been settled by mediation shall be resolved by binding arbitration within the state of washington.italics added.after noting that any ambiguity as to the scope of related claims should be construed against defendant,the trial court found the arbitration provision did not encompass plaintiff claims because they will be determined by applicable wage and hour law,regardless of the agreement terms.the court relied largely on narayan egl,cir,narayan.
at the outset,we observe a decision of import that was not cited by either party in their briefs or at oral argument perry thomas perry.there the supreme court addressed the application of california labor code section section to a private arbitration agreement under the faa.section states in relevant part actions to enforce the provisions of this article labor code sections inclusive for the collection of due and unpaid wages claimed by an individual may be maintained without regard to the existence of any private agreement to arbitrate the supreme court held in perry that a suit alleging particular labor code violations in disregard of a private agreement to arbitrate the dispute where interstate commerce is involved would be preempted by the faa.congress interest in protecting private arbitration agreements preempts any state interest in allowing litigants using state courts to enforce such violations.the faa withdrew the power of the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration.perry,supra,at see also thi of new mexico at hobbs center,llc patton cir.the holding in perry was underscored by justice grimes in her dissent in elijahjuan superior court th elijahjuan,discussed below.
several of plaintiff causes of action specifically allege labor code violations that fall within the article that includes section.this would include the second failure to provide meal periods,third failure to provide rest periods,fourth failure to pay earned wages upon discharge,and sixth failure to furnish accurate itemized wage statements causes of action,specifically,of the seven total causes of action.as to the fourth cause of action failure to pay earned wages upon discharge,the trial court holding is clearly erroneous under perry.under labor code section,a n individual arbitration agreement does not apply to an action to enforce statutes governing collection of unpaid wages,which may be maintained without regard to the existence of any private agreement to arbitrate citation.the intent is to assure a judicial forum where there exists a dispute as to wages,notwithstanding the strong public policy favoring arbitration.citations.an exception to the general rule occurs when there is federal preemption by the faa,as applied to contracts evidencing interstate commerce.citation.hoover american income life ins.th,hoover,citing perry,supra,at,italics added.here,it is undisputed that the faa applies to the agreement.accordingly,plaintiff fourth cause of action is preempted by the faa under perry see perry,at.
in narayan,the ninth circuit explained the distinction between rights arising under a contract and those arising under a california labor code statute.the issue in narayan was whether a contractual provision requiring use of texas law applied to alleged labor code violations.the appellate court explained that the alleged violations did not arise out of the contract,reasoning that the plaintiffs claims for relief were dependent on whether they were employees as opposed to independent contractors,which in turn was dependent on the definition that the otherwise governing law not the parties gives to the term employee.the court further explained that although the contracts were relevant,the labor code claims did not arise out of them,stating while the contracts will likely be used as evidence to prove or disprove the statutory claims,the claims do not arise out of the contract,involve the interpretation of any contract terms,or otherwise require there to be a contract.ibid.here,narayan is distinguishable in that it did not concern the issue of the enforceability of arbitration agreements 
in the present case,the gravamen of plaintiff complaint is that defendant misclassified him as an independent contractor.the agreement is the instrument that classified him as such and that governed his relationship with defendant,including the services he was to provide and the method by which those services would be compensated.for example,plaintiff admits that his work included taking prospective residential home buyers on home tours,providing access to properties for home inspections and appraisals,and conducting open houses at homes that are for sale.these are the very same services that he agreed to perform pursuant to his agreement for specific compensation on a basis.further,to the extent he complains that defendant did not properly reimburse him for certain business expenses,including car insurance and mls membership fees,the agreement expressly assigned these expenses to him.thus,his claims regarding his contractual employment status necessarily arise out of the agreement.
plaintiff asserts our courts have consistently held that actions challenging employer misclassification of employees as independent contractors fall outside the scope of arbitration provisions contained in independent contractor agreements.he relies on elijahjuan,supra,th,and hoover,supra,th.to the extent these cases contradict our holding,we decline to follow them.
in elijahjuan,the second district court of appeal addressed an arbitration agreement that required arbitration for disputes regarding the application or interpretation of the agreement.th.it also limited the arbitrator authority to issue an award in a way that excluded california substantive law.id.at.concluding the plaintiff wage and hour claims did not involve the application or interpretation of the agreement,and because the arbitrator did not have the authority to consider california substantive law,the majority held that the claims were not subject to arbitration.id.at.
the elijahjuan majority opinion declared the lawsuit was not covered by the arbitration clause,stating petitioners lawsuit does not concern the application or interpretation of the agreements,but instead seeks to enforce rights arising under the labor code benefitting employees but not independent contractors.no allegation in the first amended complaint is based on rights afforded petitioners under the terms of the agreements.the parties dispute therefore can not be characterized as regarding the application or interpretation of the agreements.id.at.reasoning that the legal inquiry for the misclassification claim would focus on extracontractual statutory factors,the court found that dispute involve d neither the application nor the interpretation of the agreements,but rather involve d consideration of petitioners actual work.id.at.the court concluded that the parties agreement did not encompass any claims arising out of the contract,let alone any claims arising out of its application or interpretation.more importantly,the labor code claims do not arise out of the contract but instead are distinct from the rights under the agreements in short,because the parties did not agree to arbitrate the dispute in this case,the order compelling arbitration must be reversed.id.at.
elijahjuan is distinguishable on its facts.here,the relevant arbitration clause applies to disputes arising out of or related to the agreement.in elijahjuan,the relevant clause applied only to disputes concerning the application or interpretation of the parties agreement.even if we accept plaintiff more restrictive interpretation of paragraph,namely,that it applies only to the interpretation or enforcement of the agreement,the dispute here does relate to the enforcement of the agreement in that plaintiff is asserting in his complaint that the agreement itself is unenforceable because it wrongfully designated him as an independent contractor.
we also find the dissenting opinion in elijahjuan to be compelling.in her dissent,justice grimes stated plaintiffs claims challenge whether the agreements control the terms of their compensation,or whether the labor code applies.such a dispute falls squarely within the language of the arbitration clause,which requires arbitration of all disputes with regard to the application or interpretation of the parties agreements.elijahjuan,supra,th,dis.opn.of grimes.justice grimes first noted,when an arbitration agreement is subject to the faa,questions concerning the construction and scope of the arbitration clause are determined by federal law.citation.id.at.she criticized the majority opinion for giving the agreements a narrow interpretation and ignoring law requiring doubts about the applicability of an arbitration clause to be resolved in favor of arbitration id.at,concluding the dispute fell within the arbitration clause because,r esolution of plaintiffs claims requires a determination whether the agreements apply to set the terms of plaintiffs compensation,or whether the labor code controls.id.at.we concur with the dissent view that the majority opinion and the trial court ruling in the present case amounts to a judicial rule barring arbitration of wage and hour claims under the labor code in any contract that purports to have been made with an independent contractor,even a contract affecting interstate commerce,in contravention of the principles stated in at t mobility llc concepcion.when state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim,the analysis is straightforward the conflicting rule is displaced by the faa.elijahjuan,at.
hoover american income life ins,supra,th,also cited by the trial court,is not on point.hoover involved an insurance sales agent claims of independent contractor misclassification.the parties entered into a contract with an arbitration clause,which required arbitration i n the event of any dispute or disagreement arising out of or relating to this contract.hoover,at.in refusing to enforce the arbitration agreement,the appellate court held the defendant implicitly waived its right to arbitrate because,prior to moving to compel arbitration,it had caused considerable delay,conducted litigation in a style inconsistent with the right to arbitrate,and availed itself of mechanisms not available at arbitration,such as depositions.id.at.the court also stated,in dicta,that california law applied to the agreement,not the faa,and therefore labor code section was not preempted.id.at.the hoover court itself expressly acknowledged the faa preempts the rule that statutory claims are not subject to private arbitration agreements when the arbitration agreement is in a contract involving interstate commerce.id.at.again,in our case it is undisputed that the faa applies.
we note hoover was recently criticized in lane francis capital management llc th lane.in lane,a former employee brought an action against the employer for various claims,including claims for statutory violations of the labor code.id.at.the employer moved to compel arbitration.id.at.the plaintiff opposed the motion,relying on hoover for the proposition that his statutory labor code claims were not subject to arbitration because the arbitration agreement failed to specify the labor code provisions at issue.id.at.in rejecting the plaintiff position,the second district court of appeal found hoover overly broad to the extent it suggests state statutory wage and hour claims are categorically exempt from arbitration.id.at.instead,the lane court explained the plain language of labor code section is limited to actions for the collection of due and unpaid wages brought under sections through section does not apply to all statutory wage and hour claims,emphasis in original.the court further observed,hoover broad presumption against the arbitration of statutory labor claims conflicts with armendariz.ibid.
plaintiff also relies on quinonez empire today,llc,wl,at.in that case,the district court denied a motion to compel arbitration in an independent contractor misclassification action where the clause required arbitration of any and all disputes,claims or controversies arising under or relating to this agreement id.at because t he claims brought by plaintiff do not arise under the contract between the parties but from the california labor code.id.at.again,for the reasons stated above,we do not find this holding persuasive 
i ii.conflict of law 
we turn to the issue presented by the agreement.defendant asserts the enforceability of the arbitration clause is governed by the law of washington state,not california,pursuant to the agreement provision that says,t his agreement shall be governed by,construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the state of washington,without giving effect to principles and provisions thereof relating to conflict or choice of laws italics added.defendant claims the trial court erred when it declined to enforce this clause and applied california law instead of washington law to plaintiff contract defense of unconscionability.
under california law,there is a strong policy favoring the enforcement of provisions.nedlloyd line superior court cal th.plaintiff contends,and the court below agreed,that california law applies to the conflict issue because the clause in question expressly disclaim s the application of washington conflict or choice of laws leaving the applicable conflict of laws undecided.defendant asserts the agreement reference actually means that washington law applies notwithstanding washington principles.in our view,the provision is somewhat ambiguous.regardless,because defendant limits its argument to the issue of which state laws apply to plaintiff contractual defenses to the arbitration agreement we need not decide this issue as we discuss below,we conclude that even under california law,plaintiff unconscionability claim lacks merit.
iv.the agreement is not unconscionable 
a.the doctrine of unconscionability 
civil code section,subdivision a states if the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract,or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause,or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.this provision applies to arbitration agreements.armendariz,supra,cal th at.
u nconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element,the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,the latter on overly harsh or results.citation.the prevailing view is that procedural and substantive unconscionability must both be present in order for a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability.citation.but they need not be present in the same degree t he more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.armendariz,supra,cal th at,emphasis in original.in the present case,the trial court found the agreement was unconscionable due to unrebutted evidence of substantial procedural unconscionability,and some albeit less substantive unconscionability.
procedural unconscionability 
the procedural element of an unconscionable contract generally takes the form of a contract of adhesion little auto stiegler,cal th.an adhesive contract is defined as a standardized contract,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.citation.armendariz,supra,cal th at.it is well settled that adhesion contracts in the employment context,that is,those contracts offered to employees on a basis,typically contain some aspects of procedural unconscionability.serpa california surety investigations,th,serpa.assuming the agreement here is adhesive in character,this adhesive aspect of an agreement is not dispositive.ibid.courts have observed that w hen,as here,there is no other indication of oppression or surprise,the degree of procedural unconscionability of an adhesion agreement is low,and the agreement will be enforceable unl
