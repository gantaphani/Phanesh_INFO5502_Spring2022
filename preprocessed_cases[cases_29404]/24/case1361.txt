an application for employment contains an arbitration clause providing,i agree,in the event i am hired by the company,that all disputes and claims that might arise out of my employment with the company will be submitted to binding arbitration.is the arbitration agreement,obligating the if she is hired to arbitrate her claims without imposing a reciprocal requirement on the employer in connection with its claims against the employee 
in her petition for writ of mandate challenging the trial court order compelling arbitration of her discrimination and wrongful termination claims against her employer,under the fair employment and housing act feha,et,gabriela roman contends this i agree language manifests only a unilateral obligation to arbitrate.when the adhesive nature of the contract is also taken into account,roman asserts the agreement to arbitrate is procedurally and substantively unconscionable and,therefore,unenforceable.
the trial court properly granted petition to compel arbitration.absent some indicia in the agreement that arbitration is limited to the employee claims against the employer,the use of the i agree language in an arbitration clause that expressly covers all disputes creates a mutual agreement to arbitrate all claims arising out of the applicant employment.accordingly,whatever elements of procedural unconscionability may be present in employment adhesion contracts,the agreement to arbitrate does not lack mutuality of obligation so as it make it substantively unconscionable.
factual and procedural background 
roman began working for in as a receptionist she was later promoted to the accounts receivable department.in february she was diagnosed with depression and placed on disability leave.roman alleges she was unlawfully terminated later that year.
after filing a complaint with the department of fair employment and housing dfeh and receiving notice of a right to sue,in september roman filed a complaint against in the los angeles county superior court asserting statutory claims under feha for disability discrimination,failure to accommodate,failure to engage in a timely and good faith interactive process and retaliation and a common law claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy.in november demurred to the complaint without referring to the arbitration provision.subsequently served a notice of deposition and request for production of documents on roman,responded to roman requests for written discovery with objections only no substantive responses and moved to compel responses to the discovery it had served,all without raising the issue of arbitration.
in december,before the hearings on the motion to compel and the demurrer,petitioned the court to compel arbitration based on an arbitration provision in roman employment application,which she had signed just before her hire in november.
the arbitration provision,contained in a separate paragraph initialed by roman,provided,i hereby agree to submit to binding arbitration all disputes and claims arising out of the submission of this application.i further agree,in the event that i am hired by the company,that all disputes that can not be resolved by informal internal resolution which might arise out of my employment with the company,whether during or after that employment,will be submitted to binding arbitration.i agree that such arbitration shall be conducted under the rules of the american arbitration association.this application contains the entire agreement between the parties with regard to dispute resolution,and there are no other agreements as to dispute resolution,either oral or written.
roman opposed the petition to compel arbitration,arguing had waived any right it may have had to arbitrate the dispute by engaging in discovery in the action.in addition,she argued the arbitration agreement was unenforceable.in particular,roman asserted the agreement was procedurally unconscionable because it was contained in a contract of adhesion and substantively unconscionable because it lacked mutuality of obligation,requiring her to arbitrate her claims without limiting right to a judicial forum.roman also argued the arbitration agreement,which incorporated the rules of the american arbitration association aaa,was substantively unconscionable in other respects because aaa rules in effect in were in conflict with the supreme court articulation of minimum safeguards in armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,armendariz.
in its reply in support of its petition,submitted a declaration from john grimes,its chief operating officer.grimes explained he began working at in roman lawsuit was the first employment action other than workers compensation since he began at the company and,at the time was served with the complaint,he was unaware of the arbitration provision in the employment applications.also argued its delay in asserting its right to arbitrate was minimal and the discovery it had undertaken was not in any way inconsistent with proceeding by arbitration.
on july,the trial court granted petition to compel arbitration.although the court agreed with roman that the adhesive nature of the agreement created an element of procedural unconscionability,it rejected roman arguments concerning substantive unconscionability,finding the arbitration agreement required both roman and to arbitrate all disputes and,therefore,did not lack mutuality of obligation.in its written ruling the trial court did not address waiver argument.
on august,roman filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the trial court order compelling arbitration.after requesting informal opposition to the petition,on november,we issued an order to show cause as to why the requested relief should not be granted.on december,filed its return to the petition,and on december,roman filed her reply.
discussion 
standard of review 
a petition to compel arbitration based on a written arbitration agreement must be granted unless grounds exist to revoke the agreement.code civ,subd.b.an agreement to arbitrate,like any other contract,is subject to revocation if the agreement is unconscionable.see,subd.a i f the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract,or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause,or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.
absent conflicting extrinsic evidence,the validity of an arbitration clause,including whether it is subject to revocation on unconscionability grounds,is a question of law subject to de novo review.nyulassy lockheed martin th,d stirlen supercuts,th,d.
generally,the determination whether a party to the arbitration agreement has waived the right to arbitrate is a question of fact that we review for substantial evidence.saint agnes medical center pacificare of california cal th,d,saint agnes guess,superior court th,d there is no single determinative test of waiver,and the question for the trial court is one of fact.for us,the question is whether the trial court decision is supported by substantial evidence.when,however,the facts are undisputed and only one inference may reasonably be drawn,the issue is one of law saint agnes,at,d.
governing law on unconscionability 
unconscionability has both procedural and substantive elements.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,jones wells fargo bank th,d.although both must appear for a court to invalidate a contract or one of its individual terms armendariz,at,d,wayne staples,th,d wayne mercuro superior court th,d,they need not be present in the same degree t he more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.armendariz,at,d,wayne,at,d.
procedural unconscionability focuses on the elements of oppression and surprise.discover bank superior court cal th,d,wayne,supra,th at,d.oppression arises from an inequality of bargaining power which results in no real negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice surprise involves the extent to which the terms of the bargain are hidden in a prolix printed form drafted by a party in a superior bargaining position.wayne,at,d see also mercuro superior court,supra,th at,d procedural unconscionability focuses on the oppressiveness of the stronger party conduct.
substantive unconscionability focuses on the actual terms of the agreement and evaluates whether they create overly harsh or results armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,accord,little auto stiegler,cal th,d,little,that is,whether contractual provisions reallocate risks in an objectively unreasonable or unexpected manner.jones wells fargo bank,supra,th at,d.substantive unconscionability may take many forms,but typically is found in the employment context when the arbitration agreement is in favor of the employer without sufficient justification,for example,when the employee claims against the employer,but not the employer claims against the employee,are subject to arbitration.little,at,d,see also armendariz,at,d,i t is unfairly for an employer with superior bargaining power to impose arbitration on the employee as plaintiff but not to accept such limitations when it seeks to prosecute a claim against the employee,without at least some reasonable justification for such based on business realities kinney united healthcare services,th,d s ubstantive unconscionability focuses on the terms of the agreement and whether those terms are so as to shock the conscience.
the arbitration agreement is not unconscionable 
a.the adhesive nature of the agreement is not dispositive 
roman contends the arbitration agreement was procedurally unconscionable because it was part of a contract of adhesion,that is,it was contained in a preprinted form prepared by the employer and presented to roman on a basis with no opportunity to negotiate.the supreme court has acknowledged that adhesion contracts in the employment context typically contain some measure of procedural unconscionability.see,armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,i n the case of preemployment arbitration contracts,the economic pressure exerted by employers on all but the most employees may be particularly acute,for the arbitration agreement stands between the employee and necessary employment,and few employees are in a position to refuse a job because of an arbitration requirement accord,little,supra,cal th at,d.
here,there is no dispute the arbitration agreement was part of an adhesion contract nonetheless,whatever procedural unfairness is inherent in an adhesion agreement in the employment context,it was limited in this case.the arbitration provision was not buried in a lengthy employment agreement.rather,it was contained on the last page of a employment application,underneath the heading please read carefully,initial each paragraph and sign below.it was set forth in a separate,succinct paragraph that roman initialed,affirming she had seen it.higgins superior court th,d higgins procedural unconscionability high when arbitration provision was buried in,document and,a lthough petitioners were required to place their initials in boxes adjacent to six other paragraphs,no box for initials appeared next to the arbitration provision.
in any event,whatever measure of procedural unconscionability may be present in this case involving an adhesive employment agreement between parties with unequal bargaining power,procedural unconscionability alone does not render an agreement unenforceable.there must also be some measure of substantive unconscionability.little,supra,cal th at,d,armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.roman asserts there is.emphasizing the i agree language in an agreement that provides all disputes arising out of her employment will be submitted to binding arbitration,roman insists the clause must be interpreted to apply only to her claims,and not.the argument is not persuasive.
b.the arbitration agreement is bilateral 
roman relies primarily on the court of appeal analysis in higgins,supra,th,d to support her argument the arbitration provision at issue here creates only a unilateral obligation to arbitrate.in higgins a husband and wife and their children opened their home to take care of five siblings,ages,and,after the siblings parents died.a home renovation reality television show heard the news and,pursuant to a contract with the siblings and the homeowners,razed the homeowners home,built a new home with adequate space for the siblings,paid the mortgage and then broadcast the story.soon after the house was built,the homeowners allegedly made the siblings including their adult sibling guardian leave the home.when the reality show featuring the story was later rebroadcast,the siblings sued the homeowners and the television production company responsible for the show.
the television defendants petitioned the trial court to compel arbitration of the claims against it pursuant to the arbitration provision in a contract and release signed by the siblings and their guardian in connection with their appearance on the show.the arbitration agreement provided,i agree that any and all disputes or controversies arising under this agreement or any of its terms,any effort by any party to enforce,interpret,construe,rescind,terminate or annul this agreement,or any provision thereof,and any and all disputes or controversies relating to my appearance or participation in the program,shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the following procedure all arbitration proceedings shall be conducted under the auspices of the american arbitration association i agree that the arbitrator ruling,or arbitrators ruling,as applicable,shall be final and binding and not subject to appeal or challenge the parties hereto agree that,notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph,producer shall have a right to injunctive or other equitable relief as provided for in california code of civil procedure section.or other relevant laws.higgins,supra,th at,d.
the siblings opposed arbitration,asserting the agreement to arbitrate was unconscionable and therefore unenforceable.the trial court ordered arbitration.our colleagues in division eight of this court granted a petition for writ of mandate and directed the trial court to vacate its order compelling arbitration.higgins,supra,th at,d.
the higgins court began its analysis by emphasizing the agreement heightened level of procedural unconscionability,observing the arbitration clause was buried in a lengthy form document containing pages with several more pages attached as exhibits drafted by the television defendants and given to young,unsophisticated and emotionally vulnerable orphans with little time or ability to understand or review it.it also found troubling that,although other provisions of the agreement included a space next to the paragraph to be initialed separately,the arbitration provision did not.higgins,supra,th at,d.
in addition to this strong showing of procedural unconscionability higgins,supra,th at,d,the court also found the agreement to arbitrate was unilateral and,therefore,substantively unconscionable.according to the court,the arbitration agreement i agree language referred exclusively to the siblings and included no corresponding reference to the television defendants or their duty to arbitrate.the court rejected the television defendants arguments that the language requiring all disputes arising out of the agreement be arbitrated reflected a mutual duty to arbitrate.the court found that argument miss ed the point only one side the siblings had agreed to that clause.id.at,d.
contrary to roman assertion,higgins is not on all fours with this case.the procedural unconscionability in the higgins contract was far greater than arguably exists in the instant case.as discussed,the arbitration provision,separately initialed by roman,is contained in a relatively short agreement rather than buried in a agreement with multiple attachments,and is written in clear,understandable language.more significantly,in addition to the i agree language itself,the higgins court pointed to other aspects of the arbitration agreement,such as the television defendants unilateral reservation of the right to seek injunctive relief without identifying the corresponding business necessities for reserving that right,that reinforced its conclusions on lack of mutuality and substantive unconscionability.see higgins,supra,th at,d.no comparable provisions exist in the arbitration clause at issue here.in sum,we simply do not believe the higgins court intended to hold the mere inclusion of the words i agree by one party in an otherwise mutual arbitration provision destroys the bilateral nature of the agreement.little,supra,cal th at,d,arbitration agreement providing,i agree that any claim,dispute,or controversy arising from employment will be subject to arbitration and i understand by agreeing to this binding arbitration provision,both i and the company give up our rights to trial by jury was not substantively unconscionable.
even if the language in the arbitration provision were somehow ambiguous on this point,given the public policy favoring arbitration see saint agnes,supra,cal th at,d,legislature has expressed a strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution and the requirement we interpret the provision in a manner that renders it legal rather than void see,a n interpretation which gives effect to agreement is preferred to one which makes void,if possible without violating the parties unambiguous intent,a contract is interpreted so as to make it lawful,operative,definite,reasonable and capable of being carried into effect,we would necessarily construe the arbitration agreement as imposing a valid,mutual obligation to arbitrate.indeed,if had sued roman and roman sought arbitration,there is no doubt we would interpret the agreement to bind to arbitrate.see,when ambiguity not resolved by extrinsic evidence,language of a contract should be interpreted most strongly against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist.we see no reason to reach a different result when is the one seeking arbitration.
roman reliance on municipal resource consultants th,d is simply misplaced.involved an employment agreement that provided,you the employee therefore agree that mrc,in addition to all other rights,shall have the right to file a lawsuit in any court of competent jurisdiction,to enjoin you from engaging in such activities and to seek any other equitable relief that may be appropriate.section of the employment contract contained an arbitration clause providing,any claim that you may have arising out of or relating to this agreement,or breach thereof,or your employment by mrc,or the termination of your employment by mrc,shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association then in effect there shall be no discovery.neither mrc right to file a lawsuit seeking an injunction nor mrc right to injunctive relief is subject to arbitration or to the provisions of this section.id.at,d,italics omitted.
our division four colleagues concluded the agreement to arbitrate was unconscionable and unenforceable,supra,th at,d.the court observed that section of the contract,granting mrc the right to file a lawsuit for injunctive relief,in addition to all other rights,expressly allowed the employer to sue the employee in court.see id.at,d the inclusion of the phrase in addition to all other rights can only mean mrc was similarly preserving the right to file any lawsuit it felt in its interest.otherwise,the phrase in addition to all other rights has no import.in light of section reservation of the employer right to sue,the court explained,it made no sense to interpret section arbitration clause to apply bilaterally.see ibid.the immediate juxtaposition of section reserving mrc right to file an action for injunctive and equitable relief in addition to other rights with section compelling to arbitrate all of his claims clearly conveys mrc has no obligation to arbitrate any claim it may have against.no similar employer reservation of rights is contained in the roman arbitration agreement.
nyulassy lockheed martin th,d nyulassy,on which roman also relies,is similarly inapposite.in nyulassy the predispute arbitration clause,contained in the employment agreement,provided,if i object to or disagree with any lockheed martin personnel decision relating to or affecting the terms and conditions of my lockheed martin employment,i agree i shall seek to resolve my objection or disagreement through discussions within successive levels of my supervisory chain of command,until the objection or disagreement is resolved or i have had the opportunity to discuss the matter with the vice president,human resources,or such other senior management official responsible for human resources matters within the lockheed martin business unit to which i am assigned.i understand and agree that if the dispute or controversy is not resolved to my satisfaction by means of such discussion s,my sole and exclusive remedy and avenue of redress is through arbitration proceedings conducted in accordance with the employment dispute resolution rules of the american arbitration association i understand that by agreeing to arbitration of any and all such disputes and controversies i hereby knowingly,willingly and advisedly waive any and all rights to pursue judicial proceedings or actions and remedies which i might otherwise have been entitled to pursue,or which might otherwise have been available to me,in the absence of the waiver established by this sentence id.at,fn,d,capitalization omitted.the agreement also required the employee to file a demand within days of the employer termination decision and provided the failure to satisfy the limitations period resulted in a waiver of the employee claims.ibid.
the court of appeal determined the agreement was unilateral and contained other substantively unconscionable elements.nyulassy,supra,th at,d.unlike the agreement in the instant case,which covered all disputes,the arbitration provision in nyulassy was triggered only by the employee objection or disagreement with a personnel decision relating to or affecting his or her employment.by its terms,it applied only to the employee claims and not to the employer.moreover,the arbitration agreement in nyulassy provided a shortened contractual statute of limitations,requiring the employee to file a written demand for arbitration within days from when the dispute arose or waive the claim entirely,thereby limiting the employee feha rights.thus,the agreement in nyulassy was far different from the agreement in this case,which,by its terms,applied to all disputes,whether initiated by the employee or by and did not purport to deprive the employee of any statutory rights under feha.
c.the arbitration agreement does not limit roman statutory feha rights or impose an undue limitation on discovery 
roman also contends the arbitration agreement,incorporating the aaa rules,unconscionably limits discovery.in the aaa rules provided as they did in at the time arbitration was demanded,t he arbitrator shall have the authority to order such discovery,by way of deposition,interrogatory,document production,or otherwise,as the arbitrator considers necessary to a full and fair exploration of the issues in dispute,consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.roman asserts this is unconscionable because it unfairly delegates to the arbitrator the absolute discretion to deny depositions,contrary to code of civil procedure section et,which affords litigants the absolute right to take depositions.
in armendariz,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court rejected an employee similar claim that a purportedly inadequate provision for discovery in an arbitration agreement was a proper ground for denying arbitration of their feha claims.although the court observed some discovery is often necessary for vindicating a feha claim id.at,d,it held whether or not the employees in this case are entitled to the full range of discovery provided in code of civil procedure section,they are at least entitled to discovery sufficient to adequately arbitrate their statutory claim,including access
