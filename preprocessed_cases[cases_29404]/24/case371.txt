appellants are individual investors seeking to arbitrate claims against appellee raymond james financial services rjfs that arose when the investors purchased allegedly fraudulent securities directly from inofin,inofin.as a member of the financial industry regulatory authority finra,rjfs has agreed to arbitrate any dispute with a customer that arises in connection with the business activities of the firm.appellants contend that they are rjfs customers because they purchased inofin securities on the advice of an attorney who,though lacking any formal affiliation with rjfs,was a business and personal acquaintance of an rjfs registered representative.
for the reasons that follow,we hold that appellants are not customers of rjfs within the meaning of the finra arbitration provisions.to compel arbitration here would be to expand the scope of the arbitration agreement beyond what the text permits and the parties intended.therefore,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
inofin is a massachusetts corporation that raised over million from hundreds of investors between and.around,inofin president michael cuomo recruited his former college roommate kevin keough,then a registered representative of morgan stanley dean witter,morgan stanley,and david affeldt,keough friend,brokerage customer,and tax attorney,to refer investors to inofin.these investors purchased unregistered promissory notes directly from inofin,believing that the company was investing in auto loans.
according to the securities and exchange commission sec,keough wanted to avoid receiving referral compensation directly from inofin because he was employed by morgan stanley,a regulated.cuomo and keough thus agreed that inofin would pay keough wife,nancy keough nancy,for keough referrals.sometime in,nancy and affeldt agreed to share equally in any referral fees they received from inofin,regardless of who made the actual referral.at the time this agreement was concluded,keough was still employed by morgan stanley.three years later,in,he joined rjfs,and his wife continued to share inofin referral fees with affeldt.
in january,inofin revealed that it was insolvent following protracted losses that began in after the company commenced new types of lending that were not properly disclosed to investors.shortly after inofin financial state came to light,the company entered bankruptcy,and the sec instituted civil enforcement proceedings against the company and its executives for violations of the federal securities laws.
appellants peter cary,dayna smith,robert barkin,and christine spolar are inofin investors who sustained losses on the unregistered promissory notes.they purchased the notes between and after affeldt personally met with each of them and recommended each invest in inofin.both nancy and affeldt received commissions from inofin for these transactions.
on may,the investors filed a joint finra statement of claim against rjfs,alleging,inter alia,violations of state securities laws and finra conduct rules.the investors alleged that keough assured them that their investments were fully collateralized by auto loans when inofin was actually operating a ponzi scheme in which executives diverted the invested funds towards propping up their own failing businesses and covering personal expenses.the investors sought arbitration of their claims pursuant to finra rule,which requires finra members such as rjfs to arbitrate disputes between a customer and a member or associated person of a member if arbitration is requested by the customer and the dispute arises in connection with the business activities of the member or the associated person.
on september,rjfs commenced this lawsuit in the eastern district of virginia,seeking declaratory and injunctive relief barring arbitration of the investors claims on the grounds that the finra arbitration provisions do not apply to the dispute because appellants are not and have never been rjfs customers.shortly thereafter,the parties stipulated to the following key operative facts concerning the putative relationships among appellants,affeldt,inofin,and rjfs 
the investors had no personal contact with keough regarding inofin.
affeldt personally met with the investors and recommended each invest in inofin.
the investors did not hold any accounts including trade accounts with rjfs at any time.
affeldt did not tell the investors that he was acting for a person who claimed to be an rjfs representative.
affeldt did not represent to the investors that he was affiliated with rjfs.
the investors did not understand that they were purchasing inofin or any other security from rjfs.
the investors did not understand they were purchasing inofin from an agent whom they believed to be authorized to act on behalf of rjfs.
following a hearing on the matter,the district court found that the connection between rjfs and appellants was insufficient to bring the dispute within the scope of the finra arbitration provisions.the district court therefore granted rjfs motion for a permanent injunction barring arbitration of the investors claims.this appeal followed.
appellants the investors contend that their claims are subject to arbitration because david affeldt,the attorney who recommended the inofin securities to them,had connections to kevin keough,an rjfs registered representative.appellants urge us to read finra rule broadly in accordance with the judiciary longstanding presumption in favor of arbitration and find that they are,in fact,rjfs customers.however,we conclude that no presumption in favor of arbitration applies in this case and that appellants are not customers of rjfs under our established interpretation of rule.a customer very often relies upon the representations or reputation of the entity with which the customer deals,but in this case,the investors made their decision to invest independently of any recommendation on the part of rjfs.to find a customer relationship in such a situation would impose responsibility on a company whose name was never so much as utilized to induce the investors to part with their funds.
appellants argue here,as they did below,that any ambiguity in the term customer as it used in finra rule must be resolved in their favor because of a strong national public policy favoring arbitration.appellants br.at.appellants rightly point out that arbitration is a favored mechanism of dispute resolution because it provides speed,economy,and efficiency and allows a organization such as finra to police its members activities by creating remedies not available in federal court for violations of the organization rules.id.at.but while it is beyond question that the supreme court has recognized such advantages and adopted a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,compucredit greenwood,d quoting moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d internal quotation marks omitted,appellants overlook the fact that a court can not apply any presumption in favor of arbitration unless there already exists an enforceable arbitration agreement between the parties.see ubs fin.svcs.carilion clinic,wl,at cir.
arbitration is a matter of consent,not coercion,volt info,bd.of trs.of leland stanford,d,and federal arbitration policy does not alter that maxim.as this court has recently noted,the touchstones of arbitrability analysis are the twin pillars of the parties consent and intent to arbitrate,peabody holding united mine workers of,cir.the supreme court has never held that the presumption in favor of arbitration overrides the principle that a court may submit to arbitration only those disputes the parties have agreed to submit.carilion clinic,wl,at quoting granite rock int l of teamsters,d.the presumption,while certainly a critical component of the law governing arbitration agreements,applies only when a validly formed and enforceable arbitration agreement is ambiguous about whether it covers the dispute at hand,not when there remains a question as to whether an agreement even exists between the parties in the first place.granite rock.at see also morgan keegan silverman,wl,at cir.
when it accepted finra rule,rjfs agreed to arbitrate disputes with its customers,n
