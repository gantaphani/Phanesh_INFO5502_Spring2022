we have jurisdiction pursuant to and a and we affirm.we hold that fidelity waived its right to seek vacatur of the arbitration award based on the evident partiality of the arbitrator initially appointed by durga ma.fidelity had constructive notice of the arbitrator potential connections to the durga ma attorneys but did not object to the arbitrator appointment or his failure to make disclosures until after an interim award was entered in favor of durga ma.
fidelity and durga ma,a jewelry retailer,were parties to a private label credit card marketing and origination agreement agreement under which fidelity agreed to issue private label credit cards to customers of durga ma and affiliated jewelry retailers.shortly after the inception of the agreement,durga ma claimed that fidelity breached the agreement,and demanded arbitration of the disputed claim.the parties agreement provided for arbitration in the following terms 
if any disputes or controversies arise between the parties in connection with this agreement or their acts or duties hereunder,such disputes or controversies shall be submitted to and resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the laws of the state of california and the rules of the american arbitration association.each party shall select one arbitrator,and the arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator,which three arbitrators shall constitute the arbitration panel for the dispute.all arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in los angeles,california.the decision or award of the arbitration panel shall be final and binding and judgment thereon may be entered in a state or federal court with jurisdiction over the parties.it is understood that the arbitration panel shall have no authority to add to,subtract from,or modify any provision of this agreement.
durga ma appointed alton leib as its arbitrator and notified the american arbitration association aaa of its selection by letter on november.in may,fidelity selected the judith ryan,a retired california superior court judge,as its arbitrator.in september viggo boserup was engaged as the neutral arbitrator and administrator of the arbitration panel 
the arbitrators and the parties counsel convened for the first time in an october,phone conference to address preliminary matters.during the conference,both arbitrators agreed,with the consent of the parties,to act neutrally when considering the evidence and rendering an award 
neither fidelity nor durga ma requested a disclosure statement from any arbitrator at any time before or during the arbitration proceedings.neither of the arbitrators who were initially appointed by the parties provided a disclosure statement.neither fidelity nor durga ma objected to the arbitrators failure to provide disclosure statements.
the arbitration was conducted before the panel in july and september and included seven days of testimony.on september,the arbitrators issued a unanimous interim arbitration award in favor of durga ma.the panel awarded durga ma million in damages and left open the question of attorneys fees and costs.
on september,durga ma counsel filed papers in support of its request for attorneys fees and costs.durga ma submitted time records for its attorneys,egerman brown.the egerman brown time records revealed communications between arbitrator leib and durga ma counsel both before and after the october,phone conference at which the arbitrators agreed to act neutrally.fidelity accused durga ma of carrying out ex parte communications with arbitrator leib.
egerman brown represented durga ma at all relevant times in the arbitration and court proceedings.philip brown,named partner of egerman brown,served as lead counsel.lee egerman,an associate at egerman brown and the son of named partner mark egerman,served as and appeared at nearly every arbitration hearing.
on october,fidelity objected to any further proceedings before the arbitration panel and,three days later,requested limited discovery of the communications and relationship between arbitrator leib and the durga ma attorneys.fidelity was permitted to take the deposition of philip brown and obtain sworn declarations from mark egerman and arbitrator leib.
arbitrator leib disclosed that he had been married to mark egerman sister,maxine egerman,for years leib and maxine egerman were separated and divorced about years before leib became involved in this matter as an arbitrator.thus,arbitrator leib and mark egerman are former.arbitrator leib is also the former uncle of lee egerman,who served as throughout the arbitration proceedings.arbitrator leib and maxine egerman were separated when lee egerman was five years old.arbitrator leib two sons are lee egerman cousins.according to leib declaration,his divorce was bitter and he had very little contact with the egerman family thereafter.
philip brown,a partner at brown and egerman and lead counsel for durga ma on the fidelity matter,worked with arbitrator leib on a federal securities fraud case in the after their work was concluded,brown and leib maintained limited contact.according to brown and leib,they met for lunch on a few occasions between and 
brown and mark egerman,in addition to being law partners,are married to sisters,terry fenberg brown and lynn fenberg egerman.during the time that maxine egerman was married to leib,mark egerman and his wife,lynn,invested in a piece of real property with leib and maxine.the property was sold before leib and maxine egerman were divorced.
upon discovering these facts,fidelity moved the panel to vacate the arbitration award,arguing that arbitrator leib was evidently partial to durga ma based on his failure to disclose these personal and business relationships between leib and the durga ma attorneys.fidelity did not claim that leib was actually biased.
on february,the arbitrators determined that they lacked jurisdiction to review fidelity motion to vacate the arbitration award and denied the motion.
also on february,the panel issued a unanimous final arbitration award in favor of durga ma.the award granted durga ma over million in damages,attorneys fees of about,and costs of about.
fidelity moved the district court to vacate the arbitration award,and durga ma moved the district court to confirm the arbitration award under the faa.
the district court denied fidelity motion to vacate the arbitration award in a order without making findings of fact or conclusions of law about a month later,the district court granted durga ma corporation motion to confirm the arbitration award under the faa in a similarly brief minute order 
fidelity timely appealed both orders to this court.those appeals,and,have been consolidated for purposes of the parties briefing and our review.
on appeal,fidelity asserts that the arbitration award should be vacated because arbitrator leib displayed evident partiality when he failed to disclose personal and professional relationships with the durga ma attorneys at the arbitration proceedings when he agreed to act as a neutral arbitrator.
durga ma asserts that fidelity waived its right to seek vacatur for evident partiality because it was on notice that leib may have had personal or professional connections to durga ma or its attorneys,but failed to object to leib appointment or leib failure to submit a disclosure statement until after the interim arbitration award was issued.durga ma also argues that leib was never a neutral arbitrator who met disclosure requirements.alternatively,durga ma asserts that even if leib wa
