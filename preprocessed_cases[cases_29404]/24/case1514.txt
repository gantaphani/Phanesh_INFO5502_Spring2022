introduction 
this appeal involves the grievance procedure under a memorandum of understanding the mou between the metropolitan water district of southern california the mwd and the american federation of state,county,and municipal employees,local,the local,the union representing the mwd general employees.during its reorganization,the mwd created a number of new managerial positions.it then issued and amended a list of current supervisory employees who would automatically be placed in some of the new positions,leaving the remaining new jobs open to competitive bidding from mwd other employees.the local filed a grievance under the mou to challenge the amendment to the list.the mwd rejected the grievance.
in its three separate appeals,the local challenges the trial court orders denying its petition to compel arbitration code civ,denying its petition for writ of mandate,and granting the mwd fees and expenses,subd.o.we hold that the mou is not an agreement to arbitrate and affirm the order denying the local petition under section.we further hold that the trial court did not err in denying the petition for writ of mandate because the local failed to prove its entitlement to the relief it requested.finally,we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the mwd its cost of proof fees and expenses.accordingly,the three orders are affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
the parties.
the mwd is a governmental agency,formed under the metropolitan water district act stats,ch,et,west ann.ed.et.it imports,stores,and distributes water to member in southern california.metropolitan dist.of riverside cal d.
the local is one of four separate employee bargaining units.the local represents the mwd general employees.another unit,the supervisors association,represents the mwd supervisory personnel.each bargaining unit has its own mou.
the local mou.
the local and the mwd entered into an mou pursuant to the act.the mou is intended to be the full and entire understanding of the parties concerning personnel practices and the terms and conditions of employment.mou.
article of the mou contains a grievance and appeal procedure.after an informal meeting between the parties,the mou establishes a formal grievance process.mou.level one is initiated by the filing of a written grievance within days of the event giving rise to the grievance.mou.if unresolved,the grievance advances to level two,where it is addressed to higher level management.
provided that the formal grievance is pursued in a timely manner mou,an appeal procedure is available under section of the mou.pursuant to mou section,management determination after a level two formal grievance may be appealed to a neutral hearing officer.the mou declares the decision of the hearing officer shall be final and binding on the parties.mou.the mou next provides that the decision of the hearing officer can be appealed to a court pursuant to code of civil procedure section.mou.
the underlying dispute.
commencing in,the mwd underwent an internal reorganization and created new management positions.to fill these new posts,the mwd declared that certain current supervisory employees would be incumbents to particular manager slots,and would be placed in those positions without having to bid for the post.other positions would be filled by competitive bidding from a pool of employees that included members of the local.these posts were designated as new positions.
the mwd circulated a draft incumbent list in october.discussions were initiated with the supervisors association about necessary redesignations to the list because some members of that association were already performing the management jobs identified as new positions.ultimately,positions were redesignated from new to incumbent.the mwd issued a revised incumbent list in november.the local requested a meeting to discuss its concerns about the mwd changes to the incumbent list.
at the meeting,held on november,the mwd distributed the revised incumbent list.the local executive president,robert reeves,expressed the local view that the mwd was not entitled to modify the incumbent list without first meeting and conferring with the local and other employee organizations that represented mwd employees.according to the local,by changing the designations,the mwd reduced job opportunities for the local membership.the mwd responded that the positions at issue were not in the local bargaining unit that they were already filled by members of the supervisors association.hence,according to the mwd,it was not obligated to meet and confer with the local before redesignating those positions.
on january,the local conducted an informal meeting about modifications to the incumbent list with debbie dillon,the mwd employee relations officer and human resources manager.the meeting was not successful.eight days later,on february,the local presented its written grievance.
in the mwd response to the grievance,joe tait,its chief operating officer,asserted the mwd was not obligated to meet and confer about changes to the incumbent list as the list pertained to employees.the mwd also explained that the grievance was untimely.
the local initiated the appeal procedure under section of the mou by requesting in writing the appointment of a hearing officer.the mwd refused to proceed to the appeal process on the ground that the local had not filed a timely grievance.the mwd took the position that the informal discussions between the parties,under section of the mou,occurred on january,and the written grievance was filed on february,yet,the mwd had made no change to the incumbent list within days preceding the filing of the written grievance.
the local countered that it learned of the redesignations to the incumbent list at the january,meeting.thus,the local asserted,it had processed the grievance within the mou prescribed time limits.the local also claimed that the mwd had waived its right to assert timeliness.moreover,the local argued,any question of timeliness must be presented to a neutral arbitrator.
the local filed a petition to compel arbitration code civ,and a petition for writ of mandate.the trial court denied both petitions and then granted the mwd application for attorney fees and expenses in the amount of,subd.o.the local has appealed from all three orders.additional facts will be presented in connection with the pertinent discussions.
contentions 
the local contends that the trial court erred in denying its petition to compel arbitration erred in denying its petition for writ of mandate and abused its discretion in granting the mwd request for cost of proof fees.
discussion 
i.the trial court did not err in denying the local petition to compel arbitration.code civ.facts.
the local filed its petition to compel arbitration code civ,seeking to compel the mwd to arbitrate the grievance.
the mwd opposed the motion to compel on the grounds that section of the mou was not a contract to arbitrate,and even if it were,the local had failed to adhere to the time limit requirements of the grievance procedure outlined in section.
without reaching the timeliness question,the court denied the petition to compel arbitration on the ground the mou was not an agreement to arbitrate.the court entered judgment in december for the mwd.the local filed its first appeal.
standard of review.
under code of civil procedure section,unless the petitioner has waived arbitration,grounds exist for revocation of the agreement,or a party to the arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending matter with a third party creating the possibility of conflicting rulings,the trial court shall order the parties to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists.italics added quoted in amalgamated transit union local los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority th,d amalgamated.
unless the parties have clearly and unmistakably provided otherwise,the preliminary question of whether parties to a collective bargaining agreement have agreed to arbitrate a particular dispute is decided by the court,not the arbitrator.citation.thus,the parties generally are not required to arbitrate the arbitrability question.citations.amalgamated,supra,th at,d engineers architects community development th,d.
an order denying a petition to compel arbitration is appealable.code civ,subd.a.
generally,whether an arbitration agreement applies to a controversy is a question of law to which the appellate court applies its independent judgment where no conflicting extrinsic evidence in aid of interpretation was introduced in the trial court.where the trial court decision on arbitrability is based upon resolution of disputed facts,we review the decision for substantial evidence.citation.citation.amalgamated,supra,th at,d.although d oubts as to whether an arbitration clause applies to a particular dispute are to be resolved in favor of sending the parties to arbitration id.at,d,there exists no public policy favoring arbitration of disputes which the parties have not agreed to arbitrate.engineers architects community development,supra,th at,d.
here,extrinsic evidence was submitted addressing the meaning of final and binding in the mou appeal procedure.the trial court reviewed this extrinsic evidence and made a finding.therefore,although we may interpret the applicable provisions of the mou independently,the trial court determination of the disputed factual evidence is reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.amalgamated,supra,th at,d engineers architects community development,supra,th at,d.
c.the mou appeal procedure is not an arbitration agreement because it does not contain the core component of finality.
the mou section does not mention the words arbitration,arbitrate,or arbitrator.however,the absence of this terminology is not a determining factor in deciding whether the agreement is one for arbitration.renaissance hotel associates th,d,quoting painters dist.council moen d.more important is the nature and intended effect of the proceeding.citation.ibid.
as we recently explained,a rbitration is not defined in any statute.one appellate court surveyed the various definitions of arbitration and quoted from blacks law dictionary that arbitration is a process of dispute resolution in which a neutral third party arbitrator renders a decision after a hearing at which both parties have an opportunity to be heard.where arbitration is voluntary,the disputing parties select the arbitrator who has the power to render a binding decision.citation.citations.a lthough an arbitration can take many procedural forms,a dispute resolution procedure is not an arbitration unless there is a third party decision maker,a final and binding decision,and a mechanism to assure a minimum level of impartiality with respect to the rendering of that decision.citations.saeta superior court th,d,quoting from renaissance hotel associates,supra,th at,d.
here,the mou appeal procedure contains the first and third required elements.
as to the second factor,namely,a final and binding decision by the hearing officer,our supreme court instructs typically,those who enter into arbitration agreements expect that their dispute will be resolved without necessity for any contact with the courts.citation.the very essence of the term arbitration in this context connotes a binding award.citation.t he essence of the arbitration process is that an arbitral award shall put the dispute to rest.citation.this expectation of finality strongly informs the parties choice of an arbitral forum over a judicial one.the arbitrator decision should be the end,not the beginning,of the dispute.citation.expanding the availability of judicial review of such decisions would tend to deprive the parties to the arbitration agreement of the very advantages the process is intended to produce.citations.ensuring arbitral finality thus requires that judicial intervention in the arbitration process be minimized.citations.because the decision to arbitrate grievances evinces the parties intent to bypass the judicial system and thus avoid potential delays at the trial and appellate levels,arbitral finality is a core component of the parties agreement to submit to arbitration.thus,an arbitration decision is final and conclusive because the parties have agreed that it be so.by ensuring that an arbitrator decision is final and binding,courts simply assure that the parties receive the benefit of their bargain.moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,fns.omitted,first two italics added,last italics in original.
here,the mou appeal procedure does not contain this second element of a final and binding decision by the hearing officer.the mou section appeal procedure conflictingly states b.the decision of the hearing officer shall be final and binding on the parties.c.the decision of the hearing officer can be appealed pursuant to code of civil procedure section.as would be expected,the local cites to mou section.b,while the mwd relies on mou section.
a hearing officer decision is not final and binding where it is reviewable by a trial court under code of civil procedure section.specifically,arbitration awards are subject to very limited review code civ,subd.a see moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at,d.courts may not review either the merits of the controversy or the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the award.citation.california faculty superior court th,d.w ith limited exceptions,an arbitrator decision is not generally reviewable for errors of fact or law,whether or not such error appears on the face of the award and causes substantial injustice to the parties.citation.id.at,d,quoting from moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.even an error of law causing substantial injustice is not a ground for vacation or correction of an award.moncharsh,supra,at,d.this limited review of arbitration awards vindicates the intentions of the parties that the award be final.id.at,d.
by comparison,administrative decisions are open to somewhat more extensive trial court examination under code of civil procedure section.in resolving a petition for writ of mandamus,the trial court is authorized to examine whether the proceeded in excess of jurisdiction whether there was a fair trial and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion because of a failure to proceed as required by law,the order or decision was not supported by the findings,or the findings were not supported by the evidence.the court is also authorized to consider the weight of the evidence,subds.b c.given section of the mou allows for review in the judicial system under section,the clear intended effect,supra,th at,d of the mou appeal proceeding is that the hearing officer decision would only be final and binding when the trial court review has not been triggered by the filing of a writ of administrative mandamus.such an interpretation harmonizes the two seemingly conflicting provisions of the mou section.a construction of the mou that would make the hearing officer decision final would ignore the mou subsequent provision allowing for the trial court review of findings and of the merits of the proceeding.
the extrinsic evidence presented to the trial court in aid of interpreting the mou supports our interpretation.henry torres,the mwd deputy general counsel,declared that during his tenure at the mwd,the local always maintain ed the goal of obtaining binding arbitration and,consequently local persistently submitted proposals to achieve that goal.similarly metropolitan management has resisted conceding to binding arbitration,and has steadfastly refused to reach agreement on any appeal language providing binding arbitration.in particular,management has insisted on not waiving appeal rights to judicially challenge any decision reached through the mou appeal procedure.in his supplemental declaration,torres stated that he personally represented the mwd in two trial court proceedings involving local employees in which the mwd successfully defended against petitions to compel arbitration concerning the same appeal language at issue here.although the local declaration is in direct contradiction to torres statements,the trial court apparently believed torres.therefore,torres declarations provide substantial evidence to support the trial court conclusion that the mou appeal procedure was not intended to be final,but appealable to the courts via code of civil procedure section.
for these reasons,the mou section is not an agreement to arbitrate.the trial court did not err in denying the petition to compel arbitration.
ii.the trial court did not err in denying the local petition for writ of mandate.code civ.
after the trial court denied the mou petition to compel arbitration,the local filed its petition for writ of mandate pursuant to code of civil procedure section seeking to compel the mwd to select a hearing officer and to conduct a hearing on the grievance pursuant to section of the mou.
in its answer to the mandate petition,the mwd raised the affirmative defenses of the untimeliness of the grievance,laches,and the fact that the local was collaterally estopped to seek arbitration because the petition to compel arbitration was pending in a separate proceeding.the mwd also argued that the local did not have a beneficial interest in the posts on the incumbent list because they were managerial positions filled by members of the supervisors association.
the trial court denied the writ petition.in doing so,it found that the local did not meet its legal burden of pleading and proving entitlement to the writ the local lacked standing to bring the petition because it had no beneficial interest in the positions or employees upon which the underlying grievance was based the mou did not pertain to incumbent redesignations the grievance was not timely filed and was therefore barred by the mou mandatory provisions and the grievance was barred by the doctrine of laches.the local filed its second appeal.
standard of review.
a traditional writ of mandate under code of civil procedure section is a method for compelling a public entity to perform a legal and usually ministerial duty.citation.the trial court reviews an administrative action pursuant to code of civil procedure section to determine whether the agency action was arbitrary,capricious,or entirely lacking in evidentiary support,contrary to established public policy,unlawful,procedurally unfair,or whether the agency failed to follow the procedure and give the notices the law requires.citations.although mandate will not lie to control a public agency discretion,that is to say,force the exercise of discretion in a particular manner,it will lie to correct abuses of discretion.citation.in determining whether an agency has abused its discretion,the court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency,and if reasonable minds may disagree as to the wisdom of the agency action,its determination must be upheld.citation.citation.klajic castaic lake water agency th,d,fn.omitted.
in reviewing a trial court judgment on a petition for writ of ordinary mandate,we apply the substantial evidence test to the trial courts factual findings.citation.thus,foundational matters of fact are conclusive on appeal if supported by substantial evidence.citation.klajic castaic lake water agency,supra,th at,d.
c.the local did not demonstrate its entitlement to the writ.
among the reasons the trial court gave for denying the local writ petition,was that the local had failed to prove entitlement to the requested writ.the court ruled that the grievance was untimely filed with the result the grievance appeal was barred by the mandatory provisions of the mou 
there are two basic requirements for a traditional writ of mandate to issue a clear,present and usually ministerial duty on the part of the respondent and a clear,present and beneficial right in the petitioner to the performance of that duty citations.santa clara county counsel woodside cal th,d,catalina investments,jones th,d.
here,the local has failed to carry its burden as petitioner under code of civil procedure section to prove its right to the performance of an mwd duty under the mou.the local can not make this showing of a right to the appeal procedure under section of the mou because,as the trial court found,the local grievance was untimely filed.
the time limits under the mou are mandatory.an appeal under section of the mou may only be brought if the grievants have first met the requirements of section procedure mou.section states clearly that if a grievant fails to appeal from one level to the next level within the time limits established in this grievance procedure,the grievance shall be considered settled on the basis of the last response by management and the grievance shall not be subject to further appeal.mou,italics added.
the time limits are established in section of the mou the grievant,the local here,must file the written grievance within thirty days from the event giving rise to the grievance or from the date the grievant could reasonably have been expected to have had knowledge of such event.the local has admitted that these mou provisions govern the grievance proceedings at issue here.
the event giving rise to the grievance was the mwd incumbent redesignations.according to the evidence submitted by the mwd in opposition to the petition for writ of mandate,the last revised incumbent list was prepared and disseminated on november.this list was given to the local on that same date during the meeting held with the local.therefore,the mwd asserts,november,was the date triggering the time period of mou section,and any written grievance had to be filed within days,or by december.
however,the local written grievance was not filed then.the informal meeting under mou section occurred on january.the written grievance is dated february,even later than that.the mwd stated,in response to the local filing,that it viewed the grievance as being untimely.therefore,according to the mou,the grievance was considered settled on the basis of the mwd last response,and could not be subject to further appeal.mou.having failed to first meet the requirements of section procedure the local had no right to the appeal procedure of the mou section that it sought to enforce in its petition for writ of mandate.mou.
to create a dispute,the local contends january,is the date it learned of the event giving rise to the grievance.mou.the local cites its letter from that day complaining about the unilateral changes to the incumbent list.the letter asks the mwd whether it had agreed to modify the incumbent list.yet,that letter indicates that the local knew before january,of the revisions.the text of the letter supports the trial courts implicit conclusion that the local used the letter to alter the date from which the period commenced,with the result the letter did not overcome the mwd evidence to the contrary.although the evidence is conflicting,substantial evidence supports the trial court finding that the grievance was not timely brought.klajic castaic lake water agency,supra,th at,d.
therefore,because the local failed to meet the mou time requirements it lost the right to the appeal procedure under mou section,and hence could not demonstrate to the trial court,pursuant to code of civil procedure section,its clear,present,and beneficial right to the mwd performance of that procedure.santa clara county counsel woodside,supra,cal th at,d,catalina investments,jones,supra,th at,d.
contrary to the local assertion,the trial court did hold an evidentiary hearing into the question of whether the grievance was timely filed.the hearing was based on the declarations and other documents filed by the parties.in a law and motion,writ of mandate hearing,the trial court has broad discretion to decide a case on the basis of declarations and other documents rather than live,oral testimony.citations.california school employees del norte county unified sch.dist.th,d,citing cal.rules of court,rule.the facts were thoroughly presented by the declarations,exhibits,and other evidence presented by the parties 
the local argues that the mwd timeliness defense should have been decided by the hearing officer during the appeal procedure and not by the trial court.the local cites napa association of public employees county of napa d.napa,criticized in platt pacific,andelson cal th,d,for the proposition that the hearing officer determines gateway issues of timeliness in napa,the employees union local memorandum of understanding contained a grievance procedure similar to the mou here,except that in napa,the procedure culminat ed in binding arbitration.napa,supra,at.after its grievance was rejected as untimely filed,the union sought to compel arbitration under code of civil procedure section.that statute requires the court to order arbitration unless it determines that a the right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner,italics added.napa held that the mere assertion of a party failure to file a grievance within the time specified in the agreement,in the absence of proof of intentional abandonment of the right to arbitrate or substantial prejudice resulting from the delay,is not of itself sufficient to raise a question of waiver within the meaning of code of civil procedure section and that the trial court therefore erred in finding waiver as a matter of law.id.at,italics added.
napa is distinguished for the essential reason that,in contrast to napa,this case does not involve arbitration.whether the right to arbitrate is waived under code of civil procedure section involves entirely different considerations than those at issue under code of civil procedure section.napa considered whether the failure to timely file a grievance affected a waiver of the contractual right to binding arbitration,subd.a,whereas the court here was charged with determining whether the local carried its burden to demonstrate a clear and present right to performance of a duty by the mwd.santa clara county counsel woodside,supra,cal th at,d.this question in turn required a determination whether there existed anything under the mou that the mwd could perform.as already demonstrated,the mou is not an agreement to arbitrate,and so waiver of a right to arbitrate under section is irrelevant.
toward that end,platt pacific,andelson,supra,cal th,d,is instructive.in platt,the parties agreed that a demand for arbitration was to be made within a certain timeframe.platt deemed the demand a condition precedent to be performed before the contractual duty to submit the dispute to arbitration arose.id.at,d.under the law of contracts,parties may expressly agree that a right or duty is conditional upon the occurrence or nonoccurrence of an act or event.citations.thus,a condition precedent is either an act of a party that must be performed or an uncertain event that must happen before the contractual right accrues or the contractual duty arises.citations.id.at,d.
likewise here,a condition precedent to the contractual right to the grievance appeal procedure under the mou never occurred.by virtue of the local untimely filing,its grievance had become final mou platt pacific,andelson,supra,cal th at,d,and never progressed to the appeal phase where a hearing officer determination of timeliness could have been made.the mwd was not obligated to perform under section of the mou.this court will not order the idle act,of directing the mwd to engage in a grievance appeal when it would have no clear and present duty to do so.santa clara county counsel woodside,supra,cal th at,d.
we are aware of cases standing for the proposition that timeliness and waiver are issues for the arbitrator to decide.see,kennedy,cabot national of securities dealers,th,d boys club of san fernando valley,fidelity deposit th,d napa,supra,d at.these cases are inapposite as they involve petitions to compel arbitration along with the public policy favoring arbitration and not petitions for a writ of mandate where there is no agreement to arbitrate.because the mou grievance procedure does not culminate in arbitration,the same public policy does not apply to justify sending the question of timeliness to a hearing officer.
there was no error in denying the petition for writ of mandate.
iii.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the mwd motion for attorney fees and expenses.code civ,subd.o.
a.the facts.
the mwd propounded a set of requests for admission.the local responded to six of the requests by objecting to the request,then admitting portions,and otherwise denying each request.with respect to three more requests,the local responded by objecting to and then flatly denying the request.
after prevailing on the local petition for writ of mandate,the mwd filed its application for attorney fees and expenses,seeking an award of.code civ,subd.o.the mwd alleged that the local had falsely and deceptively denied nine of the mwd requests for admission about the mou internal deadlines and when the local knew about the changes to the incumbent list.these facts related directly to the central issue of whether the local was entitled to the grievance appeal hearing it sought in its petition for writ of mandate.the mwd argued that the local unreasonable denial of these facts forced it to prove their truth.
in opposing the motion,the local argued,inter alia,that the mwd waived its right to fees by failing to move to compel responses.code civ,subds.l o.
the court found that the local had denied most of the admission requests,all of which were substantially important to the issues of this case.it found the local had no reasonable grounds to deny these requests and the mwd thereafter proved the truth of the matters contained therein.the court also found that no objection to the requests was sustained nor was any response waived.the fee award was for all of the money requested.the local appeal ensued.
subdivision o of code of civil procedure section states in relevant part,if a party fails to admit the truth of any matter when requested to do so under this section,and if the party requesting that admission thereafter proves the truth of that matter,the party requesting the admission may move the court for an order requiring the party to whom the request was directed to pay the reasonable expenses incurred in making that proof,including reasonable attorney fees.the trial court must order fees unless it finds that one of the four listed grounds for denial apply.ibid.
the primary purpose of requests for admissions is to set at rest triable issues so that they will not have to be tried they are aimed at expediting trial.citation.the basis for imposing sanctions is directly related to that purpose.unlike other discovery sanctions,an award of expenses is not a penalty.instead,it is designed to reimburse reasonable expenses incurred by a party in proving the truth of a requested admission citations such that trial would have been expedited or shortened if the request had been admitted.citations.stull sparrow th,d.
the determination of whether a party is entitled to expenses under code of civil procedure section,subdivision o is within the sound discretion of the trial court.citation.stull sparrow,supra,th at,d.
c.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the fees.
reviewing the record,it shows,in response to each of the nine requests for admission at issue,that the local lodged objections and then unequivocally and flatly answered the entirety of the requests by providing an admission a denial.for example,the mwd request for admission number asked,admit that the same memo,referred to in the immediately preceding request for admission,had an attachment that identified which employees will be appointed into new management positions,a list of those management positions that will be filled using a competitive process,and that this attachment became known as the list.the local responded that it objects to this request on the ground that it seeks information beyond the scope of discovery and that the document speaks for itself.without waiving these objections,local admits that the october,memo included an attachment which became known as list.except as specifically admitted,local responds as follows deny.likewise,request for admission number stated admit that grievance was filed more than thirty days after the event giving rise to the grievance and from the date local had knowledge of such event.the local responded that it objects to this request on the ground that it seeks information beyond the scope of discovery and it is compound.without waiving these objections,local responds as fol
