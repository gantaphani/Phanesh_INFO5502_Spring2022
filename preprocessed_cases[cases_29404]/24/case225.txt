pennecom pennecom appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york chin,granting the motion of merrill lynch,merrill lynch international,and paul pittman collectively,merrill lynch to dismiss by reason of collateral estoppel.merrill lynch had advised elektrim elektrim,a polish company,when elektrim contracted to purchase from pennecom the shares of pilicka telefonia pilicka.when elektrim refused to go through with the purchase,pennecom initiated arbitration proceedings against elektrim in london as provided by the share purchase agreement spa between pennecom and elektrim,seeking damages of million.the arbitration panel found elektrim liable for breach of contract and awarded pennecom approximately million in damages and costs,which pennecom collected.
pennecom then brought this suit against merrill lynch,seeking damages in excess of the million awarded by the arbitration panel against elektrim.pennecom contends that merrill lynch actively assisted elektrim breach and in the presentation of fraudulent evidence to the arbitration panel,which minimized the loss award.merrill lynch moved to dismiss,claiming collateral estoppel.the court granted the motion and dismissed the suit.
we believe the dismissal was premature.if pennecom can prove its allegations against merrill lynch,collateral estoppel may be inapplicable.we therefore vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for discovery and further proceedings.
background 
on april,pennecom entered into the share purchase agreement with elektrim,under which elektrim agreed to purchase,for approximately million,the shares of pennecom subsidiary pilicka,a polish telephone company.merrill lynch acted as elektrim investment banker for this transaction.
according to pennecom allegations,which must be accepted as true for this appeal because the suit was dismissed without pennecom being given an opportunity to prove them,elektrim was conducting negotiations with deutsche telekom for a joint venture in polish telecommunications,which provided substantial motivation for elektrim purchase of pilicka.after elektrim entered into the spa with pennecom,however,its negotiations with deutsche telekom broke down,making the pilicka acquisition substantially less attractive to elektrim.prior to closing on elektrim purchase of the pilicka shares,representatives of elektrim met with merrill lynch.elektrim told pittman,an attorney and investment banker employed by merrill lynch,that it did not wish to go through with the deal.
in the course of the final due diligence,merrill lynch and elektrim allegedly devised false pretextual justifications for elektrim refusal to close.elektrim did not attend the scheduled closing or complete the transaction.
in accordance with the spa,pennecom commenced arbitration proceedings against elektrim in london before the international chamber of commerce icc,seeking i specific performance or,in the alternative,million in damages,plus ii punitive damages.pennecom contends that pittman and merrill lynch presented fraudulent evidence on elektrim behalf during the arbitration.the arbitration panel found elektrim liable for breach of contract under new york law and awarded approximately million in fees and compensatory damages.the arbitration panel declined to award any further relief.pennecom obtained judicial recognition of the award in an attachment proceeding in poland and collected the full amount of the award.
later,after acquiring some information about merrill lynch role in elektrim breach and in the arbitration,pennecom brought this suit against merrill lynch,alleging that merrill lynch actively assisted elektrim breach,and seeking damages of approximately million.in its papers submitted to the district court,pennecom contended that merrill lynch,in its evidence presented to the arbitration panel,falsely minimized the loss caused to pennecom by elektrim breach.
merrill lynch moved to dismiss the action under federal rule of civil procedure b on the ground that pennecom had recovered the full amount to which it was entitled in the arbitration proceedings and was barred from claiming any further entitlements by principles of collateral estoppel.without allowing pennecom to take discovery,the district court granted the motion,believing that our ruling in norris grosvenor marketing,cir,compelled dismissal.pennecom merrill lynch,civ,wl,at,dist.lexis,at july.the district court denied pennecom subsequent motion to alter or amend the judgment of dismissal,assertedly brought pursuant to rule e of the federal rules of civil procedure,as untimely and meritless.
pennecom appeals from these judgments.
discussion 
while the parties disagree on many questions,they are in agreement that new york law of collateral estoppel governs.the new york law of collateral estoppel employs a test a party is estopped from relitigating an issue when that issue was necessary to the resolution of the prior action,and the party against whom estoppel is invoked had a full and fair opportunity to contest that issue in the previous litigation.schwartz pub.adm r.see also ryan new york,gilberg barbieri.
in ruling that pennecom is barred from pursuing its case against merrill lynch by the doctrine of collateral estoppel,the district court relied on our ruling in norris grosvenor.we believe there are significant differences between this case and norris,which,at least at this stage,make the dismissal of pennecom case inappropriate.
in norris,the facts,as recited by the court of appeals,were as follows the plaintiff norris had a contract with cooper to receive a share of cooper revenues from cooper united states distributorship of twinings tea.norris,at.cooper,without norris agreement,arranged with twining to accept early termination of the distributorship in exchange for,inter alia,a payment of million.cooper did not pay norris a share of the million.norris brought an arbitration proceeding against cooper,alleging breach of contract and claiming his share of three different categories of cooper revenues a cooper profits to the extent not previously paid to norris b the million payment cooper had received from twining and c the future revenues cooper would have earned during norris lifetime had cooper not agreed to the early termination.id.at.the arbitrator awarded norris his share of cooper revenues and the million early termination payment.id.the arbitrator,however,denied norris any recovery for norris claimed life interest in the hypothetical future earnings of cooper distributorship.after judicial confirmation of the award,cooper paid it in full.
norris then sued twining in federal court,seeking to establish twining complicity in cooper failure to pay norris a share of the hypothetical future earnings of the claim the arbitrator had denied.the complaint asserted three theories twining knowing participation in cooper breach of fiduciary duty toward norris in failing to make this payment,twining tortious interference with cooper performance of this contractual obligation,and twining wrongful conversion of norris right to a share of cooper future profits.id.norris sought both compensatory and punitive damages.id.at.
each of the three theories asserted against twining was premised on the proposition that norris had a right to participate in cooper hypothetical future profits.if cooper had no obligation to make any payments to norris on account of the hypothetical future profits foregone by cooper,then twining could not be liable for having participated in cooper breach of that obligation.because the arbitrator had denied norris claim that cooper owed a further share attributable to future profits,the district court dismissed norris suit on grounds of collateral estoppel,and we affirmed.we explained,all of norris claims against twining raise but a single issue norris right to participate in the continued profits of cooper distributorship.that issue has already been decided at the arbitration proceeding.t he arbitrator heard norris s life interest claim and rejected it.id.
in the present case,the district court concluded that norris precluded pennecom maintenance o
