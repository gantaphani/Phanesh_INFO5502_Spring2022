plaintiffs kelsey grammer and grammnet,collectively,grammer,and william morris agency,appeal a district court order confirming a screen actors guild sag labor arbitration award,totaling over million in unpaid commissions.grammer argues that the arbitrators made factual findings unsupported by the record and that they exceeded their jurisdiction.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm the district court.
factual background 
the artists agency artists agency began representing grammer in the,representation that included both grammer television and motion picture projects.grammer became increasingly dissatisfied with artists agency in the early,as its representation had secured no motion picture projects for him and grammer two most significant television projects cheers and frasier were not obtained through artists agency.
grammer sought modification of his artists agency contract so that he could seek alternative representation for potential theatrical motion picture projects.after some negotiation,grammer and artists agency agreed in january that,in exchange for grammer extending for two years his television and commercial obligations to artists agency the renewal contracts,artists agency would substantially release grammer from his theatrical motion picture obligations the settlement agreement collectively,the agreements.the settlement agreement was executed on january.the renewal contracts were executed on january,were to commence on may,and expired may.
artists agency filed the renewal contracts with sag in may,but they were originally rejected.counsel for artists agency contacted joan meyer meyer,sag executive administrator,explained the arrangement forged between grammer and artists agency,and forwarded to her the settlement agreement as evidence of that arrangement satisfied that the renewal contracts were in the best interests of grammer,and that both sides had been competently represented by counsel,meyer accepted the renewal contracts for filing with sag.
in august,grammer terminated his relationship altogether with artists agency and,in august,grammer stopped paying commissions to artists agency.grammer denied any obligations to artists agency,arguing that the agreements violated rule g of the collective bargaining agreement cba among sag,the association of talent agents ata,and the national association of talent representatives grammer alleged that the agreements were so that the execution date and the commencement date did not correspond,in violation of rule g iv c a effectively spanned longer than three years as a result of this,in violation of rule g iv c a were executed prior to the last third of the term of the previous contract between grammer and artists agency,in violation of rule g iv d and were filed more than days after their execution,in violation of rule g iv c.any one of these violations arguably voids the renewal contracts when artists agency filed a statement of claim with sag,seeking payment of the commissions allegedly due,grammer counterclaimed,alleging that artists agency owed him commissions already paid pursuant to those purportedly void contracts.
a arbitration panel held hearings over the course of days,at which witnesses were examined and,and documentary evidence was introduced the panel determined that the agreements were valid,that artists agency had enforceable rights pursuant to those agreements,that those rights entitled artists agency to more than million in back commissions,and that grammer counterclaim was without merit.specifically,the panel found that,while i t is not disputed that the settlement agreement effected a transaction that was at variance from rule g,meyer had de facto granted a waiver of that variance after reviewing the settlement agreement,determining that grammer interests were both furthered and protected by legal counsel,and accepting the renewal contracts and settlement agreement for filing with sag.
grammer then filed this action for a declaration vacating the labor arbitration award.grammer alleged that the arbitration panel did not apply the plain language of rule g,which would have rendered the agreements void and unenforceable there was no evidence in the record to support a finding that sag had granted artists agency a waiver for its rule g violations even if the agreements were valid,their execution in january voided the agency agreement between grammer and artists agency,meaning that grammer owed artists agency no commissions for income derived between january and november and the arbitration panel lacked jurisdiction to award artists agency a commission on consulting fees paid to grammer while working on the television show frasier.the district court rejected these arguments,confirmed the arbitration award,and denied grammer counterclaim.

iii.discussion 
all parties agree that the agreements violate the terms of rule g.we must decide whether the arbitration panel erred in concluding that the agreements were nevertheless enforceable.we hold that the arbitration panel decision to enforce the agreements was a reasonable interpretation of the cba we therefore affirm the district court.
waiver of rule g violations 
at the very least,it is clear that the agreements were executed and set to commence on different dates,in violation of rule g iv c a executed prior to the last third of the term on the previous contract between grammer and artists agency,in violation of rule g iv d and filed more than days after their execution,in violation of rule g iv c in light of these rule g violations,the arbitration panel observed that i t is not disputed that the settlement agreement effected a transaction that was at variance from rule g,and the district court found that the parties do not dispute that the various agreements at issue in the arbitration deviated from the standard regulations set forth in rule g.
these rule g violations,however,do not necessarily void the agreements.grammer correctly observes that neither he nor artists agency ever requested a formal,written waiver from sag.citing rule g iv j grammer argues that the absence of such a formal,written waiver renders the arbitration panel determination patently inconsistent with the plain language of rule g,and it therefore should be vacated.however,although rule g instructs that such violations void applicable contracts and that waivers of violations must be issued by sag in writing,these ostensibly plain provisions must be
