introduction 
plaintiffs amanda mitri and eric eppel plaintiffs sued their former employer,arnel management company arnel,arnel owner,george argyros,and arnel supervisors steve mensinger,ole olson,and leslie holis collectively defendants for,inter alia,sexual discrimination and harassment defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration of plaintiffs claims on the ground plaintiffs had each signed a binding arbitration agreement.the trial court denied the motion based on defendants failure to prove the existence of any such agreement to arbitrate.defendants contend the trial court erred by denying their motion.
we affirm.arnel employee handbook states,a s a condition of employment,all employees are required to sign an arbitration agreement and further states,e mployees will be provided a copy of their signed arbitration agreement.defendants have not produced evidence of signed arbitration agreements.defendants nevertheless contend the handbook reference to arbitration is sufficient to force plaintiffs to arbitrate their claims.as discussed in detail post,defendants argument is wholly without factual or legal merit.
background 
plaintiffs filed a complaint against defendants containing claims for sexual discrimination and harassment,failure to prevent sexual discrimination and harassment,retaliation for opposing sexual discrimination and harassment,invasion of privacy,and defamation.defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration and stay the proceedings on the grounds each plaintiff had entered into a written arbitration agreement with arnel,which required binding arbitration of any controversy or dispute arising from,or in any way relating to an offer of employment or the position,work,payment or relationship,or the termination of such employment and the claims in the complaint arise from or are related to plaintiffs employment.
in support of the motion,defendants submitted the declaration of arnel director of claims administration,fola linebarger,in which she stated,i t is arnel business practice to require all employees to sign an arbitration agreement prior to or upon commencement of employment with arnel and to maintain a signed copy of such agreement in each employee personnel file.i have custody of the personnel files for both amanda mitri and eric eppel,and arnel maintains these files in the ordinary course of business.attached hereto as exhibits a and b are true and accurate copies of the arbitration agreements that are maintained in mitri and eppel personnel file.
exhibit a consists of two documents.first,it contains what appears based on the footer at the bottom of each page to be a copy of pages and of the arnel employee handbook,as revised on september.pages and contain a section entitled arbitration agreement which states any dispute arising out of employment with the company,as allowed by law,will be settled by binding arbitration.as a condition of employment,all employees are required to sign an arbitration agreement.to ensure the expeditious and economical resolution to any controversy or dispute arising from,or in any way relating to an offer of employment or the position,work,payment or relationship,or the termination of such employment,will be on the written request by any party,be submitted to and resolved by binding arbitration.said arbitration will be conducted by the american arbitration association in orange county,california.the company will share equitably such expenses associated with the arbitration process.the prevailing party in the arbitration shall be awarded its attorney fees incurred in the arbitration process and the decision of the arbitrator shall be final,binding and.further,nothing in this policy is intended to prevent either you or the company from obtaining injunctive relief in court to prevent irreparable harm pending the conclusion of any such arbitration.you,as the employee and the company each have the right to resolve any issue or dispute involving company trade secrets,invention rights,and by court action in lieu of arbitration.employees will be provided a copy of their signed arbitration agreement.there is no signed arbitration agreement in the exhibit.
exhibit a also contains a document entitled acknowledgment receipt employee handbook which states this employee handbook is designed to acquaint new employees,and reacquaint existing employees,with human resource policies,operational issues,employee services,and benefits that reflect the desire to provide a professional work environment.the handbook is an excellent resource for employees with questions about the company.employees are encouraged to carefully review the employee handbook and become familiar with the contents and periodic updates.the company reserves the right to change or revise policies,procedures,and benefits described in this handbook,other than the employment provisions,without notice,at such times that the company determines this action is warranted.my signature acknowledges that i have read and understood the statements above as well as the contents of the handbook,and will direct any questions to my supervisor or the director of human resources.the acknowledgment receipt form in exhibit a was signed by mitri and dated october.
exhibit b to linebarger declaration contains identical documents to those in exhibit a,but the acknowledgment receipt form in exhibit b was signed by eppel and dated october.as with exhibit a,there is no signed arbitration agreement in exhibit defendants requested that the trial court take judicial notice of the rules of the american arbitration association.defendants did not submit any other evidence showing the existence of a mandatory arbitration agreement.
in opposition,plaintiffs each filed a declaration,in which they denied entering into an arbitration agreement with arnel or ever being asked to do so.both admitted signing a receipt for the arnel management company policy handbook,but each stated,i was not asked to read,nor was i given time to read,the arnel management company policy handbook and i did not know its contents.
the trial court issued the following tentative ruling before argument on defendants motion the court is inclined to deny this motion.the acknowledgment and receipt does not specifically cite the arbitration provision.further,the handbook is not part of the contract of employment,because the policies in the handbook,including the arbitration provision,can be changed or revised without notice whenever the company determines it is warranted.the employee does not have reciprocal rights to amend the handbook.still further,the acknowledgment states that the employee has read and understood the statements in the acknowledgment,which encourage the employee to carefully review and become familiar with the employee handbook.this implies that the review will take place after the receipt is signed.that can hardly be the basis for a binding election to arbitrate.the court recognizes that the acknowledgment also says that the employee has read and understood the statements above as well as the contents of the handbook.the court finds this to be ambiguous under the circumstances.even if this is a promise that the employee read the handbook before signing which is unclear,the declarations of the plaintiffs indicate that,in fact,they did not read the handbook before signing.further,even if they had read the handbook,the handbook did not constitute an agreed term of the contract of employment.
following argument on the motion,the trial court tentative ruling became the final order of the court.defendants timely appealed.
discussion 
the trial court order denying defendants motion to compel arbitration is appealable pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision a metalclad ventana environmental organizational partnership th,d.
w hen a petition to compel arbitration is filed and accompanied by prima facie evidence of a written agreement to arbitrate the controversy,the court itself must determine whether the agreement exists and,if any defense to its enforcement is raised,whether it is enforceable.because the existence of the agreement is a statutory prerequisite to granting the
