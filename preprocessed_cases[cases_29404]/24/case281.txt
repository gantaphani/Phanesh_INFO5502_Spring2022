opinion of the court 
alleging that td ameritrade had fired him for reporting securities violations to his supervisor,boris khazin filed suit for whistleblower retaliation pursuant to the dodd frank act.although khazin had signed an arbitration agreement with td ameritrade,he argued that it had been nullified by another provision in dodd frank that prohibits the enforcement of predispute arbitration agreements in certain whistleblower disputes.the district court disagreed,compelled arbitration,and dismissed the complaint.khazin appeal raises issues of first impression in this circuit surrounding the proper interpretation of dodd frank restrictions on predispute arbitration agreements.ultimately,though,khazin whistleblower claim is subject to arbitration for the simple reason that it is covered by none of these restrictions.
background of the case 
factual allegations 
appellant boris khazin is a financial services professional and former employee of appellees td ameritrade,and amerivest investment management company collectively with other appellees,td.when khazin began working for td,the parties executed an employment agreement in which they agreed to arbitrate all disputes arising out of khazin employment.
at td,khazin was responsible for performing due diligence on financial products offered to td customers.when he eventually discovered that one of td products was priced in a manner that did not comply with the relevant securities regulations,he reported this violation to his supervisor,lule demmissie,and recommended changing the price to remedy the violation.
in response,demmissie instructed khazin to conduct an analysis of the revenue impact of his proposed change.the analysis revealed that although remedying the violation would save customers,it would cost td in revenues and negatively impact the balance sheet of one of demmissie divisions.after reviewing these results,demmissie allegedly told khazin not to correct the problem and to stop sending her emails on the subject.when khazin subsequently approached her to renew his initial recommendation,she again informed him that no change would be made.
over the next few months,demmissie and td human resources department confronted khazin about a purported billing irregularity that,according to him,was unrelated to his duties and turned out to be nonexistent.nevertheless,khazin was told that he could no longer be trusted,and his employment was terminated.
procedural history 
khazin filed an amended complaint in the superior court of new jersey,asserting claims and a violation of the dodd frank act.all of khazin claims were premised on the allegation that he had been terminated in retaliation for whistleblowing.the state court held that federal courts had exclusive jurisdiction over the dodd frank claim,dismissed that claim without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction,and compelled arbitration of the claims.
khazin reasserted his dodd frank claim in a complaint filed in the district of new jersey.after one round of motion practice and amendments,td filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint and to compel arbitration pursuant to khazin employment agreement.in response,khazin contended that a provision of the dodd frank act,which we will call the anti arbitration provision,and its associated regulations prevented td from compelling the arbitration of his whistleblower retaliation claim.the anti arbitration provision states that n o predispute arbitration agreement shall be valid or enforceable,if the agreement requires arbitration of a dispute arising under this section.e.according to td,however,the anti arbitration provision did not forbid the arbitration of the particular type of retaliation claim that khazin had brought against it.even if it did cover such claims,td continued,the provision did not apply retroactively to bar the enforcement of arbitration agreements executed before the passage of the act,such as the agreement between khazin and td.
the district court granted td motion on the ground that the anti arbitration provision did not prohibit the enforcement of arbitration agreements that were executed before dodd frank was passed.specifically,the district court applied the analysis articulated in landgraf usi film products,and concluded that nullifying existing contractual rights to arbitration would violate the presumption against retroactivity.it did not pass upon the question of whether the anti arbitration provision covered the specific retaliation claim advanced by khazin.khazin then filed the instant appeal 
ii.discussion 
on appeal,khazin primary contention is that the district court erred in finding that his arbitration agreement was enforceable notwithstanding the anti arbitration provision and the general spirit of the dodd frank act.this argument fails neither the anti arbitration provision nor any other provision of dodd frank prohibits the arbitration of the sort of claim that khazin chose to bring against td.the district court acknowledged that td had made this argument but did not address it further.it is,however,an accepted tenet of appellate jurisdiction that we may affirm a judgment on any ground apparent from the record,even if the district court did not reach it.oss nokalva,european space agency,cir quoting kabakjian united states,cir.
statutory framework 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act spans thousands of pages and amends a number of statutes designed to regulate the financial industry,stat.of principal importance to this appeal are dodd frank amendments to the securities exchange act of,which establish a corporate whistleblowing reward program,accompanied by a new provision prohibiting any employer from retaliating against a whistleblower for providing information to the securities and exchange commission sec,participating in an sec proceeding,or making disclosures required or protected under the sarbanes oxley act of and certain other securities laws.lawson fmr llc,d citing a,b,h.the prohibition on retaliation includes a private right of action for aggrieved whistleblowers.see h b i.as khazin asserts in his complaint and reaffirmed at oral argument,this is the cause of action he asserts against td.for the sake of brevity,we will refer to it as the dodd frank cause of action.
before dodd frank was enacted,whistleblowers who suffered retaliation for reporting violations of the securities laws were not without recourse.the sarbanes oxley act of established a private right of action for whistleblowers as well.see,stat,codified at.the sarbanes oxley and dodd frank causes of action for whistleblowers are,however,substantively different,and each has its own prohibited conduct,statute of limitations,and remedies.ahmad morgan stanley,d,see also lawson.at.notably,a whistleblower seeking to assert a sarbanes oxley claim must first file an administrative complaint with the secretary of labor through the occupational safety and health administration osha.see b a c.the dodd frank cause of action,by contrast,has no exhaustion requirement.see h b.moreover,while a sarbanes oxley whistleblower may obtain back pay,with interest,a dodd frank whistleblower is entitled to times the amount of back pay otherwise owed to the individual,with interest.compare c b,with h c ii.
the dodd frank act did not merely create a new cause of action for whistleblowers it also appended the anti arbitration provision to the sarbanes oxley cause of action.see dodd frank act,stat.at.as a result,the relevant section of the united states code now provides that n o predispute arbitration agreement shall be valid or enforceable,if the agreement requires arbitration of a dispute arising under th at section.e in addition to adding the anti arbitration provision to the sarbanes oxley cause of action,dodd frank also inserted an provision with identical language into the whistleblower protections of the commodity exchange act.see,stat.at codified at n.a similar provision appears in the portion of dodd frank that pertains to the consumer financial protection bureau,which is entitled the consumer financial protection act of.see,stat.at,n o predispute arbitration agreement sha
