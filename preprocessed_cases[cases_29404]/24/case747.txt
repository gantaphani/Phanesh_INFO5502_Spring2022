for many years george watts son sold tiffany products in wisconsin.after receiving a notice ending that arrangement,watts filed suit,asserting that tiffany had violated both the contract between the parties and the wisconsin fair dealership law.stat.ch.before the case could be decided,watts and tiffany decided that they preferred arbitration to litigation.the parties received the principal benefit of that bargain swift and inexpensive decision.but watts decided in retrospect that its decision to arbitrate had been unwise,and it asked the district court to provide more relief than the arbitrator had afforded.
the arbitrator award extended the time during which watts could resell tiffany merchandise through watts bridal registry but permitted tiffany to cease selling to watts at the end of it also required tiffany to repurchase at retail price all other tiffany merchandise remaining in watts inventory.the arbitrator did not order tiffany to pay watts attorneys fees and costs.in this respect,according to watts,the arbitrator departed from state law,requiring the court to repair the problem.an error of law is not a ground listed in and for vacating or modifying an award,but in dictum the supreme court has suggested that an arbitrator manifest disregard of legal rules justifies judicial intervention.wilko swan,overruled on other grounds by rodriguez de quijas express,d.often manifest disregard of the law would be covered by a,which authorizes vacatur where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.if the parties specify that their dispute is to be resolved under wisconsin law,then an arbitrator declaration that he prefers new york law,or no law at all,would violate the terms on which the dispute was given to him for resolution,and thus justify relief under a.but watts does not contend that the arbitrator violated the arbitration agreement in such a fashion.this poses for us the question whether there is a broader,principle authorizing courts to review arbitrators legal rulings,or the legal assumptions that influence their decisions even if not identified as conclusions of law.
what could it mean to say that an arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law that the arbitrator made a legal error this is watts wisconsin law entitles the prevailing party to attorneys fees in every case under the wfdl,that it prevailed in the arbitration by obtaining an extension of its dealership plus exceptionally favorable terms for the repurchase of inventory,and that the law therefore required the arbitrator to award legal fees too.if manifest disregard means only a legal error,however,then arbitration can not be final.every arbitration could be followed by a suit,seeking review of legal errors,serving the same function as an appeal within a unitary judicial system.that would prevent the parties from achieving the principal objectives of arbitration swift,inexpensive,and conclusive resolution of disputes.if manifest disregard means not just any legal error but rather a clear error one about which there is,in watts language,no reasonable debate,again arbitration could not be final,and the litigation would be even more complex than a search for simple how blatant a legal mistake must be to count as clear or manifest error lacks any straightforward answer.cooter gell hartmarx,d.in this case,for example,the parties dispute whether an award of fees under the wfdl is mandatory or only permissive perhaps with a presumption in favor of an award they dispute even whether the arbitrator award was based on the wfdl as opposed to the contract.running these matters to ground could be complex.fortunately,we need not do so and we therefore express no opinion on them.
a search for either simple or clear legal error can not be proper.courts often say,with respect to arbitrators role in interpreting contracts,that error is not a ground of judicial review.t he question for decision by a federal court asked to set aside an arbitration award is not whether the arbitrator or arbitrators erred in interpreting the contract it is not whether they clearly erred in interpreting the contract it is not whether they grossly erred in interpreting the contract it is whether they interpreted the contract.hill norfolk western,cir see,united steelworkers enterprise wheel car,d.yet in litigation the meaning of a contract is treated as an issue of law,when the text is clear and extrinsic evidence is either unavailable or precluded by the parol evidence rule.if manifest legal errors justified upsetting an arbitrator decision,then the relation between judges and arbitrators established by the steelworkers trilogy and reiterated by many later opinions would break down.
our cases trying to apply the wilko dictum demonstrate some of the difficulties.at least two decisions say that an award may be vacated when an arbitrator disregards the law in the sense of treating it as an obstacle to reaching a result preferred on other grounds.see national wrecking teamsters,local,cir health services management hughes,cir.but other panels of this court have held the opposite,that arbitrators need not cite or apply rules of law outside the parties agreement.baravati josephthal,lyon ross,flender,cir chameleon dental products,jackson,cir.these conflicting lines of precedent do not cite each other,except for baravati,which concluded that the statutory list of reasons for setting aside an award is exclusive,that wilko has after all been overruled,and that as a result manifest disregard of the law is not an independent reason to set aside an award.at.but the next year first options of chicago,kaplan,d,repeated the wilko dictum,and in another panel of this court stated in dictum without citing baravati that the statutory list is not exclusive and that manifest disregard of the law is one ground for setting aside an award.koveleskie sbc capital markets,cir.the law in other circuits is similarly confused,doubtless because the supreme court has been opaque.the dictum in wilko and first options was unexplained and unilluminated by any concrete application.dictum in gilmer lane,d,is similarly unhelpful.
there is,however,a way to understand manifest disregard of the law that preserves the established relation between court and arbitrator and resolves the tension in the competing lines of cases.it is this an arbitrator may not direct the parties to violate the law.in the main,an arbitrator acts as the parties agent and as their delegate may do anything the parties may do directly.see eastern associated coal united mine workers,d we must treat the arbitrator award as if it represented an agreement between the parties themselves.eastern associated coal may at last clear up the confusion,having dealt with a related line of cases in which courts wrestled with the question whether violation of public policy a form of disregard of legal constraints justifies setting aside an award.the court concluded that the judiciary may step in when the arbitrator has commanded the parties to violate legal norms principally,but not exclusively,those in positive law but that judges may not deprive arbitrators of authority to reach compromise outcomes that legal norms leave within the discretion of the parties to the arbitration agreement.
suppose watts and tiffany had sat down to resolve their differences and had agreed on an extension through the end of,a repurchase of remaining items at retail price,and each side bearing its own fees and costs.could there be any legal objection surely not it is a kind of settlement businesses reach all the time,each receiving part of what it wanted.evans jeff,d parties may reach a settlement foregoing attorneys fees under.if watts and tiffany may resolve their differences without fees changing hands,why ca an arbitrator,as their agent,prescribe the same outcome in eastern associated coal an employer contended that an arbitrator exceeded his powers by ordering the reinstatement of a truck driver who had twice tested positive for marijuana.the supreme court held that reinstatement was within the arbitrato
