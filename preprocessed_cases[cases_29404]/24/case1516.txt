plaintiff shellie cummings filed this action for damages from an allegedly wrongful dismissal from her employment with defendant future nissan.the defendant answered and successfully moved to compel arbitration pursuant to a procedure contained in her employment contract.although the initial arbitration award was in the plaintiff favor,upon a review the appellate arbitrator reversed the initial award and found in favor of the defendant.the trial court issued an order granting the defendant motion to confirm the award and denying the plaintiff motion to vacate it.
in a premature appeal from the order,the plaintiff raises various meritless arguments against the enforceability of the arbitration clause in general and its provision for a second level of review in particular.as she was aware of these grounds at the time the defendants moved to compel arbitration but failed to raise them,we hold that she has forfeited plenary consideration of them.we also hold that her complaints about the manner in which the arbitration proceeded are meritless she is responsible for any delays the employer bore all the costs the creation of a settled record of the initial arbitration proceeding with the assistance of the initial arbitrator is contractually authorized and is not unconscionable and,most importantly,the contract permissibly invested the second arbitrator with a broader standard of review than a court could apply to the initial award.as the plaintiff does not otherwise have any meritorious basis for opposing the confirmation of the award,we shall affirm.
background 
the complaint alleged that the plaintiff had worked in the defendant finance department for about months,where she was the object of sexual harassment,and also of retaliation for her complaints about the harassment.she further alleged that the defendant dismissed her in retaliation for reporting the illicit financing activities of a coworker.
the defendant and don rybolt a codefendant not a party to this appeal because the initial arbitration award did not assess any damages against him answered,then moved about two months later to compel arbitration pursuant to the plaintiff employment agreement.the plaintiff resisted on the grounds that the defendant had waived arbitration and the absence of any consideration for the arbitration agreement which was not executed until after her hire.the trial court granted the motion,rejecting both of the plaintiff arguments 
in march,an arbitrator raul ramirez issued an award against the defendant of for a dismissal in violation of public policy.he found that the defendant had failed to rebut a prima facie case of retaliation for the plaintiff report about a coworker practice of fraudulently overstating vehicle values in loan applications to ensure approval for his customers the arbitrator found against the plaintiff on her other claims.
the defendant moved the arbitrator for a modification of the award on the ground that he refused to admit evidence rebutting the prima facie case.at the same time,it filed in the trial court a copy of its request for a review of the award pursuant to the contractual arbitration procedure,with the advisement that it might need the court to appoint a arbitrator if it could not reach agreement with the plaintiff 
while the modification motion was pending before arbitrator ramirez,the plaintiff petitioned the trial court to confirm the initial arbitration award.she asserted that the provision for a second level of arbitral review was unconscionable noting the issue was then pending in the supreme court involving the same contractual language and thus unenforceable,for which reason the court should strike it.the plaintiff also sought sanctions for the defendant attempt to invoke the contractual review procedure.
the trial court denied the petition to confirm as premature,finding nothing in the review to be unconscionable under armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,armendariz,as long as the defendant bore the costs of the review and it was completed within a reasonable time,because it was equally applicable to both parties and did not otherwise derogate the purpose of contractual arbitration.the order also noted the failure of the plaintiff to have raised the issue in her initial opposition to arbitration although the trial court stated at the hearing that it was not finding a formal waiver on the plaintiff part but was curious why she had not raised the issue earlier.
arbitrator ramirez subsequently denied the modification motion.he found that he lacked jurisdiction to correct any error he might have made in excluding evidence.
the parties soon afterward stipulated to the appointment of george paras as the second arbitrator.the plaintiff argued that the record should be limited to the initial award and exhibits,and that the standard of review should be the same as for a court on a motion to confirm an arbitration award,moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,moncharsh thus,she was entitled to sanctions for a frivolous appeal.arbitrator paras,however,issued an order directing the parties to work with arbitrator ramirez in developing a settled statement.the plaintiff filed objections with arbitrator paras and lodged objections with the trial court.arbitrator paras issued a second order reiterating the propriety of preparing a settled statement with the aid of arbitrator ramirez.the plaintiff then filed a motion to dismiss the appeal,which arbitrator paras denied in a third order.
at this point,the plaintiff moved in the trial court for reconsideration of the may order denying the motion to confirm the initial award,and for sanctions.she asserted that the scope of review proposed for the second level rendered the proceedings unconscionable.some pages of filings later,the trial court denied the motion on july,as untimely and lacking any new facts warranting reconsideration.
the parties crafted a settled statement with the assistance of arbitrator ramirez,which arbitrator paras reviewed in december and january.after the parties submitted their briefing to arbitrator paras and the plaintiff moved yet again for sanctions for a frivolous appeal,the superior court issued an order to show cause sua sponte to consider the effect of little decided the previous day on a provision for appellate arbitral review.after considering the briefing of the parties who did not request a hearing,the court concluded little made a general comment that appellate review is in some respects more favorable to employers see id.at,d,but its holding is limited to the particular arbitral appeal provision before it permitt ing appeal only of awards exceeding,a provision which would rarely,if ever,benefit an employee,since an employee could not appeal a defense verdict.as the present provision for arbitration did not contain any threshold,the trial court concluded it was not unconscionably as the one in little.it thus confirmed its previous ruling.
after entertaining the parties oral arguments,arbitrator paras issued his award in may.he reversed the award for the plaintiff on the legal ground that the public policy she identified was not an issue of general public importance foley interactive data cal d,green ralee engineering cal th,d,such that she was entitled to damages for a wrongful dismissal in retaliation for her efforts to report a violation.
the defendant moved to confirm the award.the plaintiff moved to vacate the award,once again requesting sanctions.the court granted the motion to confirm and denied the motion to vacate in a formal order filed in august.it again rejected the plaintiff claim that a review was in any fashion unconscionable,it found that the review proceeded in accordance with the contemplation of the arbitration agreement,and it rejected the plaintiff attempt to review the merits of the legal conclusion that a public policy of general importance was not involved in her dismissal.the plaintiff purported to appeal from the order without obtaining a judgment on it as well as the earlier rulings of the trial court over the previous two years.
