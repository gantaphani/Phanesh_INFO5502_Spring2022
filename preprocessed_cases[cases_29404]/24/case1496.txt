as an encouragement to the open communication essential to successful settlement discussions,the evidence code,and in particular evidence code section makes inadmissible any statements,writings,or other communications made in connection with mediation.we consider here whether this broad mediation confidentiality statute may be used by a settling party as a shield to prevent the admission of a purported settlement document signed at the conclusion of mediation in subsequent proceedings to enforce the settlement.
plaintiff darren stewart sued as a result of personal injuries he sustained when his vehicle collided with a backhoe that fell off a truck owned by defendant preston pipeline and driven by defendant george solinger collectively,defendants.the dispute proceeded to mediation.at the conclusion of the mediation,a by plaintiff,plaintiff attorney,and defendants to memorialize a settlement and recited that the parties intended the settlement to be enforceable and exempt from certain confidentiality provisions of the evidence code.plaintiff thereafter refused to accept the settlement check.defendants brought alternative motions to enforce the settlement and for summary judgment under code of civil procedure sections and,respectively.the court granted the latter motion and entered judgment in defendants favor.
on appeal,plaintiff contends that the settlement agreement that was the basis for the court summary judgment order was both inadmissible under section and unenforceable because it was not signed by all of the parties litigant.he cites levy superior court cal th,d,levy,which held that a written settlement agreement not signed by all settling litigants could not be enforced under the summary procedure specified in code of civil procedure section.plaintiff also argues that,assuming the agreement was admissible and enforceable,he was entitled to a trial on whether there was mutual consent,or assuming there was mutual consent whether he could rescind the agreement.
we hold that the settlement agreement was admissible under section a statutory exception to mediation confidentiality and was not rendered unenforceable as a result of its not having been signed personally by each of the parties.we conclude further that there was no triable issue of material fact that the parties settled the dispute.because the trial court properly granted summary judgment,we will affirm.
procedural history and relevant facts 
on december,plaintiff filed a complaint against defendants for damages arising out of an accident occurring on september.defendants answered by filing a general denial.the parties participated in a mediation proceeding on june.the mediation was attended by plaintiff,dennis plaintiff then attorney,thomas lemmon defendants attorney,and helen kong a claims adjuster with zurich american insurance company,defendants insurer.
at the conclusion of the mediation,a document captioned confirmation of settlement as a result of mediation settlement agreement or agreement was signed by plaintiff,his attorney,and defendants attorney lemmon.the agreement provided that t he plaintiff s and the defendant s herein agree that they have reached a full and final settlement of all claims.the concluding paragraph read the parties intend that this settlement is enforceable pursuant to the provisions of code of civil procedure section the parties agree that this confirmation of settlement is exempt from the confidentiality provisions of evidence code section,et.
thereafter,lemmon forwarded to the settlement check,along with a proposed written agreement of settlement.plaintiff refused to accept the settlement check tendered by defendants,asserting by letter through new counsel,scott seabaugh that t here is no settlement of this matter.the next day,seabaugh again wrote to lemmon,stating that he did not believe that there was an agreement,enforceable or not,reached at the mediation.in any event,stewart elects to rescind any settlement agreement defendants alleged to have existed.
defendants moved to amend their answer to allege additional affirmative defenses that the parties had agreed to settle the dispute.over plaintiff opposition and request for sanctions,the court granted the motion to amend.plaintiff then moved to strike the portion of the amended answer that concerned the alleged settlement the court denied that motion.defendants moved to confirm the settlement under code of civil procedure section in the alternative,defendants moved for summary judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section.plaintiff opposed both motions,contending,inter alia,that the settlement agreement was inadmissible under section and was unenforceable.the court overruled plaintiff evidentiary objection,denied the motion to enforce settlement,and granted the motion for summary judgment.
judgment was entered on december,plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal,and the matter is a proper subject for appellate review.code civ,subd.m see also weil brown,cal.practice guide civil procedure before trial the rutter group.
discussion 
issues on appeal 
plaintiff challenges the three orders from the underlying judgment,namely,the orders granting leave to amend the answer,denying plaintiff motion to strike portions of the answer,and granting summary judgment while he makes several arguments,the thrust of plaintiff appeal is that it was error to grant summary judgment based upon the settlement agreement,because it was a mediation communication,inadmissible under section,and not a binding settlement agreement.alternatively,plaintiff contends that,assuming arguendo the settlement agreement was admissible and a potentially binding settlement document,summary judgment was nonetheless improper.he asserts that there was a triable issue as to whether there was mutual consent assuming mutual consent,there was nonetheless a triable issue as to whether he could rescind the agreement.
after discussing the applicable standard of review,we will address these claims of error.
ii.standard of review 
as we have acknowledged,c onstruction and application of a statute involve questions of law,which require independent review.murphy padilla th,d see also elyaoudayan hoffman th,d construction and application of code civ,primarily questions of law.likewise,since summary judgment motions involve purely questions of law,we review the granting of summary judgment de novo.alexander codemasters group limited th,d de novo review of whether a triable issue of material fact exists and whether the moving party was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law chavez carpenter th,d.
as will be evident from our discussion,post,the primary issues here concern the interpretation and application of sections and with respect to the admissibility of the settlement agreement see pts.iii.and,post,matters for our independent review.and our consideration of whether there were triable issues of material fact that made summary judgment inappropriate see pt,post is similarly governed by a de novo standard of review.
iii.whether settlement agreement was admissible 
plaintiff contends that the mediation confidentiality provisions of section precluded introduction of the settlement agreement as evidence in support of defendants summary judgment motion.he asserts that these confidentiality rights are absolute and that there were no applicable statutory,in particular,that the exception prescribed under section did not apply.we review sections and below and conclude that plaintiff argument as to the inadmissibility of the settlement agreement can not be sustained.
mediation confidentiality under the evidence code 
the mediation provisions of the evidence code,commencing with section,were enacted in.stats,ch.section,subdivision a defines mediation broadly as a process in which a neutral person or persons facilitate communication between the disputants to assist them in reaching a mutually acceptable agreement.see also code civ,subd.a containing same definition of mediation for pilot project for civil mediation in civil actions in los angeles county.the evidence code provisions,including those addressing confidentiality,are applicable to all mediation proceedings,except for settlement conferences under cal.rules of court,rule,family conciliation proceedings,et,and mediation of visitation and custody issues,et,subd.a.
section provides except as otherwise provided in this chapter a no evidence of anything said or any admission made for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation or a mediation consultation is admissible or subject to discovery,and disclosure of the evidence shall not be compelled,in any arbitration,administrative adjudication,civil action,or other noncriminal proceeding in which,pursuant to law,testimony can be compelled to be given.b no writing,as defined in section,that is prepared for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation or a mediation consultation,is admissible or subject to discovery,c all communications,negotiations,or settlement discussions by and between participants in the course of a mediation or a mediation consultation shall remain confidential.in addition,section provides that a mediator reports and findings are confidential and section extends application of mediation confidentiality temporally after the end of mediation proceedings 
the rule of exclusion of mediation communications is tempered by section.that statute provides that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable outside of the mediation arena is not inadmissible or privileged simply because it is used or introduced during mediation in addition,sections through provide for the admissibility of certain mediation communications if particular requirements are met 
s ection serves an important public purpose in promoting the settlement of legal disputes through confidential mediation.rinaker superior court th,d.mediation confidentiality encourages the frank exchange of information in order to encourage settlement.foxgate,supra,cal th at,d,saeta superior court th,d.section is a rule of mediation confidentiality that sweeps broadly.eisendrath superior court,supra,th at,d.and as our high court recently reiterated,there are no exceptions to mediation confidentiality under section et,except those expressed by statute.rojas superior court cal th,d,rojas see also eisendrath superior court,supra,at,d no implied waiver of section mediation confidentiality.
b.the foxgate and rojas decisions 
the supreme court in foxgate and rojas rejected attempts to introduce into evidence mediation communications where confidentiality rights were asserted and not waived.plaintiff contends that these two decisions offer strong support for his view that the settlement agreement here was inadmissible under section 
in foxgate,supra,cal th,d,after mediation proved unsuccessful in complex construction litigation,the plaintiff filed a motion for substantial sanctions against the developer defendants and their counsel under code of civil procedure section,based upon their alleged failure to mediate in good faith.foxgate,supra,at,d.the motion was based in part upon a mediator report that detailed the mediation conduct of developers and their counsel.id.at,d.after the motion was denied without prejudice and renewed id.at,d,the developers opposed the motion.id.at,d.they argued that various materials in the mediator report,and a declaration of the plaintiff counsel containing purported statements of the developers attorney and a recitation of events occurring during inadmissible mediation communications.ibid.the court granted the sanctions motion.ibid.
finding that the language of sections and was clear and unambiguous foxgate,supra,cal th at,d,the high court held that judicial construction of the statutes is not permitted unless they can not be applied according to their terms or doing so would lead to absurd results,thereby violating the presumed intent of the legislature.id.at,d.because the clear legislative intent underlying mediation confidentiality was to promote candor in the informal exchange of information in the mediation proceedings ibid,the court concluded that sections and unqualifiedly bar red disclosure of communications made during mediation absent express statutory exception.foxgate,supra,at,d,fn.omitted.the foxgate court therefore concluded that the plaintiff motion for sanctions violated the mediation confidentiality statutes and,and that the trial court had erred in admitting that evidence.foxgate,supra,at,d,see also travelers casualty surety superior court th,d issuance of valuation order purporting to establish settlement value of claims,thereby precluding insurers from declaring coverage forfeiture if insureds settled without insurers consent,exceeded powers of mediator and violated statutes.
foxgate is distinguishable.there,the high court concluded that permitting evidence of a mediator report and communications made in for the salutary goal of preventing bad faith be antithetical to the purpose of mediation confidentiality,to ensure open communication.in this instance,that objective would not be promoted by applying confidentiality statutes to prevent one settling party from enforcing a settlement agreement signed by the party allegedly reneging on the settlement.
in foxgate,significantly,the parties asserting evidentiary objections to mediation conduct and communications had not waived mediation confidentiality.the high court specifically noted this fact in distinguishing the case before it from olam congress mortg.d a case relied on by the foxgate plaintiff.foxgate,supra,cal th at,d.here,as discussed in part iii,post,the both personally and through his attorney and defendants through their counsel waived mediation confidentiality.
in rojas,supra,cal th,d,the court addressed the scope of section,where the parties to a prior action stipulated that reports and photographs were protected from disclosure by mediation confidentiality.in a subsequent action brought by several hundred tenants alleging damages relating to toxic mold problems,the plaintiffs sought discovery of the mediation materials.ibid.after the trial court sustained objections to the discovery id.at,d,the court of appeal granted mandamus it concluded that section does not protect pure evidence,but protects only the substance of mediation,the negotiations,communications,admissions,and discussions designed to reach a resolution of the dispute at hand.id.at,d.the appellate court applied the work product doctrine to mediation materials and concluded that data,photographs,and statements of witnesses were and not privileged,matter that solely reflected impressions,research and conclusions of counsel were absolutely privileged,and derivative material that is,amalgamation s of factual information and attorney thoughts,impressions,and conclusions,such as charts and diagrams expert reports,appraisals,subject to a qualified privilege,discoverable only upon a showing.id.at,d.
the supreme court reversed,holding that the appellate court decision conflicted with the plain language of sections and defining the term writing broadly.rojas,supra,cal th at,d.the high court concluded that such writings as photographs,videotapes,witness statements,and raw test data to the court of appeal by the provisions of section to the extent that they were prepared for the purpose of,in the course of,or pursuant to,the mediation in the underlying action.id.at,d.the court also held that there was no good cause exception resulting in the qualified admissibility of derivative material prepared in connection with mediation.id.at,d.it reasoned t he legislature clearly knows how to establish a good cause exception to a protection or privilege if it so desires,the discovery of attorney work product under code of civil procedure section.the legislature did not enact such an exception when it passed evidence code section and the other mediation confidentiality provisions.ibid.
rojas is also distinguishable.it involved the question of whether photographs,expert reports,and other materials prepared in connection with mediation were subject to mediation confidentiality under section.unlike the present case,the materials did not include an alleged settlement agreement that one side sought to enforce.and unlike the case before us,the parties in rojas who objected to discovery of the materials had not waived mediation confidentiality.
whether the parties waived mediation confidentiality 
defendants contend that the court below correctly determined that the agreement was admissible under section,an exception to section.section provides a written settlement agreement prepared in the course of,or pursuant to,a mediation,is not made inadmissible,or protected from disclosure,by provisions of this chapter if the agreement is signed by the settling parties and any of the following conditions are satisfied a the agreement provides that it is admissible or subject to disclosure,or words to that effect.b the agreement provides that it is enforceable or binding or words to that effect.c all parties to the agreement expressly agree in writing,or orally in accordance with section,to its disclosure.d the agreement is used to show fraud,duress,or illegality that is relevant to an issue in dispute.
we consider whether the settlement agreement contained appropriate language to waive mediation confidentiality and determine whether the requirement in section that the agreement be signed by the settling parties necessarily restricts execution to the parties themselves as opposed to a more expansive reading that would include the parties or their attorneys.
waiver language in settlement agreement 
on its face,the settlement agreement here met at least two of the alternative requirements of the section exception to mediation confidentiality.the agreement provided that the parties agree that this confirmation of settlement is exempt from the confidentiality provisions of evidence code section,et this language satisfied the requirement that the agreement provide that it is admissible or subject to disclosure,or words to that effect,subd.a.we interpret the plain meaning of the statute language or words to that effect as contemplating that the parties need not precisely state that the agreement is admissible or subject to disclosure so long as the same import can be inferred from the words used.see state deffebaugh,statute defining alibi as evidence to the effect that the accused was at some other place at the time of the crime charged indicated legislative intent not to limit type of evidence that could be introduced for that purpose realty shop,rr westminster holding,statute making enforceable contract language that prohibited oral waivers where contractual provision was to the effect that no waiver of contract would be valid unless it was in writing denoted legislative intent that contractual provision need not contain precise language of statute.for the same reason,the parties reference in the agreement to the confidentiality provisions of evidence code section,et presents no impediment to concluding that the parties intended to make the agreement admissible or subject to disclosure,subd.a.we do not deem the reference to section,et to be words of limitation,such that the agreement should be construed as confidential in one context but nonconfidential in others 
in addition,the settlement agreement stated that it was a full and final settlement of all claims and that t he parties intend that this settlement is enforceable pursuant to the provisions of code of civil procedure s ection.it therefore satisfied the requirement that t he agreement provide that it is enforceable or binding or words to that effect,subd.b see also cal.law revision com,pt.west ann.supp.foll,subd.b was added in due to the likelihood that parties intending to be bound will use words to that effect,to the effect that the agreement is enforceable or binding,rather than saying their agreement is intended to be admissible or subject to disclosure under,subd.a.again,the fact that the parties stated that the agreement was enforceable pursuant to the provisions of code of civil procedure s ection should not be construed as words of limitation it would make little sense that the parties wished their agreement to be enforceable under code of civil procedure section only,but that it would otherwise be unenforceable 
section signed by the parties requirement 
plaintiff chief contention is that because the settlement agreement was not signed by the defendants themselves or by their insurance instead was signed only by defense did not meet the requirements of section that the waiver be signed by the settling parties.plaintiff relies principally on levy,supra,cal th,d,case that was not decided under the mediation support of his position.we conclude that levy does not compel the conclusion that section requires that an effective waiver be signed personally by the litigants.
levy superior court 
in levy,the supreme court considered whether code of civil procedure section requiring that the parties enter into a stipulation for an that the litigants themselves and not simply their attorneys were required to sign the stipulation.levy,supra,cal th at,d.after extended analysis,the court held that,in the context of motions to enforce settlements brought under code of civil procedure section,because a settlement stipulation affects the client substantial rights,in providing for an enforcement mechanism for settlements by parties,the legislature intended the term to literally mean the litigants personally.levy,supra,at,d,see also id.at,d.
levy is distinguishable on at least three grounds.first,the case was decided under code of civil procedure section,not under the mediation statutes.
second,in levy,it was the nonsignatory party litigant who challenged his attorney authority to sign the stipulation as a prerequisite to enforcing the settlement under code of civil procedure section.here,plaintiff did personally sign the settlement agreement as did his attorney he claims that the agreement is unenforceable because defendants and their insurer did not personally sign the agreement.this distinction is of some consequence because neither defendants nor their insurer challenged defense counsel authority to sign the stipulation on their behalf.
third,and perhaps most importantly,levy holding was based upon the fact that the client right affected by his attorney stipulation,settlement of a dispute was substantial.the court acknowledged that t he word parties is reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation levy,supra,cal th at,d,and in many contexts,parties is understood to refer not only to the litigant but also to his or her counsel.id.at,d.in evaluating whether party refers to the litigant or his or her counsel,or,alternatively,is given the more narrow reading of party litigant only,the levy court made a distinction between stipulations that are necessary or incidental to the management of the suit levy,supra,at,d,and those that implicate a substantial right of the litigants themselves.ibid.the court concluded that,since the decision to settle is one affecting the substantial rights of the client,it is one that,in the context of written stipulations signed by the parties enforceable under code of civil procedure section,required the party litigant personal signature.levy,supra,at,d.
confidentiality waiver is procedural 
our analysis of the authorities leads us to conclude that there is no bright line between these two kinds of identified as agreements involving procedural matters versus ones affecting substantial rights.see blanton womancare,cal d,blanton.we believe therefore that further review of the kinds of stipulations that courts have determined to fall on one side or the other is useful to our resolution of this matter.
matters concerning the authority of the attorney to bind the client through stipulation or agreement generally are governed by the principles of agency.blanton,supra,cal d at.therefore,t he attorney is authorized by virtue of his employment to bind the client in procedural matters arising during the course of the action citations.in retaining counsel for the prosecution or defense of a suit,the right to do many acts in respect to the cause is embraced as ancillary,or incidental to the general authority conferred,and among these is included the authority to enter into stipulations and agreements in all matters of procedure during the progress of the trial.stipulations thus made,so far as they are simply necessary or incidental to the management of the suit,and which affect only the procedure or remedy as distinguished from the cause of action itself,and the essential rights of the client,are binding on the client.linsk linsk cal d,fn.omitted linsk.
thus,an attorney may bind his or her client with respect to procedural matters by entering into stipulations or taking other action such as stipulating to the use of a witness testimony in a subsequent action smith whittier cal,making the tactical decision as plaintiff counsel to exonerate a codefendant,because it was the best opportunity to fortify potential recovery from the other defendant diamond springs lime american river constructors d.abandoning a nonmeritorious defense duffy griffith d.refusing to call a witness notwithstanding the client contrary wishes nahhas pacific greyhound lines d.stipulating to a trial judge view of the premises lachman muenzer d,stipulating that a witness,if called,would offer the same testimony as another witness who already testified newman los angeles transit lines d,and stipulating to the prosecution due diligence in attempting to locate a witness and the use of the unavailable witness preliminary examination testimony people hanna d.
by contrast,there are other stipulations or actions taken in a lawsuit that must be viewed as impair ing the client substantial rights or the cause of action itself.linsk,supra,cal d at.in those instances,there is no implicit authority conferred upon counsel simply by virtue of the relationship blanton,supra,cal d at,and the attorney agreement or action is valid only with his or her client express authorization or agreement.linsk,supra,cal d at.
examples of litigation actions affecting the client substantial rights include stipulations to the settlement of a lawsuit levy,supra,cal th at,d,to binding arbitration and the consequent waiver of all but minimal judicial review blanton,supra,cal d at,see also lazarus titmus th,d to the waiver of trial testimony and the submission of the case to a judge based on testimony given before a different judge in prior proceedings ending in a mistrial linsk,supra,cal d at,to the conveyance of the client property to his spouse in a dissolution proceeding woerner woerner cal,to the dismissal of the client complaint whittier union high sch.dist.superior court d.or bowden green d.to the entry of summary judgment against the client roscoe moss roggero d.to the fact that the employer premises constituted an unsafe workplace,thereby disposing of the workers compensation insurer sole interest in the litigation,its lien rights harness pacific curtainwall d.to the entry of a default judgment ross ross d,and to the elimination of a client essential defense fresno city high school dist.dillon d.
we conclude from a review of the foregoing authorities that a stipulation waiving mediation confidentiality is not one that impacts the substantial rights of the party litigant.the circumstances before us bear little resemblance to those presented in levy.such a contrasted with a settlement stipulation as addressed in clearly procedural in nature it is a strategic stipulation allowing for the admissibility of certain evidence.see,hillman stults d.attorney may stipulate to include or limit issues or defenses to be tried people leyva d.stipulation to admit prior conviction of client within scope of attorney authority morgan morgan d,stipulation to admit probation officers reports concerning child within authority of counsel.the waiver is not a decision that involve s a matter of judgment which extend s beyond technical competence so that any client would be expected to share in the making of it.blanton,supra,cal d at.rather,it is a stipulation which is simply necessary or incidental to the management of the suit,and which affect s only the procedure or remedy as distinguished from the cause of action itself,and the essential rights of the client.linsk,supra,cal d at.
to hold otherwise would exalt form over substance and would allow mediation confidentiality to nullify otherwise valid settlements agreed upon through mediation.see regents of university of california sumner th,d no valid purpose would be served here by misinterpreting section to bar introduction of evidence regarding the settlement agreed to by the parties.we must not lose sight of the fact that california has a strong policy encouraging settlements levy,supra,cal th at,d,and that mediation provides a process to assist litigants in reaching a mutually acceptable agreement resolving their dispute.see also doe superior court th,d there is strong policy favoring mediation as an alternative to litigation and it is in the public interest to encourage the use of mediation.were we to adopt plaintiff position,then in an extreme example a settlement agreement signed personally by the parties after mediation would be inadmissible in a subsequent motion or action enforcing that settlement,if the parties counsel as opposed to the parties themselves signed the waiver.we do not believe that the legislature intended to permit the tail mediation confidentiality to wag the dog settlement in such instances.
we therefore hold that the requirement in section that the written settlement agreement be signed by the settling parties does not require that an effective waiver be signed by each of the parties litigant,so long as that written waiver is signed by each of the settling parties or their respective counsel.the trial court thus correctly plaintiff evidentiary the settlement agreement here was admissible because the settling parties had waived mediation confidentiality 
iv.whether the settlement agreement was enforceable 
plaintiff contends that even if the settlement agreement was admissible notwithstanding the mediation confidentiality provisions of section,it was nonetheless unenforceable.he makes an argument similar to that made concerning mediation confidentiality that under levy,supra,cal th,d,the agreement was unenforceable because it was not signed by each of the parties litigant.he argues boldly that e ven the trial court acknowledged this deficiency by its denial of defendants motion to confirm settlement under code of civil procedure section.his position is without merit.
levy does not stand for the proposition that a settlement agreement is unenforceable per se,simply because it is executed by fewer than all of the parties litigant.instead,that case held merely that,in order for an settlement agreement to be enforceable through a code of civil procedure section motion,the agreement necessarily must be signed personally by each of the settling parties.levy,supra,cal th at,d.the high court expressly left open the possibility that the agreement could be enforced under procedures alternative to the expedited procedure of code of civil procedure section,such as by a motion for summary judgment,a separate suit in equity,or an amendment of the pleadings.levy,supra,cal th at,fn,d,see also gauss gaf th,d davidson superior court th,d acknowledging existence of other more cumbersome methods to enforce the settlement.indeed,as the court below recognized,it is indisputable that,although a settlement may not meet the procedural requirements of enforceability under code of civil procedure section,it may nonetheless be enforceable by alternative methods.harris rudin,richman appel th,d murphy padilla,supra,th,d.
the fact that the settlement agreement here was not signed personally by defendants does not render it per se unenforceable.the court below,rather than concluding that the agreement was deficient,as plaintiff claims,properly held that the agreement did not meet the requirements of code of civil procedure section.but it correctly held that the agreement could be considered in connection with defendants alternative motion for summary judgment.
v.the propriety of granting summary judgment 
it remains for us to decide plaintiff last claim of error.he contends that even if the court correctly found that the agreement was admissible and enforceable,it nonetheless erred by granting summary judgment.plaintiff asserts that the following alternative issues of material fact precluded the granting of the motion whether there was mutual consent or even if there was mutual consent,whether plaintiff could rescind the agreement.
defendants amended answer contained affirmative defenses alleging that plaintiff action was barred by the settlement agreement.defendants argued in the summary judgment motion that they had established the right to judgment based upon the agreement alleged in two affirmative defenses as the parties moving for summary judgment,defendants had the burden of showing that a cause of action ha d no merit by demonstrating that there was a complete defense to that cause of action.code civ,subd.p.
a settlement agreement is a contract,and the legal principles that apply to contracts generally apply to settlement contracts.weddington productions,flick,supra,th,d.its validity is thus judged by the same legal principles applicable to contracts generally.timney lin th,d see also nicholson barab d.defendants therefore had the burden of establishing each contractual who are capable of entering into contract,their mutual consent,a lawful object,and sufficient cause or consideration,shaw regents of university of california th,d in support of their motion.
here,the settlement agreement itself demonstrated each element of the contract.it identified the parties,facially evidenced mutual consent,had a lawful object of resolving litigation,and contained mutual promises sufficient consideration further,execution of the agreement by defense counsel was authorized by defendants insurer.see murphy padilla,supra,th at,d enforcement of settlement through means other than code civ,motion may be appropriate if nonsignatory litigant authorized her attorney to bind her to settlement.defendants thus met their initial burden under code of civil procedure section,subdivision p,of establishing that undisputed facts support ed each element of the affirmative defense citations.anderson metalclad insulation th,d.
once defendants met their burden under code of civil procedure section,subdivision p,the burden shift ed to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exist ed as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.the plaintiff could not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exist ed but,instead,was required to set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact existed as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.code civ,subd.p see also green ralee engineering cal th,d.
in opposing defendants alternative motions,plaintiff asserted that he did not read the settlement agreement before signing it,he did not understand what the document meant or what the terms,conditions or consequences were,and only signed the document because his attorney told him to do so.he claimed that there was no mutual consent and there was a triable issue of material fact as to whether he was entitled to rescind the agreement due to unilateral mistake.neither claim has merit.
mutual assent to contract is based upon objective and outward manifestations of the parties a party subjective intent,or subjective consent,therefore is irrelevant.beard goodrich th,d see also weddington productions,flick,supra,th at,d.defendants motion established from the face of the agreement that there was mutual assent.it was signed by both plaintiff and his attorney,and there was no indication from the document that it was conditional or that plaintiff did not intend to be bound by its terms.money store investment southern cal.bank th,d bank objectively manifested assent through its employee execution of acknowledgment and acceptance of escrow conditions marin storage trucking,benco contracting engineering,th,d marin storage party objectively manifested assent by signing work authorization and contract that clearly stated it was contract.plaintiff upon nothing more than his claim that he had not read or understood the agreement before signing no triable issue on the question of mutual assent.marin storage,supra,at,d ordinarily,party who signs an instrument which on its face is a contract is deemed to assent to all its terms skrbina fleming companies th,d summary judgment proper in employment discrimination action where employee signed release,notwithstanding his claim that,despite express language in release to contrary,he never intended to abandon discrimination and harassment claims.
having cited no cases below,plaintiff argued that he was entitled to rescind the settlement agreement.the sole authority plaintiff relied on was civil code section,which provides in relevant part a party to a contract may rescind the contract if the consent of the party rescinding,or of any party jointly contracting with him,was given by mistake,subd.b.a factual mistake by one party to a contract,or unilateral mistake,affords a ground for rescission in some circumstances.donovan rrl cal th,d,fn.omitted donovan.
in donovan,our high court explained that california does not follow the traditional rule recited in the first restatement of contracts,section,to the effect that unilateral mistake did not render a contract voidable unless the other party knew of or caused the mistake.donovan,supra,cal th at,d.instead,the donovan court applied the more expansive rule of section of the restatement second of contracts allowing rescission due to unilateral mistake where enforcement of the contract would be unconscionable.donovan,supra,at,d.in instances in which the other party was unaware of and did not cause the mistake,the party claiming unilateral mistake must show that the mistake was one regarding a basic assumption upon which the party claiming mistake made the contract the mistake has a material effect upon the agreed exchange of performances that is adverse to the party claiming mistake the party claiming mistake does not bear the risk of the mistake and the effect of the mistake is such that enforcement of the contract would be unconscionable.donovan,supra,at,d.as to the third factor,both the restatement second of contracts and civil code section note that the mistaken party neglect of legal duty will bar relief however,ordinary negligence does not constitute such neglect of legal duty that will preclude rescission.donovan,supra,at,d,see also kemper const.city of cal d.
we need look no further than the third donovan factor to conclude that plaintiff raised no triable issue of material fact concerning possible rescission of the settlement agreement it is well established,in the absence of fraud,overreaching or excusable neglect,that one who signs an instrument may not avoid the impact of its terms on the ground that he failed to read the instrument before signing it.hulsey elsinore parachute center d.see also madden kaiser foundation hospitals cal d.
plaintiff has cited no california cases and we are aware of none that stand for the extreme proposition that a party who fails to read a contract but nonetheless objectively manifests his assent by signing fraud or knowledge by the other contracting party of the alleged later rescind the agreement on the basis that he did not agree to its terms.to the contrary,california authorities demonstrate that a contracting party is not entitled to relief from his or her alleged unilateral mistake under such circumstances.see,casey proctor cal d,failure to read release,or if it was read,to understand that it extended to personal injury as well as property damage claims,was neglect of a legal duty under,precluding rescission brookwood bank of america th,d employee bound by contractual arbitration provision irrespective of whether she was aware of it when she signed contract hernandez badger construction equipment th,d unilateral mistake concerning absence of requirement to name lessor as additional insured due to lessee failure to read equipment lease did not justify relief.indeed,the comments to the restatement indicate that a party ordinarily may not obtain relief based upon unilateral mistake where he or she has failed to read the contract before
