this appeal concerns a motion to compel a plaintiff,anne becker becker,to submit the claims in her complaint to arbitration pursuant to the federal arbitration act.becker,on her own behalf and as trustee on behalf of her charitable remainder trust,filed a complaint against various financial advisors alleging that they provided her and the trust with unsound financial advice.we conclude that some of becker individual claims are subject to arbitration and others are not.we further conclude that the financial advisors who did not contract with becker to submit their disputes to arbitration can compel arbitration only to the extent that they allegedly collaborated with those who did so contract.
becker,individually and as the trustee for the anne becker charitable remainder unitrust the trust collectively the plaintiffs,filed suit in the united states district court for the northern district of florida against john davis,william king falcon financial management,falcon financial planning,securities corporation,successor by merger to ifg network securities,ifg advisory services,associated financial planners,michael hartley dale ehrhart michael tillman michael tillman,and tillman hartley llc.essentially,the complaint alleges that these defendants provided becker and the trust with unsound financial advice that lined the pockets of the the defendants at the expense of plaintiffs.
the defendants john davis davis,falcon financial management,falcon fm,falcon financial planning,falcon fp,securities corporation,successor to ifg network securities,and ifg advisory services,collectively the defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration based on three contractual agreements that the trust entered into with davis and.each of the three agreements contain an arbitration clause.the district court granted the defendants motion in part and denied the motion in part.the court granted the motion as it related to the claims brought by becker as trustee on behalf of the trust.the court denied the motion as it related to the claims brought by becker in her individual capacity,because she was not a signatory to the agreements.the district court also denied the motion as to falcon fm and falcon fp,because they,too,were not signatories to the agreements.the defendants appeal the district court order.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for the reasons set forth in this opinion.
background 
in becker inherited approximately million and moved to florida a year later.shortly after her arrival in florida,becker met defendant william king king,who introduced her to davis and defendant michael tillman tillman during all relevant times,davis was president and principal owner of falcon fm and falcon fp.davis was also a registered representative and registered principal of and a registered investment advisor of.in late,on the advice of davis,becker created the trust and named herself and davis as trustees becker claims that she ultimately placed approximately million,one third of her assets,in the trust.
a.the complaint 
on july,becker and the trust filed suit against the defendants.the complaint alleges a wide variety of allegations.in general,the complaint alleges that all the defendants were working together to induce becker and the trust to adopt a financial strategy that was unsuitable for her personal investment objectives.the complaint also generally alleges that the conspiring defendants failed to disclose that they were engaged in a scheme to defraud becker and the trust 
a by wrongfully creating an inappropriate investment environment and structure to control the use and investment of plaintiff assets for an inordinately long period of time b by wrongfully creating an investment vehicle or structure for plaintiff that would make it very difficult,if not impossible,for her to extricate herself or her assets from the conspiring defendants control c by wrongfully charging plaintiff and sharing among themselves excessive,illegal,and undisclosed fees and commissions d by wrongfully creating for themselves opportunities to provide and charge plaintiff for extensive,unnecessary,and improper fee generating professional services and e by preparing or causing to be prepared complex documents lacking provisions customarily found in,or containing provisions not usually found in,similar types of documents properly prepared by others,and by inducing plaintiff to execute them in order to extend improperly their own control over plaintiff assets,and to facilitate their continuing scheme to defraud all without regard for plaintiff interests,and for the fundamental purpose of maximizing their own profits and wealth at the expense of their client.
the complaint more specifically alleges actions by the defendants as to becker and actions by the defendants as to the trust.as to becker as an individual,the complaint alleges,among other things,that davis,tillman,and king gave her improper financial advice concerning a real estate transaction where becker had purchased,along with a partner,susan berger,approximately acres of land in micanopy,florida to start a business to train and board horses.becker also alleges that davis opened a money market account without her consent in the name of anne becker john davis jr jtwros joint tenants with right of survivorship.further,based on davis advice,becker also created the anne becker irrevocable trusts.these two trusts were created to provide life insurance benefits to certain beneficiaries.becker alleges that davis received,without her knowledge,an insurance agent commission in connection with the insurance policy issued to her and that the trusts themselves were unsuitable for becker needs.
the complaint alleges,among other things,that pursuant to the advice of davis and king,the trust invested in the cnl income fund xviii,cnl and the investment in this security was unsuitable for the trust.also pursuant to davis and king advice,the trust opened investment accounts with dke and sei investments.the complaint alleges that davis and his companies received improper fees based on these investments.
based on these and other factual allegations,becker and the trust filed a complaint.becker,in her individual capacity,brought fifteen counts.the trust brought four counts,and becker and the trust collectively brought one count 
b.the arbitration agreements 
during the course of becker and the trust relationship with the defendants,the trust executed three agreements with.on november,the trust executed the goals direct client services agreement agreement one.agreement one,which was signed by becker,as trustee,and lists davis as the registered representative of,opened an investment account with,which would provide the trust with broker and portfolio advisor services for the purchase and sale of securities.agreement one contains an arbitration clause,which states that a ny controversy between us arising out of our business or this agreement shall be submitted to arbitration conducted before the national association of securities dealers,in accordance with their rules.
on december,the trust executed a document that opened another account with agreement two.agreement two also contains an arbitration clause,which provides that i t is agreed that any controversy between myself and arising out of the business of ifgns or this agreement shall be submitted to arbitration conducted under the code of arbitration procedure,then applying,of the national association of securities dealers,the record copy of agreement two is practically illegible,and the line containing the parties signatures is cut off.however,it is clear that the account was opened on behalf of the trust.
on october,the trust executed a document opening another account with agreement three.agreement three is the same document as agreement two and contains the same arbitration clause.agreement three was signed by becker as trustee and davis as a representative of.however,agreement three contains an additional page that limits the type of services provided by to the trust paragraph twelve on the second page of agreement three states that the representative,might offer products and services.i also understand all products and services are outside representative relationship with ifgns and as such i shall hold ifgns harmless for any loss i may incur associated with products and services.agreement three describes such products and services as insurance,real estate,accounting,tax preparation,and financial planning,among other things.
relying on these three agreements,the defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration of all the counts against them in the complaint,both the counts brought on behalf of the trust,as well as the counts brought on behalf of becker.in its order granting in part and denying in part the defendants motion,the district court made three separate rulings,each of which is before us on appeal.first,the district court denied the defendants motion as it related to becker individual claims,because becker,in her individual capacity,was not a signatory to the agreements.second,the district court found that only the defendants davis,and could compel the trust to arbitrate,for the other defendants,falcon fm and falcon fp,were not signatories to the agreements.third,the district court held that becker and the trust claim for an accounting of the trust assets did not arise from the business as referred to in the three agreements,and therefore,this claim was not subject to arbitration.
to decide this appeal,we review the scope of the three arbitration agreements between the trust and the defendants,and engage in a painstakingly thorough review of a,page complaint.

iii.discussion 
scope of the arbitration agreements 
the first step in determining the propriety of a motion to compel arbitration pursuant to section of the federal arbitration act faa is to determine whether the parties agreed to arbitrate the dispute.klay all defendants,cir citing mitsubishi motors soler,d while there is a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,the faa strong proarbitration policy only applies to disputes that the parties have agreed to arbitrate.id.a party can not be forced to arbitrate any dispute that the party has not agreed to submit to arbitration.see volt info,bd.of trs.of the leland stanford junior,d arbitration under the faa is a matter of consent,not coercion.
in agreement one,the parties agreed to arbitrate any controversy between us arising out of our business or this agreement.the arbitration clauses in agreements two and three are substantially similar to agreement one arbitration clause in that the parties agreed to arbitrate any controversy between myself and ifgns arising out of the business of ifgns or this agreement.all three arbitration clauses state that the arbiter of any potential dispute would be the national association of securities dealers,nasd.
we agree with the district court finding that the business referred to in the arbitration clauses was the business of providing investment services in connection with the buying and selling securities.this is evidenced by the plain language of the agreements.agreement one outlines that the portfolio advisor will make recommendations to the trust with respect to investment and reinvestment of the assets in the account in investment company shares no load mutual funds or in load investment company shares at their net asset value.agreement one also names a specific representative to handle all sale and purchase orders directed to it by the broker and also to handle other custodial functions performed with respect to the security brokerage account.
agreement three specifically limits the extent of the agreement to cover only security related products and services and expressly excludes services such as advice on accounting,real estate,tax preparation,and financial planning.agreement three also specifically states that the client appoints ifgns as my agent for the purpose of carrying out my directions with respect to the purchase and sale of securities and,as such,ifgns is authorized to open or close brokerage accounts,place and withdraw orders and take such other steps as are reasonable to carry out my directions.therefore,the parties agreed to arbitrate all disputes concerning the defendants security related investment advice to the trust.
becker individual claims 
becker as a nonsignatory 
having outlined the scope of the arbitration agreements,we next consider whether becker,as a nonsignatory to these agreements,can be bound by the agreements arbitration clauses.the defendants argue that the district court erred in finding that becker did not have to arbitrate her individual claims simply because she was not a signatory to the three agreements.we agree to the extent that becker individual claims rely upon the terms of the agreements and attempt to hold the defendants to these terms.
although arbitration is a contractual right that is generally predicated on an express decision to waive the right to trial in a judicial forum,this court has held that the lack of a written arbitration agreement is not an impediment to arbitration.sunkist soft drinks,sunkist growers,cir.certain exceptions,such as equitable estoppel,can bind a nonsignatory to an arbitration agreement.id.at.the defendants cite blinco green tree servicing,llc,cir and mcbro planning development triangle electrical construction,cir in support of this argument.
in blinco,and blinco,a husband and wife,signed and executed a mortgage.blinco alone signed and executed the promissory note that contained an arbitration clause.later,the blincos brought an action against green tree,who owned the mortgage,for violating the real estate settlement procedures act.we held that even though blinco was not a signatory on the note,she was bound by the arbitration clause because e quitable estoppel precludes a party from claiming the benefits of a contract while simultaneously attempting to avoid the burdens that contract imposes.id.at.since blinco claims against green tree derived from her status as a borrower under the promissory note,we held that she could not rely on the note to establish her claims and at the same time seek to avoid the obligation to arbitrate her claims.id.
in mcbro,we also held that a party may be equitably estopped from asserting that the lack of a written arbitration agreement precludes arbitration.at.the plaintiff,a general contractor,entered into an agreement to renovate a hospital.the agreement contained an arbitration clause,as well as references to the construction manager,mcbro.the agreement also detailed mcbro duties.after the project began,the general contractor alleged that mcbro interfered with its work,and the contractor filed an action alleging,among other things,contractual interference and negligence counts.mcbro moved the district court to compel arbitration,and the court granted the motion.the contractor argued that it did not have a written agreement with mcbro,and the federal arbitration act requires that there be a written agreement between parties to arbitrate.
we affirmed the district court order compelling arbitration.id.at.we stated that although the contract between the contractor and the hospital actually disclaimed any contractual relationship between the contractor and mcbro,the general conditions of that contract are replete with references to mcbro duties as construction manager with regards to the supervision of the project and the contractor claims are intimately founded in and intertwined with the underlying contract obligations.id.quoting hughes masonry greater clark county sch,cir.in asserting its claims against mcbro,the contractor was relying on the agreement with the hospital as it related to mcbro duties therefore,the contractor could be equitably estopped from then repudiating the arbitration clause contained in the same agreement.id.
blinco and mcbro establish that if a party relies on the terms of a written agreement in asserting the party claims,that party is equitably estopped from then seeking to avoid an arbitration clause within the agreement.therefore,to the extent that becker is relying upon the terms of the three agreements and attempting to hold the defendants to those terms in asserting her individual claims,she is bound by the arbitration clauses contained in those agreements.accordingly,we must focus on the nature of becker individual claims against the defendants to determine whether her claims fall within the scope of the arbitration clauses contained in the agreements.
applicability of the arbitration agreements to becker individual claims 
citing mcbro,the defendants argue that since each count in the complaint incorporates allegations that the defendants failed to provide becker and the trust with proper investment advice,becker individual claims are intertwined with or connected to the agreements that contain the arbitration clauses.therefore,the defendants argue that all of becker individual claims are subject to arbitration.
our holding in mcbro does not compel a finding that all the disputes in the complaint are subject to arbitration.in mcbro,we adopted the seventh circuit reasoning in hughes that a plaintiff claims were subject to arbitration if in the complaint the plaintiff was attempting to hold the defendant to the terms of the agreement that contained an arbitration clause.at.only then would the plaintiff claims be intimately founded in and intertwined with the underlying contract obligations.see sunkist,at stating that the decision in mcbro rest ed on the foundation that ultimately,the party must rely upon the terms of the written agreement in asserting the party claims.
in this case,not all aspects of becker claims rely upon or attempt to hold the defendants to the terms of the three agreements.for example,in count seven,becker alleges that the defendants breached a fiduciary duty owed to her as an individual not all aspects of this count concern investment advice to the trust.paragraphs allege that in early,prior to the creation of the trust,becker and her friend susan berger purchased approximately acres of land to train and board horses.becker and berger owned the farm as joint tenants with right of survivorship,and becker incorporated the business,naming it broken fiddle.becker borrowed a large sum of money in order to operate the business and secured the note with the farm mortgage.becker alleges that the defendants davis,tillman,and king gave her poor financial advice as to the structure of the note and mortgage,and they failed to secure berger financial obligations to the business.in paragraphs,becker alleges that she provided approximately million of financial assistance to broken fiddle,and davis permitted becker to file a report with the internal revenue service that the financial assistance to the business was a gift and not a loan or an investment.therefore,davis allowed becker to forfeit substantial income tax benefits.
in these allegations,becker is not relying on or attempting to hold the defendants to the terms and duties contained in the three agreements.to find otherwise would lead to an illogical result.the terms and duties contained in the three agreements refer to the defendants obligations to the trust concerning security investments.if we were to find that in the above allegations,some of which occurred prior to the creation of the trust,that becker is attempting to hold the defendants to the terms and duties in the agreements and therefore send these disputes to arbitration,the nasd would be required to arbitrate a dispute concerning davis advice to becker about the structure of the farm mortgage and the filing of her personal income tax return.these are not the type of disputes that the parties agreed to arbitrate in the three agreements.moreover,agreement three specifically excludes real estate and tax preparation disputes from the agreement.our case law forecloses us from forcing parties to arbitrate disputes that they did not agree to arbitrate.klay,at.
we acknowledge that many disputes contained within count seven are covered by the agreements and are thus subject to arbitration.paragraph specifically alleges that davis decision to invest in cnl was unsuitable for the trust.this dispute clearly falls within the scope of the arbitration agreements,and becker,as a nonsignatory,is bound to arbitrate this dispute,because in this instance,she is attempting to hold the defendants to the terms of the agreements.
we further acknowledge that the manner in which the complaint is pled is problematic because many,if not all,of becker individual claims against the defendants contain both arbitrable and disputes.for example,in count nine,becker alleges that the defendants engaged in fraud and deceit she generally alleges that defendant davis falsely represented to plaintiff that everything he did was intended to protect and enhance her financial interests,and that his representations and promises to her were false.paragraphs specifically refer to investments concerning the trust.these disputes are within the scope of the arbitration agreements and are thus arbitrable.however,paragraphs allege that davis opened a money market account with scudder investments in the name of anne becker john davis jr jtwros as joint tenants with right of survivorship.becker alleges that she never gave davis any right,title,or interest to her money that was deposited in the account.this aspect of count nine is not within the scope of the arbitration agreements,for this allegation does not implicate a dispute concerning the accounts that the trust opened with for the purpose of buying and selling securities.it is therefore not subject to arbitration.while it would be much easier to do so,we will not send clearly disputes to arbitration merely because a count,as pled,contains both arbitrable and disputes.
the complaint inclusion of both arbitrable and disputes within a single count is also evident in count one.in count one,becker alleges that the violated the florida securities and investor protection act paragraphs allege that in february,before the creation of the trust,becker entered into an investment management agreement with defendant dke on the advice of davis,and davis secured an improper kick back fee arrangement for the benefit of the defendants.paragraphs allege that pursuant to davis advice,the trust invested in the cnl and this investment was not suitable for the trust.count one alleges that in connection with the offer,sale,or purchase of any investment or security,the defendants acts or practices constituted a scheme to defraud in violation of florida statute.
at first blush,it appears that becker is attempting to hold the defendants to the terms and duties contained in the three agreements therefore,she should not be able to avoid the arbitration clauses contained in those agreements,and count one should be sent to arbitration.however,becker opened her individual account with dke prior to the creation of the trust.the documents that becker claimed she signed to open the account with dke are not part of the record.therefore,the defendants,to the extent that they were involved in the purchase and sale of securities through becker individual dke account,owed to becker a duty not to employ a scheme to defraud her based on their investment advice independent of the three agreements that the trust later entered into with.accordingly,to the extent that count one relies on disputes concerning security investments not connected to the trust,these disputes are not within the scope of the arbitration agreements entered into by the defendants and the trust,and these aspects of count one are not arbitrable.see bratt,noble int l,cir holding that only the aspects of plaintiff breach of contract claim that the parties had agreed to arbitrate were subject to arbitration.
the defendants also argue that becker allegation that the very creation of the trust was an unsuitable investment for her financial objectives,and her allegation as trustee that certain investments for the trust were unsuitable for the trust are impossible to separate.we disagree.the trust wa
