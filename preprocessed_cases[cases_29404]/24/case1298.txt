this appeal presents the question of whether,in response to a construction defect action brought by a condominium homeowners association,the developer can compel binding arbitration of the litigation pursuant to an arbitration provision in the declaration of covenants,conditions,and restrictions cc r.the answer is 
we reach this conclusion because the developer does not rely on a contract with the homeowners association to compel arbitration but instead on the arbitration provision in the cc r.yet,under california law,the provisions in the cc r are equitable servitudes and can be enforced only by the homeowners association,the owner of a condominium,or both.developers are not among those permitted to enforce cc r.
background 
the facts and allegations in this appeal are taken from the pleadings,the exhibits submitted in connection with the motion to compel arbitration,and the standard procedure for creating a common interest development.
defendants western pacific housing,and playa capital company,llc developers,constructed,marketed,and sold a unit condominium complex located on west pacific promenade in playa vista,california.before the homeowners association association came into existence or a single unit was sold,the developers drafted and recorded the cc r.only the developers signed that document.
the cc r contained a mandatory arbitration provision,requiring that any disputes between the developers,on the one hand,and the association or a condominium owner,on the other hand,be submitted to binding arbitration.according to its terms,the provision could not be amended without the consent of the developers.the cc r made the federal arbitration act faa applicable in interpreting and enforcing the arbitration provision.
sales of the units began in.in addition to the cc r,each purchase agreement and escrow instructions contained a mandatory arbitration provision,requiring that postclosing disputes between the developers and the buyer be submitted to binding arbitration.the purchase agreements,unlike the cc r,were signed by both the developers and the buyer.
initially,the members of the association board of directors were appointed by the developers.ultimately,the developers sold all the units and no longer had any ownership interest in the complex.the owners replaced the initial board members with individuals of their own choosing.
on october,the association filed this action against the developers,alleging construction defects in the roofs,stucco,windows,and doors,and the structural,electrical,plumbing,and mechanical components and systems.the developers responded with a motion to compel arbitration,relying on the arbitration provision in the cc r and the individual purchase agreements.
the association filed opposition,contending the cc r were not subject to arbitration because they were equitable servitudes,not a contract,and,alternatively,if they were a contract,enforcement was barred because the contract was unconscionable.the association also pointed out that of the original buyers had sold their units,and the arbitration provision in their purchase agreements with the developers did not apply to the subsequent purchasers.
the motion was heard on april.by order of the same date,the trial court denied the motion to compel.the developers appealed.
discussion 
we review the trial court decision independently because it involves interpreting the cc r and applicable statutes.see p d consultants,city of carlsbad th,d redding medical center bonta th,d.
on appeal,the parties focus primarily on whether the cc r are unconscionable.in their opening brief,the developers state they no longer rely on the arbitration provision in the purchase agreements with the original buyers to compel arbitration.rather,the developers base their alleged right to arbitrate solely on the arbitration provision in the cc r,arguing that the original purchase agreements constitute evidence that procedural unconscionability is lacking an issue not relevant to our analysis because we view the cc r as equitable servitudes,not as a contract to arbitrate.
for its part,the association again argues that the developers can not enforce the cc r because that document consists of equitable servitudes it is not a contract and is therefore not enforceable by the developers,who have no ownership interest in the condominium complex.we agree with the association and affirm.
under the faa,a written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,italics added.but this case involves equitable servitudes,not a contract,making the faa inapplicable.
as our supreme court has explained at length to divide a plot of land into interests severable by blocks or planes,the attorney for the land developer must prepare a declaration that must be recorded prior to the sale of any unit in the county where the land is located the declaration,which is the operative document for the creation of any common interest development,is a collection of covenants,conditions and servitudes that govern the project typically,the declaration describes the real property and any structures on the property,delineates the common areas within the project as well as the individually held lots or units,and sets forth restrictions pertaining to the use of the property 
use restrictions are an inherent part of any common interest development and are crucial to the stable,planned environment of any shared ownership arrangement the viability of shared ownership of improved real property rests on the existence of extensive reciprocal servitudes,together with the ability of each to prevent the property partition 
the restrictions on the use of property in any common interest development may limit activities conducted in the common areas as well as in the confines of the home itself commonly,use restrictions preclude alteration of building exteriors,limit the number of persons that can occupy each unit,and place limitations on or prohibit altogether the keeping of pets 
restrictions on property use are not the only characteristic of common interest ownership.ordinarily,such ownership also entails mandatory membership in an owners association,which,through an elected board of directors,is empowered to enforce any use restrictions contained in the project declaration or master deed and to enact new rules governing the use and occupancy of property within the project.nahrstedt lakeside village condominium cal th,d,citations fn.omitted.
the court continued one significant factor in the continued popularity of the common interest form of property ownership is the ability of homeowners to enforce restrictive cc r against other owners including future purchasers of project units generally,however,such enforcement is possible only if the restriction that is sought to be enforced meets the requirements of equitable servitudes or of covenants running with the land 
restrictive covenants will run with the land,and thus bind successive owners,if the deed or other instrument containing the restrictive covenant particularly describes the lands to be benefited and burdened by the restriction and expressly provides that successors in interest of the covenantor land will be bound for the benefit of the covenantee land.moreover,restrictions must relate to use,repair,maintenance,or improvement of the property,or to payment of taxes or assessments,and the instrument containing the restrictions must be recorded 
restrictions that do not meet the requirements of covenants running with the land may be enforceable as equitable servitudes provided the person bound by the restrictions had notice of their existence.nahrstedt lakeside village condominium,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
under the law of equitable servitudes,courts may enforce a promise about the use of land even though the person who made the promise has transferred the land to another the underlying idea is that a landowner promise to refrain from particular conduct pertaining to land creates in the beneficiary of that promise an equitable interest in the land of the promisor.the doctrine is useful chiefly to enforce uniform building restrictions under a general plan for an entire tract of land or for a subdivision it is undoubted that when the owner of a subdivided tract conveys the various parcels in the tract by deeds containing appropriate language imposing restrictions on each parcel as part of a general plan of restrictions common to all the parcels and designed for their mutual benefit,mutual equitable servitudes are thereby created in favor of each parcel as against all the others.
in choosing equitable servitude law as the standard for enforcing cc r in common interest developments,the legislature has manifested a preference in favor of their enforcement.this preference is underscored by the use of the word shall in the first phrase of civil code section the covenants and restrictions shall be enforceable equitable servitudes nahrstedt lakeside village condominium,supra,cal th at,d,citations omitted.
having a single set of recorded restrictions that apply to the entire subdivision would also no doubt fulfill the intent,expectations,and wishes of the parties and community as a whole.one of the prime policy components of the law of equitable servitudes and real covenants is that of meeting the reasonable expectations of the parties and of the community.
by requiring recordation of the cc r before execution of the contract of sale,a ll buyers could easily know exactly what they were purchasing where a tract index is in effect,a plan of the proposed development should be recorded against the entire tract,which would give notice to all purchasers by placing the restriction in the direct chain of title to each lot in the tract.the burden should be upon the developer to insert the covenant into the record in a way that it can be easily found.recording a declaration of covenants covering the entire area or filing a map which referred to the covenants would be sufficient.when a developer does follow this simple procedure,it should suffice future buyers should be deemed to agree to the restrictions.citizens for covenant compliance anderson cal th,d,citation omitted.
that brings us to the question of who may enforce the cc r.the legislature answered that question in civil code section,subdivision a,which states the covenants and restrictions in the declaration shall be enforceable equitable servitudes,unless unreasonable,and shall inure to the benefit of and bind all owners of separate interests in the development.unless the declaration states otherwise,these servitudes may be enforced by any owner of a separate interest or by the association,or by both.italics added all undesignated section references are to the civil code.the provision express reference to equitable servitudes evidences the legislature intent that recorded use restrictions falling within section are to be treated as equitable servitudes thus,although under general rules governing equitable servitudes a subsequent purchaser of land subject to restrictions must have actual notice of the restrictions,actual notice is not required to enforce recorded use restrictions covered by section against a subsequent purchaser.rather,the inclusion of covenants and restrictions in the declaration recorded with the county recorder provides sufficient notice to permit the enforcement of such recorded covenants and restrictions as equitable servitudes.nahrstedt lakeside village condominium,supra,cal th at,d,citation fn.omitted.
under the plain meaning rule used to interpret statutes simke,chodos,silberfeld anteau,athans th,d,we construe the benefit and bind language of section to link ownership in the condominium complex with enforcement of the cc r the owners,the homeowners association,or both,may enforce the cc r unless the cc r provide otherwise.but under any rationale interpretation of section,the developers can not enforce the cc r once they have completed the project and sold all the units they no longer have any ownership interest in the property.section confers standing on owners of separate interests in a development and on the association to enforce the equitable servitudes nahrstedt lakeside village condominium,supra,cal th at,fn,d,italics added.
in martin bridgeport community,th,d,a husband and wife,the petersons,bought property in a planned development community and agreed that their daughter and her husband,the martins,could live there.the petersons executed a power of attorney stating that the martins would be responsible for all costs associated with the property,including mortgage payments,and would deal directly with the homeowners association on all issues.the homeowners association accepted the power of attorney.during the construction of the house,the petersons and the martins noticed that the size of the lot was smaller than represented in the purchase transaction.as a result of negotiations with the martins,the homeowners association agreed to move the northern property line.the agreement was confirmed in two letters addressed to the martins,who undertook the expense of fencing,importing dirt,and landscaping the additional land.when the homeowners association failed to cooperate timely in obtaining city approval of the lot adjustment,the martins filed suit against the association,alleging causes of action for breach of contract and breach of the cc r.after the trial court sustained demurrers to the complaint on the ground that the martins lacked standing,judgment was entered in favor of the homeowners association.the martins appealed.
relying on section,the court of appeal affirmed,stating in the instant case,as owners of lot,the petersons qualify as an owner of a separate interest entitled to enforce the cc r and other governing documents of the bridgeport community the martins do not qualify.what is bound by an equitable servitude enforceable under cc r is a parcel,a lot,in a subdivided tract,not an individual who has no ownership interest in the lot.see,subd.a.w hen the owner of a subdivided tract conveys the various parcels in the tract by deeds containing appropriate language imposing restrictions on each parcel as part of a general plan of restrictions common to all the parcels and designed for their mutual benefit,mutual equitable servitudes are thereby created in favor of each parcel as against all the others.accordingly,the right of enforcement is inextricable from ownership of real property a parcel,a lot in a planned development such as bridgeport and,thus,can not be assigned absent a transfer of ownership of the parcel to which it applies.martin bridgeport community,supra,th at,d,italics added,citations omitted.to the same effect is farber bay view terrace homeowners th,d,in which the court of appeal held that the seller of a condominium lacked standing under the cc r to require the homeowners association to repair a leaking roof because the sale had closed,and the seller no longer owned the unit id.at pages,d.
and so it is here.the developers do not own any property in the playa vista complex and therefore have no standing to enforce the cc r,including the arbitration provision.by analogy,where grant deeds contain identical restrictions applicable to several lots in a tract,i t is not open to question that building restrictions of the kind contained in the deed s are valid and enforceable at the suit of the grantor so long as he continues to own any part of the tract for the benefit of which the restrictions were exacted.firth marovich cal,italics added.a fter a grantor has parted with the property which would derive benefit from a continuance of the restrictions,such grantor has no standing in court to enforce the restrictions.kent koch d.
our conclusion that the developers can not enforce the arbitration provision in the cc r is in harmony with section,which requires a homeowners association to initiate and pursue mediation with a developer,builder,or general contractor before filing suit.in,was added to the civil code to impose a complex set of prerequisites to an
