factual and procedural background 
on july,plaintiffs the housing group,golden state developers,castro valley associates,and castro valley,commenced this lawsuit against their insurers defendants pma capital insurance company as successor in interest to caliber one indemnity company,and caliber one management company hereinafter collectively referred to as caliber one.the record does not include a copy of the first amended complaint,the operative pleading,which was filed may.caliber one describes the pleading as one in which plaintiffs seek damages for breach of contract,bad faith,fraud,declaratory relief,malicious prosecution,and negligent representation plaintiffs describe the pleading as seeking damages for caliber one failure and refusal to defend plaintiffs in certain actions arising out of the views subdivision in castro valley,california.
caliber one petitioned to compel arbitration of an alleged cumis fee dispute pursuant to civil code section,subdivision c hereinafter section c in support of the request,caliber one argued the instant action involves disputes regarding the applicable fee that should be paid by caliber one for legal services rendered by the independent counsel for plaintiffs in three underlying lawsuits hereinafter referred to as the engleman,morrison,and actions,or the underlying litigation.according to caliber one,p laintiffs seek as damages in this action the full hourly billable rate of their corporate counsel while caliber one agreed to pay the rate that is actually paid by caliber one to attorneys it retains in the ordinary course of business to defend similar actions in the community where the claim was being defended.caliber one paid defense fees and costs in excess of,but plaintiffs found the payment insufficient consequently,caliber one argued the court was required,pursuant to section c,to compel arbitration of the distinct dispute regarding the applicable fees that should be paid by caliber one for legal services rendered by plaintiffs independent counsel.relying principally on compulink management center,paul fire marine ins.th compulink,caliber one also argued that arbitration was mandatory even though plaintiffs also sought damages for caliber one alleged bad faith and unreasonable delay in agreeing to defend plaintiffs and in failing to make timely payments of defense fees and costs.
plaintiffs opposed the petition on various grounds,including that caliber one could not invoke section c because it did not and could not offer any evidence it had ever agreed to defend plaintiffs in the underlying litigation.plaintiffs submitted a declaration of their counsel,who averred that caliber one had not accepted the tender of the engleman action and never defended that action except for making a minor payment to reimburse plaintiffs damages arising out of fees after the case settled,and caliber one never responded to a tender of the morrison and actions or agreed to defend either of those actions.plaintiffs also submitted two reservation of rights letters from caliber one responding to the tender of the engleman action.according to plaintiffs,the letters did not indicate caliber one would defend plaintiffs in the underlying litigation finally,plaintiffs argued there were outstanding questions concerning whether cumis counsel was actually retained or required in the first instance,which issues were not subject to arbitration under section c.
in reply,caliber one argued that arbitration was compelled by the following allegation in plaintiffs first amended complaint notwithstanding the fact that on the even sic of trial,defendants finally admitted coverage for the engleman action and paid plaintiffs share of the settlement in the amount of and drafted the settlement agreement for the engleman action,defendants retaliated against plaintiffs for having filed this lawsuit by only reimbursing plaintiffs less than for defense fees and costs.caliber one also argued that its two reservation of rights letters,and payment of defense fees and costs,constituted an acknowledgement of their duty to defend the engleman lawsuit.
after a hearing,the trial court denied the petition to compel arbitration.it noted plaintiffs had submitted declarations and evidence demonstrating that either no defense fees were paid on the underlying actions,or,in one case,defense fees were not paid until the action settled,and that caliber one had not hired counsel to defend plaintiffs in the underlying litigation.relying on the reasoning in stalberg western title ins.d,stalberg,in which an insurer had rejected a tender to defend,the trial court found caliber one failure to provide a defense left plaintiffs in the same position as if caliber one had failed to defend.the trial court also found persuasive the decision in atmel paul fire marine d,atmel,in which the federal district court,interpreting california law,held that an insurer could not avail itself of the protections and limitations set forth in section,because it was undisputed that the insurer had not defended the insured in the underlying litigation.the trial court here then ruled in the case at bar,since the court finds that the caliber one defendants did not provide a defense,the court finds that these defendants are not entitled to compel an arbitration pursuant to section.caliber one timely appeals.
discussion 
caliber one presents several arguments challenging the denial of its petition to compel arbitration.we conclude none of the contentions requires reversal.
initially,we reject caliber one argument that we should analyze the trial court decision de novo because it is based on facts presented in the petition,and therefore the proper scope of the application of section c,and whether arbitration is mandated in this case,is a question that is subject to de novo review.unlike the situations in compulink,supra,th at,and handy first interstate bank th,handy,cited by caliber one,the trial court in this case did not deny the petition based on an application of section c to undisputed facts.instead,as plaintiffs correctly argue,the denial of the petition is based on the finding that caliber one did not defend plaintiffs in the underlying litigation,which we review for substantial evidence.engineers architects community development th.
