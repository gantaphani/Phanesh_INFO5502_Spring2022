are georgia residents and subscribers of defendant comcast corporation comcast,a cable television provider.the subscribers filed a class action lawsuit against comcast alleging violations of state law based on the cable communications policy act of,et cable act.the district court dismissed the action and compelled arbitration,finding the subscribers had entered into binding arbitration agreements with comcast.after oral argument and a careful review of the record,we find the arbitration agreements unenforceable and reverse and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
the cable act authorizes local governments to charge cable operators a franchise fee for the use of public,provided the fee does not exceed five percent of the cable operator gross revenue.a,b.the act permits cable operators,in turn,to pass the franchise fees through to their subscribers.see id.c.the act also requires cable operators to pass through the amount of any decrease in a franchise fee.id.e.
the subscribers allege comcast calculates its franchise fees by using estimates of future revenue from advertising sales and channel commissions.the subscribers contend that by using these estimates,comcast charges its customers more than it actually pays in franchise fees based on actual revenues,in violation of.they claim comcast retains the excess franchise fees even though they never consented to comcast estimated calculation of the pass through fees or to its retention of the excess fees.
on december,dale,as class action representative,filed a complaint in state court asserting claims of unjust enrichment and money had and received.the class seeks an accounting of funds wrongfully withheld,repayment of excess franchise fees,and declaratory and injunctive relief.comcast removed the action to federal court and filed a motion to compel arbitration and dismiss,arguing the subscribers individual claims were governed by written arbitration agreements.
in its motion,comcast argued that each subscriber received its policies and procedures,an annual notice containing a mandatory arbitration provision,with his or her december invoice or in a welcome kit given to each new subscriber at the time of service installation.the arbitration section in the notice,titled mandatory binding arbitration the arbitration provision,provides that either the subscriber or comcast may elect to arbitrate a dispute rather than litigate the dispute in court.the arbitration provision also contains a class action waiver clause prohibiting subscribers from bringing claims on a class action or consolidated basis.the waiver states 
all parties to the arbitration must be individually named.there shall be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated or litigated on a or consolidated basis or on basis sic involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public such as a private attorney general,other subscribers,or other persons similarly situated.
comcast argued the subscribers accepted the arbitration provision,including the class action waiver,by their continued subscription to comcast services after receiving the notices.
in response to comcast motion to compel arbitration and dismiss,the subscribers disputed having received the policies and procedures or having agreed to the arbitration provision,and they requested a jury trial on the issue of whether they each had entered into an arbitration agreement with comcast.they also argued that,even if the arbitration provision constituted an agreement to arbitrate,the class action waiver was unconscionable and therefore unenforceable as a matter of law.
on september,the district court granted comcast motion to compel arbitration and dismiss and denied the subscribers request for a jury trial.the court found the arbitration provision was binding and the class action waiver was not unconscionable.the subscribers timely appealed arguing,inter alia,the district court erred in failing to find the class action waiver unconscionable and in granting comcast motion to compel arbitration and dismiss we find merit in the subscribers arguments and reverse and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court grant of comcast motion to compel arbitration and dismiss de novo.caley gulfstream aerospace,cir.the issue presented is whether the arbitration provision class action waiver is unconscionable under georgia law and thus unenforceable as a matter of law if it is,then pursuant to the arbitration provision severability clause,the entire arbitration provision is unenforceable,and the subscribers can maintain their action in federal court 
under the federal arbitration act,et faa,written agreements to arbitrate a dispute arising out of a transaction involving commerce are valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.id.the faa allows state law to invalidate an arbitration agreement,provided the law at issue governs contracts generally and not arbitration agreements specifically.bess check express,cir.thus,generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements.doctor,casarotto,d.
here,the subscribers argue comcast class action waiver is unenforceable as a matter of law because it is unconscionable under applicable georgia law.t he basic test for determining unconscionability is whether,in the light of the general commercial background and the commercial needs of the particular trade or case,the clauses involved are so as to be unconscionable under the circumstances existing at the time of the making of the contract.nec,nelson,quoting cmt.georgia law recognizes both procedural and substantive unconscionability.id.procedural unconscionability addresses the process of making a contract,while substantive unconscionability looks to the contractual terms themselves.id.to determine substantive unconscionability,courts focus on matters such as the commercial reasonableness of the contract terms,the purpose and effect of the terms,the allocation of the risks between the parties,and similar public policy concerns.id.at.
the subscribers argue comcast class action waiver is substantively unconscionable they claim both the united states supreme court and this court have recognized that public policy supports the need for class actions for certain types of claims.see,amchem,windsor,d the policy at the very core of the class action mechanism is to overcome the problem that small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to bring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights.internal quotation omitted in re charter,cir t he effort and cost of investigating and initiating a claim may be greater than many claimants individual stake in the outcome,discouraging the prosecution of these claims absent a class action filing procedure.the subscribers argue that if comcast class action waiver is held valid,they will effectively be denied any remedy.if successful on their claims,the subscribers individually stand to recover a very small amount.for example,the subscribers contend that in fulton county,during january,february,and march,comcast charged its subscribers in franchise fees,but paid only to the local government.this resulted in a total overcharge of or per subscriber that is,divided by an estimated fulton county subscribers.over the applicable statute of limitations period,the subscribers estimate comcast charged them each in excess fees that is,each period for four years.
the subscribers also explain that even though the arbitration provision requires comcast to advance arbitration filing fees and the arbitrator cost and expenses upon written request,it holds the subscribers responsible for additional costs,including fees for attorneys and expert witnesses.comcast will only pay those fees and costs which it is required to pay by law.if comcast prevails,the arbitration provision further requires the subscribers to reimburse comcast for advanced fees up to the amount the subscribers would have paid to file the claim in state court the subscribers maintain that,given the potential recovery when compared to the cost of arbitration,a single plaintiff would not proceed to arbitration.accordingly,the subscribers argue the class action waiver is unconscionable as it will allow comcast to continue unabated its alleged practice of overcharging customers.
comcast responds that our decision in caley gulfstream aerospace,cir,disposes of the subscribers substantive unconscionability argument.in caley,we considered,inter alia,whether gulfstream dispute resolution policy drp,which required its employees to submit certain claims to arbitration,was unconscionable under georgia law.id.at.the plaintiffs claimed the drp was substantively unconscionable for several reasons,including that it limited discovery and prohibited class actions.the court discussion of this argument was rather brief.we stated 
as the supreme court has explained,the fact that certain litigation devices may not be available in an arbitration is part and parcel of arbitration ability to offer simplicity,informality,and expedition,characteristics that generally make arbitration an attractive vehicle for the resolution of claims.the drp prohibition of class actions and discovery limitations are consistent with the goals of simplicity,informality and expedition touted by the supreme court 
id.at internal quotations,citations,and footnote omitted.
we do not agree with comcast that caley requires us to conclude the class action waiver is enforceable.in caley,we determined only that under the specific facts of that case,the drp prohibiting class actions was enforceable,not that every class action waiver is enforceable under georgia law we did not consider a factual scenario in which a remedy was effectively foreclosed because of the negligible amount of recovery when compared to the cost of bringing an arbitration action.more importantly,a review of the claims in caley shows that each provided for the recovery of attorneys fees expert costs should the plaintiff prevail 
we recognize that in at least two other cases,we have found arbitration agreements precluding class action relief to be valid and enforceable.jenkins first am.cash advance of,llc,cir randolph green tree fin,cir.like caley,however,both jenkins and randolph involved claims for which attorneys fees and other costs were recoverable.for example,in jenkins,the plaintiff filed a class action lawsuit,alleging that certain payday loan agreements violated georgia usury statutes and the georgia racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico act at.each time the plaintiff obtained a payday loan,she signed an arbitration agreement,in which she agreed to either arbitrate claims or assert them in a small claims tribunal and to waive class action relief.id.at.the district court determined the arbitration agreements were substantively unconscionable because they precluded borrowers from either instigating or participating in class action suits.id.at.the court explained that a class action is the only way that borrowers with claims as small as the individual loan transactions at issue in this case can obtain relief,and speculated that a borrower who attempts to pursue a single claim would probably be unable to find affordable representation.id.internal quotation omitted.
on appeal,however,we determined the class action waiver was not unconscionable.in rejecting the district court conclusion,we noted that we had previously held in randolph that a contractual provision to arbitrate tila claims is enforceable even if it precludes a plaintiff from utilizing class action procedures in vindicating statutory rights under tila.id.at internal quotation omitted.we also found the district court contention that consumers would likely be unable to obtain legal representation without the class action vehicle to be unfounded because under georgia rico act,the plaintiff could recover attorneys fees and costs if she prevailed id.at.we stated that when the opportunity to recover attorneys fees is available,lawyers will be willing to represent debtors in arbitration.id.citing snowden checkpoint check cashing,cir and johnson west suburban bank,cir.we therefore concluded that precluding class action relief would not have the practical effect of immunizing the defendants and the inclusion of a class action waiver in the a rbitration a greements did not render those a greements substantively unconscionable.id.
here,unlike the plaintiffs in caley,jenkins,and randolph,the subscribers can not recover attorneys fees under the cable act for the specific violations alleged.while the cable act provides for attorneys fees and costs for violations of protection of subscriber policy and unauthorized reception of cable service,it does not provide for attorneys fees and costs for a violation of franchise fees.we recognize that the subscribers assert state law claims and,under state law,the subscribers may be able to recover fees and costs.georgia law provides that t he expenses of litigation generally shall not be allowed as part of the damages,but a jury may award such expenses where the plaintiff has specially pleaded and has made prayer therefor and where the defendant has acted in bad faith,has been stubbornly litigious,or has caused the plaintiff unnecessary trouble and expense.nonetheless,the potential recovery of attorneys fees and litigation costs under does not provide the same incentive for an attorney to represent an individual plaintiff as the automatic,or likely,award of fees and costs available to a prevailing plaintiff for the claims asserted in caley,jenkins,and randolph we thus find ourselves in unchartered territory and look to our sister circuits decisions addressing the enforceability of class action waivers.
in a recent case,kristian comcast,cir,the first circuit addressed the enforceability of arbitration agreements invoked by comcast against a group of boston subscribers suing comcast for violations of state and federal antitrust law.id.at.the boston subscribers argued the arbitration agreement prevented them from vindicating their statutory rights by,among other things,prohibiting the use of the class mechanism.id.at.in deciding whether the class action waiver was valid,the first circuit first noted that the legitimacy of the arbitral forum rests on the presumption that arbitration provides a fair and adequate mechanism for enforcing statutory rights.id.at internal quotation omitted.relying on unopposed expert evidence presented by the plaintiffs,the court found that the bar on class arbitration threatens this presumption given the complexity of an antitrust case generally,and the complexity and cost required to prosecute a case against comcast specifically.id.at.w ithout some form of class it class action or class consumer antitrust plaintiff will not sue at all.id.at accordingly,the court struck down the class arbitration waiver,concluding that comcast would be essentially shielded from private consumer antitrust enforcement liability,even in cases where it has violated the law.id.at plaintiffs would be unable to vindicate their statutory rights and the social goals of federal and state antitrust laws would be frustrated because of the enforcement gap created by the de facto liability shield.id.at 
while the subscribers in the instant case do not argue the class action waiver prevents them from vindicating their statutory rights,we nonetheless find the first circuit analysis in kristian instructive.without the benefit of a class action mechanism,the subscribers would effectively be precluded from suing comcast for a violation of.the cost of vindicating an individual subscriber claim,when compared to his or her potential recovery,is too great.additionally,because the cable act does not provide for the recovery of attorneys fees or related costs for the violations alleged by the subscribers,and because state law allows fees and costs to be awarded only where bad faith is shown,it will be difficult for a single subscriber to obtain representation.this will allow comcast to engage in unchecked market behavior that may be unlawful.corporations should not be
