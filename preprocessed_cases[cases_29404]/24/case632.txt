employer ex.
on april,rogney was working with a crew on a clear channel billboard located at the intersection of capital drive and green bay avenue in milwaukee.the platform on which the employees were working was eighteen or more feet above the ground.rogney was wearing a safety harness,and initially his harness was connected to the billboard safety cable.however,at some point,as rogney stepped around one of his,he unhooked the lanyard from the cable and then neglected to reattach it.
while rogney was working with his lanyard disconnected from the safety cable,a company official happened to drive by.paul sara,president of clear channel milwaukee division,was performing a periodic inspection of some of clear channel he calls driving the plant.as he approached the capitol drive billboard,he saw the crew working on that billboard and noticed that two of the workers did not have their lanyards connected to the billboard safety cable.he stopped to get a closer look and observed the crew for a period of about eight minutes.sara did not call the safety violation to the workers attention.instead,he telephoned the company operations manager,rick schoenholtz,and told schoenholtz what he had seen.sara expressed his displeasure,noting that the employees omission was an unacceptable violation of clear channel policies schoenholtz agreed.
schoenholtz and supervisor tom riley met with rogney later that day and told him what sara had seen.at no time did rogney dispute that he had violated the company safety rules by working on the billboard with his lanyard unhooked.rogney was immediately suspended pending further investigation,as was the other employee seen working without his lanyard attached to the safety cable.two days later,the company discharged them both.
local subsequently filed a grievance protesting rogney discharge,contending that he had been fired without good cause.the parties selected a mutually acceptable arbitrator,fredric dichter,and,by agreement,submitted the following questions for his decision did the employer have just cause to discharge the grievant rogney if not,what is the appropriate remedy see ex.at.the arbitrator conducted an evidentiary hearing on september,after which the parties submitted written briefs.three months later,the arbitrator rendered a written decision and award.
arbitrator dichter determined that rogney discharge was without just cause and that a suspension without pay was an appropriate penalty.he read article xiv provision that an employee may be discharged for committing the type of safety violation that rogney did,together with article vi provision that the employer may only discharge an employee for just cause,to mean that clear channel discretion to discharge an employee was limited.ex.at.just cause,as the arbitrator interpreted that term,required clear channel to consider not only whether the employee committed an offense for which the agreement permits discharge,but also whether the particular transgression warranted discharge.id.at.it was the arbitrator role,in turn,to assess de novo whether the circumstances rendered discharge too harsh a penalty,and in arbitrator dichter view,it was in rogney case.id.at.although the arbitrator conceded that rogney transgression was a serious offense that could have had disastrous consequences,he had a very hard time understanding how a member of clear channel management could stand by watching rogney and his laboring in an unsafe manner for a period of eight minutes without doing anything to intervene.id.at.to sustain the discharge under these circumstances would be asking the arbitrator to treat the offense more seriously than the employer did at the time the offense was actually being committed.id.in view of rogney perfect prior record,his long tenure with the company,the fact that he was wearing his safety harness and had the lanyard connected to the safety wire earlier,coupled with clear channel inaction,discharge was too severe a penalty,in the arbitrator view the company therefore lacked just cause to fire rogney.id.it did,however,have just cause to impose stern discipline.id.at.as of the date of the decision,rogney had been out of the company employ for more than eight months.the arbitrator believed that a suspension without pay was an adequate penalty.id.he ordered rogney reinstated subject to that penalty and directed clear channel to make rogney whole for the balance of two and months that rogney had been separated from its employ.
the district court denied clear channel motion to vacate the award and granted the union motion to confirm it.wl.the court noted at the outset that the question before it was whether the arbitrator interpreted the collective bargaining agreement,not whether he did so erroneously.id.at.having reviewed the arbitrator decision,the court was satisfied that the arbitrator did indeed interpret the parties agreement.regardless of whether his interpretation was strained or even a serious error,the award must stand.id.the court rejected clear channel suggestion that the decision was contrary to public policy.the relevant consideration in that regard was not whether the employee failure to wear the harness violates public policy but whether the order to reinstate does.id.at.the court recognized that there is a strong federal interest in workplace safety,but reasoned that a suspension does not necessarily condone a worker failure to comply with safety rules.id.
as is common in collective bargaining agreements,article vii of the agreement between local and clear channel sets forth a grievance procedure to resolve disputes between the company and its employees which provides for binding arbitration of any grievance that the company and the union are unable to settle.speaking to the arbitrator authority,the agreement provides that t he arbitrator shall interpret and apply this agreement in an effort to settle this dispute but the arbitrator shall have no power to add to,subtract from,or otherwise modify the terms of this agreement and the arbitrator decision shall be final and binding on the parties to the agreement and the employee involved.article vii,c.

here the arbitrator without question was interpreting the agreement.the arbitrator understood that it was his task to construe the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement and to apply those provisions to the facts presented to him.ex.at.he included in full the relevant provisions of the agreement in the background set forth at the outset of his opinion.id.at.his ensuing analysis was grounded in those provisions.the arbitrator deemed the permissive language found in article xiv,section regarding clear channel power to discharge an employee particularly important whereas article vi,section purports to grant to the employer the sole discretion to impose a lesser penalty for an offense that subjects an employee to immediate discharge,article xiv,section states that an employee may be immediately discharged for failing to use a safety belt harness in the manner prescribed by osha and the employer.the latter provision use of the word may implies that in certain circumstances a lesser penalty would be appropriate.id.at.by leaving the door open to a lesser penalty,the arbitrator believed,the agreement imposed on the employer the obligation to exercise its discretion in determining which penalty to impose within the confines of the remainder of the agreement.id.at.elsewhere in the agreement,the parties had agreed that no employee was to be discharged without just cause,and j ust cause,as the union notes,is not limited to a determination of whether the employee did the act,but also includes a determination as to whether the act warranted the most serious penalty that can be imposed in the industrial setting,discharge.id.furthermore,the parties had granted the arbitrator the authority to interpret and apply the agreement,and the existence or not of just cause was an issue that arbitrators regularly deal with.id.thus,although the arbitrator acknowledged that the contract grants to the employer the power to discharge an employee for failing to use his safety harness,he understood the use of the permissive word may in setting forth that power,coupled with the contract provision,to limit the exercise of that discretion and to subject the employer choice of penalty to a kind of proportionality review.id.at.the arbitrator then proceeded to consider the relevant facts,including the gravity of the safety violation,sara failure to do anything to correct the violation while he was observing it take place,the apparently inadvertent nature of the violation,rogney long tenure with the company,and his otherwise unblemished record.those facts persuaded the arbitrator that just cause did not exist to support the decision to discharge
