on february,we ordered attorney raul aguilar and attorney allen kent to show cause before this court why each should not be held in contempt of court for the willful neglect of the duty to appear for oral argument before this court in aguilar lerner cal th,d,on february.each attorney filed a return and thereafter appeared before this court,by counsel and in person,on march,providing statements and arguments and answering questions posed by the court.
on march,after considering the returns to the order to show cause,the declarations and other written submissions by both attorneys and counsel,and the oral presentations before this court on march,we issued an order declining to discharge the order to show cause,retaining jurisdiction over the contempt matter,and referring this matter to the state bar court for further investigation,an evidentiary hearing or hearings,and a report to this court on specified questions the state bar court conducted an investigation,held a evidentiary hearing,and submitted a report to this court on april,with findings pertaining to each of the referred questions.at our request,aguilar and kent filed letter briefs on may,responding to the state bar court report and findings.
after considering all the materials that have been filed in this case,including the oral presentations before this court on march,and the transcript of the evidentiary hearing before the state bar court,we conclude that aguilar and kent each should be held in contempt,that kent should be fined,that aguilar should be fined,and that aguilar should be referred to the state bar for investigation and,if appropriate,the imposition of additional disciplinary sanctions.code civ,bus.
with regard to kent,we find that he violated his professional obligation to this court by failing,without adequate justification,either to appear for oral argument before this court or to notify this court that he would not be appearing.see code civ,subd.a willful neglect or violation of duty by an attorney and d isobedience of any lawful order of the court.
past california cases that have considered whether an attorney may be held in contempt of court for failure to appear in court establish that when an attorney is aware of an order requiring his or her appearance in court,and the attorney has the ability to appear but knowingly and intentionally does not appear,the attorney has willfully neglected or failed to appear.see,lyons superior court cal d,the commitment order thus establishes that the court concluded that petitioner had the ability to appear punctually at and that his failure or neglect to appear was wilful,with a purpose or willingness to commit the act,or make the omission.italics added.once such willful failure to appear is shown,the propriety of a contempt judgment depends upon the validity or persuasiveness of the attorney excuse or justification for his or her nonappearance.see,lyons,supra,cal d at,arthur superior court cal d,inniss municipal court cal d,in re stanley d.
in this case,contrary to kent claim,the order of this court,filed on january,setting the case of aguilar lerner for oral argument on february,constitutes a sufficiently specific order directing counsel presence before this court at the designated time and place.indeed,kent clearly was aware of this obligation,because on january,he returned the form that the clerk office had sent to him with the supreme court february oral argument calendar,expressly indicating that he would be presenting oral argument on behalf of appellant aguilar on february.although we agree with kent that the law firm of aguilar sebastinelli,by whom kent was employed,rather than kent personally,was the formal attorney of record for appellant aguilar,so that another attorney in the law firm could have appeared at oral argument for appellant aguilar without the need for a formal substitution of counsel,it does not follow that in the absence of such an appearance by another attorney,personally had signed all documents filed in this court on behalf of appellant aguilar and had informed the court that he would be presenting oral argument on february not personally be held in contempt for failing,without adequate justification,either to appear or at least notify the court that he would not be appearing.the question whether kent may and should be held in contempt depends upon an assessment of the validity of kent excuse or justification for failing to appear or notify the court that he would not appear.
in light of the circumstances disclosed by the record in this case,we do not find adequate justification to excuse kent failure to notify this court that he would not be appearing at oral argument.
presentation of oral argument on appeal is an important responsibility for an attorney in any case,not only in light of the duty owed to the client but also because of the attorney professional obligations to the appellate court.as a general rule,this court does not permit parties to waive oral argument in cases before this court,and we,like all other courts,rely upon the presentation of oral argument by attorneys to assist us in reaching an appropriate resolution of the often difficult questions presented in the cases before us.
in this case,kent terminated his employment at aguilar sebastinelli only five days prior to the oral argument scheduled in this court.even if,as kent maintains,his departure from the firm properly can be characterized as a constructive discharge because of the significant reduction in salary and responsibilities that prompted his resignation,kent decision to leave the firm did not automatically terminate his professional responsibilities either to his former client or to this court.for purposes of this contempt proceeding,we need not determine whether kent took adequate steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable prejudice to the rights of his client or former client see rules conduct,rule a,but we do find that,under the circumstances of this case,kent violated his responsibility to this court by failing to notify the court that he would not be appearing at oral argument.
as noted above,on january,just one week prior to his departure from the firm,kent specifically informed this court that he would be appearing for oral argument on behalf of aguilar at the scheduled february oral argument in aguilar lerner.after his departure from the firm on february,kent made no effort to notify this court that he would not be appearing in aguilar lerner because he no longer represented appellant aguilar.the evidence presented in this contempt proceeding makes clear that kent had not been informed that another attorney actually had been assigned to the case and would appear before this court on february in his place and,of course,no such attorney had been assigned to make such an appearance contrary to kent contention,kent would not have prejudiced his client or former client simply by notifying this court that he no longer represented appellant aguilar,and in our view kent could not reasonably have believed that providing such notice to this court would be improper.
accordingly,under the circumstances revealed by the record in this case,we conclude that there was no adequate justification for kent failure to inform the court that he would not appear on february.although kent might have been fortunate enough to avoid any sanction had another attorney been promptly reassigned to the case,been able adequately to prepare for oral argument,and appeared at and presented oral argument on behalf of appellant aguilar,kent can not avoid his share of responsibility for the interference with this court operations that resulted when,without any advance notice,no attorney appeared on behalf of appellant aguilar when the case of aguilar lerner was called for argument before this court on february.
under these circumstances,we find kent in contempt of court for failing,without adequate justification,to notify the court that he would not appear for oral argument,and we conclude that an appropriate sanction for this contempt is a fine of.
with respect to attorney aguilar,we find his derelictions significantly more serious than those of kent.
