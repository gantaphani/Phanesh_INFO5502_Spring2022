plaintiff franchise owners,both individuals and their professional association,independent association of mailbox center owners,iamco,et collectively the franchisees or plaintiffs,brought a complaint raising numerous statutory and common law claims to challenge the conversion of their stores into a new format,the ups store system,created by defendant mail boxes,usa,et.mbe.following trial court rulings that their claims against mbe,their franchisor,must be arbitrated on an individual basis,and not on a classwide or group basis,the franchisees filed this writ petition challenging the denial of their consolidation motion and related rulings that declined to shift all arbitration costs to mbe and imposed a stay as to certain franchisees 
the subject franchise agreements and their arbitration mediation clauses fall into three main groups those governed by the rules of the american arbitration association aaa,covering of the petitioners those governed by the rules of jams judicial arbitration and mediation services,covering petitioners and those governed by mediation clauses rather than any arbitration provisions petitioners,referred to here as the mediation franchisees.the professional association,iamco,has no independent agreement with mbe,but instead is a representative plaintiff here.
as acknowledged by the jams franchisees,their franchise agreements contain an arbitration agreement which has a clause forbidding classwide arbitration.all franchisees claim this provision is unconscionable and unenforceable against the jams group,as well as the aaa and mediation franchisees.their petition challenges several trial court orders granting mbe petition to compel arbitration denying the franchisees motion to consolidate the arbitrations pursuant to code of civil procedure section staying this action as to the mediation franchisees whose franchise agreements do not contain arbitration clauses,and iamco and denying or referring to the arbitrator the requested ruling on fee shifting,that would require mbe to bear the costs of arbitrating the franchisees unwaivable statutory claims.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,armendariz.
the issue of the validity of a provision in an arbitration agreement forbidding classwide arbitration has very recently been addressed by our supreme court in discover bank superior court cal th,d,discover bank,in a factual context dealing with consumer credit card agreements,and under the theory of unconscionability.we will discuss and apply this authority and related recent authorities in this comparable factual context,dealing with different arbitration and mediation clauses in different franchise agreements,and the franchisees request for consolidated arbitration proceedings.
as will be explained,the petition will be denied in part,to uphold the trial court basic order that compelled arbitration.however,we will grant the petition in part,to order the trial court to vacate its order denying the consolidation request and instead to grant a different order as directed,to strike certain unconscionable portions of the arbitration clauses and to lift the stay of the action as to the mediation franchisees and iamco,who were not subject to arbitration and to vacate the order that referred to the arbitrator all issues regarding the statutory claims raised,and to hold appropriate further proceedings on fees allocation.
factual and procedural background 
afranchise agreements and arbitration provisions 
franchisees own and operate postal supply and office services businesses under franchises issued by mbe,which has recently been acquired by united parcel service ups.each of the franchisees signed a franchise agreement with mbe allowing them to use the mbe trade names and trademarks.in general,the aaa versions of the arbitration clause include provisions stating that the parties agreed to submit every claim or dispute arising out of or relating to the negotiation,performance,or of this agreement to arbitration.further,some aaa agreements provide,any monetary controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement or the breach thereof may by mutual agreement be settled by arbitration any disputes shall be submitted to and settled by binding arbitration.
in the jams versions,the resolution of disputes clause typically provides for arbitration of every controversy,claim or dispute arising out of or in connection with the negotiation,performance or of this agreement,including,without limitation,any alleged torts claims regarding the validity,scope,and enforceability of this section 
both types of arbitration clauses contain a choice of laws provision stating that the agreements shall be construed under and be governed by california law.
in the aaa version of the arbitration clause,mbe reserved for itself the right to proceed in court to seek appropriate remedies such as damages,injunctive relief,or foreclosure.however,the franchisees were restricted to arbitration to resolve any claim or dispute arising out of the agreement,including torts or the validity of the arbitration clause.similarly,the jams versions also provide for mbe to have access to the courts,while franchisees are referred to arbitration proceedings.
in contrast,in the seven franchise agreements that require mediation and do not include an arbitration clause,the parties agreed,before either party may initiate any suit or action against the other,the parties pledge to attempt first to resolve the controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the franchise agreement dispute pursuant to mediation.
these franchise agreements contained two basic versions of the arbitration clauses at issue here,regarding the number of participants in the arbitration.in the jams version,it includes a ban on group or class actions,stating 
it is the intent of the parties that any arbitration between mbe and franchisee shall be limited to the individual claims of either party and that no claim of any other party shall be subject to arbitration in such proceeding on any basis whatsoever,whether by consolidation,by class or representative principles,or otherwise.
the aaa version does not include any such reference to group or class arbitration proceedings.it generally refers to the parties as being bound to attempt to resolve the matter through good faith efforts,with an arbitration demand to follow if the parties were unable to resolve the dispute.
in these writ proceedings,the parties also dispute the validity of the aaa arbitration agreement that provides,in pertinent part,the arbitrator shall have no power or authority to award punitive,consequential or incidental damages.the jams provision has a similar limitation on available remedies,to restrict the arbitrator from awarding punitive damages,lost wages profits,attorney fees costs,and also specifies that,in no event shall any monetary damages be recovered by a franchisee in excess of the amount of the franchise fee and the costs of building out the mbe center.
complaint mbe motion to compel franchisees request for fees order 
after ups acquired mbe,these franchisees filed their complaint in july to challenge mbe business practices,regarding the change of its franchise system from mail boxes to the ups store system.plaintiffs alleged that this conduct violated corporations code section et the california franchise investment law section et,of the business and professions code the cartwright act civil code section et the uniform trade secrets act and section et of the business and professions code the unfair competition law.plaintiffs further alleged common law claims for breach of contract,interference with contractual rights and prospective economic advantage,and defamation.the relief sought included compensatory and punitive damages,injunctive relief regarding unfair trade practices,and statutory relief for restitution,disgorgement of illegal gains,and statutory penalties under the unfair competition law.
in august,mbe moved to compel arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clauses in the aaa and franchise agreements.in their opposition and in supplemental briefing permitted by the trial court,franchisees sought a ruling to order fee shifting to require mbe to bear the costs of arbitrating franchisees statutory claims relying on armendariz,supra,cal th,d.
after oral argument,the trial court confirmed its ruling of november,granting the mbe petition to compel arbitration and staying this action,for days so that the arbitrations and mediations may be completed.this action is stayed to avoid the possibility of inconsistent findings on common issues of law and fact.the trial court found,with regard to the stay 
the fact that some of the defendants are to the franchise agreements does not preclude arbitration mediation.plaintiffs claims against the defendants arise from the franchise agreements and are intertwined with the arbitrable and mediation claims against the signatory defendants.
the ruling on the motion to compel further found that the arbitration and mediation clauses were not procedurally or substantively unconscionable in that respect,there is no evidence that the plaintiffs unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate the arbitration and mediation terms of the franchise agreements there is no evidence that the franchise agreements were difficult to read there is no showing that the plaintiffs lacked sophistication such that they did not understand the terms of the franchise agreements there is no showing that the plaintiffs lacked comparable business opportunities and there is no showing that plaintiffs financial circumstances make s it impossible for them to afford arbitration or mediation of their claims.
the combined rulings on the motion to compel further included the trial court statement that it declined to allocate the costs of arbitration,and instead referred that matter to the arbitrators.
proceedings in arbitration franchisees motion to consolidate 
following the court order to arbitrate,franchisees filed two group arbitration claims in early february of,one with the aaa franchisees and one with jams.after mbe objected,the aaa decided as an aaa administrative matter that it would not proceed with a group arbitration demand and did not appoint an arbitrator to decide the group issue.the aaa cited its commercial arbitration rule which does not expressly address group arbitration procedures 
in the jams group of franchisees,jams appointed an arbitrator,retired judge keith wisot,to decide the group issue.however,he declined to administer a group arbitration,on the basis that the jams arbitration clause expressly barred group or class arbitration.
following these denials of the group arbitration requests,franchisees filed their motion to consolidate arbitrations under section.they made a statutory showing that there were separate arbitration agreements,these disputes arose from the same facts or series of related transactions,and there were common issues of law or fact.franchisees argued,inter alia,that the ban on classwide arbitration was unconscionable because it would lead to costly and duplicative proceedings that they could not afford,and because the available relief prescribed under the clause was unduly limited.
in mbe opposition,it argued that such consolidation would deprive mbe of certain vested contractual rights,such as the jams contractual bar on classwide arbitration.the mbe opposition also stated,in fact,if the court has any inclination to consolidate any of the arbitration actions,defendants withdraw any request for arbitration and ask that consolidation occur only in court.defendants would never have exercised their right to seek arbitration of the arbitrable claims if they had believed that consolidation in any effective right to occur.the motion to consolidate was denied,with the trial court explaining only that defendants opposition is dispositive.
this petition followed,alleging the remedy of appeal was inadequate.
discussion 
iissues presented 
franchisees petition for a writ of mandate seeks review of the trial court orders on an expedited basis,because the essential facts are undisputed,the subject order could unduly limit the scope of the arbitration proceedings under a potentially unconscionable no class action provision,and the issue could otherwise effectively evade appellate review.szetela discover bank th,d.we agree with franchisees that review of the subject trial court orders is appropriate at this point.where the material facts are not in dispute,an appellate court may decide the enforceability of an arbitration clause de novo.norcal mutual ins.newton th,d.one important public policy reason for allowing class actions is to promote judicial economy and streamline the litigation process in appropriate cases,involving common issues of law and fact,and this policy is also evidently promoted through an arbitration forum.szetela,supra,th at,d.to allow appropriate consideration to these policies,we have issued an order to show cause osc,obtained further briefing on the discover bank authority discover bank,supra,cal th,d,and heard oral argument under these unusual circumstances,writ relief is proper.atlas plastering,superior court d.
we first outline the scope of the issues presented and our approach to them.initially,we take note that mbe petition to compel arbitration was granted in december,but this petition for writ relief was filed almost a year later,after the franchisees consolidation requests were denied.although the franchisees nominally seek to have the motion to compel arbitration order vacated,they admit that they have significantly complied with it by initiating and pursuing arbitration proceedings,and that the orders to compel and denying their request did not become entirely objectionable to them until their consolidation request was denied.accordingly,their true focus is now upon the trial court denial of the motion to consolidate the arbitrations,in view of the different arbitration provisions involved,and the trial court rejection of their unconscionability arguments,the stay of action ordered for those mediation franchisees not subject to arbitration,and finally,the unsuccessful request they made in opposition to the motion to compel,to achieve a ruling on fee shifting,to vindicate their unwaivable statutory claims.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.
under these circumstances,we decline to disturb the underlying order granting the petitions to compel arbitration as to the aaa and jams group,as it is well grounded in the record and in applicable law.however,we will next consider the requests for writ relief regarding consolidation,and regarding the other portions of the arbitration agreement that are challenged here as unconscionable the limitation on available remedies and the availability of court relief to the franchisor only.we then address the trial court stay of the mediation franchisees claims,and its referral to the arbitrator of the request for fee shifting of the statutory claims,as outlined above.
unconscionability issues consolidation and limitations on remediesaapplicable standards unconscionability 
before we can address franchisees arguments these mandatory arbitration provisions contained in their franchise agreements were unconscionable in these respects and therefore unenforceable,we must clarify our terms and set forth the applicable standards on the respective roles of the trial court and the arbitrator in enforcing the terms of the arbitration clause,where issues of unconscionability are raised.in general,it is left to an arbitrator to construe the meaning and extent of the arbitration agreement between the parties.witkin,cal.procedure ed.proceedings without trial.however,it is for the courts to decide questions of arbitrability,which include whether the parties are bound by a given arbitration clause,or whether it is unenforceable as unconscionable.knight,et,cal.practice guide alternative dispute resolution the rutter group,citing green tree financial bazzle,d bazzle.a trial court determination of the validity of an agreement to arbitrate will be reviewed de novo on appeal,where there was no conflict in the extrinsic evidence provided to the trial court.eisenberg,et,cal.practice guide,civil appeals and writs the rutter group,citing cpi builders,impco technologies,th,d.
the doctrine of unconscionability is a judicially created doctrine which was codified in when the legislature enacted civil code section.citation.while the statute does not attempt to precisely define unconscionable,there is a large body of case law recognizing the term has both a procedural and a substantive element,both of which must be present to render a contract unenforceable.citation.the procedural element focuses on the unequal bargaining positions and hidden terms common in the context of adhesion contracts.citation.while courts have defined the substantive element in various ways,it traditionally involves contract terms that are so as to shock the conscience,or that impose harsh or oppressive terms.citation.citation.bolter superior court th,d bolter.
case law has recognized that franchise agreements can have some characteristics of contracts of adhesion.postal instant press,sealy th,d.there is a clear disparity in the bargaining power of franchisors versus franchisees.ibid.the supreme court recognized that fact in keating superior court cal d,keating overruled on other grounds in southland keating,d,which arose out of a dispute over franchise agreements.discover bank,supra,cal th at,d.the term contract of adhesion signifies a standardized contract,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.citation.bolter,supra,th,d,citing armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.additionally,a claim of unconscionability often can not be determined merely by examining the face of a contract,but will require inquiry into its commercial setting,purpose,and effect.citation.bolter,supra,at,d.franchise agreements are not per se unenforceable,but their provisions can be examined to see if the characteristics of unconscionability are present in part or in whole.bolter,supra,at,d,citing,subd.a.
as set forth by the supreme court in discover bank,it is in both federal and state law dealing with arbitration that courts should be left to decide certain gateway matters bazzle,supra at.plur.opn.of breyer,or fundamental matters such as the validity and scope of the arbitration agreement,at.dis.opn.of rehnquist.under california law,the question whether grounds exist for the revocation of the arbitration agreement code civ,based on grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract,is for the courts to decide,not an arbitrator.citations.this includes the determination of whether arbitration agreements or portions thereof are deemed to be unconscionable or contrary to public policy.citations.discover bank,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
however,also as clarified in discover bank,supra,cal th,d,the united states supreme court did not address in bazzle,supra,d,the question of whether a decision about the propriety of classwide arbitration should have been made by a court or an arbitrator under an agreement silent on the subject.the united states supreme court did not have to do so because the state court system in that case had made that decision to allow it,which was correct,such that even if that decision should properly have been left to the arbitrator,there was no use in sending it back for redetermination.id.at.conc.dis.opn.of stevens,as cited in discover bank,supra,cal th at,d.
discover bank further held,under california law,as discussed,class arbitration may be authorized,even when a contract of adhesion forbids it,because a class arbitration waiver may be unconscionable.bazzle does not call into question the principle that state courts may enforce general contract rules regarding unconscionability and public policy that preclude class action waivers.discover bank,supra,cal th at,d.
under these authorities,we believe that the franchisees requests regarding the jams agreement ban on consolidation,and regarding the other significant portions of the arbitration agreement the limitation on available remedies and the availability of court relief to the franchisor only should properly be considered to be the type of gateway matters that have to do with the validity and binding nature of the given arbitration clauses,under the theory of unconscionability.we must determine de novo whether those rulings by the trial court were correct.
ban on group arbitration 
section provides in pertinent part that a superior court may order consolidation of separate arbitration proceedings where separate arbitration agreements or proceedings exist between the same parties or one party is a party to a separate arbitration agreement or proceeding with a third party and the disputes arise from the same transactions or series of related transactions and there is common issue or issues or law or fact creating the possibility of conflicting rulings by more than one arbitrator or panel of arbitrators.the statute further provides for the trial court to make legal rulings and to exercise its discretion as follows 
in the event that the arbitration agreements in consolidated proceedings contain inconsistent provisions,the court shall resolve such conflicts and determine the rights and duties of the various parties to achieve substantial justice under all the circumstances.the court may exercise its discretion under this section to deny consolidation of separate arbitration proceedings or to consolidate separate arbitration proceedings only as to certain issues,leaving other issues to be resolved in separate proceedings.
as recognized and confirmed in discover bank,supra,cal th,d,classwide arbitration is well accepted under california law as workable and appropriate in some cases.id.at,d,citing keating,supra,cal d.in discover bank,the supreme court applied these rules in the consumer litigation context,stating,u nder some circumstances,the law in california is that class action waivers in consumer contracts of adhesion are unenforceable,whether the consumer is being asked to waive the right to class action litigation or the right to classwide arbitration.discover bank,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court further found there was no faa federal arbitration act,et preemption of california law in this respect.discover bank,supra,cal th at,d,also see blue cross of california superior court th,d trial court can order classwide arbitration under california law even though arbitration agreement is silent as to classwide arbitration also see garcia directv,th,d.
as set out in discover bank,when the question of whether a class action arbitration is available depends on whether or not the arbitration agreement is silent on the matter or expressly forbids class action arbitration,then it is up to the arbitrator,not the court,to determine whether the arbitration agreement is in fact silent.discover bank,supra,cal th at,d.
this factual context involves different arbitration and mediation clauses found in different franchise agreements,with respect to the specification of the allowable number of participants in the arbitration.in particular,the jams version in this case includes a ban on group or class actions,stating it is the intent of the parties that any arbitration between mbe and franchisee shall be limited to the individual claims of either party and that no claim of any other party shall be subject to arbitration in such proceeding on any basis whatsoever,whether by consolidation,by class or representative principles,or otherwise.in contrast,the aaa version is silent on any such issue of group or class arbitrations.
we have already mentioned that franchise agreements,in some cases,have the same qualities of adhesion contracts as do certain consumer contracts,such as were discussed in discover bank,supra,cal th,d,with regard to the availability of group arbitration.these franchise agreements also resemble employment agreements to the extent that the franchisees livelihoods are involved and subject to contractual arbitration for dispute resolution,although those clauses are not statutory in nature.here,the trial court flatly rejected the unconscionability argument,stating in that respect,there is no evidence that the plaintiffs unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate the arbitration and mediation terms of the franchise agreements there is no evidence that the franchise agreements were difficult to read there is no showing that the plaintiffs lacked sophistication such that they did not understand the terms of the franchise agreements there is no showing that the plaintiffs lacked comparable business opportunities however,these findings beg the question of whether the nature of these franchise agreements and the business relationship between the parties fell within accepted criteria for adhesion contracts,particularly as to this prohibition in one of the clauses of group arbitration jams,and its broad application to the other groups aaa and mediation franchisees.we find the trial court ruling substantively incorrect because it disregarded applicable law concerning adhesion contracts in the franchise situation,where broad statutory arguments implicating the public interest are raised.
in any case,under section,the trial court had the duty and the discretion to resolve conflicts between any inconsistent provisions in the two sets of arbitration agreements,in order to achieve substantial justice under all the circumstances.the court may exercise its discretion under this section to deny consolidation of separate arbitration proceedings or to consolidate separate arbitration proceedings only as to certain issues,leaving other issues to be resolved in separate proceedings.in this case,the trial court erred in deeming the jams arbitration clause to be controlling over the aaa arbitration clauses,to the extent that it banned group arbitration proceedings.the trial court also erred in essentially allowing the aaa arbitration administrative proceedings to decline to decide or issue any ruling on the group arbitration request,without at least referring the matter to an arbitrator.as a matter of interpretation of the validity of the arbitration agreement,the trial court had the duty and the discretion to construe the two agreements together and to make an appropriate order regarding consolidation.
for the reasons outlined in discover bank,supra,cal th,d,and bazzle,supra,group arbitration can be a valid means of dispute resolution where the statutory and case law criteria for consolidation are satisfied.here,the franchisees made an adequate showing under section that there were common issues of law and fact and that group arbitration would be a preferred means of dispute resolution.the trial court should have accepted that showing,in light of the policies outlined in keating,supra,cal d,and it was error not to strike the ban on group arbitration from the jams agreement on this record.we are aware that difficult questions still remain regarding separating out the common issues of law and fact,particularly the statutory claims,from the individualized common law issues regarding the contractual and tort claims,as we next discuss.
limitation of available remedies in arbitration 
franchisees next dispute the validity of the portions of the jams and aaa arbitration agreements purporting to restrict an arbitrator from having any power or authority to award punitive,consequential,or incidental damages,aaa version or restricting the arbitrator from awarding punitive damages,lost wages profits,attorney fees costs,and specifying that,in no event shall any monetary damages be recovered by a franchisee in excess of the amount of the franchise fee and the cost of building out the mbe center jams version.additionally,franchisees make arguments that these provisions are unconscionable to the extent that they allow mbe to obtain court relief in injunction or damages,while franchisees are limited to seeking arbitration.
as alleged by the complaint,franchisees are seeking to show that mbe violated corporations code section et the california franchise investment law business and professions code section et the cartwright act civil code section et the uniform trade secrets act and business and professions code section et the unfair competition law.the relief sought includes compensatory and punitive damages,as authorized by statute,as well as injunctive relief regarding unfair trade practices,and other statutory relief for restitution,disgorgement of illegal gains,and statutory penalties available under the unfair competition law.
the nature of the claims presented in the relief sought portion of the complaint again raises the issue of whether classwide arbitration is workable and appropriate to resolve both the common issues,such as the statutory claims,as well as the individualized contract and tort claims.discover bank,supra,cal th at,d.we have already outlined above that insofar as the arbitration clause contains an unconscionable ban on group arbitration,it is not valid and enforceable.however,where,as here,the arbitration agreements are broad in terms of the scope of the questions submitted to arbitration,the arbitrators will have the authority to make additional contract interpretations,as guided by the trial court validity rulings,and to decide matters of arbitration procedure,according to the teaching of the united states supreme court in bazzle,supra.yuen superior court th,d.t he court decides whether the matter should be referred to arbitration,but once a matter has been referred to arbitration,the court involvement is strictly limited until the arbitration is completed.citation.ibid.under the aaa commercial arbitration rules.scope of award a the arbitrator may grant any remedy or relief that the arbitrator deems just and equitable and within the scope of the agreement of the parties,including,but not limited to,specific performance of a contract as of.this may include rulings on both statutory and contractual claims,as we next explain.
this approach is supported by the language of the california supreme court in broughton cigna healthplans of california cal th,d.there,the court made the general observation that the purpose of arbitration is to voluntarily resolve private disputes in an expeditious and efficient manner.citations.parties to arbitration voluntarily trade the formal procedures and the opportunity for greater discovery and appellate review for the simplicity,informality,and expedition of arbitration.citation.ibid.nevertheless,it is well accepted that an arbitrator can,within the scope of the particular arbitration agreement,resolve statutory claims as well as those purely contractual if the parties so intend,and that in doing so,the parties do not forego substantive rights,but merely agree to resolve them in a different forum.citations.broughton,supra,cal th,d.
it is not within the scope of these writ proceedings to decide the availability of the substantive relief requested under these various remedial statutory schemes,including punitive or compensatory damages or other relief.however,we are able to say at this point that to the extent the arbitration clauses purport to deny the arbitrators the ability to award full relief according to the merits of the respective showings,the arbitration clauses run contrary to statute and are unduly restrictive,possibly amounting to unconscionable waivers of statutory rights.the arbitration agreements should not be interpreted as written to deprive the arbitrators of authority to award punitive,consequential,or incidental damages,such as lost wages profits,or attorney fees costs,to the extent these would otherwise be available under the substantive causes of action asserted.to the extent that the arbitration clauses in this respect seek to deprive plaintiffs of statutorily authorized remedies,or relief in court that would otherwise be allowable to them,they are unconscionable,and the trial court should have stricken them from the arbitration clause.the petition for writ of mandate will be granted to this extent as well.
stay of the mediation franchisees claims 
the mediation franchisees agreements do not include an arbitration clause,instead providing before either party may initiate any suit or action against the other,the parties pledge to attempt first to resolve the controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the franchise agreement dispute pursuant to mediation.the trial court ruling stat
