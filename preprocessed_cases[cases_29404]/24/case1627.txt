ii.background 
plaintiff signed three nearly identical arbitration agreements while employed by defendant.the most recent of the three stated as follows i agree that any claim,dispute,or controversy including,but not limited to,any and all claims of discrimination and harassment which would otherwise require or allow resort to any court or other governmental dispute resolution forum between myself and the company or its owners,directors,and officers,and parties affiliated with its employee benefit and health plans arising from,related to,or having any relationship or connection whatsoever with my seeking employment with,employment by,or other association with,the company,whether based on tort,contract,statutory,or equitable law,or otherwise,shall be submitted to and determined exclusively by binding arbitration under the federal arbitration act,in conformity with the procedures of the california arbitration act civ.proc.sec et,including section and all of the act other mandatory and permissive rights to discovery provided,however,that in addition to requirements imposed by law,any arbitrator herein shall be a retired california superior court judge and shall be subject to disqualification on the same grounds as would apply to a judge of such court.to the extent applicable in civil actions in california courts,the following shall apply and be observed all rules of pleading including the right of demurrer,all rules of evidence,all rights to resolution of the dispute by means of motions for summary judgment,judgment on the pleadings,and judgment under code of civil procedure section.resolution of the dispute shall be based solely upon the law governing the claims and defenses pleaded,and the arbitrator may not invoke any basis other than such controlling law,including but not limited to,notions of just cause.as reasonably required to allow full use and benefit of this agreement modifications to the act procedures,the arbitration shall extend the times set by the act for the giving of notices and setting of hearings.awards exceeding shall include the arbitrator written reasoned opinion and,at either party written request within days after issuance of the award,shall be subject to reversal and remand,modification,or reduction following review of the record and arguments of the parties by a second arbitrator who shall,as far as practicable,proceed according to the law and procedures applicable to appellate review by the california court of appeal of a civil judgment following court trial.i understand by agreeing to this binding arbitration provision,both i and the company give up our rights to trial by jury.
plaintiff filed an action against defendant alleging he was demoted and subsequently terminated after he reported that certain employees were engaging in warranty fraud.plaintiff causes of action were for tortious demotion in violation of public policy tortious termination in violation of public policy breach of an implied contract of continued employment and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.in the first through third causes of action,plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages.in the fourth cause of action,plaintiff sought only contract breach damages.plaintiff sought no relief under the fair employment and housing act feha,et.
defendant initial motion to compel arbitration was granted.following the supreme court decision in armendariz,the trial court,upon plaintiff request for reconsideration,denied defendant motion to compel arbitration.the trial court ruled the court believes that the arbitration clause in issue does not meet the standards set forth by the supreme court and it should not be enforced.the clauses of the arbitration agreement that do not comport with the requirements of the armendariz decision include the clauses that.require the plaintiff to share the costs.provide for no judicial review.the court deems this fatal,as judicial review of all decisions is not the same as limited review by another arbitrator of only certain awards.limit the remedies available to the complaintant sic to possibly exclude equitable as opposed to legal remedies,to which he might otherwise be entitled.lack of mutuality of remedy,in that this clause,unlike the one in armendariz does not obviously bind the employer to likewise enforce its right in the arbitration forum.defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.
