discussion 
arbitrability of claims for injunctive relief.
in enacting of the federal arbitration act congress declared a national policy favoring arbitration and withdrew the power of the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration.southland keating,d.the united states supreme court has repeatedly made clear that arbitration may resolve statutory claims as well as those purely contractual if the parties so intend,and that in doing so,the parties do not forego substantive rights,but merely agree to resolve them in a different forum.citations.broughton cigna healthplans cal th,d.hereafter broughton.however,that is not to say that all controversies implicating statutory rights are suitable for arbitration.mitsubishi motors soler,d hereafter mitsubishi.for example,the united states supreme court recognizes an inherent conflict exception to the arbitrability of federal statutory claims.citation.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.that is,if congress intended to prohibit waiver of a judicial forum for a particular statutory claim,such an intent will be deducible from an inherent conflict between arbitration and the statute underlying purposes.express,mcmahon,d.
in broughton,supra,cal th at page,d,our supreme court recognized that the united states supreme court inherent conflict cases all concerned federal statutory claims,and thus the inquiry was into the congressional intent behind those statutes.but although the court has stated generally that the capacity to withdraw statutory rights from the scope of arbitration agreements is the prerogative solely of congress,not state courts or legislatures citation,it has never directly decided whether a legislature may restrict a private arbitration agreement when it inherently conflicts with a public statutory purpose that transcends private interests.ibid.accordingly,the broughton court asked whether there is an inherent conflict between arbitration and the statute at issue there,california consumer legal remedies act id.at,d,and concluded that such a conflict does exist,under certain circumstances,between arbitration and the clra injunctive relief provision,subd.a.specifically,the court held that where a clra plaintiff functions as a private attorney general,seeking to enjoin future deceptive practices on behalf of the general public,arbitration is not a suitable forum,and the legislature did not intend this type of injunctive relief to be arbitrated.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.furthermore,congress did not contemplate faa enforcement of public injunction arbitration.id.at,d.two factors,taken together,convinced the broughton court of the inherent conflict between arbitration and the underlying purpose of the clra injunctive relief remedy first,the relief is for the benefit of the general public rather than the party bringing the action,and second,the judicial forum has significant institutional advantages over arbitration in administering a public injunctive remedy.cal th at,d.
the broughton rationale has since been extended to claims for injunctive relief brought under business and professions code section groom health net th,d hereafter groom,coast plaza doctors hospital blue cross of california th,d hereafter coast plaza,health net th,d hereafter,and pacificare does not dispute that it extends to section injunctive claims as well.
in this case,the trial court ruled that all cruz claims for injunctive relief were inarbitrable under broughton and coast plaza.on appeal,pacificare contends that broughton has been abrogated by the recent united states supreme court opinion in green tree financial.randolph,d hereafter randolph.in that case,the court held that an arbitration agreement silence with respect to payment of arbitration expenses,challenged under the truth in lending act and the equal credit opportunity act,did not render it unenforceable,because the plaintiff had not met her burden of establishing the likelihood that prohibitive arbitration costs would undermine her ability to vindicate her statutory rights.thus,the randolph court considered and resolved an issue entirely different from the one raised here and in broughton.but pacificare focuses on the randolph court general statement,in determining whether statutory claims may be arbitrated,we first ask whether the parties agreed to submit their claims to arbitration,and then ask whether congress has evinced an intention to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory rights at issue.citations.randolph,supra,at,italics added see also,at.at.
as indicated by the randolph court citation to gilmer lane,d hereafter gilmer,and mitsubishi,supra,at page.and as pacificare expressly acknowledges,the quoted language does not constitute a new rule of law,but rather reiterates the established rule from which the broughton court began its analysis.see,broughton,supra,cal th at,d,citing gilmer,mitsubishi,and the congressional intent rule.the high court,once again considering federal statutory claims,did nothing in randolph to abrogate either its own inherent conflict method for determining congressional intent,nor the broughton court application of that rationale to state statutory claims.nordlinger lynch d.california courts bound by state supreme court rejection of federal constitutional challenges to state law absent subsequent united states supreme court decision directly on point.
the trial court properly determined that cruz claims for public injunctive relief are inarbitrable under broughton.
arbitrability of equitable monetary relief.
in addition to injunctive relief,cruz requested disgorgement bus,restitution,subd.a,and disgorgement,restitution,refund,or reimbursement,as a remedy for alleged unjust enrichment while statutory damages claims are fully arbitrable broughton,supra,cal th at,d,the trial court found cruz claims for equitable monetary relief were not.
the clra expressly distinguishes between damages and restitution,subds.a.by their terms,business and professions code sections and provide for restoration of money acquired by unfair competition false advertising,but damages are not available under either section.cortez purolator air filtration products cal th,d.what is properly sought in a claim labeled unjust enrichment is restitution.lauriedale associates,wilson th,d.the trial court found the distinction between damages and restitution determinative,but pacificare maintains that under broughton and its progeny,all claims except those for public interest injunctive relief are arbitrable,that is,only requests for public injunctions are exempt from arbitration.pacificare reads too much into the broughton line of cases.
the broughton plaintiffs sought medical malpractice damages and,under the clra,both damages and an injunction.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.the court held that the injunctive relief portion of a clra claim is inarbitrable,but an action for damages under the clra is fully arbitrable broughton,supra,cal th at,d,see also
