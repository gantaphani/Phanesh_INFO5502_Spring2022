this case involves a labor dispute between the washington metropolitan area transit authority wmata and the fraternal order of police fop.the dispute arose after wmata fired two of its police officers,reinstated them pursuant to arbitration awards,and then fired the officers a second time after maryland declined to recertify them as police officers in that state.the district court granted the fop motion for summary judgment and ordered wmata to reinstate the two officers.for the reasons that follow,we reverse.
wmata,an interstate agency,operates the metrorail and metrobus systems in washington,maryland,and virginia under a compact agreed to by those jurisdictions.the compact authorizes wmata to employ a police force,the metro transit police department mtpd,whose officers enforce the laws of the compact jurisdictions on the metro system.the fop is the bargaining agent for mtpd officers and therefore a party to the officers collective bargaining agreement with wmata.the agreement permits wmata to discipline officers only for just cause and outlines a grievance procedure for resolving labor disputes,culminating in arbitration.
in,wmata fired two mtpd officers,mark spencer and sherman benton collectively the officers.wmata discharged officer spencer for allegedly striking a passenger with his baton and for being untruthful during the subsequent investigation.wmata fired officer benton in the wake of an alleged physical altercation with a female companion in atlantic city wmata determined that he had made false statements during the investigation of the incident and had engaged in conduct that discredited himself and the mtpd.
in response to these terminations,the fop filed grievances on behalf of the officers.both cases reached arbitration,and,in,the board of arbitration overturned both discharges.although the board found that wmata had legitimate grounds for disciplining the officers,the board concluded that lengthy suspension,not termination,was the appropriate remedy.it ordered wmata to reinstate the officers after their respective suspensions.
as a result of their initial terminations,however,the officers had lost their certifications to serve as police officers in maryland.under maryland law,a police officer must be certified in order to exercise law enforcement powers within the state.regs.b.if an officer loses his certification,he must apply for recertification from the maryland police training commission wmata compact mandates that mtpd officers shall have the same powers and shall be subject to the same limitations as a member of the duly constituted police force of the political subdivisions in which wmata operates.wmata compact b.the officers therefore needed to apply for recertification from the maryland commission in order to resume police activities for wmata in maryland.
beginning in april officer spencer and may officer benton of,wmata placed the officers on paid administrative leave while they sought recertification.as part of the recertification process,maryland law required the mtpd to send the maryland commission various materials,including any derogatory information discovered during the investigation that led to the firing of the officers.regs.d.michael taborn,who was then chief of the mtpd,wrote letters to the maryland commission stating,in no uncertain terms,that the mtpd did not favor recertification of the officers.the record suggests this is the first time that the mtpd has lobbied against recertification in the wake of an arbitration decision ordering an officer reinstatement.the maryland commission denied officer spencer request for recertification in july it denied officer benton request in august and subsequently denied his appeal in october.neither officer sought review of the commission decisions in state court.wmata then discharged the officers for a second time.
following these second terminations,the fop filed grievances on behalf of the officers.officer spencer grievance was denied at each of the first three steps of the process outlined in the collective bargaining agreement,and the fop did not request arbitration.officer benton grievance was denied at the first step of the process,and the fop did not appeal it further.the record does not reveal why the fop did not continue with the grievance process on behalf of the officers.
at some point after the maryland commission decisions,the fop did raise the issue of officer benton lack of recertification with the same board of arbitration panel that had ordered his reinstatement the board concluded that it was not within its jurisdiction to determine whether the grievant meets the requirements to return to work as a wmata transit police officer.at oral argument before us,the fop acknowledged that it did not challenge this determination.
instead,the fop filed this action in federal court on behalf of each officer,alleging that wmata failed to comply with the arbitration awards,in violation of both the wmata compact and the collective bargaining agreement.the parties filed for summary judgment the district court granted the fop motion and denied wmata.
finding no defect in the arbitration awards,and no evidence that the awards were contrary to law or public policy,the district court concluded that wmata failed to carry the heavy burden necessary to displace the presumption that arbitral awards are to be enforced as written.fraternal order of police metro transit police labor,wmata,wl,at.june,summ.op.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.accordingly,the court held that wmata breached both the collective bargaining agreement and the compact by failing to comply with the decisions of the arbitration board.id.at.the court ordered wmata to reinstate benton and spencer as metro transit police officers and awarded them back pay and benefits the court subsequently denied wmata motion for reconsideration.fraternal order of police metro transit police labor,wmata,wl,at e.wmata then noted this timely appeal.
wmata advances several arguments on appeal,but its principal contention is that the district court erred in holding that it failed to comply with the board of arbitration awards.wmata maintains that it complied with the awards by placing the officers on paid administrative leave pending their recertification.it further contends that,in an action seeking to enforce the arbitration awards,the fop can not challenge the officers second terminations,those resulting from the maryland commission denial of recertification.instead,wmata argues,the fop needed to use the grievance procedure outlined in the collective bargaining agreement to contest the second terminations.we agree.
we review a district court decision to grant summary judgment de novo,and we view all facts and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.t mobile ne.llc city council of newport news,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.under the federal common law of arbitration,which applies to labor disputes involving wmata,a court can decline to enforce an arbitration award only on narrow grounds.see office prof l emps.int l union,local wmata,we need not examine any of those grounds here,however,because the question in this case is not whether the arbitration awards are valid the parties do not dispute that the board of arbitration had the power to order wmata to reinstate the discharged officers and that the awards were valid when issued.rather,the question is whether wmata complied with the awards.
the fop recognizes that wmata initially complied with the arbitration awards.for,at oral argument before us and before the district court,the fop acknowledged that placing the officers on paid administrative leave constituted at least temporary reinstatement.the question,then,is whether terminating the officers after the maryland commission denied recertification constitutes with the arbitration awards.
neither the parties nor the district court cite any legal authority that speaks directly to this question.two of our sister circuits,however,have decided cases with similar procedural histories,where an employee has been terminated,ordered reinstated by an a
