in this case,plaintiffs sued defendant cellular telephone company alleging that its arbitration agreement and other remedial provisions were unconscionable,although plaintiffs did not otherwise allege that these provisions had been enforced against them or caused them damage.there are two questions before us.first,whether under these circumstances,a plaintiff may obtain injunctive relief to compel the removal of the allegedly unconscionable provisions under the california consumer legal remedies act clra,et.second,whether a plaintiff may obtain declaratory relief pursuant to code of civil procedure section to declare these provisions unlawful and unenforceable.
we conclude that a plaintiff has no standing to sue under the clra without some allegation that he or she has been damaged by an alleged unlawful practice,an allegation plaintiffs do not sufficiently make here.moreover,we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that declaratory relief was not appropriate under these circumstances.we therefore uphold the court of appeal judgment affirming the trial court order sustaining a demurrer to plaintiffs complaint.
facts and procedural history 
the facts,taken largely from the court of appeal opinion,are not in dispute.susanne ball sued sprint spectrum sprint on may,on behalf of the general public,for violating the unfair competition law ucl bus,et.following the enactment of proposition,the complaint was amended ball,who was not a sprint customer,withdrew from the litigation,and meyer and phillips were substituted as plaintiffs.
after three more amendments of the complaint,two in response to the trial court sustaining a demurrer with leave to amend,plaintiffs filed a fourth amended complaint,which alleged three causes of action violation of the ucl violation of the clra and for declaratory relief.the basis for each cause of action was plaintiffs claim that certain provisions of sprint customer service agreement were unconscionable and illegal because they required that the parties to submit disputes under the customer service agreement to binding arbitration pursuant to the rules of judicial arbitration and mediation services,national arbitration forum,or an organization chosen by the parties waived the right to resolve disputes through a jury trial waived class action in arbitration failed to provide for discovery before arbitration split the cost of arbitration disclaimed warranties and limited liability permitted sprint to unilaterally change the terms of the customer service agreement imposed a limitation period for initiating billing disputes and imposed a fee.
sprint demurred to the fourth amended complaint,arguing plaintiffs lacked standing to assert any of the alleged causes of action.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.it concluded that p laintiffs have not shown they were personally damaged or that the allegedly unconscionable or illegal provisions have been enforced against them.plaintiffs did not request leave to amend from the trial court.
the court of appeal affirmed the trial court,holding that plaintiffs could not demonstrate an injury in fact,which is a prerequisite to asserting a claim under the ucl without any showing of damage,plaintiffs had no standing to sue under the clra and plaintiffs had alleged no actual controversy between them and sprint,and that therefore declaratory relief was not available.plaintiffs sought review in this court of the second and third issues only,and we granted review.
ii.discussion 
does the clra require a showing of damages in order to demonstrate standing 
the clra makes unlawful,in civil code section,subdivision a,all undesignated statutory cites are to the civil code various unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer.these include,most pertinently to the present case,r epresenting that a transaction confers or involves rights,remedies,or obligations which it does not have or involve,or which are prohibited by law,subd.a and i nserting an unconscionable provision in the contract,subd.a.plaintiffs contend that with various unconscionable provisions in the arbitration agreement and various other unlawful restrictions on remedies and penalties,sprint violated the clra and may be enjoined from including such provisions in its customer services agreement.
plaintiffs do not allege that there was any dispute between them and sprint that necessitated resort to arbitration or to the other remedial provisions.rather,theirs can be characterized as a preemptive lawsuit to strike these terms should any dispute arise.the question is whether the clra gives standing to permit such preemptive suits.
this question is one of statutory interpretation.when a court attempts to discern the meaning of a statute,it is well settled that we must look first to the words of the statute,because they generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous our inquiry ends.if there is no ambiguity in the language,we presume the legislature meant what it said and the plain meaning of the statute governs.citations.in reading statutes,we are mindful that words are to be given their plain and commonsense meaning.murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th,d.
sprint contends that plaintiffs do not have standing,relying on the plain language of section,subdivision a hereafter section a,which states any consumer who suffers any damage as a result of the use or employment by any person of a method,act,or practice declared to be unlawful by section may bring an action against that person to recover or obtain any of the following actual damages,but in no case shall the total award of damages in a class action be less than one thousand dollars.an order enjoining the methods,acts,or practices.restitution of property.punitive damages.any other relief that the court deems proper.sprint contends plaintiffs have not suffer ed any damage as a result of the allegedly unlawful practices.
plaintiffs make essentially two counterarguments.first,they contend that they have experienced some damage within the meaning of that statute.second,they contend that section a is in fact not a statute about standing and that there is no damage requirement for bringing a clra suit.
as to the first argument,plaintiffs contend that the phrase any damage is not synonymous with actual damages,which generally refers to pecuniary damages.the language of section a indicates that plaintiffs are correct.if any damage and actual damages were synonymous,then it seems likely only the latter phrase would have been used in the first part of subdivision a.the juxtaposition of the two phrases so close together indicates that the phrases have different meanings.moreover,the breadth of the phrase any damage indicates a category that includes,but is greater than,actual damages,those who are eligible for the remedy of actual damages are a subset of those who have suffered any damage.sprint does not dispute this point.it concedes that any damage may encompass harms other than pecuniary damages,such as certain types of transaction costs and opportunity costs 
plaintiffs then argue that the very presence of unconscionable terms within a consumer contract,in violation of section,subdivision a and,constitutes a form of damage within the meaning of section a.sprint disagrees,arguing that in addition to the fact that an agreement contains allegedly unconscionable terms a consumer must experience some damage,some type of increased costs,as a result of the unconscionable terms in order to have standing pursuant to section a.
we conclude based on the language of the statute that sprint has the better position.section a provides that any consumer who suffers any damage as a result of the use or employment by any person of a method,act,or practice declared to be unlawful by section may bring an action under the clra.the statute speaks plainly about the use of an unlawful practice causing or resulting in some sort of damage.thus,the statute provides that in order to bring a clra action,not only must a consumer be exposed to an unlawful practice,but some kind of damage must result.if the legislature had intended to equate any damage with being subject to an unlawful practice by itself,it presumably would have omitted the causal link between any damage and the unlawful practice,and instead would have provided something like any consumer who is subject to a method,act,or practice declared to be unlawful by section may bring an action under the clra.
plaintiffs cite in support kagan gibraltar sav.loan cal d,kagan.in kagan,the plaintiff chose a financial institution,gibraltar savings and loan association gibraltar,that had represented it would charge no management fees for an individual retirement account ira.after opening the account,gibraltar informed plaintiff that they would be charging a fee for administering the account.initial letters of protest against the fee were unavailing.the plaintiff hired counsel,who advised gibraltar that it had violated the clra,and demanded that gibraltar not deduct the fees,that it cease its misleading advertising practices,and that it rectify the charging of this fee to other similarly situated bank customers.gibraltar responded by complying with some of the plaintiff demands,but did not attempt to identify and reimburse all customers who had been charged the fee.the plaintiff filed a class section lawsuit on behalf of herself and those similarly situated who had been charged fees by gibraltar.id.at.
gibraltar,in opposing the class action lawsuit,contended that because the administrative fee was not actually deducted from the plaintiff account,the plaintiff had not suffered any damage within the meaning of section a and therefore had no standing to sue.the court acknowledged that,had the plaintiff demand letter been made solely on her own behalf alone,gibraltar actions in rectifying its deceptive practice,would have meant that no clra action would lie,because section,subdivision b provides that no clra action for damages can be maintained when the unlawful practice has been timely corrected.kagan,supra,cal d at.but the court construed the plaintiff demand letter as being made on behalf of a class of similarly situated consumers,and therefore falling under the rubric of section,subdivision c.that section requires that in order to defeat a class action lawsuit against a class injured by a practice proscribed under the clra,the party alleged to have committed the unlawful practice must adequately notify the members of the class and provide an opportunity for an appropriate remedy for the defective goods or services.because gibraltar did not comply with these strictures,the court found the individual remedy offered the plaintiff inadequate to preclude a class action.kagan,supra,cal d at.
in so holding,the kagan court made clear that the clra was specifically designed to preclude such picking off of prospective class action plaintiffs the most important point in connection with the settlement of class actions is that settlement with the named plaintiffs will not preclude them from further prosecuting the action on behalf of the remaining members of the class.note that section c precludes the further maintenance of the action only if all the described conditions are shown to exist.those conditions require settlement with all reasonably identifiable members of the class.kagan,supra,cal d at.
having so concluded,the court went further,stating we thus reject gibraltar effort to equate pecuniary loss with the standing requirement that a consumer suffer any damage.as it is unlawful to engage in any of the deceptive business practices enumerated in section,consumers have a corresponding legal right not to be subjected thereto.accordingly,we interpret broadly the requirement of section that a consumer suffer any damage to include the infringement of any legal right as defined by section.kagan,supra,cal d at.
although the kagan court equated the infringement of any legal right under section with suffering any damage pursuant to section a,its holding was ultimately based not on an analysis of that language,but on the provisions of section,subdivision c,that once a person has been the victim of a proscribed practice under the clra and makes a demand on behalf of a class,remedying the plaintiff individual complaint does not disqualify her as class representative.moreover,in kagan it was indisputable that the defendant made clear its intent to deduct an allegedly fraudulent administrative fee from her account,and that the plaintiff was able to avoid the fee only by expending time and money threatening gibraltar with a lawsuit.as discussed,the expenditure of such transaction costs to avoid the consequences of a deceptive practice falls within the broad meaning of suffering any damage as a result of the use or employment of an unlawful practice,whether or not those transaction costs are cognizable as actual damages.the plaintiff in kagan may have also incurred opportunity costs,because gibraltar alleged misrepresentations may have diverted the plaintiff from finding a financial institution that did not charge administrative fees.
in the present case,however,because sprint had not sought to enforce any unconscionable term against plaintiffs,sprint has not actually imposed additional transaction costs on plaintiffs.although the allegedly unconscionable terms may at some future time require plaintiffs to expend greater costs and legal fees should a dispute arise that requires arbitration or resort to other remedial provisions,it would contort the statutory language to conclude that the preemptive expenditure of fees for this litigation means that sprint alleged unlawful practices had caused damage at the time the lawsuit was filed.if we were to so conclude,then the mere employment of an unlawful practice would be sufficient to authorize a clra suit,a meaning which,as discussed above,the language of the statute does not support.we decline to extend kagan to situations in which an allegedly unlawful practice under the clra has not resulted in some kind of tangible increased cost or burden to the consumer 
plaintiffs second argument is that section a is not a standing statute at all,and that even though a consumer who suffers any damage may obtain various remedies,the statute does not provide explicitly or implicitly that one who does not suffer any damage is precluded from obtaining injunctive relief.plaintiffs point to section in support of their position.subdivision a provides thirty days or more prior to the commencement of an action for damages pursuant to this title,the consumer shall do the following notify the person alleged to have employed or committed methods,acts,or practices declared unlawful by section of the particular alleged violations of section.demand that the person correct,repair,replace,or otherwise rectify the goods or services alleged to be in violation of section.subdivision b,as noted provides no clra action for damages may be maintained if there is appropriate correction within days after receipt of notice.subdivision d,provides in pertinent part an action for injunctive relief brought under the specific provisions of section may be commenced without compliance with subdivision a.not less than days after the commencement of an action for injunctive relief,and after compliance with subdivision a,the consumer may amend his or her complaint without leave of court to include a request for damages.
thus,section,subdivision d contemplates the filing of a clra action for injunctive relief alone,and such actions are not subject to the requirements of subdivisions a and b of notice and allowance for voluntary correction.but subdivision d does not alter the basic requirements of section a that the consumer bringing the action has suffered damage as the result of unlawful practices.although subdivision d does speak in terms of a n action for injunctive relief brought under the specific provisions of section,section does not by itself authorize injunctive relief.section is the only section of the clra that sets forth the
