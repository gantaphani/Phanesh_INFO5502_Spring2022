in,the california legislature enacted code of civil procedure section,subdivision a hereafter section a,which directed the california judicial council to establish ethics standards for persons serving as neutral arbitrators under contractual arbitration agreements.stats,ch.as explained in a legislative report,the legislature purpose was to provide basic measures of consumer protection with respect to private arbitration,such as minimum ethical standards and remedies for the arbitrator failure to comply with existing disclosure requirements.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.
in response to the legislature directive,the judicial council adopted the ethics standards for neutral arbitrators in contractual arbitration cal.rules of court,div.vi hereafter the california standards,most of which became effective on july.the stated purposes of the california standards are to guide the conduct of arbitrators,to inform and protect participants in arbitration,and to promote public confidence in the arbitration process,std.a.
the california standards are not the only ethics standards to which neutral arbitrators may be subject.the national association of securities dealers,nasd is a organization sro that licenses and regulates in the national securities industry.through its wholly owned subsidiary,nasd dispute resolution,nasddr,it has adopted a code of arbitration procedure the nasd code to govern the arbitration of disputes between its members and their customers.like the california standards,the nasd code contains disclosure requirements and disqualification procedures for arbitrators.under the authority of the federal securities exchange act of et hereafter sea,the united states securities and exchange commission sec has approved the nasd code.see shearson american express,mcmahon,d mcmahon t he sec has specifically approved the arbitration procedures of the nasd.
we granted review in this case to address five issues did section a authorize the judicial council to adopt ethics standards for arbitrators appointed by arbitration providers like the nasddr does the sea preempt section a and the california standards for arbitration are the parties to an arbitration agreement relieved of their duty to arbitrate when their arbitration provider has refused to proceed with arbitration for more than one year may the parties to an arbitration waive application of the california standards does the federal arbitration act of et hereafter faa preempt section a and the california standards in arbitrations based on contractual arbitration agreements or disputes affecting interstate commerce 
we conclude that section a authorized the judicial council to adopt ethics standards for arbitrators appointed by arbitration providers like the nasddr,but also that the sea preempts section a and the california standards for arbitration.under the circumstances of this case,we further conclude that the delay in arbitrator selection and appointment,resulting from uncertainty regarding the applicability of the california standards,does not relieve plaintiffs of their duty to arbitrate.in light of these conclusions,we find it unnecessary to address the remaining issues concerning waiver and preemption under the faa.
facts and procedural history 
in early,jack jevne opened an account with jb oxford company oxford in the name of avalon investments,avalon,a business entity that jevne wholly owns,to safeguard funds obtained from the sale of certain securities.oxford is a licensed securities and a member of the nasd.to open the account,oxford required jevne to sign an account opening statement in which he agreed that all disputes with oxford would be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the nasd code.the account opening statement declared that california law would govern t he agreement and its enforcement.
jevne has alleged that when he opened the account,he personally instructed oxford that he was the only person authorized to withdraw funds and securities from the account.he has further alleged that oxford violated this instruction by allowing to be taken from the account between april and september through a series of withdrawals that he did not authorize.
in august,jevne and avalon plaintiffs sued oxford and jb oxford holdings,defendants in superior court alleging negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,and conversion.defendants moved to compel arbitration under the terms of the account opening statement.plaintiffs did not oppose the motion,which the trial court granted,and in may the parties signed a uniform submission agreement agreeing to arbitrate according to the nasd code.after one arbitrator and two public arbitrators were appointed according to the nasd code,the arbitration proceedings began 
after the california standards went into effect in july,the nasd adopted a rule,designated f,establishing a temporary waiver program for arbitrations in california.under this rule,to participate in arbitration,california investors were required to waive application of the california standards to have their arbitration proceedings held in california or agree to conduct the arbitration outside of california.the sec promptly approved the waiver rule as a pilot program see.the sec has approved several extensions of the nasd temporary waiver rule,which is to expire on september.
on july,the nasd arbitration panel granted defendants motion to dismiss plaintiffs claim,with leave to amend.plaintiffs filed an amended claim,and defendants again moved to dismiss.in september,before the panel ruled on this motion,the nonpublic arbitrator disqualified himself for undisclosed reasons.the nasddr suspended the proceedings and asked plaintiffs to sign a statement waiving application of the california standards.plaintiffs refused to sign the waiver and,in february,asked the superior court to set aside the order compelling arbitration and to restore the matter to the active civil trial calendar.in april,the court denied the motions.plaintiffs then petitioned the court of appeal for a writ of mandate directing the trial court to set aside its order denying the motions and to enter a new order granting the motions.the petition named defendants as real parties in interest.
after receiving an opposition from defendants see cal.rules of court,rule b,the court of appeal issued an alternative writ,and it received briefs from several amici curiae the nasddr,the new york stock exchange nyse the sec,and the california attorney general.in lieu of an amicus brief,the california judicial council submitted a copy of a brief it had filed in another case,nasd dispute resolution,judicial council of cal.d.
on november,the court of appeal denied plaintiffs petition.although the court concluded that the judicial council had acted within its authority in drafting the california standards and that they are not preempted by the faa,it also concluded that the california standards conflict with,and are preempted by,the sea.on december,plaintiffs petitioned the court of appeal for a rehearing to consider issues not addressed in the original decision.the court of appeal denied rehearing the next day.
we granted plaintiffs petition for review.thereafter,on april,we granted a joint motion to intervene by the nasddr and the nyse interveners as additional real parties in interest.we have also accepted briefs from several amici curiae the california employment lawyers association,the trial lawyers for public justice,the securities industry association,the california attorney general,and the california judicial council.
after we had placed this matter on calendar for oral argument,a panel of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit issued its decision in credit suisse first boston corporation grunwald cir.consistent with our decision in this case,which affirms the judgment of the state court of appeal,the ninth circuit concluded that the judicial council had statutory authority to adopt ethics standards for arbitrators appointed by arbitration providers like the nasddr,but also that the sea preempts the california standards for arbitration.
ii.the california standards and arbitrators 
do the california standards that the judicial council adopted in apply to neutral arbitrators appointed for contractual arbitration by an sro or other arbitration service or provider to the extent the california standards purport to apply to arbitrators appointed by sro and other third party arbitration providers,are they invalid as exceeding the scope of the statutory authorization 
section a mandates that a person serving as a neutral arbitrator pursuant to an arbitration agreement shall comply with the california standards.code of civil procedure section,subdivision d hereafter section d defines a neutral arbitrator as one who is either selected jointly by the parties or by the arbitrators selected by the parties or appointed by the court when the parties or the arbitrators selected by the parties fail to select an arbitrator who was to be selected jointly by them.as mentioned earlier,the legislature enacted section a in it adopted section d definition of arbitrator,however,much earlier,in stats,ch,and it has not amended this definition since.
the california standards define neutral arbitrator somewhat differently than section d does arbitrator and neutral arbitrator mean any arbitrator who is subject to these standards and who is to serve impartially,whether selected or appointed a jointly by the parties or by the arbitrators selected by the parties b by the court,when the parties or the arbitrators selected by the parties fail to select an arbitrator who was to be selected jointly by them or c by a dispute resolution provider organization,under an agreement of the parties.california standards,std.a,italics added.the standards define d ispute resolution provider organization as any nongovernmental entity that,or individual who,coordinates,administers,or provides the services of two or more dispute resolution neutrals,std.g.
the california constitution grants the judicial council authority to,among other things,adopt rules for court administration,practice and procedure,and perform other functions prescribed by statute.cal,art.vi,subd.d.the constitution adds the rules adopted shall not be inconsistent with statute.see also people mendez cal th,d.because statutes are construed to effectuate the enacting body intent,the test for determining whether a rule that the judicial council has adopted exceeds statutory authority is whether the rule conflicts with the legislative intent underlying the authorization statute.see people hall cal th,d,in re robin cal d.thus,a rule may be broader than the literal terms of its authorizing statute,provided it reasonably furthers the statutory purpose.commercial investors,firmaterr,th,d.
on first reading,standard a appears to broaden section d definition of neutral arbitrator to include a class not mentioned in the selected by a dispute resolution provider organization such as the nasddr.under the nasd code,the nasddr uses a computerized neutral list selection system to generate two lists of available arbitrators,one list for public arbitrators and another for nonpublic arbitrators.each party may strike one or more of the arbitrators from each list for any reason and may rank the remaining candidates by order of preference.the nasd director of arbitration then consolidates the parties lists and appoints a panel according to their reported preferences,but if the number of remaining arbitrators is insufficient to fill the panel,the director may appoint one or more arbitrators not named on the lists submitted to the parties.nasd code,rule b,c.thus,although the parties preferences play a role in the process,the nasddr both limits the pool of potential arbitrators and,through its director of arbitration,makes the final selection.whether this method of selection is consistent with section d definition of neutral arbitrator depends on what that definition means when it refers to an arbitrator selected jointly by the parties.does it require that the parties directly and personally agree to the particular individual who is to serve as arbitrator,or is it sufficient that the parties have jointly agreed to a selection method or procedure,even though the method or procedure authorizes a third party to make the final determination on this point,the statutory language is ambiguous.
to determine the legislative intent underlying section d definition of neutral arbitrator,we consider its legislative history.in,the legislature,by a concurrent resolution,authorized the california law revision commission to study,among other things,whether the statutes relating to arbitration should be revised.stats,ch.in december,the commission submitted its report and recommendations,which included adoption of a statutory definition of neutral arbitrator.recommendation and study relating to arbitration cal.law revision com.pp.the legislature enacted the definition of neutral arbitrator exactly as the commission had recommended.compare,with d.
reports of commissions which have proposed statutes that are subsequently adopted are entitled to substantial weight in construing the statutes.citations.this is particularly true where the statute proposed by the commission is adopted by the legislature without any change whatsoever and where the commission comment is brief,because in such a situation there is ordinarily strong reason to believe that the legislators votes were based in large measure upon the explanation of the commission proposing the bill.van arsdale hollinger cal d,accord,people martinez cal th,d.
regarding the meaning of neutral arbitrator,the commission stated when a tripartite arbitration board is appointed,it is usually composed of a representative of each of the contending parties and a third arbitrator chosen by the other two or by some other procedure.the third arbitrator,who is the neutral arbitrator,often acts as the chairman of the board it is suggested that the california statute should distinguish the arbitrators by their titles.the arbitrators appointed by both parties,or by the two arbitrators chosen by the parties,or appointed by the court,or any other disinterested agency,should be designated the neutral arbitrator the arbitrators representing the parties should be designated party arbitrators recommendation and study relating to arbitration,supra,cal.law revision com,italics added see also id.at pp.to.this comment indicates that the primary purpose of the statutory definition of neutral arbitrator was to distinguish arbitrators chosen in a manner likely to ensure their neutrality and impartiality from an arbitrator selected by one party unilaterally to act as an advocate for that party interests.the definition was not intended to exclude arbitrators selected by a neutral third party,like an arbitration provider or administrator,to which the parties had mutually assigned that responsibility.on the contrary,it was intended to include arbitrators chosen by any disinterested agency to which the parties mutually entrusted the task of appointing an impartial arbitrator.
this understanding of the meaning of neutral arbitrator is also consistent with the legislative intent underlying the legislation that authorized the judicial council to formulate and adopt the california standards.nothing in the enactment history of that legislation suggests a legislative intent to exempt from the california standards all arbitrators appointed by arbitration providers.rather,the documented concerns underlying the legislation,relating to the fairness of private contractual arbitration,strongly suggest an intent to apply the standards to contractual arbitration generally.
for example,a report by the assembly committee on the judiciary noted that the growing use of private the imposition of mandatory,binding arbitration contracts in consumer and employment given rise to a largely unregulated private justice industry.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess,supra.the report stated that the proposed legislation seeks to provide basic measures of consumer protection with respect to private arbitration,such as minimum ethical standards and remedies for the arbitrator failure to comply with existing disclosure requirements.a senate floor analysis stated that this legislation would apply to an appointed arbitrator in private or contractual arbitrations,that it would address concerns of fairness by requiring private arbitrators to comply with ethical guidelines to be established by the judicial council,and that proponents of the legislation argued that strict ethical guidelines should apply to private arbitrators to ensure that parties to the arbitration can have confidence in the integrity and fairness of the private arbitrator.rules,off.of floor analyses,analysis of bill reg.sess.we may properly consider these legislative documents in determining legislative intent.see people cruz cal th,fn,d.
interveners the nasddr and the nyse point out that the staff of the judicial council,in a report to the members of the judicial council dated april,stated that the then proposed definition of neutral arbitrator in standard a expands upon the definition of neutral arbitrator in code of civil procedure section d,which does not include arbitrators appointed by a dispute resolution provider organization or by any party acting alone,even if those arbitrators are to serve impartially.italics added.interveners argue that this statement somehow proves that standard a is inconsistent with section d and that the judicial council exceeded its authority in adopting it.we are unpersuaded.the comments by the judicial council staff to members of the judicial council in are not probative of the legislative intent underlying either the enactment of section d or the enactment of section a.moreover,as we have explained,the test is not whether the rule adopted is broader than the literal terms of its authorizing statute,or a related statute,but whether the rule adopted reasonably furthers the purpose underlying the statutory authorization.
given the relevant legislative history,we agree with the court of appeal in this case that the legislature,when it enacted section a in,intended to authorize the judicial council to formulate and adopt ethical standards for neutral arbitrators in private nonjudicial arbitration generally,including neutral arbitrators appointed by third party providers like the nasddr.
iii.preemption 
general principles 
we recently explained the general principles governing claims of federal preemption of state law,in these words 
the supremacy clause of article vi of the united states constitution grants congress the power to preempt state law.state law that conflicts with a federal statute is without effect.cipollone liggett group,d cipollone,quoting maryland louisiana,d.it is equally well established that c onsideration of issues arising under the supremacy clause start s with the assumption that the historic police powers of the states are not to be superseded by federal act unless that is the clear and manifest purpose of congress.cipollone,at.thus,t he purpose of congress is the ultimate touchstone of analysis.ibid.
the united states supreme court has explained that federal preemption arises in three circumstances first,congress can define explicitly the extent to which its enactments state law.citation.fundamentally is a question of congressional intent,citation and when congress has made its intent known through explicit statutory language,the courts task is an easy one.second,in the absence of explicit statutory language,state law is where it regulates conduct in a field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively.such an intent may be inferred from a scheme of federal regulation so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it,or where an act of congress touch es a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.citation.although this court has not hesitated to draw an inference of field where it is supported by the federal statutory and regulatory schemes,it has emphasized where the field which congress is said to have includes areas that have been traditionally occupied by the states,congressional intent to supersede state laws must be clear and manifest.citations.finally,state law is to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.thus,the court has found where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements,citation or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.english general electric,d,fn.omitted see crosby national foreign trade council,d olszewski scripps health cal th,d.dowhal smithkline beecham consumer healthcare cal th,d,see also bronco wine jolly cal th,d.
preemption by the sea 
the sea contains no express preemption provision on the contrary,it contains two savings clauses expressly preserving state law in certain limited areas.accordingly,neither express preemption nor field preemption by the sea is at issue in this case.as the court of appeal in this case correctly recognized,and as the parties themselves agree,we are concerned here only with conflict preemption by the sea.as noted earlier ante,d,conflict preemption applies in two situations when it is impossible to comply with both the federal and the state law,and when the state law could prevent or impair accomplishment of the purposes and objectives of the federal law.english general electric,supra,at.
as a preliminary matter,we must decide whether,as defendants and interveners argue,the provisions of the nasd code have the force of federal law,so that if the california standards conflict with the nasd code,they likewise necessarily conflict with the sea,and are therefore preempted.plaintiffs,and the california attorney general as amicus curiae,argue that the nasd code does not have the preemptive force of federal law,and,as a consequence,the california standards may conflict with the nasd code without necessarily being preempted by the sea.
the preemptive force of the nasd code 
federal regulations have no less effect than federal statutes.fidelity federal sav.loan de la cuesta,d fidelity.to have preemptive effect,however,a federal regulation must be one that congress authorized the promulgating agency to adopt.id.at.thus,a federal agency may state law only when and if it is acting within the scope of its congressionally delegated authority,for an agency literally has no power to act,let alone the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign state,unless and until congress confers power upon it.louisiana public service comm fcc,d accord,new york,d.here,the relevant questions are whether the sec intended to preempt the california standards,and,if so,whether that action is within the scope of the sec delegated authority.see fidelity,supra,at.the questions upon which resolution of this case rests are whether the board meant to california law,and,if so,whether that action is within the scope of the board delegated authority.
in,in merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,ware,d ware,the united states supreme court considered whether nyse arbitration rules preempted a california law governing employee wage claims.merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,merrill lynch had established a plan for its employees under terms providing that an employee who voluntarily terminated employment and competed with merrill lynch forfeited all benefits.id.at.david ware,a former employee whose benefits had been forfeited under this provision,brought a class action against merrill lynch in california state court,arguing that the forfeiture provision was void under a california law bus,prohibiting contracts that restrained anyone from engaging in a lawful profession,trade,or business.ware,supra,at.merrill lynch petitioned to compel arbitration,invoking an arbitration provision in ware employment agreement and a provision of the nyse rules requiring that any controversy between a member and the member employee be settled by arbitration in accordance with nyse arbitration rules.id.at.the trial court denied the petition to compel arbitration,and the court of appeal affirmed,reasoning that contributions were a form of wages and that another california law labor code,permitted an employee to sue for wages without regard to the existence of any private agreement to arbitrate.ware,supra,at,fn.
the united states supreme court granted certiorari to decide the extent to which authority delegated under a federal regulatory statute state law.ware,supra,at.the court stated that its guiding principle was that state law should be by exchange only to the extent necessary to protect the achievement of the aims of the securities exchange act.id.at,quoting silver new york stock exchange,d.the sea embodies congress decision to use an approach of supervised of the national securities market.ware,supra,at.under the sea,securities may be traded only on registered exchanges,and an exchange seeking registration must show that it has rules that are just and adequate to insure fair dealing and to protect investors.ware,supra,at,quoting d.the ware court noted that the sea gave the sec authority to alter or supplement an exchange rules,but only in designated areas exchange rules outside those areas were not subject to sec scrutiny.ware,supra,at.
from this review,the high court concluded that the congressional aim in supervised is to insure fair dealing and to protect investors from harmful or unfair trading practices and that any rule or practice not germane to fair dealing or investor protection would not appear to fall under the shadow of the federal umbrella it is,instead,subject to applicable state law.ware,supra,at.applying this conclusion to the facts before it,the ware court noted that nothing in the sea or in any sec rule specified arbitration as the favored means of resolving disputes,and that the nyse rule requiring arbitration of those disputes was not within any of the areas subject to sec scrutiny.the court further noted that arbitration of disputes was not essential to protect investor confidence in the market,contrasting the nyse arbitration rule with other exchange rules providing for direct effective disciplinary action against any abusive exchange practice.ware,supra,at.rules of that kind designed to insure fair dealing and to protect investors,are of the kind directly related to the act purposes and ordinarily would not be expected to yield to provisions of state law.ibid.
the high court in ware rejected the nyse argument that federal preemption was necessary to allow national uniformity in the resolution of wage claims between exchange members and their employees.convenience in exchange management may be desirable,but it does not support a plea for uniform application when the rule to be applied is not necessary for the achievement of the national policy objectives reflected in the act.ware,supra,at.the court added in effect,we are asked to sacrifice the individual expectation of uniform treatment in the state of his residence for uniformity of application of the effect of an exchange rules.we decline to do so because we believe that congress intended that those elements of the old regime of complete,that is,those elements not related to the federal objectives,be subject to state law and to established conflicts principles when their application out of state comes into controversy.id.at.the united states supreme court thus concluded that the nyse rule requiring arbitration of wages disputes did not preempt california law 
making a significant change,congress in amended section of the sea to grant the sec broad authority to oversee and to regulate the rules adopted by the sros relating to customer disputes,including the power to mandate the adoption of any rules it deems necessary to ensure that arbitration procedures adequately protect statutory rights.mcmahon,supra,at.as a result of the amendments of the sea,the sec must approve any nasd rule before it can be implemented.see b.to approve a rule,the sec must determine that the rule is consistent with the requirements and goals of the sea to protect investors and the public interest.b see mcmahon,supra,at.
although congress amendment of the sea substantially altered the statutory scheme that the high court had earlier construed in ware,supra,d,the precise impact of the amendment on the continuing validity of ware reasoning is unclear.ware implied that because congress had given the sec authority to review sro rules in certain defined areas,it was reasonable to infer that all rules within the designated areas were germane to the primary purposes of the dealing and investor that all rules outside those areas were not germane to those purposes.interveners the nasddr and the nyse here appear to argue that because the sec now reviews all sro rules,courts must infer that all sro rules are germane to the sea purposes and thus have the preemptive force of federal law.
absent guidance from the united states supreme court,we are unwilling to go that far.rather,we conclude that because the sec now reviews all sro rules,any of those rules may be germane to the sea goals of fair dealing and investor protection.whether a particular rule is germane to the congressional purposes is a matter to be determined by careful examination of the rule contents and consideration of any public pronouncements by the sec concerning the rule purpose and effect.as the federal agency entrusted with enforcement of the sea,the sec approval of an nasd rule is an expression of federal policy that may have preemptive effect.see dowhal smithkline beecham consumer healthcare,supra,cal th at,d.sec approval will have preemptive effect if the sec intended that the rule prevail over conflicting state law and if the sec decision was not arbitrary or in excess of its statutory authority.see fidelity,supra,at.
the court of appeal here concluded that three of the california and,concerning disclosure,and standard,concerning with the nasd code,and thus also with the sea.we begin with standards and and then examine standard.
standards and 
standard sets forth in considerable detail the matters that must be disclosed by a person nominated or appointed as an arbitrator.cal,std,subd.a.standard lists additional matters that an arbitrator must disclose in a consumer arbitration administered by a provider organization.among other things,the arbitrator must disclose relationships between the provider organization and any of the parties or lawyers in the arbitration.
by comparison,the nasd code contains a relatively concise description of matters that must be disclosed each arbitrator shall be required to disclose to the director of arbitration any circumstances which might preclude such arbitrator from rendering an objective and impartial determination.each arbitrator shall disclose any direct or indirect financial or personal interest in the outcome of the arbitration any existing or past financial,business,professional,family,social,or other relationships or circumstances that are likely to affect impartiality or might reasonably create an appearance of partiality or bias.persons requested to serve as arbitrators must disclose any such relationships or circumstances that they have with any party or its counsel,or with any individual whom sic they have been told will be a witness.they must also disclose any such relationship or circumstances involving members of their families or their current employers,partners,or business associates.nasd code,rule a.the nasd code further provides that arbitrators must make a reasonable effort to inform themselves of any interests,relationships or circumstances that should be disclosed,and that after appointment they have a continuing duty to disclose,at any stage of the arbitration,any such interests,relationships,or circumstances that arise,or are recalled or discovered,rule b,c.finally,the director of arbitration must advise the parties of any information disclosed by an arbitrator,unless the arbitrator voluntarily withdraws or the director removes the arbitrator,rule e.
standard a provides that an arbitrator is disqualified in these situations 
the arbitrator fails to comply with his or her obligation to make disclosures and a party serves a notice of disqualification in the manner and within the time specified in code of civil procedure section 
the arbitrator complies with his or her obligation to make disclosures within calendar days of service of notice of the proposed nomination or appointment and,based on that disclosure,a party serves a notice of disqualification in the manner and within the time specified in code of civil procedure section 
the arbitrator makes a required disclosure more than calendar days after service of notice of the proposed nomination or appointment and,based on that disclosure,a party serves a notice of disqualification in the manner and within the time specified in code of civil procedure section 
a party becomes aware that an arbitrator has made a material omission or material misrepresentation in his or her disclosure and,within days after becoming aware of the omission or misrepresentation and within the time specified in code of civil procedure section c,the party serves a notice of disqualification that clearly describes the material omission or material misrepresentation and how and when the party became aware of this omission or misrepresentation or 
if any ground specified in code of civil procedure section exists and the party makes a demand that the arbitrator disqualify himself or herself in the manner and within the time specified in code of civil procedure section d.
the standard further provides that n otwithstanding any contrary request,consent,or waiver by the parties,an arbitrator must disqualify himself or herself if he or she concludes at any time during the arbitration that he or she is not able to conduct the arbitration impartially.california standards,std.c.
the nasd code arbitrator disqualification provisions differ significantly.the nasd code provides after the appointment of an arbitrator and prior to the commencement of the earlier of a the first conference or b the first hearing,if the director or a party objects to the continued service of the arbitrator,the director shall determine if the arbitrator should be disqualified.if the director sends a notice to the parties that the arbitrator shall be disqualified,the arbitrator will be disqualified unless the parties unanimously agree otherwise in writing and notify the director not later than days after the director sent the notice.the director will grant a party request to disqualify an arbitrator if it is reasonable to infer,based on information known at the time of the request,that the arbitrator is biased,lacks impartiality,or has an interest in the outcome of the arbitration.the interest or bias must be direct,definite,and capable of reasonable demonstration,rather than remote or speculative.nasd code,rule d see also,rule d.
as noted earlier ante,at,conflict preemption applies in two situations when it is impossible to comply with both the federal and the state law,and when the state law could prevent or impair accomplishment of the purposes and objectives of the federal law.english general electric,supra,at.we consider first the california standards disclosure requirements,then their disqualification requirements.
it is not impossible to comply with both the disclosure requirements of the california standards and the nasd code.assuming that the matters required to be disclosed differ somewhat under each,the arbitrator need only disclose all matters required by both codes.for matters required to be disclosed by the california standards,the arbitrator would make the disclosure directly to the parties,as the california standards require.for matters required to be disclosed by the nasd code,the arbitrator would make the disclosure to the director of arbitration,as the nasd code requires.
the remaining question is whether the detailed disclosure requirements of the california standards in any significant way impede or impair accomplishment of the goals of the nasd code,and thereby the goals of the sea.the sec has expressed its opinion that the california standards disclosure requirements will adversely affect nasd arbitrations in three ways by increasing administrative costs associated with the more detailed disclosure requirements by reducing the number of available arbitrators because many will be unwilling to comply with standard requirements,and by reducing the nationwide uniformity and consistency of nasd arbitrations by imposing special disclosure requirements applicable in only one state.
the sec first expressed these views in july in a letter addressed to the leadership of the california legislature.in that letter,the sec director stated t he burdens associated with complying with some of the disclosure requirements may have a deleterious effect on sro arbitration programs by causing some arbitrators to resign rather than comply.finally,adjudicating a national program to the specific requirements of any state or every state will unnecessarily burden the administration of sro arbitration programs to the detriment of investors.
the sec again expressed these views in october when it approved rule of the nasd code,requiring waiver of the california standards.announcing its approval of the rule,the sec recited the concerns expressed by the nasddr the california standards put extreme and unnecessary disclosure burdens on individuals who serve on nasd arbitration panels and already meet stringent disclosure rules.the extensive requirements for arbitrators,coupled with potential liability for even inadvertent violations of the california standards,led the nasd to conclude that,if the nasd were required to implement the california rules,investors and other parties would be saddled with higher costs,a less efficient and streamlined process,and a much smaller arbitrator roster from which to select the panelists who will decide their cases.the sec concluded that the proposed rule change was consistent with the sea and that accelerated approval of the rule change was necessary to protect investors in that the rules are designed to help address the backlog of cases created by the confusion over the new california standards,are designed to provide them with a mechanism to help resolve their disputes with in a more expedited manner,and are designed to help ensure the certainty and finality of arbitration awards.id.at.
the sec next expressed these views in january in an amicus curiae brief submitted to the federal district court in mayo dean witter reynolds,d mayo.see auer robbins,d administrative agency interpretation of federal law in a legal brief is worthy of deference when it reflects the agency fair and considered judgment on the matter in question.in that brief,the sec stated the commission is of the view that in light of the commission comprehensive oversight under federal law of the sros,only the commission can decide what disclosure and disqualification standards are appropriate for the protection of investors in sro arbitration,and can insure that those standards are part of an effective national system.the california standards,to the extent they apply to the sros,are preempted by virtue of this scheme of federal regulation.the federal district court gave great weight to the sec views mayo,supra,at,fn,and it concluded that the sea preempted the california standards for arbitrations id.at.
finally,the sec expressed these views in an amicus curiae brief submitted to the court of appeal in this very case.the sec stated that the california standards for disclosure and disqualification are preempted by federal law for arbitrations conducted by the nasddr.the sec attached a copy of the brief it had submitted in mayo,supra,d,and it reiterated its position that only the commission can decide what disclosure and disqualification standards are appropriate for the protection of investors or employees in sro arbitration,for the furtherance of market efficiency and regulation of national securities associations and exchanges,and can insure that those standards are part of an effective national system.
in deciding whether a state law conflicts with a federal law by hindering the complete accomplishment of the federal law objective,we give considerable weight to the views of the federal agency charged with administering the federal law.geier american honda motor,d.accordingly,based on the views of the sec discussed above,we conclude that the sea preempts the california standards rules on arbitrator disclosure.
the case for sea preemption is even more compelling as to the california standards disqualification rules.
standard of the california standards conflicts with rule of the nasd code insofar as it deprives the director of arbitration of authority to determine whether,after an arbitrator has been appointed,that arbitrator should be disqualified on the ground of bias or interest.under standard,disqualification is automatic if a party timely serves a notice of disqualification in any of the circumstances described in the standard,some of which may occur after an arbitrator has been selected and appointed.under the nasd code,after an arbitrator is appointed,a party may seek disqualification of the arbitrator by making an objection,but it is the director of arbitration who makes the disqualification determination.this may often require the exercise of judgment to determine whether information that the arbitrator disclosed after appointment,or failed to disclose before appointment,sufficiently demonstrates a disqualifying bias or interest.these different systems of arbitrator disqualification are fundamentally irreconcilable because application of standard could require disqualification of an arbitrator who could not be disqualified under the nasd rules because the director of arbitration had determined that the arbitrator did not have a disqualifying bias or interest.see mayo,supra,d at application of the california standards thus would greatly reduce,if not eliminate in practice,the role of the director of arbitration in the disqualification process.
in october,when it approved rule of the nasd code,requiring waiver of the california standards,the sec relied on the existence of this conflict under the california standards,even inadvertent of immaterial relationships is a basis for removal of an arbitrator and vacatur of an award.the california standards remove from the alternative dispute resolution administrator the power to decide contested challenges to arbitrators,instead vesting this authority unilaterally in any party to the arbitration.as currently drafted,the california standards would allow a party unilaterally to challenge and remove one arbitrator after another,thus destroying any notion of arbitral finality and closure.in adopting a rule designed to prevent implementation of the california standards in nasd arbitrations,the sec made a finding that the nasd rule was consistent with section b of the act,which requires that the rules be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade,as well as to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market,and,in general,to protect investors and the public interest,fn.omitted.
the sec has expressed its view that the california standards disqualification provision,standard,conflicts with the nasd code in a way that threatens to frustrate the congressional goals and objectives underlying the sea.in its brief in mayo,the sec stated t he california standards for disqualification conflict with the sro rules in that they require arbitrator disqualification in circumstances where the sro rules do not permit it.while the sro rules provide that an arbitrator may,prior to the hearing,be disqualified by the director of arbitration based upon the information disclosed under sro rules,and the nasd allows removal based on previously unknown disqualifying information after the hearing begins,the california statute mandates that an arbitrator shall be disqualified,upon notice from either party,for failure to comply with california disclosure requirements.the sec further noted this conflict can not be resolved by the sros simply by interpreting their existing rules more broadly to accommodate the california standards.all interpretations of rules that are not reasonably and fairly implied in the rule are classified as proposed rule changes and subject to commission review.u nilateral imposition of the state regulations would impair the balance that the commission has struck in approving existing disclosure and disqualification rules,as well as its obligation to consider and strike a balance in any revision of those rules.as noted,serious concerns have been raised by the commission staff that the added opportunities under the california system for disqualification and vacature of arbitral decisions may increase the complexity,cost,and uncertainty of the arbitration process.if so,this would serve the interests of brokerage firms,while the average investor would suffer from protracted and costly proceedings.the commission must have an opportunity to consider these factors and make its own determination where to strike the appropriate balance.
it appears that application of the california standards disqualification provisions would allow a party to disqualify any arbitrator in an arbitration.standard b a requires the arbitrator to disclose any party membership in the provider organization.because an arbitration always includes one is an nasd member,every arbitrator would have to make this disclosure.under standard a,a party may serve a notice of disqualification based on any disclosure that the arbitrator has made.if the notice is timely served,in the proper form,standard provides that the arbitrator is disqualified.thus,in an arbitration between a and a customer,the customer may disqualify every potential arbitrator based on the arbitrator required disclosure that the is an nasd member.
the sec approval of rule of the nasd code,and its pronouncements quoted above,reflect its determination that the nasd code provisions governing arbitrator selection should prevail over conflicting state law,and this determination is neither arbitrary nor in excess of its statutory authority.therefore,we conclude that the sea,through the sec approval of the nasd code,preempts the california standards dealing with disclosure and disqualification,including standards,and.
severability 
as plaintiff jevne points out,the california standards contain standards in all.he argues that the sea preempts only those standards that actually conflict with it,and that the other,nonconflicting standards may be enforced in an arbitration.we disagree.
when state law conflicts with federal law,it is preempted only to that extent and no further.peatros bank of america cal th,d,plur.opn.of mosk,see also id.at,d.whether the other standards are enforceable in sro arbitrations depends on whether those standards also conflict with federal law and,if not,whether they are severable from the standards that do conflict.an invalid part can be severed if,and only if,it is grammatically,functionally and volitionally separable.citation.it is grammatically separable if it is distinct and separate and,hence,can be removed as a whole without affecting the wording of any of the measure other provisions.citation.it is functionally separable if it is not necessary to the measure operation and purpose.citation.and it is volitionally separable if it was not of critical importance to the measure enactment.citation.hotel employees restaurant employees internat.union davis cal th,d.
standards,and,are grammatically separable from the other standards in the sense that they are separate and distinct standards that may be removed without affecting the wording of the other standards.whether they are functionally or volitionally separable,in the sense that they are unnecessary to the california standards operation and purpose or not critical to their enactment,is more problematic.the preempted provisions govern disclosure and disqualification,two areas that would appear to be both necessary to the california standards operation and critical to their enactment.when it directed the judicial council to draft the standards,the legislature specified that the california standards shall address the disclosure of interests,relationships,or affiliations that may constitute conflicts of interest,including prior service as an arbitrator or other dispute resolution neutral entity,disqualifications,acceptance of gifts,and establishment of fu
