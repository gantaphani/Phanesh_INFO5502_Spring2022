background 
in early,plaintiffs james and kari garten decided to have a playhouse built for their daughter behind their house.the gartens contacted defendant peter kurth,a licensed architect who had designed the garten home for its prior owner.at the first meeting,kurth said that he was an experienced architect with the professional capacity to complete the project.the gartens decided to retain defendant the peter kurth office of architecture and planning architecture and planning as the architect for the project.on may,the gartens signed an agreement the garten agreement with architecture and planning for the construction of the playhouse.this agreement contained an arbitration clause that stated 
claims,disputes or other matters in question between the parties to this agreement arising out of or relating to this agreement or breach thereof shall be subject to and decided by arbitration in accordance with the construction industry arbitration rules of the american arbitration association currently in effect unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.no arbitration arising out of or relating to this agreement shall include,by consolidation,joinder or in any other manner,an additional person or entity not a party to this agreement,except by written consent containing a specific reference to this agreement signed by the owner,architect,and any other person or entity sought to be joined.consent to arbitration involving an additional person or entity shall not constitute consent to arbitration of any claim,dispute or other matter in question not described in the written consent.the foregoing agreement to arbitrate and other agreements to arbitrate with an additional person or entity duly consented to by the parties to this agreement shall be specifically enforceable in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
the award rendered by the arbitrator or arbitrators shall be final and judgment may be entered upon it in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
following the signing of the garten agreement,kurth prepared the plans for the project and provided the gartens with an estimate of per square foot,for a total cost of approximately.he also told the gartens that he would collect and submit to them proposals for the construction of the playhouse.the summary of the bids that kurth gave the gartens included those from defendants mkc construction company mkc,pgm construction management,pgm,and peter kurth,aia design works construction,design works,plus bids from five other companies.mkc,pgm,and design works,the three lowest bidders,were all controlled by kurth at the time of the bidding.kurth did not inform the gartens about his connections to these companies.design works bid and budget of was the lowest and was accepted by the gartens.as a result,the gartens entered into a construction management agreement with design works this agreement also contained an arbitration clause.design works role was to be general contractor for the project.
due to rising costs in the ongoing construction project,the paying the an accounting around april.though they were entitled to such an accounting pursuant to the garten agreement,they never received it.when the gartens had paid over,they met with kurth to discuss the growing costs and were told that the project could be completed in the range.on may,the gartens gave kurth checks for two further invoices.but,the next day,upon determining that they had paid him almost,they stopped payment on the checks and contacted kurth to review the situation 
within a few days,the gartens met with defendants peter kurth and paula rudofsky kurth assistant and offered to complete the project.kurth accepted this offer and the gartens provided a check for marked full and final payment,which he cashed.soon after,kurth and garten spoke again.at that time,kurth warned garten that more money would be needed to complete the job and that garten would be required to pay any additional costs.he pointed out that the gartens could not litigate the issue,but would have to go into he was very familiar with,but a process for which the gartens would need to hire an attorney.defendants did not provide further payments to subcontractors or perform any work after this point.on june,the gartens terminated their relationship both with architecture and planning and with design works.architecture and planning then filed and served a mechanic lien for over against the gartens property design works did the same for an amount in excess of.the gartens requested an itemized statement for the liens but were given only the same invoices that they had already received.
in october,plaintiffs began this action against,inter alia,defendants peter kurth,rudofsky,architecture and planning,mkc,pgm,and design works alleging rico violations as well as various statutory and common law claims sounding in fraud,malpractice,breach of fiduciary duty,and unjust enrichment.after plaintiffs amended their complaint,defendants moved to compel arbitration under the federal arbitration act and and to dismiss the suit on the grounds of failure to state a cause of action lack of jurisdiction.
in a memorandum and order dated october,the district court declined to dismiss the amended complaint.it denied the motion to compel arbitration with respect to plaintiffs claims against peter kurth,darden,pgm,and julia kurth the defendants because no agreement to arbitrate existed between the defendants and plaintiffs.and,it reserved decision on defendants motion to compel arbitration for the claims against architecture and planning and design works pending an evidentiary hearing.
the court took cognizance of the existence of an arbitration agreement with these latter parties and it noted that the validity of a contract that provides for arbitration is usually an issue for the arbitrators.it further pointed out that t he federal arbitration act does not permit the federal court to consider claims of fraud in the inducement of contract generally,and that the court may address allegations of fraud only if they are directed to the arbitration clause itself.here,however,plaintiffs had alleged that the arbitration clauses were used to facilitate defendants fraud.as a result,the court stated,the question whether the fraud alleged went to the arbitration clause must be decided before arbitration can be compelled or plaintiffs can be allowed to proceed with their claim in district court.the court order permitted discovery solely on the issue of fraud in the inducement of the arbitration provisions in the contracts.and,the court stayed the action with respect to all the defendants until it could adjudicate the validity of the arbitration agreement between the gartens and the two and planning and design had signed contracts with them 
the district court conducted a hearing on the question.on march,it issued findings of fact and conclusions of law.in its decision,the court reviewed the evidence surrounding plaintiffs allegations.it found that the focus of the fraud alleged was the systematic overcharging of plaintiffs for services performed by subcontractors.thus,for invoices dated september to december,kurth had paid subcontractors while the gartens had paid out more than.this,the district court concluded,sufficed to show a continuing pattern of fraud and deceit.as to the relevance of the arbitration clause to this fraud,t
