while its first appeal was pending,ceats filed a motion for relief from the judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b rule b based on an alleged relationship between the mediator and the law firm representing most of the accused infringers.this alleged relationship was brought to light in an unrelated case the karlseng litigation.after we affirmed the invalidity of ceats patents in ceats i,the district court denied ceats rule b motion.this appeal followed.

background 
a.the district court trial and mediation 
on april,ceats sued continental in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas for infringement of four patents.the district court ordered the parties to participate in mediation and appointed former magistrate judge robert faulkner as the mediator on september.the parties conducted two mediation sessions before faulkner one on june,and another on june,because the parties failed to reach a settlement during mediation,the matter proceeded to trial.thomas melsheimer,a partner at fish richardson fish,served as lead trial counsel.fish represented some,but not all,of the accused infringers before the trial court.during the day jury trial,the parties conducted further mediation sessions,but again failed to reach a settlement.on march,the jury found ceats patents infringed,but invalid.
b.the karlseng litigation 
in an unrelated case that began three years before ceats filed its complaint in this case,fish represented a party in a partnership dispute before a texas state court.after the parties agreed to arbitration,the state court appointed faulkner to serve as the judicial arbitration and mediation service jams arbitrator.see karlseng cooke karlseng i.pursuant to jams rules,faulkner disclosed that he previously had participated in arbitrations and mediations with the named fish attorneys,but disclosed no other contacts with them.four days after this disclosure,brett johnson,a partner at fish,made his first appearance in the case.faulkner made no changes to his general disclosure form when johnson entered his appearance.see id.during the arbitration,faulkner also acted as if he had not met johnson previously.in january,faulkner issued a ruling in favor of fish client for million,including million in attorney fees.after learning that faulkner and johnson were,in fact,previously acquainted,opposing counsel asked to conduct discovery regarding the nature of their relationship.the state court denied that request and confirmed the award on february.see id.at.
on appeal,the texas appellate court found that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to grant a continuance to conduct discovery because there was sufficient evidence of a prior relationship between faulkner and johnson to warrant further investigation.id.at.because the opposing party had not been given adequate opportunity to investigate,to seek the testimony of faulkner and johnson on april,the appellate court vacated the order confirming the arbitration award.the court remanded the case for the trial court to allow further discovery regarding the faulkner johnson relationship.see id.at.
after remand,faulkner and johnson were both deposed.see karlseng cooke karlseng ii.fish continued representing its client during remand.despite this extra discovery and what it revealed,the trial court again confirmed the award on june,nine months before ceats filed its complaint in this case.the state court opponent appealed for the second time.on november,two months after faulkner was appointed mediator in this case and six months before the first mediation melsheimer argued before the state court of appeals on behalf of fish client,urging that the court uphold the arbitration award in doing so,melsheimer defended faulkner decision not to disclose his relationship with johnson.on june,between the first two mediation sessions in this case the texas court of appeals issued its decision vacating the arbitration award,finding that faulkner failure to disclose his relationship with johnson violated his obligations as an arbitrator and tainted the arbitration award.in its opinion,the appeals court detailed both an enduring social relationship between faulkner and johnson,which it said included expensive outings and gifts,and an active business relationship between faulkner and the fish firm.see id.at.
on may,faulkner was added as a codefendant with fish,johnson,and others in a state court action.the complaint sought damages for breach of contract and fraud,alleging that faulkner,johnson,fish,and the client breached the arbitration agreement and fraudulently concealed the faulkner johnson fish relationship.see id.at.
post trial activity 
on march,the district court entered final judgment in favor of continental based on the jury finding of invalidity.on may,ceats claims to have first found out about the karlseng litigation because of a news article related to the suit against faulkner and fish.after the district court denied numerous motions,ceats filed its notice of appeal of the jury finding of invalidity on august.three days later,ceats also moved for relief from the final judgment under rule b ceats argued that it was entitled to relief under rule b based on fish failure to disclose the facts surrounding the karlseng litigation.ceats also asserted that,under rule b,faulkner failure to disclose the karlseng litigation and the facts relating thereto warranted relief from judgment.on april,we affirmed the district court finding of invalidity.ceats i,app x at.the district court subsequently denied ceats rule b motion on june.ceats now appeals the district court denial of the rule b motion.
the ruling of a district court under rule b is final and appealable pursuant to.venture indus.autoliv asp.we have jurisdiction under a because the claims in this case were for patent infringement.
ii.discussion 
because the denial of a rule b motion is a procedural question not unique to patent law,we review the district court denial under the law of the regional circuit,in this case,the fifth circuit.marquip,fosber.in the fifth circuit,a district court denial of a motion under rule b is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.patterson mobil oil,cir.
rule b states in relevant part that 
on a motion and just terms,the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment,order,or proceeding for the following reasons 
fraud whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic,misrepresentation,or misconduct by an opposing party 
any other reason that justifies relief.
fed.civ.proc.b emphasis added.
on appeal,ceats argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to grant relief from judgment under both rule b and rule b.ceats contends that fish failure to disclose the facts surrounding the karlseng litigation was improper and amounts to fraud whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic,misrepresentation,or misconduct by an opposing party.fed.civ.proc.b emphasis added.because the basis for relief under rule b must be mutually exclusive from the other five grounds for relief under rule b,liljeberg health servs.acquisition,ceats argues that it is faulkner not fish failure to disclose the facts surrounding the karlseng litigation that entitles it to relief under rule b.
in the fifth circuit,the party seeking relief under rule b must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the adverse party engaged in fraud or other misconduct,and that this misconduct prevented the moving party from fully and fairly presenting his case.hesling csx,cir citing gov t fin.servs.one.peyton place,cir.ceats conceded at oral argument,however,that there is nothing in the record that shows it was not given a full and fair opportunity to present its case.see oral argument at,ceats,continental airlines,available at.u there is no evidence,and the b standard clearly requires the movant to have to be able to show and demonstrate some impact on their ability to have a full and fair trial.and we were not given that opportunity,nor was there time.that why i think this case,however,can turn on b.because we are constrained to the record,we affirm the district court finding that ceats is not entitled to relief under rule b.
rule b gives federal courts authority to relieve a party from a final judgment upon such terms as are just.liljeberg,at see fed.civ.proc.b t he court may relieve a party from a final judgment for any other reason that justifies relief.in liljeberg,the supreme court first held that the district court judge violated a by failing to recuse himself.the plaintiff in liljeberg sought a declaration that it owned a hospital then under construction.while the case was pending,the defendant in the case engaged in negotiations with a third party to purchase the hospital.the presiding judge sat on that third party board of trustees.id.at.the supreme court held that a reasonable observer would have questioned the judge impartiality and have expected him to recuse himself.id.at.because the judge failed to recuse himself,he violated.a any justice,judge,or magistrate of the united states shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.emphasis added.
that violation of a,however,did not automatically entitle the movant to relief from judgment under rule b.id.at rule b relief is accordingly neither categorically available nor categorically unavailable for all a violations.a movant is entitled to relief under rule b the provision if such action is appropriate to accomplish justice and only in extraordinary circumstances.id.at quoting klapprott united states,internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court set forth three factors to consider in determining whether a judgment should be vacated for a violation of a the risk of injustice to the parties in the particular case the risk that the denial of relief will produce injustice in other cases and the risk of undermining the public confidence in the judicial process.id.at.
though ceats argues that the district court was incorrect to apply the liljeberg test to mediators,appellant br,it nonetheless relies on the three liljeberg factors to argue for reversal and argues that mediators are bound by the same neutrality requirements as judges and arbitrators.appellant reply.because,as explained below,we agree with ceats that mediators are bound by disclosure requirements similar to the recusal requirements of judges,we find it proper to apply the supreme court analysis in liljeberg to mediators.to apply that test,we first consider whether faulkner violated his duty to disclose by failing to disclose the facts surrounding the karlseng litigation.if faulkner should have disclosed similar to how the judge in liljeberg should have recused himself we would then turn to the three factors to determine if relief under rule b is warranted by virtue of that violation.
mediators neutrality requirements 
although we recognize that mediators perform different functions than judges and arbitrators,mediators still serve a vital role in our litigation process.courts depend heavily on the availability of the mediation process to help resolve disputes.courts must feel confident that they are referring parties to a fair and effective process when they refer parties to mediation.and parties must be confident in the mediation process if they are to be willing to participate openly in it.because parties arguably have a more intimate relationship with mediators than with judges,it is critical that potential mediators not project any reasonable hint of bias or partiality.indeed,all mediation standards require the mediator to disclose any facts or circumstances that even reasonably create a presumption of bias,am.bar ass model standards of conduct for mediators aba standards for mediators a mediator shall disclose,as soon as practicable,all actual and potential conflicts of interest that are reasonably known to the mediator and could reasonably be seen as raising a question about the mediator impartiality.emphasis added this duty to disclose is similar to the recusal requirements imposed on judges.compare aba standards for mediators a mediator shall disclose,as soon as practicable,all actual and potential conflicts of interest that are reasonably known to the mediator and could reasonably be seen as raising a question about the mediator impartiality.emphasis added with a any justice,judge,or magistrate judge of the united states shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.emphasis added 
while mediators do not have the power to issue judgments or awards,because parties are encouraged to share confidential information with mediators,those parties must have absolute trust that their confidential disclosures will be preserved.see in re grand jury subpoena dated,cir confidentiality is critical to the mediation process because it promotes the free flow of information that may result in the settlement of a dispute.alt.disp.resol.ed.a mediator must be fair and impartial to gain the trust and respect of the parties.indeed,mediation is not effective unless parties are completely honest with the mediator.see in re grand jury,at see also in re teligent,cir collecting cases.
just as a judge is required to recuse himself under a whenever his impartiality might reasonably be questioned,mediators are required to disclose a potential conflict whenever there are facts and circumstances that could reasonably be seen as raising a question about the mediator impartiality.aba standards for mediators emphasis added.because mediators have disclosure obligations which are similar to the recusal requirement imposed on judges,we find it appropriate to examine faulkner disclosure obligation under liljeberg.
faulkner duty to disclose the facts surrounding the karlseng litigation 
similar to liljeberg,where the supreme court first considered whether the presiding judge violated a,here,we first consider whether faulkner should have disclosed the facts surrounding the karlseng litigation the district court decided that a reasonable observer would not have questioned faulkner impartiality because,unlike the presiding judge in liljeberg,faulkner had no fiduciary interest in karlseng was not compelled to disqualify himself by statute and did not act as the presiding judge and final.based on these distinctions,the district court refused to find that a reasonably objective person would have expected faulkner to disclose the facts surrounding the karlseng litigation.on this ground,the district court ruled that faulkner did not violate his disclosure duty as a mediator.
on appeal,ceats argues that,as a neutral mediator,faulkner had a duty to disclose the facts surrounding the karlseng litigation because they gave the appearance of affecting the mediator neutrality.appellant br.quoting.mediator standards of practice and codes of ethics.ceats insists that the facts of the karlseng litigation reasonably affect the appearance of faulkner neutrality and impartiality.
continental responds that faulkner did not have a duty to disclose because johnson was not involved in this case and melsheimer was not involved in the case at the time of the first mediation.continental further argues that no disclosure was necessary because fish did not actually represent faulkner in the karlseng matter.instead,fish represented i
