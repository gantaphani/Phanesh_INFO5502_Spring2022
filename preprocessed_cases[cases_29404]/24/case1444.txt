the children of a decedent sued a nursing home that had provided services to their mother.the trial court denied the nursing home motion to compel arbitration of the elder abuse cause of action.the nursing home contends that the trial court,in so doing,ignored the controlling precedent of garrison superior court th,d garrison.the nursing home is correct that garrison is well reasoned and dictates the outcome of this case.the trial court should have granted the motion.the decedent had signed a probate code section health care power of attorney that authorized her daughter to make health care decisions for her,including the selection of health care providers.this authorization impliedly included the power to execute contracts of admission when having the decedent admitted to a health care facility.inasmuch as the decedent had not elected to restrict the powers of the daughter as her agent so as to exclude the power to enter into arbitration agreements,the daughter had the power to execute arbitration agreements when presented to her by the health care facility as part of the package of admissions documents.we reverse and remand.
in january,sarah hogan sarah executed a probate code section statutory advance health care directive form,a health care power of attorney.in that document,she named her daughter,barbara hogan barbara,as her agent in may,when sarah was suffering from stage ii alzheimer disease,barbara had her admitted to country villa plaza healthcare center,a skilled nursing care facility.at the time of admission,barbara signed two arbitration manifesting an agreement to arbitrate any medical malpractice claims and one manifesting an agreement to arbitrate any other type of claim against the facility.the second agreement specifically stated that any claim for alleged violations of the elder abuse and dependent adult civil protection act welf,et was to be arbitrated.each of the two arbitration agreements was optional and each contained a rescission right.

discussiona.health care power of attorney 
pursuant to the probate code section health care power of attorney in question,sarah authorized barbara to make health care decisions for her.the document contained the following language unless the form you sign limits the authority of your agent,your agent may make all health care decisions for you.this form has a place for you to limit the authority of your agent.you need not limit the authority of your agent if you wish to rely on your agent for all health care decisions that may have to be made.if you choose not to limit the authority of your agent,your agent will have the right to a consent or refuse consent to any care,treatment,service or procedure to maintain,diagnose or otherwise affect a physical or mental condition and b select or discharge health care providers and institutions 
sarah did not impose any limitations on barbara authority to select or discharge health care providers and institutions.the only limitation of any kind that sarah imposed had to do with the postdeath donation of organs,tissues or body parts.
the question is whether the provision permitting barbara to select and discharge health care providers and institutions includes the authority to execute admissions forms,including arbitration agreements,on sarah behalf.country villa says,yes,and the hogans say,no.
health care decisions law 
as indicated above,the provisions of the standard form health care power of attorney that sarah signed are set forth in probate code section,a part of the health care decisions law contained in division of the probate code et.probate code section explains that the standard form may,but need not,be used to create a health care power of attorney.section also provides that the other sections of the health care decisions law govern the effect of a health care power of attorney.
some of the other statutory provisions of the health care decisions law that come into play include probate code section,which generally permits an agent under a health care power of attorney to make health care decisions for the principal,and section,which specifies that the s election and discharge of health care providers and institutions is a health care decision.another of those statutory provisions is probate code section,which provides that when the health care decisions law does not articulate a rule governing a particular question about an agent powers under a health care power of attorney,the laws of agency shall apply to provide the rule.as we shall show,these probate code provisions,together with civil code provisions on general agency law,provide that an agent under a probate code section health care power of attorney,in selecting a health care facility,has the power to execute applicable admissions forms,including arbitration agreements,unless that power is restricted by the principal.as we shall explain,this conclusion is supported by garrison,supra,th,d,a case that is similar in material respects to the one before us.
in garrison,supra,th,d,a daughter,who was designated as her mother under a health care power of attorney,signed her mother into a health care facility.id.at,d.at the time the daughter did so,she signed two arbitration agreements,one pertaining to medical malpractice claims and one pertaining to all other claims against the facility.id.at,d.following the death of the mother,the daughter and certain other family members filed suit against the facility,collectively asserting causes of action for elder abuse,negligence,fraud,unlawful business practices and wrongful death.id.at,d.the facility moved to compel arbitration.id.at,d.the trial court granted the motion and the appellate court agreed that the daughter had the authority to enter into the arbitration agreements on her mother behalf.id.at,d.
the health care power of attorney at issue in garrison,supra,th,d was not created via a standard form probate code section document,as was the one before us.however,the garrison health care power of attorney provided that it was created under probate code section et,which,as stated previously,also applies to the health care power of attorney sarah executed.garrison,supra,th at,d.moreover,the garrison health care power of attorney also provided,as does the one sarah signed,that the daughter was authorized to make health care decisions for the mother.ibid.thus,the interpretation of the pertinent document provisions and the applicable probate code provisions is essentially the same under both garrison and the case before us.
in undertaking its analysis,the garrison court noted that california law favors enforcement of arbitration agreements.citations.garrison,supra,th at,d.however,the court also made plain that the right to compel arbitration nonetheless depends upon the existence of a valid agreement to arbitrate between the parties.citations.ibid.it then showed why a valid agreement to arbitrate was present.
the garrison court opined that three provisions of the health care decisions law governed the outcome of the case.garrison,supra,th at,d.it first cited probate code section,which states in pertinent part a an agent designated in the power of attorney may make health care decisions for the principal to the same extent the principal could make health care decisions if the principal had the capacity to do so.b the agent may also make decisions that may be effective after the principal death id.at,d.next,the court cited probate code section,which provides in pertinent part an agent shall make a health care decision in accordance with the principal individual health care instructions,if
