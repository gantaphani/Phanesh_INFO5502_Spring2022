introduction 
a group of five pilots,william mann,wayne dalland,edward marino,james weir,gary shepard,and charles musick the pilots,which prevailed in a grievance arbitration,appeal summary judgment against them and in favor of a different group of pilots,donald steward,david schriner,george dickman,donny griffin,william atwater,richard dunn,and david mckennan the pilots,which sued to have the court set aside the arbitrator award.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the judgment of the district court setting aside the award and remanding the grievance to the airtran airways pilots system board of adjustment board.
ii.background and procedural history 
in,a group which included the and pilots joined together to start their own airline,destination sun airways.in september,they entered into an agreement that ranked them for seniority purposes,using the dates on which they purchased destination sun stock to fix their ranking.by the terms of the agreement,the ranking would continue in effect should destination sun become another airline.
in,destination sun and another airline,conquest airlines,joined together to form a new airline,conquest sun airlines.it is disputed whether conquest sun ever honored the destination sun seniority agreement.
in,airtran airways,purchased conquest sun.rather than simply hiring all of conquest sun pilots,airtran interviewed all of the pilots and hired only some.airtran held its first pilot training class in july.the former conquest sun pilots who attended this first training class are the pilots.airtran held its second training class in august,which the pilots attended.airtran fixed its pilots seniority rankings by the date on which the pilots began training.thus,the pilots were ranked above the pilots for airtran seniority purposes.
in,airtran pilots formed a union,the airtran pilots association atpa or the association.all the pilots involved in this case were members of the atpa.in april,airtran and the atpa entered into a collective bargaining agreement cba.the cba contained provisions governing the integration of two airlines should airtran merge with another airline,provisions governing seniority rankings,and provisions governing how airtran and the atpa would resolve employee grievances.the grievance provisions provide several steps for resolution of disputes.the first two involve discussions between airtran and the employee,whether or not represented by the union,and call for airtran vice president of flight operations to render a decision on the grievance.the cba then provides 
if the decision of the vice operations or his designee is not satisfactory,the president of the association,or his designee,may within seven calendar days after the receipt of the decision,appeal the grievance in writing to the airtran airways pilots system board of adjustment.the pilots system board of adjustment will consist of two members appointed by the association and two members appointed by the company.both parties will provide each other the names of the system board members.
a majority vote of all members of the system board of adjustment will be competent to make a decision and decisions at the board in all cases properly referable to it will be final and binding upon the parties hereto.
in the event of a deadlock in rendering a decision on any case before the board,the company and association will,within ten working days,select a mutually agreeable arbitrator to sit as a neutral member of the board to make the decision.the arbitrator will render his decision within sixty calendar days of final testimony.
shortly after the cba took effect,the pilots filed a grievance under the cba seeking to have airtran recognize and follow the destination sun seniority ranking,pursuant to the cba merger protection provisions.the parties were unable to settle the grievance in the first two steps,and the pilots apparently found the vice president of flight operations decision unsatisfactory.
just after the grievance was filed,airtran merged with valujet airlines,and the new company kept the name airtran.valujet pilots had recently become members of the national pilots association npa.after the merger,atpa pilots also became members of the npa,and the npa and airtran entered a collective bargaining agreement identical to the cba.an airtran pilot,warzocha,sued airtran and the npa in a separate case regarding the integration of the seniority rankings of airtran and valujet pilots.the parties to warzocha suit agreed to settle the suit with binding arbitration.in the settlement agreement,they agreed that 
the seniority integration arbitration does not include arbitration of any grievance currently pending by any former airways flight deck crew member relating to destination sun.those grievances will be arbitrated in separate proceedings,if necessary,and any decision rendered in a destination sun arbitration hearing which affects seniority will be implemented subsequent to the seniority integration arbitration.
after warzocha seniority integration arbitration was complete,the pilots contacted the npa to begin resolution of their grievance.the pilots refused to follow the process outlined in the cba,insisting that the settlement agreement in warzocha case entitled them to forego the contractual procedure and proceed instead before a single arbitrator.the npa initially insisted that the grievance be processed according to the cba,but eventually took the position that,as the pilots were represented by their own counsel,the npa would not oppose foregoing the contractual procedure,if airtran consented to it.airtran apparently consented,and the grievance was scheduled to be heard by a single arbitrator.
the parties agree that the arbitrator did not send notice of the arbitration to the pilots,who stood to lose some of their seniority by the arbitration.beyond this,the facts are in some dispute as to the notice the pilots actually received of the arbitration hearing.the parties agree that two of the pilots actually attended the arbitration hearing.one was donny griffin,whom airtran called as a witness at the hearing.the other was david mckennan,a attorney as well as a pilot.the undisputed evidence shows that mckennan learned of the hearing by a chance meeting with the npa grievance chairman.at the hearing,mckennan objected to the arbitrator jurisdiction and to the fact that several pilots who would be affected by the arbitration were neither present nor represented at the hearing.it is also undisputed that,at the hearing,there was a session between the npa,airtran,and counsel for the pilots,which mckennan was not allowed to attend.the facts are in dispute,however,as to mckennan role at the hearing the pilots provide affidavit testimony that he presented testimony,made legal arguments,and witnesses,while mckennan provides an affidavit stating that he did none of these things,and that he did not represent anyone other than himself.the pilots also present evidence that donald steward had notice of the hearing,but opted not to go,as his interests were represented by griffin and mckennan.steward provides an affidavit disputing this.finally,the pilots present affidavit evidence that sometime prior to the hearing,a notice containing the time,date,and place of the hearing was posted on the npa bulletin board at airtran headquarters,where notices of previous arbitrations had been posted.the pilots provide the affidavit of the npa grievance chairman,who swears that he knows of no such notice being posted.
after the hearing,the arbitrator decided that the collective bargaining agreement incorporated the destination sun seniority agreement,and revised the airtran seniority rankings accordingly.
the pilots,whose seniority rights were negatively affected by the arbitrator award,filed this action in the district court asking the district court to vacate the arbitrator award.the parties filed for summary judgment,and the district court granted the pilots motion,setting aside the arbitration award.while the district court concluded that the arbitrator had not overstepped the bounds of the cba,as his ruling was arguably within the essence of the cba,it found that the pilots had not been given the notice due them under the railway labor act rla,first j.rather than remanding the case to the arbitrator,the district court remanded the case to the board,because the court concluded that the settlement agreement in warzocha case was insufficient to overcome the contractual grievance procedure in the cba.
the pilots appeal,and the pilots.
iii.issues on appeal and contentions of the parties 
on appeal,the pilots raise three issues.first,they contend that the district court erred when it concluded that the rla statutory due notice provision,first j,requires all involved employees to receive actual notice of the hearing of grievances affecting them.they contend that constructive notice satisfies the due notice requirement,and that the notice posted on the npa bulletin board provided constructive notice.the pilots maintain that under the circumstances the rla requires at least actual,if not formal,notice of the hearing 
second,the pilots contend that there are disputed issues of material fact,making summary judgment inappropriate.
third,the pilots contend that the district court erred when it concluded that the grievance must be arbitrated by the board rather than by a single arbitrator.they argue that the settlement in warzocha case,which stated that the grievance would be arbitrated in separate proceedings,bound the npa and airtran to forego the contractual grievance procedure and proceed before a single arbitrator.at ex.the pilots argue that the warzocha settlement language was ambiguous,and thus was insufficient to overcome the contractual grievance procedure calling for a hearing by the board.
iv.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same familiar standards as the district court.hallum provident life acc.ins,cir.
discussion 
as we noted above,the issues on appeal deal with the due notice requirement of first j and the proper forum for the grievance on remand.we will consider the issues in turn.
a.the railway labor act due notice requirement 
under the terms of the rla,a court may set aside the award of an adjustment board for one of only three reasons the board did not follow the requirements of the rla,exceeded its jurisdiction,or acted fraudulently or corruptly first p henry delta air lines,cir.here,the district court set the award aside because it found that the arbitrator,who sat in place of the board,failed to comply with the rla due notice requirement.in reviewing this conclusion,we must address an issue that the district court did not explicitly address whether the due notice requirement applies to proceedings before airline adjustment boards.we will then turn to the question of what type of notice satisfies the due notice requirement.
does first j due notice requirement apply to proceedings before an airline board of adjustment 
we have never considered whether the due notice requirement of first j applies to proceedings before an airline board of adjustment.the district court did apply the statutory due notice requirement in this case,but did so without discussing whether the requirement should apply.based on our review of the history and purposes of the rla,we conclude that it should.
when congress extended the railway labor act to the airline industry,it expressly stated that,which contains the statutory due notice requirement,did not apply to proceedings before airline adjustment boards.see also whitaker american airlines,cir discussing the extension of the rla to the airline industry.but,when the supreme court confronted the question of whether there was a federal cause of action to enforce an award of an airline adjustment board,it looked to the entirety of the rla,rather than just those provisions which congress expressly applied to the airline industry.international assocation of machinists central airlines,d.the court concluded that congress intended that the awards of airline adjustment boards be enforceable by a federal cause of action,based on the rla purpose of quickly and finally resolving employee grievances to avoid strikes.id.at.at.the court went on to suggest that courts confronted with similar questions in the future should consult other provisions of rla which do not expressly apply to airline adjustment boards 
the provisions of a codified at contract,such as those governing the composition of the adjustment board,the procedures to be employed as to notice and hearing or for breaking deadlocks,or the finality to be accorded board awards,are to be judged against the act and its purposes and enforced or invalidated in a fashion consistent with the statutory scheme.
id.at.at emphasis added.
only one published opinion has addressed the issue of whether the statutory due notice requirement ought to apply to airline adjustment board proceedings.in that opinion,the court considered whether a group of pilots would be given notice of a hearing before an airline adjustment board.air line pilots association international texas int l airlines.the court followed the supreme court admonition to look to the notice requirements which the rla imposes on railroad adjustment boards.id.quoting international ass of machinists,at.at.the texas int l court noted,as the supreme court had,that congress purpose was to extend the same benefits and obligations to air carriers and their employees that already applied to the railroad industry when it called for the formation of airline adjustment boards.texas int l.at,citing international association of machinists,at.at.it noted that other courts had applied other aspects of to airline adjustment boards to further this purpose,and concluded that this purpose called for the due notice requirement to apply to airline adjustment boards.texas int l.at,citing with approval international union united automobile,aircraft agricultural implement workers delta air lines,stating that makes applicable to air carriers and their employees.we agree with the texas int l court analysis based on the rla purpose of providing quick and final resolution of grievances,and on the supreme court suggestion in international association of machinists,at.at,we conclude that first j due notice requirement applies to proceedings conducted by airline adjustment boards 
what kind of notice does the due notice provision require 
the due notice provision requires an adjustment board to give due notice of all hearings to the employee or employees and the carrier or carriers involved in any disputes submitted to them.first j.an employee is involved for purposes of first j if he would be adversely affected by the board decision.estes union terminal,cir.here,the pilots stood to have their seniority rankings shifted downward.because seniority affects,among other things,the airline consideration of which pilots to award jobs to when there are fewer assignments than there are pilots,a lowered seniority ranking is an adverse effect.thus,the pilots were involved employees and entitled to due notice of the grievance hearing.
the supreme court has said that due notice is a flexible standard which takes into account the realities of the relationships between the employer,the union,and the employee.see elgin,ry.burley.elgin ii.in the usual case,the union represents the employee before the board.id.at.at estes,at.thus,in the usual case,when the board gives the union,rather than the employee,notice of the hearing,courts will not automatically set aside the board award for failure to give due notice to the employee.see,public law bd,cir upholding board award against due notice challenge where complaining employee had authorized union to represent him and to receive notices from the board,and the board had provided the union with notice of the grievance hearing.but see meeks illinois cent.gulf,cir setting aside board award where board provided notice to union,but union failed to give notice to employee cole erie lackawanna ry,cir setting aside board award where board provided union representing employee with notice,and employee knew when the hearing was to take place,but evidence showed that employee did not grasp the significance of the hearing.
