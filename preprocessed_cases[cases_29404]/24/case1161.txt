raymond muller filed a grievance against his employer,the government printing office,which was referred to an arbitrator pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement.the arbitrator dismissed the grievance as not arbitrable,on the ground that a deadline for holding a hearing,required by the agreement,had passed.we conclude that the arbitrator erred the contractual provision does not require dismissal of the grievance in the event of noncompliance with the deadline.the deadline is merely a nonbinding housekeeping rule to encourage timely arbitration,one that is addressed to the arbitrator as well as the parties.there is no past practice requiring dismissal under the circumstances of this case.we accordingly reverse and remand with instructions to address muller grievance on the merits.
background 
muller is an employee of the government printing office gpo or agency and a member of the international brotherhood of teamsters,local s union union,which belongs to the joint council of unions.the joint council of unions and gpo are signatories to a collective bargaining agreement,a master labor management agreement master agreement,which creates a negotiated grievance procedure for gpo employees to contest adverse employment actions as an alternative to appeal to the merit systems protection board mspb.the master agreement specifies that resolution of adverse employment actions under the negotiated procedure can proceed to arbitration if not resolved at the agency level.
article vii of the master agreement sets forth various rules for the arbitration process.section.of the master agreement stipulates that,i f the grievance is not resolved at the agency level the union may inform the director,labor and employee relations service of its decision to proceed to arbitration.arbitration must be invoked within days this written statement must be submitted to the director within days after the decision of the joint grievance committee of agency and union officials.sections.and establish the rules of arbitrator selection,including the possibility that either the union or the agency may begin the arbitrator selection process and that the federal mediation and conciliation service fmcs can step in if the process stalls.section.states that t he arbitration hearing will take place within months after filing of the notice of decision to proceed to arbitration,unless the parties mutually agree to an extension of the time limit.section.e specifies that a n arbitrator will render his decision as quickly as possible,but not later than calendar days after the close of the record.
muller was reassigned between divisions of the gpo,resulting in demotion to a lower grade and a reduction in pay,an adverse employment action under.muller elected to challenge his reassignment through the negotiated grievance procedure,and,after proceeding through the steps of review required by the master agreement,the agency issued a decision denying the grievance.the union timely invoked arbitration on february,and requested and received a list of arbitrators from the fmcs on april.the union and the gpo jointly selected marvin feldman as arbitrator,and feldman was notified of his selection on may.the arbitrator thus received the case approximately three weeks prior to june,the date on which the deadline expired.the arbitrator wrote the union and the agency on june,to suggest the hearing be held july or august.
on june,four months to the day from the date that arbitration had been invoked,the gpo wrote to the union and the arbitrator to ask that the arbitration be closed for failure to comply with the deadline.the arbitrator requested briefs from both sides on the question of arbitrability and ultimately issued a decision on september,dismissing muller grievance as not arbitrable,because the master agreement requires that the arbitration hearing take place within four months after filing of the notice of decision to proceed to arbitration,unless the parties mutually agree to an extension of that time limit.the arbitrator concluded that noncompliance with the hearing deadline automatically terminated the grievance but,at the same time,found that the union was primarily responsible for the delay.t here is ample evidence in the record,although none is required contractually,that the union,not fmcs,was the direct and primary cause for the failure of the parties to meet the requirement.
muller petitions for review,arguing that the arbitrator decision to close arbitration and dismiss the grievance was arbitrary,capricious,and an abuse of discretion,and was not supported by substantial evidence.muller requests that the arbitrator decision be set aside.we have jurisdiction under.f and b and a.
discussion 
under e,part of the civil service reform act of csra,a federal employee seeking to challenge disciplinary action by his employing agency may appeal his claim to the mspb or,alternatively,take his claim to an independent arbitrator under a negotiated grievance procedure created by collective bargaining agreement.the arbitrator decision is reviewed by this court under f.section f establishes that arbitrations of such grievances are reviewed under the same standard of review that applies to appeals from decisions of the mspb.the statute provides that,i n matters covered under sections and of this title which have been raised under the negotiated grievance procedure in accordance with this section,section of this title shall apply to the award of an arbitrator in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the matter had been decided by the board.f see also cornelius nutt,newman corrado.muller claim arises under,as it concerns a reduction in grade and a reduction in pay,so applies here.
section c requires this court to set aside any agency action,findings,or conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence.c see also appleberry dep t of homeland.the standard of review under differs from the standard that applies to arbitrations conducted under the federal arbitration act,et,where an arbitrator decision can be set aside only under narrow circumstances,such as corruption or misconduct on the part of the arbitrator.a see also hall street,mattel,first options of,kaplan.this difference,with substantially less deference granted to arbitrations of the grievances of federal employees,is consistent with the purpose of the csra,which created arbitration defined by collective bargaining agreement as a parallel alternative to dispute resolution at the mspb.congress clearly intended that an arbitrator would apply the same substantive rules as the board does in reviewing an agency disciplinary decision.cornelius,u.at.
the csra makes clear that employees and their unions are obliged to invoke arbitration promptly,or their claims are forfeited.see,e an employee shall be deemed to have exercised his option under this subsection to raise a matter under the negotiated grievance procedure at such time as the employee timely files a grievance in writing in accordance with the provisions of the parties negotiated grievance procedure emphasis added.as the government points out,failure to comply with the deadline for invoking arbitration can result in dismissal of an employee grievance.in appleberry,we upheld an arbitrator dismissal of a federal employee claim because it was not properly raised under the negotiated grievance procedure in the first place,at,the employee having failed to invoke arbitration within days of the agency denial of her grievance,as required by the controlling collective bargaining agreement,id.at.
however,the csra does not itself create any statutory timing requirements that apply after arbitration has been invoked.instead,arbitration of grievances is allowed to proceed under a timetable and procedural rules set by the governing collective bargaining agreement.we have noted that c ourts should be careful not to judicialize the arbitration process.arbitration normally envisions that each case be decided on i
