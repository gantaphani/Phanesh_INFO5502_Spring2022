this mandamus proceeding requires us to resolve an issue of importance to judges and practitioners alike does a district court possess the authority to compel an unwilling party to participate in,and share the costs of,mediation conducted by a private mediator we hold that a court may order mandatory mediation pursuant to an explicit statutory provision or local rule.we further hold that where,as here,no such authorizing medium exists,a court nonetheless may order mandatory mediation through the use of its inherent powers as long as the case is an appropriate one and the order contains adequate safeguards.because the mediation order here at issue lacks such safeguards although it does not fall far short,we vacate it and remand the matter for further proceedings.
background 
in january,superaqueduct partners entered into a master agreement with the puerto rico aqueduct and sewer authority prasa to construct,operate,and maintain the north coast superaqueduct project the project.granted subcontracts for various portions of the work,including a subcontract for construction management to dick of puerto rico,a subcontract for the operation and maintenance of the project to thames water international,thames water,and a subcontract for the fabrication of pipe to atlantic pipe apc.after the project had been built,a segment of the pipeline burst.incurred significant costs in repairing the damage.not surprisingly,it sought to recover those costs from other parties.in response,one of prasa insurers filed a declaratory judgment action in a local court to determine whether claims were covered under its policy.the litigation ballooned,soon involving a number of parties and a myriad of issues above and beyond insurance coverage.
on april,the hostilities spilled over into federal court.two entities beneficially interested in the master group international and chiang,patel yerby,collectively cpa sued,thames water,and various insurers in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico,seeking remuneration for consulting services rendered in connection with repairs to the project.a googol of claims,counterclaims,and complaints followed.some of these were brought against apc the petitioner here.to complicate matters,one of the defendants moved to dismiss on grounds that,inter alia,cpa had failed to join an indispensable party whose presence would destroy diversity jurisdiction,and the existence of the parallel proceeding in the local court counseled in favor of abstention.
while this motion was pending before the district court,asked that the case be referred to mediation and suggested professor eric green as a suitable mediator.the district court granted the motion over apc objection and ordered mediation to proceed before professor green.the court pronounced mediation likely to conserve judicial resources directed all parties to undertake mediation in good faith stayed discovery pending completion of the mediation and declared that participation in the mediation would not prejudice the parties positions the pending motion or the litigation as a whole.the court also stated that if mediation failed to produce a global settlement,the case would proceed to trial.
after moving unsuccessfully for reconsideration of the mediation order,apc sought relief by way of mandamus.its petition alleged that the district court did not have the authority to require mediation especially in light of unresolved questions as to the court jurisdiction and,in all events,could not force apc to pay a share of the expenses of the mediation.we invited the other parties and the district judge to respond.see fed.b.several entities including,and thames water opposed the petition.two others defendants united states fidelity guaranty company and united surety and indemnity company filed a brief in support of apc.we assigned the case to the oral argument calendar and stayed the contemplated mediation pending our review.
prior to argument in this court,two notable developments occurred.first,the district court considered and rejected the challenges to its exercise of jurisdiction.second,apc rejected an offer by to pay its share of the mediator fees.
ii.jurisdiction 
in an effort to shut off further debate,the respondents asseverate that mandamus is improper because apc will not suffer irreparable harm in the absence of such relief.they rest this asseveration on the notion that m andamus is ordinarily appropriate only in those rare cases in which the issuance or nonissuance of an order presents a question anent the limits of judicial power,poses some special risk of irreparable harm to the appellant,and is palpably erroneous.united states horn,cir.the problem,however,is that these limitations typically apply only to supervisory mandamus.id.at.in the tiny class of cases in which advisory mandamus is appropriate,irreparable harm need not be shown.id.at.
we believe that this case is fit for advisory mandamus because the extent of a trial court power to order mandatory mediation presents a systemically important issue as to which this court has not yet spoken.see in re prov.journal,cir discussing criteria for advisory mandamus.moreover,that issue is capable of significant repetition prior to effective review.see jennifer,comment,compelled participation in innovative pretrial proceedings,nw,noting that,as a practical matter,lawyers often are unable to challenge pretrial innovations even when they may be invalid.that fact militates in favor of advisory mandamus.see horn,at.we conclude,therefore,that invoking advisory mandamus is prudent under the circumstances.consequently,the existence vel non of irreparable harm is a.we turn,then,to the merits.
iii.the merits 
there are four potential sources of judicial authority for ordering mandatory mediation of pending cases,namely,a the court local rules,b an applicable statute,c the federal rules of civil procedure,and d the court inherent powers.because the district court did not identify the basis of its assumed authority,we consider each of these sources.
a.the local rules.
a district court local rules may provide an appropriate source of authority for ordering parties to participate in mediation.see rhea,cir per curiam.in puerto rico,however,the local rules contain only a single reference to any form of alternative dispute resolution adr.that reference is embodied in the district court amended civil justice expense and delay reduction plan cjr plan.see app.iii.
the district court adopted the cjr plan on june,in response to the directive contained in the civil justice reform act of cjra.rule v of the cjr plan states 
pursuant to b,this court shall adopt a method of alternative dispute resolution adr through mediation by a judicial officer.
such a program would allow litigants to obtain from an impartial third judicial officer as flexible,dispute resolution process to facilitate negotiations among the parties to help them reach settlement.
app.iii.in addition to specifying who may act as a mediator,rule v also limns the proper procedure for mediation sessions and assures confidentiality.see id.
the respondents concede that the mediation order in this case falls outside the boundaries of the mediation program envisioned by rule v.it does so most noticeably because it involves mediation before a private mediator,not a judicial officer.seizing upon this discrepancy,apc argues that the local rules limit the district court in this respect,and that the court exceeded its authority thereunder by issuing a mediation order,one that contemplates the intervention of a private mediator.the respondents counter by arguing that the rule does not bind the district court because,notwithstanding the unambiguous promise of the cjr plan which declares that the district court shall adopt a method of alternative dispute resolution,no such program has been adopted to date.
this is a powerful argument.apc does not contradict the respondents assurance that the relevant portion of the cjr plan has remained unimplemented,and we take judicial notice that there is no formal,ongoing adr program in the puerto rico federal district court.because that is so,we conclude that the district of puerto rico has no local rule in force that dictates the permissible characteristics of mediation orders.consequently,apc argument founders 
b.the adr act.
there is only one potential source of statutory authority for ordering mandatory mediation here the alternative dispute resolution act of adr act.congress passed the adr act to promote the utilization of alternative dispute resolution methods in the federal courts and to set appropriate guidelines for their use.the act lists mediation as an appropriate adr process.id.a.moreover,it sanctions the participation of professional neutrals from the private sector as mediators.id.b.finally,the act requires district courts to obtain litigants consent only when they order arbitration,id.a,not when they order the use of other adr mechanisms such as mediation.
despite the broad sweep of these provisions,the act is quite clear that some form of the adr procedures it endorses must be adopted in each judicial district by local rule.see id.b directing each district court to devise and implement its own alternative dispute resolution program,by local rule adopted under section a,to encourage and promote the use of alternative dispute resolution in its district.in the absence of such local rules,the adr act itself does not authorize any specific court to use a particular adr mechanism.because the district of puerto rico has not yet complied with the act mandate,the mediation order here at issue can not be justified under the adr act.
the respondents essay an end run around this lacuna they contend borrowing a phrase from the court below that the spirit of the adr act authorizes the mediation order because the act was intended to promote experimentation with adr techniques.we reject this attempt to press the adr act into service by indirection.
although the adr act was designed to promote the use of adr techniques,congress chose a very path it granted each judicial district,rather than each individual judge,the authority to craft an appropriate adr program.in other words,congress permitted experimentation,but only within the disciplining format of local rules adopted with notice and a full opportunity for public comment.see b.to say that the act authorized each district judge to disregard a adr plan or the absence of one and fashion innovative procedures for use in specific cases is simply too much of a stretch.
we add,however,that although the respondents can not use the adr act as a justification,neither can apc use it as a nullification.noting that the act requires the adoption of local rules establishing a formal adr program,apc equates the absence of such rules with the absence of power to employ an adr procedure say,mediation in a specific case.but that is wishful thinking if one assumes that district judges possessed the power to require mediation prior to the passage of the adr act,there is nothing in the act that strips them of that power.after all,even the adoption of a federal procedural rule does not implicitly abrogate a district court inherent power to act merely because the rule touches upon the same subject matter.see chambers nasco,d rejecting the argument that the adoption of various provisions of the civil rules eliminated the district court inherent power to impose other sanctions link wabash,d explaining that neither the permissive language of.b nor the policy behind it justified a conclusion that it was meant to limit the district courts inherent power to dismiss a case for want of prosecution.
the case before us is analogous to chambers and link.even though congress may cabin the district courts inherent powers,its intention to do so must be clear and unmistakable.see weinberger,d.not so here we know of nothing in either the adr act or the policies that undergird it that can be said to restrict the district courts authority to engage in the deployment of adr procedures.hence,we conclude that where,as here,there are no implementing local rules,the adr act neither authorizes nor prohibits the entry of a mandatory mediation order.
c.the civil rules.
the respondents next argue that the district court possessed the authority to require mediation by virtue of the federal rules of civil procedure.they concentrate their attention on,which states in pertinent part that the court may take appropriate action with respect to settlement and the use of special procedures to assist in resolving the dispute when authorized by statute or local rule.c.but the words when authorized by statute or local rule are a frank limitation on the district courts authority to order mediation thereunder and we must adhere to that circumscription.see schlagenhauf holder,d explaining that the civil rules should not be expanded by disregarding plainly expressed limitations.because there is no statute or local rule authorizing mandatory private mediation in the district of puerto rico,see supra parts iii a b,rule c does not assist the respondents cause 
inherent powers.
even apart from positive law,district courts have substantial inherent power to manage and control their calendars.see link,at.see generally brockton sav.bank peat,marwick,mitchell,cir explaining that the rules of civil procedure do not completely describe and limit the power of district courts.this inherent power takes many forms.see.b providing that judges may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law and applicable rules.by way of illustration,a district court may use its inherent power to compel represented clients to attend pretrial settlement conferences,even though such a practice is not specifically authorized in the civil rules.see heileman brewing joseph oat,cir en banc.
of course,a district court inherent powers are not infinite.there are at least four limiting principles.first,inherent powers must be used in a way reasonably suited to the enhancement of the court processes,including the orderly and expeditious disposition of pending cases.coyante ports,cir.second,inherent powers can not be exercised in a manner that contradicts an applicable statute or rule.chambers,at.third,the use of inherent powers must comport with procedural fairness.id.at.and,finally,inherent powers must be exercised with restraint and discretion.id.at.
at one time,the inherent power of judges to compel unwilling parties to participate in adr procedures was a issue for legal scholars.compare,supra at arguing that inherent power should not be used to compel participation in pretrial settlement proceedings,with lucille ponte,putting mandatory summary jury trial back on the docket recommendations on the exercise of judicial authority,fordham,urging the opposite conclusion.although many federal district courts have forestalled further debate by adopting local rules that authorize specific adr procedures and outlaw others,permitting mandatory mediation me.permitting only voluntary mediation.permitting mandatory summary jury trials but only voluntary mediation,the district of puerto rico is not among them.thus,we have no choice but to address the question.
we begin our inquiry by examining the case law.in strandell jackson county,cir,the seventh circuit held that a district court does not possess inherent power to compel participation in a summary jury trial in the court view.occupied the field and prevented a district court from forcing an unwilling litigant to be sidetracked from the normal course of litigation.id.at.but the group that spearheaded the subsequent revision of rule explicitly rejected that interpretation.see,advisory committee note amendment the amended rule does not attempt to resolve questions as to the extent a court would be authorized to require adr proceedings as an exercise of its inherent powers.thus,we do not find strandell persuasive on this point.
the strandell court also expressed concern that summary jury trials would undermine traditional discovery and privilege rules by requiring certain disclosures prior to an actual trial.at.we find this concern unwarranted.because a summary jury trial like a mediation does not require any disclosures beyond what would be required in the ordinary course of discovery
