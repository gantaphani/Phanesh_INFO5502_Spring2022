petitioner paul woolls woolls seeks a writ of mandate to set aside respondent superior court order denying his petition to vacate an arbitration award obtained by real parties in interest thomas turner and thomas turner dba t t construction collectively,turner.woolls moved to vacate the award on the ground the arbitration agreement failed to comply with business and professions code section 
section requires arbitration provisions in contracts for work on residential property of one to four units to satisfy certain disclosure requirements,including an advisement to the consumer that he or she is giving up the right to have the dispute litigated in a court or jury trial,subd.b.the essential issue presented is the consequence of an arbitration agreement noncompliance with section.
we conclude the noncompliant arbitration provision can not be enforced against any person other than the licensee,subd.c.therefore,we grant woolls petition for writ of mandate.
factual and procedural background 
the two arbitration provisions.
on october,woolls,a homeowner,and turner,a contractor,entered into a written agreement for the renovation and expansion of woolls single family residence the agreement.the agreement,signed by the parties,contained the following arbitration provision all claims,disputes,and other matters in question between the parties to this agreement,arising out of or relating to this agreement or the breach thereof,shall be decided by mediation and then arbitration in accordance with the construction industry arbitration rules of the american arbitration association then obtaining unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.notice of demand for arbitration shall be filed in writing with the other party of this agreement and with the american arbitration association.italics added.
on the same date,woolls and turner also initialed the cover sheet of a second,unsigned document which contained specifications for the project specifications.the specifications contained the following arbitration provision claims or disputes between the contractor and the owner arising from this agreement that are not settled through negotiation shall be offered for mediation according to the rules of the american arbitration association.disagreements not settled by mediation shall be offered for arbitration as per the rules of the american arbitration association.work shall not be halted or slowed by the contractor during negotiation,mediation,or arbitration of such disputes.italics added.
neither of these arbitration provisions included an advisement that by agreeing to arbitration,a party is waiving the right to a court or jury trial.
disputes arise and lead to turner instituting arbitration proceedings against woolls.
during the course of the work,disputes arose among woolls,turner and stock building supply of california dba terry lumber terry lumber regarding turner performance of the terms of the contract and terry lumber billing for building materials.ultimately,woolls replaced turner with other contractors to complete the work.
on or about october,terry lumber recorded a mechanics lien against woolls property for the sum of.
on january,terry lumber filed suit against turner and woolls.the first cause of action against turner pled a breach of contract.the second cause of action against woolls sought foreclosure of the mechanics lien.
on february,woolls answered the complaint and filed a against terry lumber and turner.
turner initiated an arbitration proceeding against woolls pursuant to the arbitration clause in the construction contract.
the arbitration proceeds,notwithstanding woolls objections,and concludes in an award for turner.
on march,prior to the start of the arbitration,woolls submitted written objections to the arbitrator,contending the arbitration agreement failed to comply with section in various particulars so as to render the arbitration clause unenforceable against woolls.
despite a pending motion by woolls to stay the arbitration,and despite woolls objections to the arbitrator,the arbitrator proceeded with the hearing on march through.according to the writ petition,woolls participated in the arbitration to preserve his rights and to prevent a runaway default judgment.
on april,the arbitrator issued an award,directing woolls to pay to turner,as well as administrative fees,the arbitrator compensation and expenses.
woolls unsuccessfully moves to vacate the award for noncompliance with section.
turner filed a petition to confirm the award and woolls filed a petition to vacate the award.woolls again argued the arbitration agreement did not comply with section,rendering it unenforceable.
on august,after hearing the matter,the trial court issued an extensive minute order,concluding the arbitration provision was enforceable against woolls,despite the absence of full compliance with the cautionary statements set forth in section.the ruling provides 
the parties do not dispute that they entered into two contracts for the construction on this project,both of which contained arbitration provisions.the parties also do not seriously dispute that neither of these arbitration provisions complies strictly with the requirements set forth in business professions code 
this statute,although enacted in,has not yet been interpreted in any published appellate decision.woolls argues the proper interpretation of section,subdivision c is that an arbitration provision which does not comply with the prior subdivision regarding font size and language can not be enforced against anyone other than the licensee.turner argues that the use in subdivision c of the term may permits discretion of the part of the trial court with respect to the enforcement of the provision,and that circumstances here dictate against strict enforcement of this provision and in favor of enforcing the arbitration provision against the home owner.there is a strong public policy in favor of arbitration of disputes and any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable disputes should generally be resolved in favor of arbitration.citation.when interpreting agreements to arbitrate,the court should generally liberally interpret such an agreement,and arbitration should be ordered unless the agreement clearly does not apply to the dispute in question.citation.this statute,as it a ffects the enforceability of arbitration agreements,presumably should also be read in this context of favoring arbitration.
in interpreting a statute,the court begins with the language of the statute as the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.accordingly,where the word may is used in a statute,it has been held that the word may be read to make the provisions permissive,rather than mandatory.citation.
here,the statute instructs that the arbitration provision may not be enforced against a particular party,not that it shall not be enforced.in these circumstances,the court finds that the use of the term may gives rise to a permissive meaning,and may be construed to read that the court may enforce a arbitration provision if the circumstances so warrant.such circumstances are present here.the statute appears primarily directed to putting a residential consumer on notice that he or she is giving up any rights to a jury trial to an appeal of the arbitrator decision.business and professions code b.here,however,woolls is a licensed attorney,who was fully aware that by signing an arbitration provision,he was waiving his right to a jury trial and his right to appeal.in fact,woolls has testified that he objected to the inclusion of the arbitration provision in the agreements,that the parties actually negotiated this point,and that woolls voluntarily executed the agreement knowing it contained an arbitration provision.moreover,even though woolls raised the issue of fraud in the procurement of the provision at several junctures in the proceeding,he did not raise the issue of the provision technical failure to follow business professions code as a ground for this argument until the first day of the arbitration.instead,woolls has argued all along that he voluntarily signed the agreement,knowing it contained an arbitration provision,but that he agreed to arbitration based on fraudulent statements by turner that turner never had any client complain about his work.he has never argued that he did not fully appreciate the meaning and effect of the arbitration provision.
on the day of the arbitration,rather than pursue his then recognized rights under the business professions code,woolls instead voluntarily participated in the arbitration,and raised his own cross claims.these circumstances indicate enforcement of the arbitration provision against woolls is justified despite the absence of full compliance with the cautionary statements set forth in business professions code.italics added.
after concluding section did not preclude enforcement of the agreement to arbitrate,the trial court continued the matter for a further hearing on woolls claim of fraud in the inducement of the arbitration provision.
on september,woolls filed the instant petition for writ of mandate.three days later,we issued an order to show cause and stayed further proceedings below pending determination of the petition or further order of this court.
contentions 
woolls contends an arbitration provision which fails to comply with section is not enforceable against anyone other than the interpretation of similar disclosure requirements supports the conclusion that noncompliant arbitration provisions should not be enforced against anyone other than the licensee and public policy also supports such a conclusion.
discussion 
the legislature has expressed a strong public policy in favor of arbitration at the same time,arbitration can not be imposed where an arbitration agreement has not been perfected in accordance with statutory requirements.
code of civil procedure section et,as enacted and periodically amended by the legislature,represents a comprehensive statutory scheme regulating private arbitration in this state.moncharsh heily blase cal th,d.through this detailed statutory scheme,the legislature has expressed a strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution.see also express mcmahon,d.federal arbitration act,et,establishes federal policy in favor of arbitration.consequently,courts will indulge every intendment to give effect to such proceedings.citations.moncharsh,supra,at,d.
although arbitration is favored moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d,there is also the recognition that the right to select a judicial forum,arbitration,is a substantial right,not lightly to be deemed waived.citations.chan drexel burnham lambert,d.
toward that end,the legislature has imposed mandatory disclosure requirements for arbitration provisions in various types of contracts.see,contract for work on residential property of one to four units code civ,contract for medical services containing a provision for arbitration of professional negligence claim health,arbitration provision in health care service plan.
here,the legislature sought to ensure that an agreement to arbitrate disputes arising out of a contract for work on residential property of up to four units is obtained through a proper waiver of the right to a judicial forum.in furtherance of that goal,it adopted section to p rohibit the use of a binding arbitration clause in a contract for work on a residential property unless the contract contains a specified disclosure that the binding arbitration clause results in a waiver of the right to a judicial resolution of a dispute concerning the contract.floor analysis,assem.bill reg.sess,italics added.
the pertinent statute.
section,adopted in,imposes certain disclosure requirements in specified residential contracts.the statute provides in relevant part 
a if a contract for work on residential property with four or fewer units contains a provision for arbitration of a dispute between the principals in the transaction,the provision shall be clearly titled arbitration of disputes.
if a provision for arbitration is included in a printed contract,it shall be set out in at least roman boldface type or in contrasting red print in at least roman boldface type,and if the provision is included in a typed contract,it shall be set out in capital letters.
b immediately before the line or space provided for the parties to indicate their assent or nonassent to the arbitration provision described in subdivision a,and immediately following that arbitration provision,the following shall appear 
notice by initialing in the space below you are agreeing to have any dispute arising out of the matters included in the arbitration of disputes provision decided by neutral arbitration as provided by california law and you are giving up any rights you might possess to have the dispute litigated in a court or jury trial.by initialing in the space below you are giving up your judicial rights to discovery and appeal,unless those rights are specifically included in the arbitration of disputes provision.if you refuse to submit to arbitration after agreeing to this provision,you may be compelled to arbitrate under the authority of the business and professions code or other applicable laws.your agreement to this arbitration provision is voluntary.we have read and understand the foregoing and agree to submit disputes arising out of the matters included in the arbitration of disputes provision to neutral arbitration.
if the above provision is included in a printed contract,it shall be set out either in at least roman boldface type or in contrasting red print in at least roman boldface type,and if the provision is included in a typed contract,it shall be set out in capital letters,subds.a,b,italics added.
subdivision c of section specifies the consequence for noncompliance with the statute.it states a provision for arbitration of a dispute between a principal in a contract for work on a residential property with four or fewer units that does not comply with this section may not be enforceable against any person other than the licensee,subd.c,italics added.
the two arbitration provisions herein failed to comply with section.
turner contends the arbitration provisions herein were in substantial compliance with section,and that is sufficient to pass muster.the argument fails.scrutiny of the arbitration provisions in the agreement and in the specifications in light of the requirements of section compels the conclusion they totally failed to comply with section,under any standard.
contrary to the statute,the arbitration provisions were not titled arbitration of disputes,subd.a.the arbitration provision in the agreement bore no title at all.as for the arbitration provision in the specifications,it was simply titled disputes,with no reference to arbitration.
more importantly,the two arbitration provisions lacked the disclosure paragraph set forth in section,subdivision b,which alerts the consumer,inter alia,by initialing in the space below you are giving up any rights you might possess to have the dispute litigated in a court or jury trial.in fact,the arbitration provisions lacked any mention of the waiver of the right to a court or jury trial.in this regard,the agreement simply stated that all disputes shall be decided by mediation and then arbitration.similarly,the specifications provided that disputes between the contractor and the owner arising from this agreement that are not settled through negotiation shall be offered for mediation and that d isagreements not settled by mediation shall be offered for arbitration.in short,the arbitration provisions herein were silent with respect to the waiver of the right to a court or jury trial.
additionally,section requires an arbitration clause to be initialed by the parties in spaces below,subd.b.here,no spaces were provided for the parties initials.as a result,the arbitration provision in the agreement was not separately agreement was simply signed by the parties at the end of the document.likewise,the arbitration provision contained in the specifications was not separately initialed.the specifications themselves were unsigned and solely were initialed by woolls and turner on the cover sheet.
we conclude there was a total failure of the arbitration provisions to comply with section.
noncompliance with section renders the arbitration provisions unenforceable against woolls.
subdivision c of section specifies the consequence for noncompliance with the statute.it states a provision for arbitration of a dispute between a principal in a contract for work on a residential property with four or fewer units that does not comply with this section may not be enforceable against any person other than the licensee,subd.c,italics added.
because the statute provides a noncompliant arbitration may not be enforceable,subd.c,rather than shall not be enforceable,the trial court herein concluded it was vested with discretion to enforce the noncompliant arbitration provisions.thus,the issue is presented as to whether the trial court properly found it had discretion to disregard the arbitration provisions noncompliance with section,or whether a noncompliant arbitration clause is per se unenforceable.
principles of statutory construction.
the touchstone of statutory interpretation is the probable intent of the legislature.when interpreting a statute,we must ascertain legislative intent so as to effectuate the purpose of a particular law.of course our first step in determining that intent is to scrutinize the actual words of the statute,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.california teachers governing bd.of rialto unified school dist.cal th,d.when the words are clear and unambiguous,there is no need for statutory construction or resort to other indicia of legislative intent,such as legislative history.california fed.savings loan city of los angeles cal th,d.but language that appears unambiguous on its face may be shown to have a latent ambiguity if so,a court may turn to customary rules of statutory construction or legislative history for guidance.stanton panish cal d.quarterman kefauver th,d accord,union bank of california superior court th,d.
b.the term may not is prohibitory,not permissive thus,section prohibits enforcement of a noncompliant arbitration provision.
as indicated,section,subdivision c states a noncompliant arbitration provision may not be enforceable against any person other than the licensee,subd.c,italics added.
generally speaking,the word may is can do it if you want,but you are being forced the word shall is way you can do it.see,woodbury th,d ordinarily,the word may connotes a discretionary or permissive act the word shall connotes a mandatory or directory duty.decker registry,th,d generally explaining that may is discretionary,shall is mandatory see also dean kuchel cal d,the word may is at least reasonably susceptible of a permissive meaning rather than mandatory or prohibitory.county of orange bezaire th,d.
here,however,the pertinent language is may not,rather than may section,subdivision c,states a noncompliant arbitration provision may not be enforced against anyone other than the licensee.may not is prohibitory,as opposed to permissive.for example,people torres th,d,which states a witness m ay n ot e xpress an o pinion as to w hether a c rime h as b een c ommitted id.at,d,italics added,then goes on to explain that a witness is prohibit ed from expressing an opinion as to whether a crime has been committed,italics added.
because may not is prohibitory,the plain and commonsense meaning of section,subdivision c is that it prohibits enforcement of a noncompliant arbitration provision against anyone other than the licensee,leaving no room for any exercise of discretion by the trial court.
assuming arguendo the statute is ambiguous,the legislative history confirms enforcement of a noncompliant arbitration provision is prohibited.
assuming arguendo section,subdivision c is ambiguous with respect to whether compliance with the statute is mandatory or merely precatory,we resort to the legislative history for clarification.the legislative history confirms a noncompliant arbitration provision shall not be enforceable against any person other than the licensee.
section was added to the business and professions code by assembly bill reg.sess,which was approved by the governor on september.the final amendments to ab occurred in the senate on august.with the final senate amendments,the wording of the proposed statute,at subdivision c,was a provision for arbitration of a dispute between a principal in a contract for work on a residential property with four or fewer units that does not comply with this section may not be enforceable against any person other than the licensee.amend.to assem.bill reg.sess,italics added.the final vote took place in the assembly on august,when the assembly concurred in the senate amendments.
the bill analysis for the final assembly vote states that the senate amendments,inter alia,p rovide that a provision for arbitration of a dispute between a principal in a contract for work on residential property with four or fewer units shall not be enforceable against any person other than the licensee unless the contract also contains the required disclosure.assem.floor analysis,concurrence in,assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,italics added.
thus,at the time of the final vote on ab,the legislature understood and intended that an arbitration provision which fails to satisfy section shall not be enforceable.
guided by the legislative history,we conclude an arbitration provision which fails to comply with section can not be enforced against any person other than the licensee,subd.c.
analogous case law is in accord.
our conclusion that compliance with section is mandatory is consistent with malek blue cross of cal.th,d,wherein this court construed the arbitration disclosure requirements of health and safety code section.that statute,pertaining to health care service plans,specifies an arbitration agreement shall include certain specified disclosures.health.
we noted that health and safety code section is silent on the effect of noncompliance with its requirements.malek,supra,th at,d.however,to construe the statute as optional would render it ineffective,a construction that we must avoid.moreover,it would be inconsistent with the legislative intent that these disclosures be included in a ny health care service plan that includes terms that require binding arbitration this language evidences an implicit legislative determination that these disclosures must be included in a health care service plan to safeguard against patients unknowingly waiving their constitutional right to a jury trial.section,therefore,establishes the requirements that must be satisfied in order to arbitrate disputes involving a health care service plan.accordingly,even though section is silent on the effect of noncompliance,because the disclosure requirements are mandatory,the failure to comply with those requirements renders an arbitration provision unenforceable.malek,supra,th at,d,first italics added.
here,the disclosure requirements contained in section,subdivisions a and b,are mandatory.section repeatedly provides those provisions shall appear in the contract,subds.a,b.therefore,to construe section as optional would render it ineffective,a construction we must avoid.see malek,supra,th at,d.
consequently,we construe the language in section that a noncompliant arbitration provision may not be enforceable,subd.c,to mean that a failure to comply with section renders an arbitration provision per se unenforceable against any person other than the licensee,subd.c.
enforcement of section herein is not barred by federal law.
turner contends section is preempted by the federal arbitration act et hereafter faa and therefore the arbitration clauses noncompliance with section is not a ground to invalidate the arbitration agreement.as explained below,turner preemption argument is meritless.
turner burden of establishing preemption.
we begin with the premise that a lthough federal law may preempt state law,c ourts are reluctant to infer preemption,and it is the burden of the party claiming that congress intended to preempt state law to prove it.citation.olszewski scripps health cal th,d,accord,marshall bankers life casualty cal th,d.therefore,turner has the laboring oar with respect to the claim of preemption.turner has
