the code of civil procedure empowers arbitrators in certain cases to impose the discovery sanctions available in superior court.in this case,we hold that an arbitrator refusal to impose a discovery sanction provides no ground to vacate the arbitration award,even if the sanction is mandatory under the discovery statutes.
maureen alexander appeals from a judgment confirming an arbitration award in favor of blue cross of california blue cross.alexander contends the award should have been vacated because the arbitrator exceeded his powers by refusing to deem that blue cross had admitted requests for admissions to which it failed to respond.in the published part of our opinion,we reject that argument.in the unpublished part of the opinion,we conclude we are bound by the trial court factual findings that blue cross did not engage in misconduct during arbitration,and that the arbitrator was not biased against alexander.consequently,we affirm the judgment.
background 
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment confirming the arbitration award,as we must siegel prudential ins.th,d,the record discloses the following facts 
alexander had health insurance coverage under a blue cross prudent buyer plan.the plan included a provision for binding arbitration by the american arbitration association according to its commercial rules of arbitration.in september,alexander was involved in an automobile accident that caused her to have neck pain.her primary care physician recommended that she see adey,a neurosurgeon with diablo neurosurgical medical group,to determine the source of the pain.however,alexander was unable to get an immediate appointment with adey and instead saw chen,who belonged to the same medical group and was a participating physician in the blue cross prudent buyer plan.
chen met with alexander in his office for to minutes and asked questions about her physical and mental condition.he then took alexander to an examination room and told her to disrobe to her undergarments and put on a medical gown,which she did.there was no nurse in the examination room.after observing alexander gait and testing her reflexes,chen conducted a sensory pinprick examination on her hands,arms,and back.during this examination,he lightly pricked alexander with a safety pin and asked if she felt the pinprick.he then removed her gown and continued the pinprick test on and below her breasts and down her torso to below her navel.chen did not explain the reason for the pinprick exam,or ask permission to remove alexander gown.however,alexander made no objection during the pinprick exam.
alexander believed chen examination was inappropriate and sexually motivated.she filed complaints with blue cross and the california medical board.she did not sue chen for malpractice.the california medical board took no action against chen.blue cross investigated alexander complaint,and obtained the opinion of an independent neurosurgeon who concluded that the pinprick examination was necessary and appropriate.thus,blue cross did not discipline chen.
unhappy with these results,alexander filed a written demand for arbitration against blue cross,alleging that blue cross had breached its contract with her and was negligent in its investigation of chen.after taking evidence,the arbitrator found against alexander and issued a defense award in favor of blue cross.
alexander primary contention on appeal does not focus on the arbitration award itself,but on the arbitrator discovery orders.the arbitrator had ruled on a series of discovery motions brought by alexander to compel blue cross to answer interrogatories and requests for admission.the arbitrator granted the motions in part,ordering blue cross to respond to the requests for discovery and pay alexander in sanctions.the arbitrator decided that because of its delay in responding,blue cross had waived all objections except the attorneyclient privilege to nearly all the requests for discovery.however,the arbitrator did not grant alexander request to treat her requests for admissions as admitted.instead,he ordered blue cross to respond to those requests without objection.see,subd.k.
after the arbitrator issued his final award,alexander filed a petition in superior court to vacate the award.blue cross filed a to confirm the award.the petition to vacate alleged that the arbitrator exceeded his powers by not adhering to california discovery law the arbitrator engaged in misconduct showing a bias in favor of blue cross and blue cross engaged in misconduct by withholding information during discovery.
the trial court denied the petition to vacate and granted the petition to confirm the award.the court found that the arbitrator did not exceed the scope of his powers the arbitrator was not biased and did not engage in misconduct and blue cross did not engage in misconduct.alexander filed a timely notice of appeal.
