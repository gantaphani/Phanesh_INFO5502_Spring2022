in this case,we consider a provision of the charter of the city and county of san francisco that requires disputes between the city and county of san francisco the city and unions representing firefighters and other public safety officers,after bargaining to impasse,to be submitted to binding arbitration.an exception to this binding arbitration requirement is any rule or policy necessary to ensure compliance with laws.charter,g.we are called on to decide whether a rule changing the method by which applicants are selected for promotion in the fire department falls within this exception.we must also decide the proper standard for reviewing the city determination,a topic that was addressed at length by the court of appeal and by the parties before this court.
we conclude that when read in context,the charter provision in question gives the city considerable discretion to determine what is necessary for ensuring compliance with antidiscrimination laws.therefore,judicial review of that determination must be deferential,and a rule adopted by the city that is reasonably related to the goal of ensuring compliance with antidiscrimination laws is not subject to binding arbitration.we further conclude that the city new rule regarding promotion is reasonably related to such compliance,and that therefore the court of appeal judgment ordering the city into binding arbitration must be reversed.
statement of facts 
the below factual background,which is not controverted,is largely drawn from the court of appeal opinion.the city charter charter charges the city civil service commission commission with providing qualified persons for appointment to the service of the city and county.charter.the commission is mandated to adopt rules,policies and procedures to carry out a civil service merit system and,except as otherwise provided in th e charter,such rules govern the various aspects of hiring and promotion,including examinations eligibility duration of eligible lists and certification of eligibles.charter.

history of litigation over fire department hiring and promotion practices 
the san francisco fire department hired no firefighters before.city and county of san francisco,davis i.in,only four of uniformed fire personnel were.id.at.the department allowed no women to apply before and hired no women until august.city and county of san francisco,davis ii.
between and,a federal district court ruled that three successive versions of the firefighter examination had an adverse impact on minority applicants and had not been professionally validated as an accurate measure of the knowledge,skills and ability needed for the job.davis i,supra.at.the court ordered affirmative action,requiring the city to hire one minority for each nonminority hired from the eligibility list until all minority applicants on the list had been hired.davis i,at.more than percent of the minorities who had been hired by the department as of november had been hired pursuant to this arrangement.ibid.a consent decree terminated the action in and set a goal of percent representation of minorities on the list of eligibles for positions,but did not require strict ratio or quota hiring.ibid.that consent decree expired in.ibid.
the california fair employment and housing commission found that a firefighter promotional examination had an adverse impact on minorities and that the city failed to show that the test was sufficiently job related to be valid.davis ii,supra.at.those findings were upheld on appeal.city and county of san francisco fair employment housing com.d.
in and,the federal district court found that and promotional firefighter examinations used between and had adverse impacts on minorities and women.davis i,supra.at davis ii.at.the city did not attempt to defend the validity of the tests.davis i,at.the davis i court issued a permanent injunction requiring the development of new examinations that satisfied title vii requirements title vii of the civil rights act of,et and also established an interim hiring procedure.davis i,at.the fire department was allowed to hire from the existing eligibility lists,but had to minimally assure that those offered positions reflect the minority and female proportions of the applicant pool,if feasible.id.at.
in june,the davis ii court approved a consent decree that set hiring goals of percent minority and percent female representation in the department.davis ii,supra.at.the goal for promotions was to reflect the minority representation in the applicant pool.ibid.these goals were targets and not quotas nevertheless,failure to meet a goal had to be justified to the court.ibid.the consent decree had a term of seven years.id.at see also id.at.
in,the district court approved the use of banding to help the city meet the hiring and promotion goals in the consent decree.city and county of san francisco cir,davis iii.candidates with scores within a designated band or group of scores were considered equally qualified with respect to the skills and abilities measured by the examination.promotions were then made from among the candidates with scores in the band on the basis of secondary criteria,including race.ibid.the banding method the court approved was a form of statistically valid grouping.see,citing officers for justice civil service com.cir.
in december,the district court terminated the consent decree on the stipulation of the parties.city and county of san francisco cal,mhp wl davis iv.the stipulated order reaffirmed the hiring and promotional goals in the consent decree and required the city to use its best efforts within the law to attain a work force that reflected the percentages of minorities in the city population.id.at pp.the city agreed to develop and implement a cadet program to replace the selection process and an officer candidate program to replace the promotional process.id.at.prior to implementation of the officer candidate program,the city would continue to use banding for promotions to the extent necessary to meet the promotional goals and avoid an adverse impact against women and minorities.id.at.
the stipulated order expired in.davis iv,supra,wl at.the parties then entered into a memorandum of understanding that reaffirmed the goal of attaining a work force that reflected the diversity of the population of the city and required the city to develop an outreach program,a bilingual proficiency test,and the officer candidate program.the officer candidate program was never implemented,and the fire department has not held promotional examinations since termination of the consent decree in.
as of june,the uniformed force of the fire department was approximately percent caucasian,percent,percent hispanic,percent and percent women.
past and proposed rules regarding promotion 
typically,applicants for city employment take a civil service examination and are ranked in order of their scores on an eligibility list for new hires or promotions.certification rules determine which names from the list of eligibles are certified as candidates for an open position.the appointing officer must choose from among these certified candidates to fill the position.
as of april,the rule of three scores governed promotions in the fire department.civil service commission rules rule issued.under that rule,all employees with the three highest scores on the list were certified as candidates when one position was available.rules.because of tie scores,this group might include many more than three employees.for every additional available position,employees with the next highest score would be added to the list of certified candidates,so that when two positions were open,the list included all employees with the top four scores when three positions were open,it included all employees with the top five scores,and so on.rules.appointing officers were responsible for establishing selection criteria for choosing among the certified candidates.rule.selection had to be based on merit and fitness without regard to relationship,race,religion,sex,national origin or other factors and with due consideration of equal employment opportunity goals.rule.
in december,the commission notified san francisco fire fighters local,international association of fire fighters,union that it intended to amend rule,and three related rules,rules.it offered to meet and confer about the proposed changes.the parties quickly agreed on amendments to rules,but negotiated for two years about rule without reaching agreement.negotiations focused on the banding method to be used to certify promotional candidates.the union favored methods that resulted in a narrow band,thus limiting the discretion of appointing officers,and the commission favored a banding method,statistically valid grouping,explained post,that would lead to wider bands and greater discretion.during this period of negotiations,the commission held two public hearings at which it heard conflicting expert testimony on the use of statistically valid grouping.it also heard public comment from and held informational meetings with other interested parties,including the san francisco black firefighters association.
the commission declared an impasse in december.the commission final position was that rule had to employ statistically valid grouping for certification of promotional candidates.the union final offer was a proposal to use a rule of five scores for certification of promotional candidates,implement an officer candidate program,specify service requirements for promotions and lines of promotion,and identify secondary selection criteria,among other modifications to existing procedures.
after declaring the impasse,the commission amended rule,consistent with its last offer to the union.rule issued.rule as revised requires that statistically valid grouping be used exclusively for certification of candidates for promotion.rules.the revised rule continues the requirement that appointing officers establish nondiscriminatory selection procedures,but now requires that the criteria be announced and approved by the commission in advance of any job announcement.rule.the revised rule deletes any reference to equal employment opportunity goals.rule.
before approving the revisions to rule,the commission adopted a statement of legislative findings in support of its unilateral implementation of the rule.the commission found that the amendments were necessary to and will ensure compliance with federal,state and local laws,ordinances or regulations.
judicial proceedings 
in response to the commission declaration of impasse,the union demanded binding arbitration pursuant to charter section.the commission refused to submit the issue to arbitration,arguing the exemption in charter section g applied.the union filed a petition for a writ of mandate to compel arbitration,naming the city and the commission as respondents.the trial court denied the petition,ruling that the commission amendment of rule was a discretionary,act and thus was subject to review for abuse of discretion and that there was no abuse of discretion in the city determination that adoption of revised rule was necessary to ensure compliance with antidiscrimination law.the court concluded that banding is a selection device that is a universal and normally an unquestioned method of simplifying scoring by eliminating meaningless gradations.the court also concluded that the city was not required to demonstrate the need to employ extraordinary measures to remedy a history of past discrimination but was acting pursuant to title vii requirement for investigating methods of hiring and promotion that have the least disparate impact on minorities.
the court of appeal reversed.it concluded that when a municipal agency makes a finding of fact that triggers an expansion of its powers,that finding is subject to independent judicial review,and further concluded that the city finding in the present case was subject to such review.the court of appeal also interpreted the word necessary in the clause necessary to ensure compliance with laws,contained in charter section g,strictly to mean the only available means to ensure compliance with antidiscrimination laws.the court of appeal determined that the city findings and the evidence in the record did not support the conclusion that the unilateral amendment of revised rule was necessary in that strict sense.it therefore reversed the trial court judgment and remanded the matter to the trial court with directions to issue a writ of mandate requiring the city and the commission to submit the firefighter promotional certification rule to binding arbitration.we granted review.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
because a good deal of the court of appeal opinion below,and the briefing before this court,is devoted to a discussion of the appropriate standard of review,something more than the usual cursory recitation of the proper standard is in order.
a standard of review prescribes the degree of deference given by the reviewing court to the actions or decisions under review.childress davis,federal standards of review ed.the deferential standard of review generally accorded legislative and actions,at issue here,has both a constitutional and an institutional basis.the courts exercise limited review of legislative acts by administrative bodies out of deference to the separation of powers between the legislature and the judiciary,to the legislative delegation of administrative authority to the agency,and to the presumed expertise of the agency within its scope of authority.california hotel motel industrial welfare com.cal d.
these principles of separation of powers and deference to administrative expertise apply not only to actions of the state but also to local legislation and to administrative rules issued by local agencies.see strumsky san diego county employees retirement cal d,fn,city and county of san francisco cooper cal d,fn.they apply in particular to the powers of municipal civil service commissions.as was stated in almassy county civil service com.cal d,where the civil service commission has been given broad discretionary powers in determining the subjects of examination and the qualifications which are to be measured citations,j udicial interference under such circumstances is unjustified except on a showing of arbitrary,fraudulent,or capricious conduct,or a clear abuse of discretion.the charter invests the commission with such broad discretionary powers.charter,see harris civil service com.th,d.
nonetheless,the level of deference accorded a decision will depend in part on the nature of the challenge to the agency action.a s to acts of administrative agencies,judicial review is limited to an examination of the proceedings before the officer to determine whether his action has been arbitrary,capricious,or entirely lacking in evidentiary support,or whether he has failed to follow the procedure and give the notices required by law.citation.when,however,a regulation is challenged as inconsistent with the terms or intent of the authorizing statute,the standard of review is different,because the courts are the ultimate arbiters of the construction of a statute w hile the construction of a statute by officials charged with its administration is entitled to great weight,nevertheless,w hatever the force of administrative construction final responsibility for the interpretation of the law rests with the courts.citation.administrative regulations that alter or amend the statute or enlarge or impair its scope are void and courts not only may,but it is their obligation to strike down such regulations.citations.although in determining whether the regulations are reasonably necessary to effectuate the statutory purpose we will not intervene in the absence of an arbitrary or capricious decision,we need not make such a determination if the regulations transgress statutory power.california of psychological providers rank cal d,fn.omitted.
notwithstanding these general principles,the court of appeal in the present case adopted a general rule,with which the union agrees,that when a municipal agency makes a finding of fact that triggers an expansion of its powers,that finding is subject to independent judicial review.when the official or agency simply exercises its discretion within the ordinary scope of its powers,its decisions are reviewed for abuse of discretion.we conclude that this rule is not a correct statement of the law.
the court of appeal stated that california courts have independently reviewed declarations of necessity or emergency by municipal authorities that expanded the ordinary scope of their powers.the court relied on a line of cases beginning with san christina.san francisco cal,san christina.in that case,san francisco officials invoked a provision of the charter,passed in the wake of the earthquake,that would allow it to levy taxes in excess of the maximum rate set in the charter if a declaration of great necessity or emergency was issued by the board of supervisors.id.at.the issue before the san christina court,after the trial court sustained a demurrer in favor of the city,was whether the board declaration was subject to judicial review.san christina answered in the affirmative.w hen the power or jurisdiction of a municipal body is made to depend upon the existence of a fact,its determination of the fact is not conclusive unless declared to be so in the pertinent charter or ordinance in express terms or by necessary implication.san christina,supra,cal.at.
subsequent cases cited by the court of appeal and the union overturned the city attempt to increase levies based on a declaration of emergency pursuant to the same charter provision at issue in san christina,finding the declaration without factual basis.see josselyn san francisco cal,burr san francisco cal,spreckels san francisco.in later cases involving the exercise of emergency powers by the city mayor,courts have found the exercise legitimate after scrutinizing the record.mullins henderson d,verreos city and county of san francisco d.verreos.in the latter case,the court,although ultimately approving the mayor invocation of an emergency,rejected the notion that an emergency proclamation,in order to be nullified,must be fraudulent or palpably unreasonable or arbitrary.what the cases do establish is that the trial court must determine for itself,based upon the evidence presented,whether an actual emergency existed at the time of the declaration.verreos,supra,d at.more recent court of appeal cases,however,have reviewed municipal declarations of emergency or urgency under an abuse of discretion standard.see,sonoma county organization.employees county of sonoma th,d crown motors city of redding d.northgate partnership city of sacramento d.
whatever may be the proper standard of reviewing the validity of a municipal declaration of emergency in a given case,no such declaration is before us in the present case.rather,at issue is a determination of whether certain actions are necessary to accomplish a legislative goal.we see no basis for a per se rule that would accord heightened scrutiny of this common legislative determination.in fact,in the very case relied upon by the union,verreos,the court was deferential in its review of precisely this kind of determination s ection of the charter provided that in case of a public emergency,the mayor shall have the power and it shall be his duty to do whatever he may deem necessary for the purpose of meeting the emergency.thus,it is apparent that this language grants extremely broad powers and discretion to the mayor in a situation where an emergency exists.verreos,supra,d at,italics added.
we do not suggest that a deferential standard is to be invariably or uniformly applied in cases.as implied by the above passage,the discretion granted an agency by the legislation authorizing its duties,and hence the appropriate standard of review,may vary depending on the language and intent of that legislation.in the present case,section g of the charter excepts from binding arbitration any rule,policy,procedure,order or practice which is necessary to ensure compliance with federal,state or local laws,ordinances or regulations.if it can be discerned that the charter gives the city very little discretion to determine what is necessary to ensure compliance,then some kind of more rigorous independent review would be required in order to prevent the city from circumventing what was intended to be a strict limitation on its authority.in other words,the charter provision may define the scope of the city discretion,and this in turn shapes not only what is to be reviewed but how it should be reviewed legislation with a narrow definition of necessity would not be served by a deferential standard of review.but if it can be inferred from the authorizing legislation that a municipality has been granted considerable discretion to determine what is necessary to accomplish a valid legislative goal,a more deferential standard of review is appropriate.see verreos,supra,d at.
we therefore agree with the court of appeal to the extent it concluded that the appropriate standard of review is to be derived in part from examining the charter provision authorizing the city and commission powers.but we do not agree with the court of appeal general rule that when a municipal agency makes a finding of fact that triggers an expansion of its powers,that finding is subject to independent judicial review,as opposed to when it acts within the ordinary scope of its powers,which is subject to abuse of discretion review.the rule ignores the possibility that the making of the above findings may itself involve the exercise of considerable discretion that requires a deferential standard of judicial review.we therefore turn to our interpretation of the relevant charter provision to discern whether it explicitly or implicitly sets forth the kind of deference that should be accorded to the city actions in the present case.if the provision sheds no light on the matter,then we will employ the general principles of review of actions discussed above.
b.the meaning of charter section g 
as discussed,charter section declares that the commission can not unilaterally change any term or condition of employment and if,after meeting and conferring with union representatives,the parties bargain to impasse,the matter must be submitted to binding arbitration.the charter thus provides a rule of impasse resolution that differs from that generally provided to local government employees through the act,et this latter statutory scheme permits a local agency to unilaterally impose changes in the terms and conditions of employment if the agency has met and conferred in good faith with representatives of a recognized employee organization and bargained to impasse.see,santa clara county counsel woodside cal th,d.
the charter sets forth certain exceptions to this rule of binding arbitration.charter section g,at issue here,provides in full that the above impasse resolution procedure shall not apply to any rule,policy,procedure,order or practice which relates or pertains to the purpose,goals or requirements of a consent decree,or which is necessary to ensure compliance with federal,state or local laws,ordinances or regulations.in the event the city acts on a matter it has determined relates to or pertains to a consent decree,or in the event the city acts to ensure compliance with federal,state,or local laws,ordinances or regulations,and the affected employee organization disputes said determination,that determination or action shall not be subject to arbitration.
the main controversy in interpreting this provision is construing the meaning of necessary.the court of appeal agreed with the union that the word should be interpreted in a strict sense.as the court stated the primary definition of necessary in the oxford english dictionary is indispensable,requisite,essential,needful that can not be done without oxford english,ed,and the definition in webster new collegiate dictionary page is absolutely needed,required.the plain meaning of words used in a charter is our primary guide in interpreting the charter.citations.as used in section g of the charter,we construe necessary to mean the only available means to ensure compliance with antidiscrimination laws.italics added.
the city points to a long line of cases holding that the term necessary does not necessarily have the above meaning.in the law,the word necessary has not a fixed meaning,but is flexible and relative.citation.it must be considered in the connection in which it is used,as it is a word susceptible of various meanings.it may import absolute physical necessity or inevitability or it may import that which is only convenient,useful,appropriate,suitable,proper or conducive to the end sought.westphal westphal,accord people belous cal d,see also zack marin emergency radio authority th,d zack for purposes of determining whether a power is implied,the word necessary has been judicially defined in california as meaning convenient,useful,appropriate or suitable,and not indispensable.grissom vons,th,d the word necessary is susceptible of various meanings,depending on the context in which it is used danley merced irr.dist,danley.
we will therefore examine the word necessary within the context of the rest of the charter provision to determine which of its various meanings was intended.we find critical to this interpretation the second paragraph of charter section g,which states in the event the city acts on a matter it has determined relates to or pertains to a consent decree,or in the event the city acts to ensure compliance with federal,state,or local laws,ordinances or regulations,and the affected employee organization disputes said determination,that determination or action shall not be subject to arbitration.italics added.
how can the first paragraph of charter section g,providing that only a rule,that is necessary to ensure compliance with antidiscrimination laws is to be exempt from binding arbitration,be reconciled with the second paragraph,that whenever the city acts to ensure compliance with antidiscrimination laws,the action is exempt from binding arbitration we believe the two paragraphs can not be reconciled if one adopts the court of appeal and the union strict definition of necessary just because the city is taking an action to ensure compliance with antidiscrimination laws does not mean that it is employing the only available means toward such compliance,and therefore the two paragraphs would have conflicting standards as to when a city action is exempt from binding arbitration.
but the second paragraph can be harmonized with the first,if necessary is construed in its broader sense,that which is convenient,useful,appropriate,suitable,proper or conducive westphal westphal,supra.at,to ensuring compliance with antidiscrimination laws.in other words,a rule,policy,procedure,order or practice,that is necessary,convenient,useful,appropriate,suitable,proper or conducive to ensure compliance with antidiscrimination laws is not subject to binding arbitration therefore when the city takes an action to ensure compliance,such as adopting,amending,or implementing a rule,that is convenient,useful,appropriate,suitable,proper or conducive to ensure compliance with antidiscrimination laws,that action is itself necessary to ensure compliance in the broad sense of the word,and therefore exempt from binding arbitration.hence,that broader definition of necessary is the one consistent with the language of charter section g,read in its totality.
the court of appeal did not cite nor discuss the second paragraph of the charter provision.the union offers its own meaning of the second paragraph as follows the union agrees that a determination that an action is necessary to ensure compliance with laws is not subject to arbitration.however,the union is not seeking to arbitrate that determination.the union is seeking judicial review of that determination.it is the underlying issue of the proper certification rule,not the determination of necessity,that is subject to arbitration.neither section g nor any other section of the charter precludes judicial review of the necessity determination.in order to ensure that the city does not exceed its powers,the city determination of necessity must be subject to judicial review.
the union view appears to come down to this a rule,that is necessary to ensure compliance with antidiscrimination laws is exempt from binding arbitration.when the city acts to ensure compliance with antidiscrimination laws,then a court,rather than an arbitrator,is supposed to determine whether the act is necessary to ensure compliance.necessary to ensure compliance means for the union,as for the court of appeal,the only available means to ensure compliance with antidiscrimination laws.in other words,necessary to ensure compliance and acts to ensure compliance refer to two different former is the standard for determining when a city rule,is exempt from binding arbitration,the latter is an action that triggers judicial review of whether the rule,meets the necessary to ensure compliance standard.
we do not believe this interpretation is plausible.in order for it to be viable,the phrase that determination or action shall not be subject to binding arbitration at the end of the second paragraph of section g italics added would have to refer back to the determination in the first paragraph,a determination of necessity.but that determination or action clearly refers back to the beginning of the second paragraph.what is not subject to arbitration,inter alia,is an action to ensure compliance with laws.because action refers back to acts to ensure compliance with antidiscrimination laws,section g makes it clear that once the city acts to comply with antidiscrimination laws,that action itself is not subject to binding arbitration,not merely the determination that the act is necessary to ensure compliance.the more reasonable interpretation,as explained ante,is that the second paragraph provision exempting the city from binding arbitration any time it acts to ensure compliance with antidiscrimination laws demonstrates a mandate of broad discretion to the city,and that the word necessary in the first paragraph must be understood in the broader sense so that its meaning is consistent with that mandate.
other language in the charter provision also leads to the conclusion that the word necessary is to be interpreted broadly to give the city considerable discretion.section g speaks in terms of ensuring compliance with federal,state,or local laws,ordinances or regulations.italics added.thus,exempted from the binding arbitration provisions are not only actions taken to comply with federal or state law,but also actions taken to comply with antidiscrimination laws passed by the city itself,and not only city ordinances,but also municipal antidiscrimination regulations.this provision is inconsistent with an interpretation of section g that would narrowly circumscribe the city authority to act unilaterally to address unlawful discrimination.
finally,the kind of determination the city must make in order to ensure compliance with antidiscrimination laws does not fit well with a strict showing of necessity.what does the court of appeal definition of necessary the only available means to ensure compliance with antidiscrimination laws mean in the present context the commission determination that an action is necessary to comply with antidiscrimination laws is not a finding of fact in the strict sense,but a prediction that a certain employment the present case the modification of the way promotional exams are used to evaluate survive litigation brought under antidiscrimination laws.suppose the city reasonably determined that the strategy it adopted had a good chance of withstanding a legal challenge,and that the alternative adopted by the union was less promising in this regard,but still had some chance of surviving such a challenge.is the city action the only available means to ensure compliance with antidiscrimination laws the answer may be no,but that negative answer only serves to underscore the inaptness of the inquiry.because the decision about the best way to comply with antidiscrimination laws is a complex prediction rather than a simple factual determination,it is a judgment call that inherently involves the exercise of discretion.see sonoma county organization.employees county of sonoma,supra,th,d.the electorate that adopted this charter provision evidently chose to lodge that discretion with the city itself,which has the ultimate legal obligation to comply with such laws and considerable potential liability if that obligation is not fulfilled.
that is not to say that section g does not contemplate judicial review.section establishes,as a general rule,that matters negotiated to impasse are to be submitted to binding arbitration,with the exception of city actions to ensure compliance with laws.g.a court must therefore review the action to determine whether it is in fact taken to ensure compliance with laws.ibid.it would violate both the letter and spirit of the charter provision if the city were permitted to evade the binding arbitration requirement with an action that is unrelated,or only remotely related,to compliance with antidiscrimination laws.section g requires that the measure adopted be necessary to the goal of ensuring compliance with laws,which,as discussed,means in context that the action be convenient,useful,appropriate,suitable,proper or conducive to the goal of a ensuring such compliance.westphal westphal,supra.at.or,to use a more concise modern formulation,the action must be reasonably related to that goal.see,birkenfeld city of berkeley cal d,exercise of local government police power will be upheld when the measure reasonably relates to a legitimate governmental purpose.but when there is a reasonable relationship,section g withdraws the action from binding arbitration even if there is a bona fide dispute between the city and the union about the city determination that the action is the appropriate means of ensuring compliance with laws.
application to present case 
we must determine whether the adoption of rule is reasonably related to ensuring the city compliance with antidiscrimination laws and not merely a means of circumventing the charter binding arbitration requirements.in order to make this determination,we must first review the antidiscrimination laws in question.both parties agree that the laws bearing most directly on the city promotional exams for firefighters are title vii and article i,section of the california constitution,incorporating proposition.
under title vii,d iscriminatory employment tests are impermissible unless shown,by professionally acceptable methods,to be predictive of or significantly correlated with important elements of work behavior which comprise or are relevant to the job or jobs for which candidates are being evaluated.citation.in evaluating employment tests that are alleged to have a racially disparate impact,courts first consider whether the plaintiff has established a prima facie case by demonstrating that the test causes a disparate impact on the basis of race.of educators state of california cir,educators.
if the plaintiff makes a prima facie case,the burden shifts to d efendants to demonstrate that the test was validated properly.educators,supra,at.to demonstrate that a test was validated properly,defendants are required to show that it has a manifest relationship to the employment in question.citation,at.if the defendant carries its burden,a plaintiff may still prevail under a title vii claim if he or she can show that other tests or selection devices would also serve the employer legitimate hiring interests and at the same time have a lesser adverse impact upon that protected class.brunet city of columbus cir,see educators,supra,at,fn.
california constitution,article i,section,subdivision a states the state shall not discriminate against,or grant preferential treatment to,any individual or group on the basis of race,sex,color,ethnicity,or national origin in the operation of public employment,public education,or public contracting.i n approving proposition,the voters intended section,like the civil rights act as originally construed,to achieve equality of public employment,education,and contracting opportunities citation and to remove barriers that operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible classification.wire works,city of san jose cal th,d.
as an initial matter,it seems inarguable that discriminatory promotional exams are traditional subjects of title vii litigation see connecticut teal,d,and that action regarding such exams at least plausibly could be actions to ensure compliance with antidiscrimination laws.we agree with amicus curiae san jose police officers association that section g should not be interpreted so broadly that every action regarding the terms and conditions of employment that has a remote or indirect effect on minorities would fall within its scope,thereby making it the exception that swallows the binding arbitration rule.but in the present case,a rule that purports to reduce the discriminatory impact of a promotional exam would have a direct effect on the city capacity to withstand a title vii challenge.
furthermore,the san francisco fire department has had a long history of litigation concerning promotional exams.see davis i,supra.at davis ii.at.as recounted,that litigation resulted in a consent decree,in which the court supervised hiring and promotional tests to foster a more diversified work force.the union argues that there is no viable title vii issue before the city because,as the result of the consent decree,the fire department has achieved a diversified work force and there are no pending title vii challenges.however,since the dissolution of the consent decree,the fire department has had no promotional exams,and therefore there has been nothing to challenge.
more importantly,nothing in section g limits the city actions to ensure compliance with antidiscrimination laws to those actions responding to pending or impending legal challenges.obviously,the city may anticipate such legal challenges and design programs more likely to comply with the law and withstand such challenges.indeed,title vii requires public agencies to be proactive in adopting employment selection procedures.b efore utilizing a selection procedure that has an adverse impact on minorities,the city has an obligation to explore alternative procedures and to implement them if they have less adverse impact and are substantially equally valid to rank ordering.brunet city of columbus,supra,at.the city reasonably determined that it should act prospectively in devising a valid method of promotion that would minimize adverse impacts on minorities.
we turn then to examine the rule adopted by the city.the controversy between the fire department and the city specifically revolves around the amendment of rule with section,statistically valid grouping sliding band,which is the only method to be used for selecting promotional candidates.as we will explain,this selection method is designed to lessen reliance on promotional exams,which have a history of having a discriminatory impact,and increase reliance upon other measures of ability.
statistically valid grouping,as adopted by the commission
