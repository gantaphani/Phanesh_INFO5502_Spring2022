background 
this dispute centers around farmers obligations under a written property insurance policy it issued to devonwood,a california homeowners association.when a fire occurred in one of devonwood units,a hercules,california,condominium in,devonwood submitted a claim for fire damage to farmers.when the parties could not agree on the value of the loss,devonwood demanded that an appraisal be conducted by a panel pursuant to the policy appraisal provision.the provision called for each party to select a competent and impartial appraiser,who together would select an umpire,and stated that a decision agreed to by any two will be binding.devonwood selected keith charleston as its appraiser,farmers selected peter evans,and the two selected gene roberts as the umpire.
this appraisal panel,after holding hearings and considered evidence submitted by the parties,issued a unanimous written appraisal of insurance claim award in june.the panel stated that it had considered all material facts and available information pertaining to devonwood claim,and decided on an appraisal award as described below which in the appraisal panel opinion restores the building to its condition,based on the condition of the property in april.the panel then stated two categories of replacement cost values.the first,the replacement cost value of structure damage,exclusive of floor coverings,ceiling coverings including paint,and wall coverings including paint in the residential unit,totaled.the second category,the replacement cost value of interior painting of walls and ceilings due to structure damage,totaled.the panel also stated in relevant part 
attached to this award is a breakdown which sets forth those items included herein.this breakdown sets forth the above award in detail and is made without consideration of any deductible amount or any coverage or other provision of the above policy which might affect the amount of the insurer liability thereunder 
devonwood subsequently filed a petition to confirm the appraisal award in contra costa county superior court.farmers opposed the petition,arguing the requested order would necessarily create liability to pay the assigned valuation irrespective of coverage issues and the applicable deductible,all contrary to the clear dictates of the appraisal award,and would necessarily require the determination of coverage issues such that in addition to determining the amount of loss said order would create farmers liability for the loss,an issue of coverage,although the appraisal panel had no authority to resolve any coverage issues.farmers requested the appraisal award either be corrected pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b providing for the correcting of an award without affecting the merits of the decision because the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or vacated based on code of civil procedure section,subdivision a also based on the arbitrators exceeding their powers 
at the heart of farmers opposition was its contention that it was not obligated under the policy to pay for painting interior areas.according to a declaration by farmers attorney,linda lynch,during the course of the appraisal hearing,the policy provision which stipulates there is no coverage for interior finishes was discussed.farmers indicated to all attendees and the panel that provision would affect how much farmers paid on the claim t here was a lack of consensus between devonwood and farmers as to exactly how that provision applied in this context of this claim.at no time was that coverage issue submitted for resolution by the appraisal panel in fact,the appraisal panel members advised they could not resolve that or any other coverage issue and informed us that they would segregate and separately value the different elements of damage and segregate the award so the parties could determine their rights and obligations under the policy.
farmers also submitted declarations from the appraiser it selected for the panel,peter evans,the panel umpire,gene roberts,and noelle stitt,a farmers claims representative.as a part of its reply,devonwood submitted extensive written objections to the declarations of lynch,evans,roberts,and stitt.
the superior court heard argument and issued a written statement of decision.it found that an agreement to conduct an appraisal contained within an insurance policy constituted an arbitration agreement subject to the statutory law regarding contractual arbitrations,that farmers had conceded that the appraisal panel had not addressed any coverage issues,that farmers opposition did not cite any statutory bases for the court to dismiss,correct,or vacate the award,that none were present,and that it was required by statute to confirm the award.the court sustained devonwood objections to the declarations of evans and roberts and most of stitt,and overruled most of the objections to lynch declaration.it confirmed the appraisal award in the amount of.
devonwood then submitted a proposed judgment.farmers filed objections to the statement of decision and proposed judgment,arguing many of the positions it raises in this appeal.it requested that,if the court issued judgment,it do so based on what farmers considered to be the entire award,including the appraisal panel statement that it was not determining any coverage issues,or that the court issue a conditional award that required the parties to resolve themselves or through a more formal venue the issue of coverage.
the court issued an order granting devonwood petition,confirming the appraisal award,and awarded devonwood judgment in the sum of,as well as the costs of its petition.it then entered judgment for devonwood in the amount of,and awarded it costs.farmers subsequently filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
farmers asks that we reverse or vacate the judgment on several grounds.it argues that the judgment does not conform to the appraisal award,contrary to the dictates of code of civil procedure section that even if the judgment so conforms,the appraisal panel necessarily exceeded its powers by determining coverage issues and that an appraisal award issued pursuant to insurance code section section may not be entered as a money judgment following its confirmation pursuant to code of civil procedure sections and.farmers also argues the lower court erred when it excluded the declarations of evans,roberts,and stitt.
devonwood opposes farmers arguments.it also moves for sanctions against farmers for filing a frivolous appeal.
we conclude the lower court judgment did not conform to the appraisal award in violation of code of civil procedure section and,therefore,must be vacated.
