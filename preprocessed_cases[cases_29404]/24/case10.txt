respondent jackson filed an suit against petitioner,his former employer,in a nevada federal district court.filed a motion,under the federal arbitration act faa,to dismiss or stay the proceedings,and to compel arbitration,based on the arbitration agreement agreement jackson signed as a condition of his employment.jackson opposed the motion on the ground that the agreement was unenforceable in that it was unconscionable under nevada law.the district court granted motion.the ninth circuit reversed in relevant part.
held under the faa,where an agreement to arbitrate includes an agreement that the arbitrator will determine the enforceability of the agreement,if a party challenges specifically the enforceability of that particular agreement,the district court considers the challenge,but if a party challenges the enforceability of the agreement as a whole,the challenge is for the arbitrator.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
we consider whether,under the federal arbitration act faa or act,a district court may decide a claim that an arbitration agreement is unconscionable,where the agreement explicitly assigns that decision to the arbitrator.
on february,the respondent here,antonio jackson,filed an suit under stat,against his former employer in the united states district court for the district of nevada.the defendant and petitioner here,west,filed a motion under the faa to dismiss or stay the proceedings,and to compel arbitration.argued that the mutual agreement to arbitrate claims agreement,which jackson signed on february,as a condition of his employment there,precluded jackson from pursuing his claims in court.the agreement provided for arbitration of all past,present or future disputes arising out of jackson employment with,including claims for discrimination and claims for violation of any federal law.app.it also provided that t he arbitrator,and not any federal,state,or local court or agency,shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation,applicability,enforceability or formation of this agreement including,but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this agreement is void or voidable.at.
jackson opposed the motion on the ground that the arbitration agreement in question is clearly unenforceable in that it is unconscionable under nevada law,at.responded that jackson unconscionability claim was not properly before the court because jackson had expressly agreed that the arbitrator would have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute about the enforceability of the agreement.it also disputed the merits of jackson unconscionability claims.
the district court granted motion to dismiss the proceedings and to compel arbitration.the court found that the agreement clearly and unmistakenly sic gives the arbitrator exclusive authority to decide whether the agreement is enforceable,app.to pet.for cert.quoting howsam dean witter reynolds,and,because jackson challenged the validity of the agreement as a whole,the issue was for the arbitrator,app.to pet.for cert.citing buckeye check cashing,cardegna.the court noted that even if it were to examine the merits of jackson unconscionability claims,it would have rejected the claim that the agreement to split arbitration fees was substantively unconscionable under nevada law.it did not address jackson procedural or other substantive unconscionability arguments.
without oral argument,a divided panel of the court of appeals for the ninth circuit reversed in part,affirmed in part,and remanded.the court reversed on the question of who the court or arbitrator had the authority to decide whether the agreement is enforceable.it noted that jackson does not dispute that the language of the agreement clearly assigns the arbitrability determination to the arbitrator,but held that where a party challenges an arbitration agreement as unconscionable,and thus asserts that he could not meaningfully assent to the agreement,the threshold question of unconscionability is for the court.at.the ninth circuit affirmed the district court alternative conclusion that the provision was not substantively unconscionable and remanded for consideration of jackson other unconscionability arguments,at,and.judge hall dissented on the ground that the question of the arbitration agreement validity should have gone to the arbitrator,as the parties clearly and unmistakably provide d in their agreement.at.
we granted certiorari.
the faa reflects the fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of contract.section,the primary substantive provision of the act,moses cone memorial hospital mercury constr,provides 
a written provision in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.
the faa thereby places arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other contracts,buckeye,supra,at,and requires courts to enforce them according to their terms,volt information sciences,board of trustees of leland stanford junior.like other contracts,however,they may be invalidated by generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability.doctor associates,casarotto.
the act also establishes procedures by which federal courts implement substantive rule.under,a party may apply to a federal court for a stay of the trial of an action upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration.under,a party aggrieved by the failure of another party to arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration may petition a federal court for an order directing that such arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement.the court shall order arbitration upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue.ibid.
the agreement here contains multiple written provision s to settle by arbitration a controversy,two are relevant to our discussion.first,the section titled claims covered by the agreement provides for arbitration of all past,present or future disputes arising out of jackson employment with.app.second,the section titled arbitration procedures provides that t he arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the enforceability of this agreement including,but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this agreement is void or voidable.at.the current controversy between the parties is whether the agreement is unconscionable.it is the second provision,which delegates resolution of that controversy to the arbitrator,that seeks to enforce.adopting the terminology used by the parties,we will refer to it as the delegation provision.
the delegation provision is an agreement to arbitrate threshold issues concerning the arbitration agreement.we have recognized that parties can agree to arbitrate gateway questions of arbitrability,such as whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate or whether their agreement covers a particular controversy.see,howsam,at green tree financial bazzle,plurality opinion.this line of cases merely reflects the principle that arbitration is a matter of contract see first options of chicago,kaplan.an agreement to arbitrate a gateway issue is simply an additional,antecedent agreement the party seeking arbitration asks the federal court to enforce,and the faa operates on this additional arbitration agreement just as it does on any other.the additional agreement is valid under save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,and federal courts can enforce the agreement by staying federal litigation under and compelling arbitration under.the question before us,then,is whether the delegation provision is valid under.
there are two types of validity challenges under one type challenges specifically the validity of the agreement to arbitrate,and t he other challenges the contract as a whole,either on a ground that directly affects the entire agreement,the agreement was fraudulently induced,or on the ground that the illegality of one of the contract provisions renders the whole contract invalid.buckeye,at.in a line of cases neither party has asked us to overrule,we held that only the first type of challenge is relevant to a court determination whether the arbitration agreement at issue is enforceable see prima paint flood conklin,buckeye,supra,at preston ferrer.that is because states that a written provision to settle by arbitration a controversy is valid,irrevocable,and enforceable without mention of the validity of the contract in which it is contained.thus,a party challenge to another provision of the contract,or to the contract as a whole,does not prevent a court from enforcing a specific agreement to arbitrate.a s a matter of substantive federal arbitration law,an arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract.buckeye,at see also,at the severability rule is based on.
but that agreements to arbitrate are severable does not mean that they are unassailable.if a party challenges the validity under of the precise agreement to arbitrate at issue,the federal court must consider the challenge before ordering compliance with that agreement under.in prima paint,for example,if the claim had been fraud in the inducement of the arbitration clause itself,then the court would have considered it,at.to immunize an arbitration agreement from judicial challenge on the ground of fraud in the inducement would be to elevate it over other forms of contract,at.in some cases the claimed basis of invalidity for the contract as a whole will be much easier to establish than the same basis as applied only to the severable agreement to arbitrate.thus,in an employment contract many elements of alleged unconscionability applicable to the entire contract outrageously low wages,for example would not affect the agreement to arbitrate alone.but even where that is not the case as in prima paint itself,where the alleged fraud that induced the whole contract equally induced the agreement to arbitrate which was part of that contract we nonetheless require the basis of challenge to be directed specifically to the agreement to arbitrate before the court will intervene.
here,the written provision to settle by arbitration a controversy,that asks us to enforce is the delegation provision the provision that gave the arbitrator exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the enforceability of this agreement,app.the remainder of the contract,buckeye,supra,at,is the rest of the agreement to arbitrate claims arising out of jackson employment with.to be sure this case differs from prima paint,buckeye,and preston,in that the arbitration provisions sought to be enforced in those cases were contained in contracts unrelated to arbitration contracts for consulting services,see prima paint,supra,at,services,see buckeye,supra,at,and personal management or talent agent services,see preston,supra,at.in this case,the underlying contract is itself an arbitration agreement.but that makes no difference application of the severability rule does not depend on the substance of the remainder of the contract.section operates on the specific written provision to settle by arbitration a controversy that the party seeks to enforce.accordingly,unless jackson challenged the delegation provision specifically,we must treat it as valid under,and must enforce it under and,leaving any challenge to the validity of the agreement as a whole for the arbitrator.
the district court correctly concluded that jackson challenged only the validity of the contract as a whole.nowhere in his opposition to motion to compel arbitration did he even mention the delegation provision.see app.noted this fact in its reply jackson response fails to rebut or otherwise address in any way argument that the arbitrator must decide jackson challenge to the enforceability of the agreement.thus,argument is uncontested.at emphasis in original.
the arguments jackson made in his response to motion to compel arbitration support this conclusion.jackson stated that the entire agreement seems drawn to provide with undue advantages should an dispute arise.at emphasis added.at one point,he argued that the limitations on discovery further suppor t his contention that the arbitration agreement as a whole is substantively unconscionable.ibid.emphasis added.and before this court,jackson describes his challenge in the district court as follows he opposed the motion to compel on the ground that the entire arbitration agreement,including the delegation clause,was unconscionable.brief for respondent emphasis added.that is an accurate description of his filings.
as required to make out a claim of unconscionability under nevada law,see,at,he contended that the agreement was both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.it was procedurally unconscionable,he argued,because it was imposed as a condition of employment and was.app.but we need not consider that claim because none of jackson substantive unconscionability challenges was specific to the delegation provision.first,he argued that the agreement coverage was one sided in that it required arbitration of claims an employee was likely to bring contract,tort,discrimination,and statutory claims but did not require arbitration of claims was likely to bring intellectual property,unfair competition,and trade secrets claims,at.this argument clearly did not go to the validity of the delegation provision.
jackson other two substantive unconscionability arguments assailed arbitration procedures called for by the contract the arrangement and the limitations on discovery procedures that were to be used during arbitration under both the agreement to arbitrate disputes and the delegation provision.it may be that had jackson challenged the delegation provision by arguing that these common procedures as applied to the delegation provision rendered that provision unconscionable,the challenge should have been considered by the court.to make such a claim based on the discovery procedures,jackson would have had to argue that the limitation upon the number of depositions causes the arbitration of his claim that the agreement is unenforceable to be unconscionable.that would be,of course,a much more difficult argument to sustain than the argument that the same limitation renders arbitration of his factbound claim unconscionable.likewise,the unfairness of the arrangement may be more difficult to establish for the arbitration of enforceability than for arbitration of more complex and aspects of the alleged employment discrimination.jackson,however,did not make any arguments specific to the delegation provision he argued that the and discovery procedures rendered the entire agreement invalid.
jackson appeal to the ninth circuit confirms that he did not contest the validity of the delegation provision in particular.his brief noted the existence of the delegation provision,brief for appellant in,but his unconscionability arguments made no mention of it,at.he also repeated the arguments he had made before the district court,see supra,at,that the entire agreement favors and that the limitations on discovery further his contention that the arbitration agreement as a whole is substantively unconscionable,brief for appellant.finally,he repeated the argument made in his district court filings,that under state law the unconscionable clauses could not be severed from the arbitration agreement,see,at the point of this argument,of course,is that the agreement as a whole is unconscionable under state law.
jackson repeated that argument before this court.at oral argument,counsel stated there are certain elements of the arbitration agreement that are unconscionable and,under nevada law,which would render the entire arbitration agreement unconscionable.tr.of oral arg.emphasis added.and again,he stated,we got both certain provisions that are unconscionable,that under nevada law render the entire agreement unconscionable,and that what the court is to rely on.at emphasis added.
in his brief to this court,jackson made the contention,not mentioned below,that the delegation provision itself is substantively unconscionable because the quid pro quo he was supposed to receive for it that in exchange for initially allowing an arbitrator to decide certain gateway questions,he would receive plenary judicial review was eliminated by the court subsequent holding in hall street associates,mattel,that the nonplenary grounds for judicial review in of the faa are exclusive.brief for respondent.he brought this challenge to the delegation provision too late,and we will not consider it see penn plaza llc pyett,slip,at.
we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals for the ninth circuit.
it is so ordered.
west,petitioner antonio jackson 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice stevens,with whom justice ginsburg,justice breyer,and justice sotomayor join,dissenting.
neither petitioner nor respondent has urged us to adopt the rule the court does today even when a litigant has specifically challenged the validity of an agreement to arbitrate he must submit that challenge to the arbitrator unless he has lodged an objection to the particular line in the agreement that purports to assign such challenges to the arbitrator the delegation clause.
the court asserts that its holding flows logically from prima paint flood conklin,in which the court held that consideration of a contract revocation defense is generally a matter for the arbitrator,unless the defense is specifically directed at the arbitration clause,at.we have treated this holding as a severability rule when a party challenges a contract,but not specifically its arbitration provisions,those provisions are enforceable apart from the remainder of the contract.buckeye check cashing,cardegna.the court decision today goes beyond prima paint.its breezy assertion that the subject matter of the contract at issue in this case,an arbitration agreement and nothing more makes no difference,ante,at,is simply wrong.this written arbitration agreement is but one part of a broader employment agreement between the parties,just as the arbitration clause in prima paint was but one part of a broader contract for services between those parties.thus,that the subject matter of the agreement is exclusively arbitration makes all the difference in the prima paint analysis.
under the federal arbitration act faa,parties generally have substantial leeway to define the terms and scope of their agreement to settle disputes in an arbitral forum.a rbitration is,after all,simply a matter of contract between the parties it is a way to resolve those disputes but only those disputes that the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration.first options of chicago,kaplan.the faa,therefore,envisions a limited role for courts asked to stay litigation and refer disputes to arbitration.
certain issues the kind that contracting parties would likely have expected a court to have decided remain within the province of judicial review.howsam dean witter reynolds,see also green tree financial bazzle,plurality opinion technologies,communications workers.these issues are gateway matter s because they are necessary antecedents to enforcement of an arbitration agreement they raise questions the parties are not likely to have thought that they had agreed that an arbitrator would decide.howsam,at.quintessential gateway matters include whether the parties have a valid arbitration agreement at all,bazzle,at plurality opinion whether the parties are bound by a given arbitration clause,howsam,at and whether an arbitration clause in a concededly binding contract applies to a particular type of controversy,ibid.it would be bizarre to send these types of gateway matters to the arbitrator as a matter of course,because they raise a question of arbitrability.see,first options,at.
q uestion s of arbitrability thus include questions regarding the existence of a legally binding and valid arbitration agreement,as well as questions regarding the scope of a concededly binding arbitration agreement.in this case we are concerned with the first of these categories whether the parties have a valid arbitration agreement.this is an issue the faa assigns to the courts section of the faa dictates that covered arbitration agreements shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.s uch grounds,which relate to contract validity and formation,include the claim at issue in this case,unconscionability.see doctor associates,casarotto.
two different lines of cases bear on the issue of who decides a question of arbitrability respecting validity,such as whether an arbitration agreement is unconscionable.although this issue,as a gateway matter,is typically for the court,we have explained that such an issue can be delegated to the arbitrator in some circumstances.when the parties have purportedly done so,courts must examine two distinct rules to decide whether the delegation is valid.
the first line of cases looks to the parties intent.in technologies,we stated that question s of arbitrability may be delegated to the arbitrator,so long as the delegation is clear and unmistakable,at.we reaffirmed this rule,and added some nuance,in first options.against the background presumption that questions of arbitrability go to the court,we stated that federal courts should generally apply ordinary principles that govern the formation of contracts to assess whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter including arbitrability.at.but,we added,a more rigorous standard applies when the inquiry is whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate arbitrability courts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is clear and unmistakable evidence that they did so.ibid.internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.justice breyer unanimous opinion for the court described this standard as a type of revers e presumption one in favor of a judicial,rather than an arbitral,forum,at.clear and unmistakable evidence of agreement to arbitrate arbitrability might include,as was urged in first options,a course of conduct demonstrating assent,at,or,as is urged in this case,an express agreement to do so.in any event,whether such evidence exists is a matter for the court to determine.
the second line of cases bearing on who decides the validity of an arbitration agreement,as the court explains,involves the prima paint rule.see ante,at.that rule recognizes two types of validity challenges.one type challenges the validity of the arbitration agreement itself,on a ground arising from an infirmity in that agreement.the other challenges the validity of the arbitration agreement tangentially via a claim that the entire contract of which the arbitration agreement is but a part is invalid for some reason.see buckeye,at.under prima paint,a challenge of the first type goes to the court a challenge of the second type goes to the arbitrator.see,at see also buckeye,at.the prima paint rule is akin to a pleading standard,whereby a party seeking to challenge the validity of an arbitration agreement must expressly say so in order to get his dispute into court.
in sum,questions related to the validity of an arbitration agreement are usually matters for a court to resolve before it refers a dispute to arbitration.but questions of arbitrability may go to the arbitrator in two instances when the parties have demonstrated,clearly and unmistakably,that it is their intent to do so or when the validity of an arbitration agreement depends exclusively on the validity of the substantive contract of which it is a part.
we might have resolved this case by simply applying the first options rule does the arbitration agreement at issue clearly and unmistakably evince petitioner and respondent intent to submit questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator the answer to that question is no.respondent claim that the arbitration agreement is unconscionable undermines any suggestion that he clearly and unmistakably assented to submit questions of arbitrability to the arbitrator.see restatement second of contracts,comment d g ross inequality of bargaining power,together with terms unreasonably favorable to the stronger party,may confirm indications that the transaction involved elements of deception or compulsion,or may show that the weaker party had no meaningful choice,no real alternative,or did not in fact assent or appear to assent to the unfair terms american airlines,wolens,concurring in judgment and dissenting in part a determination that a contract is unconscionable may in fact be a determination that one party did not intend to agree to the terms of the contract the fact that the agreement delegation provision suggests assent is beside the point,because the gravamen of respondent claim is that he never consented to the terms in his agreement.
in other words,when a party raises a validity challenge to the arbitration agreement itself,that issue must be resolved before a court can say that he clearly and unmistakably intended to arbitrate that very validity question.this case well illustrates the point if respondent unconscionability claim is correct,if the terms of the agreement are so and the process of its making so unfair it would contravene the existence of clear and unmistakable assent to arbitrate the very question petitioner now seeks to arbitrate.accordingly,it is necessary for the court to resolve the merits of respondent unconscionability claim in order to decide whether the parties have a valid arbitration agreement under.otherwise,that section preservation of revocation issues for the court would be meaningless.
this is,in essence,how i understand the court of appeals to have decided the issue below.see,w e hold that where,as here,a party challenges an arbitration agreement as unconscionable,and thus asserts that he could not meaningfully assent to the agreement,the threshold question of unconscionability is for the court i would therefore affirm its judgment,leaving,as it did,the merits of respondent unconscionability claim for the district court to resolve on remand.
rather than apply first options,the court takes us down a different path,one neither briefed by the parties nor relied upon by the court of appeals.in applying prima paint,the court has unwisely extended a fantastic and likely erroneous decision,at black,dissenting 
as explained at the outset,see supra,at,this case lies at a seeming crossroads in our arbitration jurisprudence.it implicates cases such as first options,which address whether the parties intended to delegate questions of arbitrability,and also those cases,such as prima paint,which address the severability of a presumptively valid arbitration agreement from a potentially invalid contract.the question of who decides arbitrator or court animates both lines of cases,but they are driven by different concerns.in cases like first options,we are concerned with the parties intentions.in cases like prima paint,we are concerned with how the parties challenge the validity of the agreement.
under the prima paint inquiry,recall,we consider whether the parties are actually challenging the validity of the arbitration agreement,or whether they are challenging,more generally,the contract within which an arbitration clause is nested.in the latter circumstance,we assume there is no infirmity per se with the arbitration agreement,there are no grounds for revocation of the arbitration agreement itself under of the faa.accordingly,we commit the parties general contract dispute to the arbitrator,as agreed.
the claim in prima paint was that one party would not have agreed to contract with the other for services had it known the second party was insolvent a fact known but not disclosed at the time of contracting,at.there was,therefore,allegedly fraud in the inducement of the contract a contract which also delegated disputes to an arbitrator.despite the fact that the claim raised would have,if successful,rendered the embedded arbitration clause void,the court held that the merits of the dispute were for the arbitrator,so long as the claim of fraud in the inducement did not go to validity of the arbitration clause itself.at emphasis added.because,in prima paint,no claim ha d been advanced by prima paint that respondent fraudulently induced it to enter into the agreement to arbitrate,and because the arbitration agreement was broad enough to cover the dispute,the arbitration agreement was enforceable with respect to the controversy at hand,at.
the prima paint rule has been denominated as one related to severability.our opinion in buckeye,set out these guidelines 
first,as a matter of substantive federal arbitration law,an arbitration provision is severable from the remainder of the contract.second,unless the challenge is to the arbitration clause itself,the issue of the contract validity is considered by the arbitrator in the first instance.at.
whether the general contract defense renders the entire agreement void or voidable is irrelevant,at.all that matters is whether the party seeking to present the issue to a court has brought a discrete challenge,preston ferrer,to the validity of the arbitration clause.buckeye,at.
prima paint and its progeny allow a court to pluck from a potentially invalid contract a potentially valid arbitration agreement.today the court adds a new layer of severability something akin to russian nesting dolls into the mix courts may now pluck from a potentially invalid arbitration agreement even narrower provisions that refer particular arbitrability disputes to an arbitrator.see ante,at.i do not think an agreement to arbitrate can ever manifest a clear and unmistakable intent to arbitrate its own validity.but even assuming otherwise,i certainly would not hold t
