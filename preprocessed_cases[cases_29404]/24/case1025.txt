background 
hri is a utah corporation that franchises carpet cleaning franchises.in june,the bradleys acquired two franchises and executed two franchise license agreements in connection therewith agreements.each of the agreements provided that,f ollowing the initial five year period,this agreement shall be automatically renewed for additional consecutive five year periods on subsequent five year anniversary dates without any renewal fees being paid by franchisee.franchisee will,however,be required to sign a then current franchise agreement.on may,the parties extended the agreements to june,pursuant to a settlement agreement in a lawsuit brought by the bradleys against hri.
on january,hri sent the bradleys two identical letters one per franchise notifying them of hri intent to allow renewal of the franchises for additional terms,provided that the bradleys sign current franchise agreements and other paperwork and return them by july.hri asked that the bradleys respond in writing by march,and further provided that the contract date had been extended from june,to august,in order to allow the bradleys sufficient time to review the paperwork.
on april,hri sent the bradleys another letter,stating,b ecause you failed to respond by march,we can only assume that you have elected to not renew each of the above referenced franchises.hri therefore stated that,as of august,the two franchises were to be considered and would no longer be in effect.
on july,the bradleys attorney sent hri a letter stating that the agreements had been automatically renewed pursuant to their original terms,citing cal.bus.in case it were later determined,however,that the bradleys were mistaken,they enclosed franchise renewal documents that they had signed and returned to hri conditionally and under protest,in order to protect their business rights,but without waiver of their right to challenge the validity of the agreements agreements.the agreements contained an arbitration clause requiring disputes to be submitted to arbitration in salt lake city,utah,and providing that all arbitration matters were to be governed by the faa the letter further expressed the bradleys view that the contracts were contracts of adhesion and lack ed mutuality.
on july,hri sent the bradleys attorney a letter setting forth its position,pointing out that the agreements required the bradleys to sign new franchise agreements if they wished to renew the franchises.hri asserted that its january,letter constituted the notice required by cal.bus,and that the franchises were not renewed because of the bradleys failure to execute the agreements unconditionally and to execute a release agreement and a velda equipment agreement.nonetheless,hri offered the bradleys another period within which to execute the required documents,without condition,qualification or protest.
on july,hri sent the bradleys new sets of renewal documents,including copies of the agreements.hri informed the bradleys that,in order to renew their franchises,they needed to execute the documents by september,in accordance with the terms of the july letter,unaccompanied by any conditions,qualifications or protests that could impact in any way the creation of binding agreements.
the bradleys did not execute the new documents,instead filing this suit against hri,on july.the bradleys contended that they were entitled to continue operating their franchises under the agreements and sought a declaration of their right to do so.they further sought a determination of the enforceability of the agreements,contending not only that they were adhesion contracts,but that they violated cal.bus.by requiring disputes to be resolved outside california.the bradleys also alleged that the and the agreements violated cal.bus.and that hri engaged in unfair business practices.hri moved for summary judgment on the first bradleys rights under the agreements.hri sought a declaration that the franchises were not validly renewed upon the expiration of the agreements,or,in the alternative,that the bradleys renewed their franchises under the terms of the agreements and hence were required to arbitrate all claims raised in the lawsuit pursuant to the arbitration provision in the agreements.
the district court rejected the bradleys argument that they were entitled to automatically renew the agreements without signing new franchise agreements,pointing to iii of the agreements,which explicitly stated that the franchisee was required to sign a then current franchise agreement in order to renew.the court then addressed hri contention that it was entitled to terminate the agreements under cal.bus.f,which permits a franchisor to refuse to renew if it provides days prior written notice and the parties fail to agree to changes or additions to the franchise agreement.the court concluded that hri had given the requisite statutory notice of intent not to renew,but that the bradleys did not fail to agree to the terms of the agreements.the court reasoned that the bradleys execution of the agreements evidenced their intent to be bound by the agreement,and that by signing under protest,they intended only to preserve their ability to challenge the legality of certain provisions of the agreements.
because the bradleys executed the agreements,they were bound by all of its provisions,including the arbitration clause.the court,however,concluded that the arbitration clause was enforceable only if the arbitration was conducted in california,citing cal.bus.the court therefore denied hri motion for summary judgment,ordered the parties to participate in arbitration in california,and dismissed the case.

discussion 
hri contends that the district court erred in holding that invalidates the agreements arbitration clause requiring arbitration to take place in utah.hri claim is based solely on its argument that the faa preempts the california statute and governs the agreements the act provides 
a written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction,or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof,or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract,transaction,or refusal,shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.
the faa was designed to overrule the judiciary longstanding refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate.volt info,bd.of trs.of the leland stanford,d quoting dean witter reynolds byrd,d.the faa contains no express provision,nor does it reflect a congressional intent to occupy the entire field of arbitration.id.at.citation omitted.however,state law may nonetheless be to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal is,to the extent that it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.id.quoting hines davidowitz.
