introduction 
plaintiff mariam dornbirer appeals from a judgment of the trial court in favor of defendant kaiser foundation health plan,kaiser.after a neutral arbitrator ruled in favor of kaiser on dornbirer claim that kaiser failed to notify her that she needed care following a mammogram in,dornbirer petitioned the trial court to correct or vacate the arbitration award.dornbirer argued that the arbitrator failed to disclose all of the information he was required to disclose pursuant to statute,and that the incomplete disclosure provided grounds for vacating the arbitration award.the trial court denied dornbirer petition.
on appeal,dornbirer maintains that the arbitrator disclosure was fatally deficient under the statutory scheme.we conclude that although the arbitrator disclosure was incomplete,the arbitrator sufficiently disclosed existing grounds for disqualification by acknowledging a prior relationship with both kaiser and kaiser counsel,lewis brisbois bisgaard smith lewis brisbois,and disclosing that he had served as an arbitrator in a number of prior arbitrations involving kaiser and lewis brisbois.the information that the arbitrator disclosed was sufficient to put dornbirer on notice of any potential bias on the arbitrator part.we therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.
factual and procedural background 
dornbirer underwent a mammogram on august,at a kaiser facility.kaiser technicians considered the mammogram incomplete since it showed the presence of a cluster of calcifications,which indicates breast cancer.
according to dornbirer,kaiser never notified her of the results of the mammogram,or that an additional mammogram would be necessary.in july,dornbirer was diagnosed with breast cancer,which had by that time metastasized to other organs.
dornbirer filed a claim in arbitration against kaiser,alleging that kaiser failed to inform her after the mammogram that her mammography was not complete.
the parties agreed that attorney marc adelman would serve as the neutral arbitrator.adelman prepared the disclosure required under code of civil procedure section,and sent it to the parties on june.the arbitration proceeded to a hearing before adelman,between october,and november.witnesses for kaiser testified that they had attempted to contact dornbirer about obtaining further care through letters and telephone calls,that dornbirer had scheduled and then cancelled an appointment for an additional mammogram,and that albert ray,a kaiser physician,had advised dornbirer during an office visit on november,that she needed to repeat her initial mammogram.dornbirer medical records corroborated the testimony of kaiser witnesses.dornbirer testified that the kaiser witnesses were mistaken in their recollections,and that her medical records were incorrect.
adelman,acting as arbitrator,ruled that dornbirer had not established by a preponderance of the evidence that kaiser failed to provide her with sufficient notice of the need for care after her august,mammogram,and thus deemed kaiser the prevailing party in the arbitration.
dornbirer filed a petition to correct or vacate the arbitration award on february,after receiving briefs from the parties and hearing oral argument on the matter,the trial court denied dornbirer petition on june.the court also confirmed the arbitration award in favor of kaiser.dornbirer filed a timely notice of appeal on july,
discussion 
dornbirer contends that the arbitrator failed to comply with the statutory disclosure requirements set forth in the code of civil procedure for proposed neutral arbitrators.proposed neutral arbitrators are to disclose,within calendar days of notice of the proposed nomination,all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed neutral arbitrator would be able to be impartial.code civ.section provides a list of the types of information that constitute matters that would cause a person to entertain a doubt as to the impartiality of the proposed arbitrator.
dornbirer complains that adelman did not clearly disclose how many times he had served as an arbitrator in matters in which kaiser was a party,and that for the matters involving kaiser that adelman did disclose,he failed to provide the dates of those arbitrations,the results of the arbitrations,and the names of other attorneys who were involved in those arbitrations,as is required under section.according to dornbirer,adelman incomplete disclosure provides a ground for vacating adelman arbitration award in kaiser favor under the statute governing the vacating of an arbitration award,which compels vacating an arbitration award if the arbitrator failed to disclose a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator was then aware.
additional background 
pursuant to section,the arbitrator sent dornbirer a disclosure letter after he was proposed as an arbitrator.the letter provided,in relevant part,
i currently do not preside over any matters involving roy lafrancis,jr,or nancy vaughan.i have previously presided over one matter where the claimant was represented by roy lafrancis,jr,and i have previously presided over one matter where kaiser was represented by nancy vaughan.
i am currently presiding over one additional matter involving kaiser permanente,who is being represented by james wallace of lewis brisbois bisgaard smith.
i have presided over fifteen matters involving the law firm of lewis brisbois bisgaard smith.in four of these cases there was a determination on the merits made.in addition,i previously presided over eleven other matters involving kaiser which were either dismissed,settled or resolved on the merits.
i find no fact that would cause a reasonable person to doubt that i could perform the duties of an independent neutral in an impartial manner.
dornbirer did not object to adelman participation as the neutral arbitrator at any time prior to or during the arbitration.
b.the statutory scheme 
there are multiple statutory provisions that are relevant to the issues dornbirer and kaiser raise on appeal.section sets forth the information that a neutral arbitrator is required to disclose to the parties 
a in any arbitration pursuant to an arbitration agreement,when a person is to serve as a neutral arbitrator,the proposed neutral arbitrator shall disclose all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed neutral arbitrator would be able to be impartial,including all of the following 
the existence of any ground specified in section for disqualification of a judge.for purposes of paragraph of subdivision a of section,the proposed neutral arbitrator shall disclose whether or not he or she has a current arrangement concerning prospective employment or other compensated service as a dispute resolution neutral or is participating in,or,within the last two years,has participated in,discussions regarding such prospective employment or service with a party to the proceeding.

the names of the parties to all prior or pending noncollective bargaining cases involving any party to the arbitration or lawyer for a party for which the proposed neutral arbitrator served or is serving as neutral arbitrator,and the results of each case arbitrated to conclusion,including the date of the arbitration award,identification of the prevailing party,the names of the parties attorneys and the amount of monetary damages awarded,if any.in order to preserve confidentiality,it shall be sufficient to give the name of any party not a party to the pending arbitration as claimant or respondent if the party is an individual and not a business or corporate entity.

any professional or significant personal relationship the proposed neutral arbitrator or his or her spouse or minor child living in the household has or has had with any party to the arbitration proceeding or lawyer for a party.
b subject only to the disclosure requirements of law,the proposed neutral arbitrator shall disclose all matters required to be disclosed pursuant to this section to all parties in writing within calendar days of service of notice of the proposed nomination or appointment.
c for purposes of this section,lawyer for a party includes any lawyer or law firm currently associated in the practice of law with the lawyer hired to represent a party.
d for purposes of this section,prior cases means noncollective bargaining cases in which an arbitration award was rendered within five years prior to the date of the proposed nomination or appointment.
e for purposes of this section,any arbitration does not include an arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of a public or private sector collective bargaining agreement.
section discusses when and how a party may disqualify a proposed neutral arbitrator.subdivision c of section further provides that a party failure to act within the time limits specified results in that party waiver of the right to disqualify a neutral arbitrator,unless the arbitrator made a material omission or misrepresentation in his or her disclosure 
section sets forth a list of grounds for vacating an arbitration award.that provision provides in relevant part that the court shall vacate the award if the court determines that a n arbitrator making the award either a failed to disclose within the time required for disclosure a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator was then aware or b was subject to disqualification upon grounds specified in section but failed upon receipt of timely demand to disqualify himself or herself as required by that provision,subd.a.on its face,section leaves no room for discretion.if a statutory ground for vacating the award exists,the trial court must vacate the award.citations.citation.guseinov burns th,d.
although the statute clearly contemplates that there will be situations in which an arbitration award must be vacated,public policy generally favors finality in arbitration awards.see lesser towers,constr.d.
dornbirer asserts that adelman failed to disclose that kaiser was a party to a number of prior arbitrations in which he served as arbitrator,the dates of any arbitration awards,the prevailing parties in prior kaiser arbitrations,the names of the parties attorneys in the prior kaiser arbitrations,and the amount of monetary damages awarded in prior arbitrations in which kaiser was a party.dornbirer claims that adelman disclosure in this case was statutorily deficient,and implies that as a result,she did not have access to sufficient information to have been able to discern that adelman had a financial incentive to rule in kaiser favor.
kaiser acknowledges that the arbitrator disclosure did not entirely comply with the requirements set forth in the statute,observing that w hat was not stated in this communication were any of the dates,additional attorney names,and amounts of the arbitrator prior awards for or against,kaiser and its counsel in the other matters handled by the arbitrator.kaiser contends,however,that the arbitrator incomplete disclosure does not provide sufficient grounds to vacate the arbitration award.
there are two distinct,but related,issues concerning the disclosure at issue here.one is whether,in presenting an ambiguous statement regarding the number of prior kaiser arbitrations in which he had participated,the arbitrator failed to disclose within the time required for disclosure a ground for disqualification.the other is whether the arbitrator failure to disclose certain facts with respect to the disclosed prior arbitrations,the dates of the arbitrations,the attorneys involved,the prevailing party,constitutes a ground to vacate the award.
disclosure of kaiser involvement in the prior arbitrations 
dornbirer contends that with regard to whether kaiser was involved in the prior arbitrations adelman disclosed,the disclosure letter was at least ambiguous and at worst,deliberately misleading on this point.the relevant language from the letter provides 
i am currently presiding over one additional matter involving kaiser permanente,who is being represented by james wallace of lewis brisbois bisgaard smith.
i have presided over fifteen matters involving the law firm of lewis brisbois bisgaard smith.in four of these cases there was a determination on the merits made.in addition,i previously presided over eleven other matters involving kaiser which were either dismissed,settled or resolved on the merits.
according to dornbirer,while adelman stated that he had presided over fifteen matters involving the law firm of lewis brisbois bisgaard smith,he failed to disclose that those matters involved kaiser as party.under dornbirer interpretation of the disclosure,it appeared that adelman had served as an arbitrator in only matters involving kaiser,although in fact he had been involved in a total of arbitrations involving kaiser.dornbirer asserts,the separation of the matters involving the law firm from the eleven other matters involving kaiser implied that the matters involving the law firm did not involve kaiser.
however,adelman letter can just as easily be read as disclosing that all arbitrations involved kaiser.adelman states that he previously presided over eleven other matters involving kaiser italics added.in order to be given effect,the word other in that sentence must refer to additional arbitrations identified in the letter.because the eleven other matters are described in the same paragraph in which the matters involving lewis brisbois are disclosed,it is reasonable to understand the other in that sentence to mean that the matters involving kaiser were in addition to the matters involving kaiser in which kaiser was represented by lewis brisbois.thus,we can not conclude that adelman failed to disclose the nature of his relationship with kaiser.at most,the disclosure is ambiguous.
further,although adelman disclosure letter may be ambiguous with regard to the precise number of cases he had previously arbitrated in which kaiser was a party,the disclosure was sufficient to put dornbirer on notice that adelman had served as an arbitrator in a large number of such cases.if dornbirer was concerned about the number of times adelman had served as an arbitrator for kaiser,she had the opportunity to ask for clarification.however,she did not do so.
the disclosure clearly put dornbirer on notice that adelman had a significant history of serving as an arbitrator in cases in which kaiser was a party.dornbirer was thus aware of facts that might cause her to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed neutral arbitrator would be able to be impartial,subd.a.although dornbirer may have been unaware of the precise number of kaiser arbitrations that adelman had handled,she can not realistically claim to have been surprised to learn that adelman had a prior business relationship with kaiser,and she could have disqualified adelman on that ground if she was concerned about his ability to be impartial.further,even if dornbirer understood adelman disclosure to mean that he had handled prior arbitrations involving kaiser as a party,as opposed to,the difference would not be sufficiently material to the issue of the arbitrator impartiality to render the disclosure fatally defective under the statute.
failure to disclose additional factual information regarding the prior arbitrations 
the basis for vacating an arbitration award is that the arbitrator failed to disclose a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator was then aware,subd.a a.dornbirer asserts that each and every item of information that is required to be disclosed pursuant to section constitutes a ground for disqualification.kaiser counters that such a reading of the statute would have absurd results,in that a party could successfully move to have any arbitration award vacated if an arbitrator failed to disclose the amount of a single prior award or failed to provide the name of a single attorney involved in a prior arbitration.we agree with kaiser that section can not be read to nullify every arbitration award that stems from an arbitration in which the arbitrator failed to disclose all of the details of prior arbitrations,particularly where neither party challenged the arbitrator despite being aware that this information was not contained in the arbitrator disclosure.for this reason,we conclude that not every item of information that is required to be disclosed under section constitutes a ground for disqualification as the term is used in section.rather,the most reasonable interpretation of the statutory scheme is that the words failed to disclose within the time requires for disclosure a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator was then aware in section refer to a failure to disclose the existence and nature of any relationship between the arbitrator and the parties or the parties attorneys,not the specifics of each such relationship.
when a party has been informed of the existence of a prior relationship between the arbitrator and another party or an attorney,that party is aware of facts that would put the party on notice of the potential for bias.if the arbitrator does not include additional information regarding such a relationship in the disclosure,a party has sufficient information to inquire of the arbitrator concerning that information.it is only when the arbitrator fails to acknowledge the existence of such a relationship that a party is without sufficient information to question the impartiality of the arbitrator.
this case does not present a scenario in which a party was unaware that the arbitrator had previously been involved in prior arbitrations with the other party and had no opportunity to request information to shed light on the extent of that relationship.unlike a situation in which an arbitrator wholly fails to acknowledge his or her participation in a prior arbitration involving a party or its attorneys,adelman put dornbirer on notice that he had served as an arbitrator in a number of cases in which kaiser was a party.dornbirer was clearly aware that adelman had not provided the particulars surrounding the prior matters he disclosed,but she did not raise this as an issue prior to the arbitration.rather,she agreed to go forward with the arbitration.allowing dornbirer to successfully petition to vacate the arbitration award in this case,at this stage of the proceeding,on the ground that adelman failed to provide the dates,the names of other attorneys,or the specifics of prior awards as to the arbitrations about which dornbirer was aware,would undermine the statutory scheme.under dornbirer interpretation,a party could simply hold off on raising the issue of the completeness of the arbitrator disclosure,wait to see if he or she is pleased with the arbitration award,and,if unhappy with the award,challenge the award on the basis that the arbitrator failed to disclose information that the party could have easily requested prior to the arbitration.
dornbirer relies on international alliance of theatrical stage employees laughon th,d international alliance to support her position.dornbirer points out that the court in international alliance stated that the grounds for disqualification referred to in section include,of course,those enumerated in the subparagraphs of section,subdivision a.although this broad language,taken out of context,suggests that the international alliance court interpreted the statutory scheme in the manner dornbirer suggests,that every omission of an item of information required under section provides a basis for vacating an arbitration award,the circumstances in international alliance establish that the court was not considering the scope of the statute.rather,the court was dealing with an arbitrator failure to disclose the very existence of a prior arbitration relationship,not simply the details of a prior arbitration.the neutral arbitrator failed to disclose the only case he had previously handled that involved counsel for one of the parties to the arbitration.id.at,d.thus,the defendant in that case had no information about the arbitrator service as a neutral arbitrator in the prior matter.as a result,the international alliance court concluded that,the failure to disclose the sort of prior relationship involved here necessarily satisfied the might cause a reasonable person to question standard mentioned in section.international alliance,supra,th at,d.
the international alliance court was concerned with the arbitrator failure to disclose the sort of prior relationship involved in that,the failure to disclose the existence of a prior relationship with the attorneys representing one party to the arbitration.the court was not addressing whether the lack of information regarding the date of the prior arbitration or the ultimate outcome of the case would have similarly resulted in vacating the arbitration award,if the existence of the prior relationship itself had been disclosed.
dornbirer asserts that in this case,as in international alliance,there was no disclosure of the information at any time,nor was there any opportunity to challenge the arbitrator during the arbitration.she further claims that there was no disclosure that could have led the patient to the omitted information.this is not accurate.adelman disclosed that he had served as an arbitrator in cases involving both kaiser and kaiser counsel on not just one occasion,but multiple times.although adelman disclosure was not complete under the statute,the disclosure provided sufficient information to dornbirer to allow her either to request that he provide additional information concerning the prior arbitrations so that she could make a more informed decision as to whether to agree to use adelman as the arbitrator,or to move to disqualify him for failure to provide all of the information required under the statute.unlike international alliance,in which the plaintiff had no knowledge of the prior relationship between the neutral arbitrator and counsel for the defendant,dornbirer was aware of a significant relationship between adelman and kaiser prior to the arbitration.dornbirer had the opportunity to challenge adelman,but she did not do so.
dornbirer attempts to distinguish this case from fininen barlow th,d fininen.in fininen,the parties agreed on a neutral arbitrator named mccollum.prior to the arbitration,mccollum disclosed potential conflicts of interests by notifying the parties that he had previously mediated several cases for respondents counsel and also mediated arbitrated several cases for barlow counsel.fininen,supra,th at,d.when the parties appeared for the arbitration,barlow and mccollum recognized each other.mccollum then advised the parties and counsel that he had previously mediated a matter in which barlow was a party.ibid.mccollum did not provide the name of the other party,but indicated that the mediation had taken place in santa maria,and that although he had difficulty remembering the prior case,barlow had indicated to him that it had been a construction collection dispute.ibid.mccollum asked the parties to waive any conflicts arising from the disclosure regarding barlow.the parties and counsel all agreed to proceed with the arbitration.ibid.
mccollum heard the matter and issued an arbitration award in favor of the respondents.fininen,supra,th at,d.barlow then filed a petition to vacate the arbitration award on the ground that mccollum failed to make disclosure of his involvement in a prior similar case involving barlow.id.at,d.the trial court denied barlow petition
