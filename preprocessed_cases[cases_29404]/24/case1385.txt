rn solution,rns entered into a contract to recruit south korean nurses for catholic healthcare west chw,which operates a chain of medical facilities.the contract contains a broad arbitration clause.under disputed circumstances,rns chief executive officer ceo,tanya woo,became involved in an intimate relationship with a chw who oversaw the recruiting contract,stephen robertson.woo ultimately pursued felony domestic battery charges against robertson arising from their personal relationship.less than a year after those charges were filed,chw terminated its contract with rns,citing reasons.
woo and rns sued chw and robertson,alleging a series of interrelated contract,business tort,and personal injury claims.the defendants moved separately to compel arbitration of the claims against them.the trial court denied the motions and held that notwithstanding the arbitration agreement all of the claims must be tried in court pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision c.we reverse and hold that the trial court lacked discretion under section et to deny arbitration of causes of action covered by the arbitration clause,and the tort claims do not come within the arbitration clause.
factual and procedural background 
chw operates a system of hospitals and medical centers in california,arizona,and nevada.before leaving chw employment in december,robertson was a managing agent and a of human resources for chw and worked out of its headquarters in san francisco.rns is a california corporation that recruits nurses in south korea and places them in hospitals in the united states.woo is rns president,ceo,and founder.
in,chw bay area division began recruiting nurses from south korea through an exclusive contract with rns.under the contract,rns received a fee for each korean nurse recruited by it and hired by chw.in june,rns and chw renewed the contract for another months.both agreements included mandatory dispute resolution provisions,which required that any dispute between chw and rns aris ing out of the services contracted for in this agreement be resolved by a process consisting of a meet and confer followed by arbitration.the arbitration step of the process was described in relevant part as follows upon written demand by either party,and after exhaustion of the meet and confer process set forth above,any dispute arising out of or in connection with this agreement,including any question regarding its existence,interpretation,validity or termination,shall upon written demand by either party,be referred to the american arbitration association a provision in both agreements specified that they were to be construed and enforced exclusively in accordance with the internal laws of the state of california.the agreements were signed by an officer of chw and by woo on behalf of rns.
in june,chw designated robertson to manage the chw contract and instructed woo to report to him directly.in october,woo entered into a sexual relationship with robertson and moved into robertson residence.woo alleges that robertson coerced her into the relationship by threatening her with the loss of rns exclusive contract and threatening to fire some of the nurses placed by rns,if she did not give in to his demands.
according to woo,robertson soon began a pattern of violent and abusive behavior toward her at home when he drank.in a july incident,he yelled at her,choked her,and pushed her to the floor.in early october,robertson punched woo in the face,causing swelling and damage to her left eye that required medical treatment.in december,while the two were living temporarily in woo house,woo sensed that robertson was going to attack her and attempted to protect herself by barricading herself in a room.robertson allegedly forced the door open,hit woo in the face,and threw her on the floor.he threatened to use a razor on her and warned her not to leave him.when robertson left the room,woo fled to a neighbor house and called.robertson was arrested and charged with five felony counts,including two counts of corporal injury on a cohabitant,subd.a,assault by means likely to cause great bodily injury,subd.a,and false imprisonment.robertson ultimately pled guilty to two counts of felony vandalism for damage caused to a door and painting in woo house.
robertson responsibility for managing the rns contract ended following his december arrest.according to woo,this was not brought about at the initiative of chw management,but was necessitated by orders issued by the court.woo alleges that beginning in the spring of,she began to encounter resistance within chw in her efforts to recruit nurses for the company.woo wrote to the chw board chair summarizing her relationship with robertson,his threats to disrupt rns business relationship with chw if woo did not submit to his sexual demands,and his violence.woo stated that rns had not placed a single nurse with chw following robertson arrest,and expressed her belief that chw executives were retaliating against her for complaining about robertson conduct and for testifying at the preliminary hearing in the criminal proceedings against him.chw board chair wrote back advising that woo charges had been brought to the attention of chw senior leadership and that chw had begun an investigation of them.woo was informed at the end of august,that chw had found no evidence of retaliation against her or rns.
in october,chw terminated rns contract,citing as material breaches by rns that the nurses it recruited lacked contractually required english language skills and that rns used the chw logo without prior authorization.woo and rns rejected these grounds as demonstrably flimsy and pretextual.this lawsuit was filed in october.
b.the complaint 
woo and rns allege causes of action breach of contract against chw breach of the covenant of good faith and faith dealing against chw sexual harassment in violation of government code section,subdivision j against both defendants retaliation in violation of government code section,subdivision h against both defendants sexual harassment in violation of civil code section against both defendants violence in violation of civil code section against both defendants gender violence in violation of civil code section against robertson assault against robertson battery against robertson negligence against both defendants defamation against both defendants tortious interference with prospective economic advantage against both defendants false imprisonment against robertson intentional infliction of emotional distress against robertson declaratory relief against chw and injunctive relief against chw 
motions to compel arbitration 
chw and robertson moved separately to compel arbitration.chw sought to compel arbitration of all causes of action asserted against it.robertson sought to compel arbitration of all causes of action or,if the court determined that not all causes of action were arbitrable,for an order requiring all causes of action to be tried in court.
the court denied both motions.the court found all of the causes of action against chw,except and violence under civil code section and declaratory relief regarding the arbitration clause,were arbitrable all causes of action against robertson,except,and violence,gender violence,assault,battery,false imprisonment,and intentional infliction of emotional distress,were arbitrable and the arbitrable and nonarbitrable causes of action were so intertwined as to create a possibility of conflicting rulings on one or more common issues of fact or law if the court were to order the arbitrable claims to proceed to arbitration and the nonarbitrable claims to proceed in court.based on these findings,the court deemed it appropriate to deny both motions and order all causes of action to be tried in court pursuant to section,subdivision c 
chw and robertson timely appealed from the order denying their motions to compel arbitration.
ii.discussion 
application of section,subdivision c 
when the motions to compel were litigated in the trial court,all parties apparently assumed that the third party provisions of section,including subdivisions c c,would be applicable if the court found that the complaint included arbitrable as well as nonarbitrable claims and that there might be a risk of conflicting determinations if the two types of claims were decided in different forums.once the court made those predicate findings,the only issue left for determination was whether it should exercise its discretion under that subdivision to deny arbitration of all claims or to grant the motion to compel as to specified claims and order either the court proceeding or arbitration stayed pending the outcome of the other.see,subds.c c.on appeal,chw argues for the first time that the third party provisions of section did not in fact apply,and therefore the court erred in believing it had the discretion to deny arbitration.
appellate courts will generally not consider new theories raised for the first time on appeal.in re marriage of moschetta th,d.exceptions exist,however,in cases where a new point of law is decided after the trial court proceedings fisher city of berkeley cal d,fn,or where the new theory presents a question of law to be applied to undisputed facts in the record.transamerica ins.th,d.whether to apply this exception lies within the appellate court discretion.resolution trust winslow th,d.in this case,the facts relevant to the motions to language of the arbitration agreement,the parties who are bound by it,and the allegations of the not in dispute.further,it is at least arguable that the case upon which chw principally relies,rowe exline th,d rowe,which was decided after the appeal was filed in this case,established a new point of law regarding the interpretation of section.accordingly,we will exercise our discretion to consider chw argument regarding section,subdivision c hereafter section c.
chw argument runs as follows subdivisions c through c of section are inapplicable because they require that there be a pending court action between a party to the arbitration agreement and a third party.the term third party for purposes of section,must be construed to mean a party that is not bound by the arbitration agreement.because all of the named parties in the underlying court,rns,chw,and in fact bound by the arbitration agreement under ordinary principles of contract and agency law,there are no third part ies in this case and section c does not apply.
rowe was an appeal from an order denying motions to compel arbitration by a close corporation and two individual defendants who were founders,shareholders,and directors of the corporation.rowe,supra,th at,d.plaintiff rowe was a and former director of the corporation.ibid.the arbitration agreement was contained in a settlement agreement under which rowe had agreed to transfer his ownership interests in the corporation to the corporation,and to resign as a corporate director,in return for in installment payments.id.at,d.rowe signed the settlement agreement on his own behalf and the two defendants signed it as officers of the corporation.ibid.rowe sued all three defendants for breaching the settlement agreement,alleging that the corporation was merely an alter ego of the individual defendants.id.at,d.the complaint also asserted statutory causes of action under the corporations code against the individual defendants as well as the corporation.id.at,d.the trial court denied arbitration of any of the claims in reliance on section,subdivision c.rowe,at,d.the trial court found that rowe,a party to the arbitration agreement,was also a party to the pending court action with third parties,the individual defendants,arising out of the same transaction,the settlement agreement,and that conflicting rulings on common issues were possible.id.at,d.
the court of appeal reversed.it held as an initial matter that whether the individual defendants were in fact third part ies for purposes of section c was a matter of law subject to de novo review.rowe,supra,th at,d.the appellate court further held that the individual defendants,although nonsignatories to the arbitration agreement,could enforce the arbitration agreement against rowe because of his allegation that the corporation was an alter ego of these individuals id.at,d.
finally,in the passage that is of primary importance here,rowe held that section c did not apply on these facts because no court action against a third party was pending section,subdivision c,on which the trial court relied to deny arbitration,provides an exception to mandatory arbitration where a party to the arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court action with a third party,arising out of the same transaction or series of transactions and there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact.italics added.as our supreme court has explained section c addresses the peculiar situation that arises when a controversy also affects claims by or against other parties not bound by the arbitration agreement.the california provision giving the court discretion not to enforce the arbitration agreement under such circumstances avoid s potential inconsistency in outcome as well as duplication of effort.cronus investments,concierge services cal th,d,italics added.because the individual defendants may enforce arbitration of the claims against them,they are not third part ies within the meaning of section,subdivision c.section,subdivision c therefore does not apply,and the trial court erred in denying arbitration on this ground.rowe,supra,th at,d.
in our view,the analysis in rowe applies with equal force here.chw and rns are clearly not third parties because they are both direct signatories of the arbitration agreement.woo,although she signed the arbitration agreement only in her capacity as rns president and ceo,benefited financially and professionally from the recruitment agreement between rns and chw,as alleged in her complaint.she is bound by the arbitration agreement both as an of rns and as a third party beneficiary of the recruitment agreement.see harris superior court d.employee of corporation that is party to arbitration agreement is bound by agreement norcal mutual ins.newton th,d person who accepts benefits under agreement containing arbitration clause is bound by clause.robertson was chw agent with respect to the recruitment agreement.the complaint alleges that he was a managing agent and of human resources within the company.as such,he is also bound by the arbitration agreement and entitled to enforce it.see harris,at.dryer los angeles rams cal d,i f,as the complaint alleges,the individual defendants,though not signatories,were acting as agents for the rams,then they are entitled to the benefit of the arbitration provisions.
since all of the parties involved in the lawsuit are bound by the arbitration agreement,the fundamental precondition for the application of section c a pending court action or special proceeding between a party to the arbitration agreement and a third absent.contrary to plaintiffs contention,the fact that woo and robertson could not compel arbitration of the claims does not make them third parties for purposes of section.no party to the court proceeding could compel arbitration of those claims because they do not come within the coverage of the arbitration clause.the mere fact that some claims are arbitrable and some are not is surely not the peculiar situation meant to be addressed by section c according to our supreme court.cronus investments,concierge services,supra,cal th at,d.
the trial court therefore erred in proceeding under the third party provisions of section c.instead,the court should have first determined the arbitrable and nonarbitrable claims alleged in the complaint,ordered all of the arbitrable claims to arbitration,and stayed all such claims pending arbitration.the court would then have had discretion to delay its order to arbitrate the arbitrable claims under section c,only if it first determined that the adjudication of the nonarbitrable claims in court might make the arbitration unnecessary absent that determination,the arbitrable claims would proceed to arbitration and the nonarbitrable claims would continue to be litigated in court unless a party moved successfully pursuant to section,to stay further litigation
