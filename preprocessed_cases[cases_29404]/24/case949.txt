appellant citizens telecommunications citizens and appellee international brotherhood of electrical workers,local ibew are parties to a collective bargaining agreement cba in effect from october through september.ibew sought an order compelling citizens to arbitrate ibew claim that citizens had violated the cba by reducing employee retirement benefits.the district court granted the motion to compel arbitration and citizens appealed,arguing that ibew can not arbitrate its grievance without first obtaining consent from the retirees currently eligible for benefits under the cba.we affirm.
background 
article of the cba provides that the citizens utilities medical plan,which includes the retiree medical plan,shall be provided for all eligible employees in accordance with the terms of said plans.this article further provides that citizens may make changes to the plan,provided that,inter alia,t he changes do not reduce the overall level of benefits.article also contains the following arbitration provision 
in the event that any dispute arises as to whether the proposed change does or does not reduce the overall level of benefits the dispute will be referred to expedited arbitration without exhaustion of the grievance procedure.
in november,citizens informed ibew,the exclusive bargaining agent for a group of citizens employees,that it was making changes to its medical plan that would affect both current employees and retirees.in particular,citizens purported to cancel retiree medical benefits,beginning in january,for any medicare eligible retiree.in response,ibew filed two grievances.the first,grievance,sought relief from citizens decision to increase the medical plan premiums paid by active employees.the second,grievance,alleged that citizens unilaterally made changes to the retiree medical plan and therefore violated the cba because those changes would reduce the overall level of benefit to the retiree plan.in this grievance,ibew requested that citizens rescind any and all unilateral retiree medical benefit reductions and reimburse retirees appropriately and retroactively.this grievance also requested expedited arbitration pursuant to article of the cba.
citizens,while agreeing to arbitrate grievance,refused to arbitrate grievance.in a letter from citizens associate general counsel to ibew senior assistant business manager,citizens contended that ibew was attempting to grieve issues related to current retirees who were formerly represented by the union.because the union did not currently represent those employees,and because,citizens asserted,the union is not raising an issue covered by the current cba between the parties,citizens claimed that grievance was not arbitrable under the cba.
in april,ibew sued citizens in the eastern district of california seeking to compel arbitration.in opposition,citizens did not contend that the grievance was beyond the scope of the arbitration provision.instead,citizens argued that ibew lacks standing to represent the interests of former employees who are no longer members of the union.int l of workers citizens telecomms.of cal.ibew i,no.civ,wl.may.the district court observed that the bulk of authority addressing the issue has endorsed a rule requiring retiree consent in order for the union to represent the interests of retirees.id.at.the district court ultimately rejected this rule as inconsistent with the ninth circuit understanding of the role and purpose of unions,and out of step with accepted principles of contract law.id.at.the district court granted ibew motion to compel arbitration of grievance over the cancellation of certain medical benefits,and citizens filed this appeal.

a.the cba requires arbitration 
citizens does not dispute that grievance raises an issue that is subject to the expedited arbitration procedures of the cba.as a general rule,a party duty to arbitrate depends on contract law 
a rbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.yet,to be consistent with congressional policy in favor of settlement of disputes by the parties through the machinery of arbitration,the judicial inquiry under must be strictly confined to the question whether the reluctant party did agree to arbitrate the grievance an order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.
united steelworkers warrior gulf navigation,d emphasis added.in grievance,ibew contends that citizens new policy reduces the overall level of benefits in contravention of article of the cba.citizens contends that it does not.this is the issue ibew seeks to submit to arbitration,and the plain language of the cba imposes on citizens a duty to arbitrate.citizens did not contest the existence of this duty before the district court,ibew i,at r espondent does not contend that the aforementioned modifications do not trigger the article duty to arbitrate,and it does not do so here.instead,citizens contends that the district court erred in not requiring a union to obtain the consent of affected retirees before arbitrating claims concerning their benefits,and citizens urges this court to join the fifth sixth,and seventh circuits in requiring the union to do so.appellant br.at.in advancing this position,citizens relies primarily on rossetto pabst brewing,cir,and cleveland electric illuminating utility workers union local,cir.while these cases do not bind the ninth circuit,they are plainly relevant to our consideration and thus merit further examination.
rossetto and cleveland electric 
in rossetto,a collective bargaining agreement between pabst the employer and district the union provided certain benefits to retirees.in june,when the cba expired,pabst proposed eliminating the retiree benefits from a successor agreement to that cba,and district rejected the proposal.in august year informed retirees but not district that it would be terminating the same retiree benefits as of september.on august,after learning of pabst actions,district filed a grievance alleging that the unilateral termination of retiree benefits breached the cba.in september,a group of retired pabst employees also sued pabst in federal court seeking reinstatement of the benefits on the grounds that pabst termination action violated the cba and the employee retirement income security act erisa.in november,pabst reinstated the retiree benefits and agreed to extend the expired cba through january.a day before the cba was again set to expire,district notified pabst of its desire to arbitrate its august grievance,pursuant to a provision of the cba providing for arbitration of certain grievances.the combined effect of the notice and the expiring cba was that the arbitration would pertain only to employees who had already retired,and not to current employees.pabst refused to arbitrate,and the federal plaintiffs amended their complaint to request an order compelling arbitration of the grievance.the district court granted the motion to compel,and pabst appealed.see rossetto,at.
at oral argument,the seventh circuit panel sua sponte raised a critical threshold district has standing to pursue the retirees grievance to arbitration.id.at.the court observed that,in general,a union has standing under article iii of the constitution to arbitrate the meaning of a collective bargaining agreement that grants rights to third parties in this case,retirees simply by virtue of the fact that the union is a party to the contract,and that when the union and employer arbitrate,the union serves as the grievants representative.id.emphasis added.but because district was not the exclusive bargaining representative of the retiree plaintiffs,any claims for benefits here
