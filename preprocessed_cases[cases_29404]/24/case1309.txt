factual and procedural background 
on december,augusta filed a complaint against keehn for legal malpractice.the parties contract included a clause for binding arbitration,but augusta did not invoke it.
in february augusta filed a first amended complaint fac,which added counts for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty based on the same conduct as the negligence claim.the fac alleges as follows.keehn represented augusta,a licensed securities salesman,between and in a bankruptcy proceeding that arose from substantial awards clients obtained against him in securities litigation over certain bonds that defaulted.the bonds,which turned out to be a ponzi scheme,were recommended to augusta and underwritten by his then employer.in a july,letter,keehn allegedly gave augusta faulty advice that the bankruptcy filing automatically extended the statute of limitations for a legal malpractice action code civ.against the attorneys who jointly represented him and his former employer in the securities litigation hereafter underlying malpractice action.as a result,the attorneys in the underlying malpractice action obtained summary judgment on the negligence cause of action of augusta complaint,which left only claims for intentional misconduct.the loss of the negligence claim caused a million reduction in a settlement augusta received.
keehn represented himself during the first few months of the litigation.he responded to the fac by serving augusta with a prefiling copy of a motion for monetary sanctions for the bringing of a frivolous lawsuit,subd.b,on the ground the action was since the only alleged wrongdoing occurred in.keehn argued the statute of limitations was not tolled by his continued representation of augusta to,because he represented augusta only in the bankruptcy matter and not in the underlying malpractice action.under section,subdivision c,the offending party may avoid sanctions by withdrawing the pleading without penalty within a safe harbor period.galleria plus,hanmi bank th.augusta did not dismiss the fac,and on march keehn filed his motion for sanctions.keehn also demurred to the fac on the statute of limitations ground.
on march,augusta propounded to keehn form interrogatories,special interrogatories,requests for admissions,and a demand for production of documents.keehn served responses,and on april,augusta sent keehn a meet and confer letter complaining the responses were inadequate and spurious and demanding supplemental responses within five days.the letter cited provisions of the civil discovery act et,and warned that f ailure to do so will result in the appropriate motions to compel and sanctions for your failure to comply.also on april,the court denied keehn motion for monetary sanctions under section.
keehn did not supplement his discovery responses,and on may,augusta applied ex parte for an order continuing the hearing on the demurrer so he could first move to compel discovery.the court denied the application.
on may,augusta noticed keehn deposition for june and.on may,augusta filed motions to compel further responses to his requests for admissions and form interrogatories,and for a total of in sanctions.on may,the court overruled keehn demurrer to the fac.
on june,keehn associated in defense counsel.augusta notified keehn new counsel that a case management conference was scheduled for june,and the hearing on augusta motions to compel discovery was scheduled for august.further,augusta supplied keehn new counsel with a copy of the notice of keehn deposition.keehn answered the fac and alleged as an affirmative defense that the action was subject to arbitration.
at the june case management hearing,the court scheduled trial for january.after the hearing,augusta confirmed in writing that keehn advised augusta he would not seek arbitration after all.he also confirmed that keehn deposition was still scheduled for june and,and that he and his counsel had engaged in significant efforts to prepare for this deposition.keehn asked to reschedule the deposition,and augusta agreed to do so until some time in july.
on june,however,augusta cancelled keehn deposition.in a letter to keehn attorney,augusta attorney advised that he intended to petition to compel arbitration,and,f rankly,we do not want you or keehn to suggest to the court that we have somehow waived our client right to compel arbitration by taking keehn deposition.on june,augusta made a written demand on keehn for arbitration.keehn responded that he opposed arbitration based on augusta litigation of the matter in superior court for many months 
on july,augusta filed a petition to compel arbitration.keehn opposed the petition on the ground of waiver.
on july,augusta agreed to take his motions to compel further discovery off calendar in exchange for keehn agreement to provide supplemental discovery responses.in a confirming letter,augusta attorney stated that if he deemed the supplemental responses inadequate,and if the court denied the motion to compel arbitration,augusta reserved the right to file a subsequent motion to compel further discovery.
before augusta petitioned to compel arbitration,keehn had propounded discovery requests to him.in late august,augusta responded to each of the requests by stating discovery is not available in arbitration.augusta objected to keehn notice of his deposition on the same ground.
on october,the court issued a tentative ruling denying augusta petition to compel arbitration.the court found augusta unreasonably delayed in demanding arbitration,and he took steps inconsistent with an intent to invoke arbitration.the court explained in the time between filing his lawsuit and demanding arbitration,plaintiff served discovery to defendants,engaged in meeting and conferring about defendants discovery responses,noticed plaintiff deposition,filed two motions to compel discovery and until june,notably after defendants obtained counsel,expressed his intentions of continuing with the depositions and motions to compel.the court determined augusta conduct prejudiced keehn as follows while augusta ultimately cancelled the deposition and the motions were taken,keehn responded to discovery and provided supplemental responses before the discovery motion date.in his discovery responses,keehn disclosed at least some of his trial theories which would not have been disclosed if the case was in arbitration.keehn lost whatever efficiencies he would have gained through arbitration.
during a hearing on the same date,the court asked augusta to explain his delay in seeking arbitration.he attributed the delay to keehn.he argued that as an attorney,keehn should have moved to compel arbitration instead of filing a motion for sanctions and demurring to the fac,and voluntarily responding to his discovery requests.the court confirmed its tentative ruling.
