this appeal under the railway labor act,et rla,concerns when an enforcement action accrues under the statute of limitations after an arbitration award and,alternatively,whether a request for interpretation of an arbitration award tolls the limitations period.following an arbitration award,the union sought to enforce the award in district court.the district judge determined that the union petition was outside the,statutory limitations period and dismissed the enforcement action,which has presented issues for our circuit.we affirm.
background 
on november,pitzen,employed by,csx transportation,csx,claimed absence from work because of an neck injury.csx did not question the legitimacy of pitzen claim.after nearly a absence,pitzen told a supervisor that,during the period when he supposedly was unable to operate trains,he had driven from ohio to panama city,florida,participated in a karate tournament,and won the title at that tournament.because his claimed injury absence was under false pretenses,csx charged pitzen with dishonesty and terminated him.
on behalf of pitzen,brotherhood of locomotive engineers and trainmen general committee of adjustment csx transportation northern lines blet,challenged his dismissal and requested his reinstatement.pursuant to the parties collective bargaining agreement and a separate arbitration agreement that established public law board the board,the parties referred pitzen claim to the board an arbitrator determined that csx had the burden of proving that pitzen had been dishonest regarding his absence because of his alleged injury and that it had failed to carry its burden.on june,the arbitrator sustained pitzen claim and ordered compliance within thirty days.
csx reinstated pitzen but did not pay him back wages for the period of his dismissal.on august,blet sent a letter to csx and demanded back pay for pitzen.csx responded on october,that the award did not require the payment of back wages.for more than a year,blet did nothing.in november,blet sent two more letters to csx demanding back pay for pitzen.csx responded by repeating its position that the award did not include back pay.
on february,blet requested that the arbitrator clarify whether the award required payment of back wages.blet had first acknowledged the potential need for such a clarification in its initial letter on august,but delayed making its request for an interpretation for another sixteen months.on april,the arbitrator clarified that,although the award did not provide for back wages expressly,the terms of the parties collective bargaining agreement required them.nonetheless,blet waited almost four more months before filing its petition for enforcement with the district court on august.in lieu of an answer,csx moved to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,because the statute of limitations barred blet petition to enforce the award.
on the facts pled in blet petition,the district judge concluded that the cause of action for enforcement accrued on july,and granted csx motion.the judge additionally decided that the board had issued an interpretation of the award under first m,which did not toll the statute of limitations.accordingly,the district judge determined that blet filed its august,petition outside the limitations period and dismissed the action.blet has appealed that order.

accrual of cause of action 
there is no dispute that the statute of limitations contained in first r applies to blet action.this appeal concerns when blet enforcement cause of action under first p accrued for the purpose of calculating the running of the statute of limitations.because the award specifically states that csx had to comply within thirty days,and the date of the award was june,the district judge concluded that blet enforcement cause of action accrued on july.since blet did not file its petition for enforcement until august,the judge dismissed blet claim as untimely.
the statute of limitations for rla enforcement actions states that a ll actions at law based upon the provisions of this section shall be begun within two years from the time the cause of action accrues under the award of the division of the adjustment board,and not after.first r emphasis added.to determine when an enforcement cause of action accrues,the statute provides 
if a carrier does not comply with an order of a division of the adjustment board within the time limit in such order,the petitioner,or any person for whose benefit such order was made,may file in the district court of the united states a petition setting forth briefly the causes for which he claims relief,and the order of the division of the adjustment board in the premises.such suit in the district court of the united states shall proceed in all respects as other civil suits,except that on the trial of such suit the findings and order of the division of the adjustment board shall be conclusive on the parties 
first p emphasis added.the plain language of these provisions makes the carrier failure to comply within the time limit established by the award the triggering event for an enforcement action and the running of the statute of limitations.blet interpretation,that there is a cause of action for enforcement of an award,not when an award issues,or even when it becomes effective,but when the carrier refuses to comply with the award,appellant br.at,disregards the subsequent clarifying statutory phrase that a carrier must comply within the time limit in such order,first p.
the primary principle of statutory construction requires courts to give effect to the plain meaning of the words used in their ordinary and usual sense.caminetti united states.to the extent possible,the rules of statutory construction require courts to give meaning to every word and clause in a statute.united states menasche.trw andrews,d.additionally,courts must reject statutory interpretations that would render portions of a statute surplusage.trw,at.at.
consequently,the plain meaning of within the time limit in such order in first p is that a cause of action to enforce an award arises at the end of the time limit set forth in that award.by requiring a carrier to comply by a date certain,the rla provides plaintiffs with a basis to determine whether they have a cause of action for enforcement.no compliance by the requisite date indicates that a potential plaintiff had time to acquire sufficient factual knowledge for reasonable inquiry to reveal the cause of action.united states kubrick,d.in this case,blet had reasonable basis to know that csx was not going to pay pitzen back wages when it did not do so by july,the date specified in the award for compliance.consequently,blet cause of action accrued on the date following the deadline for compliance stated in the award,or july,as the district judge correctly determined.
other circuits have interpreted first p literally and strictly as did the district judge in this case.see lekas united airlines,cir recognizing that the failure to comply would have occurred when payment was not made within that specified time emphasis added transportation commc ns int l union csx,cir tciu as a general rule,a cause of action accrues for purposes of subdivision r upon a carrier at the time fixed for compliance in the award.emphasis added joint council dining car employees local,hotel restaurant employees int l alliance delaware,cir concluding that the cause of action accrued the day after the date specified in the award for compliance these consistent interpretations in other circuits not only are supported by the clear meaning of the statutory text but also are justified by policy considerations underlying statutes of limitations.with statutes of limitations,legislatures determine that the right to be free of stale claims in time comes to prevail over the right to prosecute them.kubrick,at.at citation omitted.statutes of limitations are not arbitrary obstacles to the vindication of just claims,and therefore they should not be given a grudging application.they protect important social interests in certainty,accuracy,and repose.cada baxter healthcare,cir posner.tying the accrual of an enforcement action to the specific time set forth in the award ensures that these interests are served and guarantees that both the potential plaintiff and the carrier know the earliest and latest date that an enforcement action can be instituted.railroad yardmasters of am.indiana harbor belt,cir.
significantly,this definite standard serves the policy considerations underlying the rla.one of the stated objectives of the rla is to provide for the prompt and orderly settlement of railway labor disputes.in enacting the rla,congress endeavored to promote stability in relations in this important national industry by providing effective and efficient remedies for the resolution of disputes arising out of the interpretation of agreements.union pac.sheehan,d per curiam.the specific limitations period established in this case by the district judge interpretation of first p promotes efficiency and prevents labor disputes concerning this issue.see id.at.at a determination than an employee had not filed his appeal within the time requirements of the agreement is final and binding upon the parties and neither the district court nor the court of appeals had authority to disturb it.
blet has not identified any authority that supports an accrual rule different from the district judge application of first p accordingly,the district judge did not err in concluding that csx failed to comply within the time period specified in the award.because the award in this case expressly provided a time for compliance,the relevant authority supports the july,accrual date and substantiates the district judge dismissal.therefore,the district judge correctly determined that blet cause of action accrued when csx refused to provide back pay by the date stated for compliance in the arbitrator award.because blet waited more than two years after that date to file its petition,the district judge properly dismissed blet enforcement action as barred by the statute of limitations.
effect of request for interpretation on statute of limitations 
blet alternatively argues that,even if its cause of action accrued on july,the district judge still erred in dismissing the case because blet request for an interpretation from the board as to whether csx had to pay back wages tolled the running of the statute of limitations.equitable tolling is a form of extraordinary relief that courts have extended only sparingly.irwin department of veterans affairs,d.it is appropriate when a movant untimely files because of extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond his control and unavoidable even with diligence.arce,at quoting sandvik united states,cir per curiam see outler united states,cir per curiam equitable tolling is only available if the petitioner establishes extraordinary circumstances and due diligence.the plaintiff bears the burden of showing that such extraordinary circumstances exist.arce,at.the district judge explained that blet fails to allege any extraordinary circumstances beyond its control and unavoidable with diligence that prevented it from filing its action within the limitations period.instead,blet relies on the argument that the filing of a request for interpretation tolls the statute of limitations.at.
requests for interpretations are not uncommon in rla arbitration proceedings.first m.significantly,blet could have sought an interpretation when csx showed that it did not intend to pay pitzen back wages by not doing so by july,the date of compliance specified in the award.additionally,csx clarified that it did not believe that the award required it to make a payment of back wages in the october,letter that it sent to blet.nonetheless,blet waited until february,to request interpretation.even when the arbitrator issued an interpretation on april,blet waited until august,to file its petition for enforcement.these delays show blet lack of diligence and such lack of diligence is inimical to a request for tolling.arce,at,sandvik,at outler,at.
f or statute of limitations purposes,a plaintiff ignorance of his legal rights and his ignorance of the fact of his injury or its cause should not receive identical treatment.kubrick,at.at lekas,at.the determinative fact is whether the plaintiff had knowledge of the harm incurred.blet knew when pitzen did not receive back wages to which he was entitled within the time that the award established for compliance.
blet could have pursued an interpretation while it sought to enforce the award.enforcement and interpretation proceedings should proceed separately and simultaneously.great northern ry.national adjustment,first,cir accord tciu,at.the seventh circuit explained that the two procedures enforcement and interpretation should proceed independently of,and simultaneously with,each other.great northern,at.when these two actions proceed together,the first m proceedings will result in an interpretation of the award which the parties can make available to the court in the enforcement action,which is precisely what the statute contemplates by not dismissing the enforcement action despite the first m interpretation request.id.the fact that the carrier may have been seeking clarification from the board to support its position does not amount to evidence that the carrier either concealed plaintiff cause of action or caused plaintiff to miss a filing deadline,and,consequently,does not justify equitable tolling.lekas,at.because blet sought an award interpretation did not prevent it from simultaneously filing an enforcement action to protect its rights.therefore,blet request for interpretation did not justify equitable tolling,because it had not met its burden of showing that extraordinary circumstances existed.arce,at.
to determine whether equitable tolling is appropriate,t he basic question is one of legislative intent whether the right shall be enforceable after the prescribed time.id.quoting burnett new york cent,d second omission in original see midstate horticultural pennsylvania.it does not follow that congress did not intend the limitation period to be absolute.therefore,federal courts have refused to toll the period established by first r the rla should be literally applied in the absence of a clear showing of a contrary or qualified intention of congress.brotherhood of trainmen chicago river,d.under a strict interpretation of r,the second circuit concluded 
this is a part of the rla setting up a specially constituted board to deal with the minor disputes of the in the interpretation or application of employment agreements.as an integral part of this system,congress gave the employees a special and favorable statutory remedy,to be exercised within two years and not after,a period of enforced inaction for the employer,during which he can not obtain even a declaration of his rights under the original agreement.we think,therefore,that a court is not justified in finding any exception to,or extension of,this period.
