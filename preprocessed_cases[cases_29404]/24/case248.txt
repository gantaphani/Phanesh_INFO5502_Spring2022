this appeal concerns the issue of arbitrability in the context of the rules of the national association of securities dealers nasd.jean bensadoun,a stockbroker registered with the nasd,appeals from the january,judgment of the district court for the southern district of new york jed rakoff,district judge dismissing his suit for declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the,eight investors the investors from requiring him to arbitrate their claims against him.we conclude that the suit was prematurely dismissed,and therefore vacate and remand for further proceedings.
background 
underlying allegations.in june,the investors filed a statement of claims soc for arbitration with the nasd.the soc named as respondents bensadoun,two brokerage firms for which he worked during the relevant time period,ubs paine webber,paine webber and salomon smith barney,and man financial.the soc designated michel autard as an unnamed.autard is a resident of switzerland and,during the relevant periods,was a principal and the managing director of compagnie financiere metropolitaine sa cfm,a swiss company.although not a party to this action or the underlying arbitration,autard was allegedly a key participant in the alleged fraud and conspiracy that precipitated the present controversy.
the soc alleges that bensadoun and autard conspired to defraud the investors,resulting in a net loss of.according to the soc,the investors made a series of fund transfers to paine webber in.bensadoun,then employed by paine webber,was the account representative for the brokerage accounts into which the funds were initially transferred.these transfers were made on the investors understanding that autard would open accounts for them at painewebber and that he would invest the proceeds in a combination of stocks and bonds.instead,autard and bensadoun deposited the investors funds in accounts held under cfm name,which prevented the investors from receiving copies of monthly statements and confirmations.the soc implies that the pooling of funds in an account held in the name of cfm was done without investors knowledge or consent.
at some point after the first cfm account was opened,pierre schmidt,one of the investors,alleges that he discovered that the account was not registered in his name and he called bensadoun to complain about this fact.the soc alleges that bensadoun told schmidt that the funds were being held temporarily in the account of cfm in order to complete certain administrative tasks.bensadoun allegedly told schmidt that he would open an account in schmidt name.bensadoun did open the account in schmidt name,but the address on the account was cfm instead of schmidt.the soc alleges that autard and bensadoun conspired to keep schmidt uninformed about this second account.
in its answer and defenses to the soc,filed with the nasd arbitration panel,paine webber asserts that,in opening this account,schmidt executed a form granting trading authority on the account to michel autard.paine webber asserts that three accounts are at issue two accounts opened under cfm name and a separate account opened under schmidt name.the soc implies,without directly stating,that the second cfm account referred to by paine webber and the schmidt account were in fact the same.
when bensadoun transferred his employment to smith barney,some portion of the paine webber accounts were allegedly transferred to smith barney as well.also,bensadoun opened an account in the name of pierre schmidt at smith barney.
the soc alleges other direct contacts between bensadoun and the investors.the soc alleges that after cfm went into bankruptcy,bensadoun called schmidt at his home and told schmidt that he had invested money in cfm,and that his father had invested about with cfm as well.when catherine peiretti sought to withdraw money from her account,bensadoun allegedly told her that the money was not available in her account at that time,and that she would be paid from the cfm account instead a check was apparently issued to peiretti drawing on cfm funds.the soc also alleges that madame and her alban peiretti faxed memoranda to bensadoun making inquiries about her investments in what she thought was her account.the soc includes as exhibits two letters written by alban peiretti on behalf of madame inquiring as to her accounts.the soc states that following the events complained of,cfm went into bankruptcy and autard was arrested for embezzlement.
bensadoun suit for declaratory relief.in december,bensadoun filed the suit from which this appeal arises,naming the investors as defendants.contrary to the usual alignment in stockbroker controversies in which an nasd broker demands arbitration,bensadoun sought a declaration that the investors have no right to arbitrate against him and an injunction preventing the investors from pursuing arbitration.
bensadoun submitted a proposed order to show cause why arbitration should not be preliminarily enjoined,supported by his affidavit and a memorandum of law.in this affidavit,bensadoun declares that none of the investors other than schmidt was ever his customer,and that no misconduct is alleged in connection with schmidt personal account.he states that he never had any contact with the investors,other than schmidt,prior to the closing of the cfm accounts and that he never saw the letters,purportedly addressed to him,that the investors attached to the soc.he also says that the accounts that the complaint concerns were opened by cfm,through autard,and that the accounts enjoyed profits while under bensadoun representation.finally,he states that when the accounts were eventually closed at the direction of autard,the funds in the accounts were transferred to cfm account in switzerland.
proceedings before the district court were apparently quite limited.the court did not issue the proposed show cause order,and appears instead to have treated it as a motion to stay arbitration.in response to the proposed order to show cause,the defendants filed a memorandum opposing the motion to stay arbitration and an affidavit of richard fooshee,the attorney for the defendants.this affidavit states that the client agreements of paine webber include an arbitration clause and that schmidt had such an agreement with paine webber.
in january,the district court issued a brief memorandum order denying bensadoun motion to stay arbitration.the court ruled that customer,as used in the nasd rules,is to be given a liberal construction.the court further ruled that the soc,liberally construed in favor of the investors,alleges that bensadoun participated in a scheme to convince the investors that they were engaged in an relationship with bensadoun,and that this allegation was sufficient,on the present sparse record,to support sending the matter to arbitration without prejudice to any subsequent determination the arbitrators may make,on a fuller record,as to their jurisdiction.
because the action had no other raison besides the motion to stay arbitration,the district court ordered the complaint dismissed,and judgment was entered dismissing the action.
discussion 
i.the district court deferral of the arbitrability issue 
in the absence of a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment,and prior to any discovery,the district court dismissed the complaint,acknowledging that the record thus far developed was sparse.in doing so,the court appears to have resolved against bensadoun the factual issues he sought to present.the district court declined to give close scrutiny to bensadoun contentions in the belief that the arbitrators would have an opportunity to evaluate their own jurisdiction on a fuller record.the case law is clear,however,that u nless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise,the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is to be decided by the court,not the arbitrator.john hancock life ins.wilson,cir quoting at t techs.communications workers of america,d see also spear,leeds kellogg central life assurance,cir whether or not a matter is arbitrable is a matter for judicial determination.
in john hancock,we ruled that the nasd code does not evidence a clear and unmistakable intent to submit t
