gary and jennifer taylor petitioned the superior court to confirm an arbitration award they had obtained in their dispute with a construction contractor,respondent construction vcc.the court,however,granted vcc request to correct the award under code of civil procedure section on the ground that the arbitrator had exceeded his powers in granting attorney fees.the taylors appeal,contending that the court erred in reviewing the award and in correcting a legal error that did not exist.we agree that the deletion of the attorney fees was improper,and we must therefore reverse the order.
background 
the parties dispute arose after the taylors engaged vcc to remodel their home.when the taylors refused to pay the full contract price,vcc demanded arbitration pursuant to their agreement.in their answering statement the taylors asserted a counterclaim for the amount they had incurred to repair the defects in vcc work.on february,the arbitrator found that vcc performance had been materially substandard and inexcusably delinquent,thus entitling the taylors to compensation for their reasonable,substantiated costs in completing and correcting said work.the arbitrator awarded the taylors in damages,subject to an offset of.
the arbitrator also declared the taylors to be the prevailing parties and awarded them in attorney fees.in making the fee award,the arbitrator reasoned as follows although the governing contract between claimant vcc and respondents the taylors is devoid of any attorney fee provision,respondents are statutorily entitled to such a recovery as the prevailing party pursuant to code of civil procedure section a c sic,and by operation of the american arbitration association rule d,permitting such an award where,as here,all parties have requested the same through their respective claims,counterclaims,and answering statements filed in this arbitration.italics omitted.
on march,the taylors filed a petition to confirm the award.in its opposition vcc urged the court either to dismiss the petition as procedurally defective or,alternatively,to correct the award to delete the attorney fees.vcc contended that the award of attorney fees was without any contractual or statutory basis,that neither party had requested such fees,and that the award was beyond the arbitrator authority under civil code section.consequently,vcc argued,the arbitrator had exceeded his powers in awarding attorney fees.
the superior court agreed with vcc.the court noted that the applicable arbitration rules permitted arbitrators to award attorney fees if the arbitration agreement provided for them,if all parties had requested them,or if they were authorized by law here,the court ruled,none of these conditions applied.it was undisputed that the parties agreement did not mention attorney fees,and vcc had not requested such fees in the arbitration proceeding.furthermore,the arbitrator seemed to conclude that there was a bona fide dispute between the parties,and under darling controlled environments construction th,d,a party is entitled to attorney fees only in cases where a bona fide dispute did not exist consequently,controlled environments precludes either party from recovering attorney fees as costs under civil code.accordingly,the court ordered the award corrected to reflect this error by the arbitrator.

scope of review 
the parties agree that code of civil procedure section provides for correction of an arbitration award if t he arbitrators exceeded their powers but the award may be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted.code civ,subd.b see also code civ,vacating awards.however,the deference due an arbitrator decision on the merits of the controversy requires a court to refrain from substituting its judgment for the arbitrator in determining the contractual scope of those powers.advanced micro devices,intel cal th,d,amd.in particular,arbitrators do not exceed their powers merely by rendering an erroneous decision on a legal or factual issue,so long as the issue was within the scope of the controversy submitted to the arbitrators.moshonov walsh cal th,d.
furthermore,a court may not vacate or correct an arbitration award merely because it disagrees with the arbitrator choice of remedy.a n appropriately deferential review starts not from the beginning,but from the arbitrator own rational assessment of his or her contractual powers and is dependent on that is,rests on acceptance of this and any other factual or legal determination made by the arbitrator.the principle of arbitral finality,the practical demands of deciding on an appropriate remedy for breach,and the prior holdings of this court all dictate that arbitrators,unless expressly restricted by the agreement or the submission to arbitration,have substantial discretion to determine the scope of their contractual authority to fashion remedies,and that judicial review of their awards must be correspondingly narrow and deferential.amd,supra,cal th at,d.were courts to reevaluate independently the merits of a particular remedy,the parties contractual expectation of a decision according to the arbitrators best judgment would be defeated.id.at,d,see also united paperworkers intern.union,misco,d courts have no authority to disagree with arbitrator honest judgment in determining contract remedies because judicial intervention would undermine speedy private resolution of grievances.
accordingly,arbitrators,unless expressly restricted by the agreement of the parties,enjoy the authority to fashion relief they consider just and fair under the circumstances existing at the time of arbitration,so long as the remedy may be rationally derived from the contract and the breach.the rights and obligations of the parties under the contract as it was to be performed are not an unfailing guide to the remedies available when the contract has been breached.it follows that parties entering into commercial contracts with arbitration clauses,if they wish the arbitrator remedial authority to be specially restricted,would be well advised to set out such limitations explicitly and unambiguously in the arbitration clause.amd,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
propriety of attorney fees in arbitration award 
vcc maintains that in this case the arbitrator exceeded his powers because attorney fees were not authorized under the aaa rules,the contract,or civil code section.it is undisputed that attorney fees were not provided for in the parties agreement on the other hand,they were not expressly restricted either.id.at,d.in any event,the arbitrator did not purport to base the award on any contractual provision.instead,he identified two reasons for granting attorney fees to the taylors a rule of the american arbitration association that allows such fees when all parties have requested them see aaa rules,d and code of civil procedure section,subdivision a c.although,contrary to vcc assertion and the court finding,vcc clearly did request attorney fees the record discloses no similar request by the taylors.however,we need not decide whether the arbitrator reliance on a request by all parties constituted an error of fact or law or resulted in an act in excess of the arbitrator powers,because his alternative rationale should not have been supplanted by the court own legal conclusion.
code of civil procedure section,subdivision a c,permits an award of attorney fees as costs when authorized by l aw.the arbitrator apparently believed that the authorizing law in this case was civil code section the statute on which vcc had based its request for fees.neither in the court below nor on appeal did vcc contend that the mere act of applying statutory authority was in itself beyond the powers of the arbitrator it is only the result of that application that vcc disputes.thus,we are not presented with an issue of whether an arbitration award was improperly based on an extrinsic source or whether a chosen remedy is rationally drawn from the contract as interpreted.amd,supra,cal th at,d.
