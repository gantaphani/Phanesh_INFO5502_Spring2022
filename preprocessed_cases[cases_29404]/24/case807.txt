patrick manion,sued attorney stephen nagin,and the law firms of herzfeld rubin,herzfeld rubin,and nagin gallop figueredo,for breach of fiduciary duty,negligence,and tortious interference with contract stemming from nagin conduct in the creation and representation of the boat dealers alliance,bda the district court dismissed manion suit,and we affirm.
background 
because this matter reaches us following a motion to dismiss the complaint,we construe the pleadings liberally in favor of manion and accept the allegations in his complaint as true.wisdom first midwest bank,cir patrick manion worked for many years in the pleasure boat industry.in,he came up with a plan to organize,own,and operate an entity made up of retail boat dealers,who would use their buying power to purchase marine equipment at significant discounts.
stephen nagin held himself out as an attorney who was experienced in representing buying groups.when manion contacted nagin about manion idea to create his marine buying group,nagin boasted that he was a world class lawyer working at a world class law firm.appellant app.at.he claimed to be one of the few lawyers in the country who had expertise in organizing buying groups.in the spring of,nagin agreed to represent manion in creating and running bda.nagin told manion that he would charge per hour for his work on bda,but eventually the two agreed that nagin would charge an hour but also receive ten percent of bda preferred stock.owners of the preferred stock received ten percent of bda annual distributable income.until nagin suggested he take an ownership interest in bda preferred stock,manion intended to be the sole owner of it.
nagin incorporated bda in florida.manion questioned whether it was wise to incorporate in this venue,but nagin shrugged off manion concern,stating i am the attorney.i am the one who is well versed in this.let me do my job and you do yours.appellant app.at.when nagin prepared bda,manion noticed that preferred stock shareholders could only vote for certain changes in the,while common stock shareholders had unrestricted voting rights.he questioned nagin about how he,owning only preferred stock,could control bda if he could not vote on general matters.nagin advised manion that he maintained control over bda because the value of his preferred stock was so much greater than the value of common stock,and because of a management agreement that nagin had drafted to serve as manion employment contract with bda.nagin assured manion that the management agreement precluded bda from removing manion from his position as executive director for any reason for twenty years.
by,nagin had become unhappy with his fee structure.he wrote to manion,asserting that he was not receiving the amount of compensation they had anticipated in crafting the fee agreement.the two agreed on a new fee structure,whereby nagin received a greater percentage of the preferred stock dividends.manion was the only other shareholder of the preferred stock,meaning that the increased legal fees would be paid from monies originally due to manion.
on february,bda held a special meeting at which bda terminated manion.in arbitration proceedings related to manion claims of wrongful termination,bda successfully argued that its termination of manion was proper because he acted in bad faith against the interests of bda.the district court confirmed the arbitration award,and this court affirmed.see manion nagin,cir.manion,still a majority shareholder of the preferred stock,decided to attend bda april,meeting.at the meeting,manion learned that nagin had asked bda finance committee to search for additional grounds to justify bda termination of manion.when manion learned about this,he asked nagin who he was representing.nagin responded that he represented bda.up until this point,nagin had not told manion that he did not represent manion,and manion considered nagin to be his lawyer.
manion filed suit against bda,its individual members,nagin,and his law firms.the district court directed arbitration with regard to manion complaint against bda and its members pursuant to the terms of his contract,and stayed his claims against nagin and the law firms pending the outcome of the arbitration.this court affirmed.manion nagin,cir.following the arbitrator decision,nagin and the law firms moved to dismiss manion complaint,contending that the claims were either legally deficient,collaterally estopped,or barred for failure to comply with a minnesota statute concerning legal malpractice claims.the district court dismissed manion complaint,and this appeal followed.
the district court found that manion tortious interference with contract claim and some of his negligence claims were barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel,also known as issue preclusion.we look to state law in determining whether to apply issue preclusion,liberty mut.ins.fag bearings,cir,and review the district court ruling on the matter de novo,union fire ins.terra,cir.a party is precluded from litigating an issue if the following conditions are met the issue to be litigated is identical to one already decided in a prior adjudication the earlier case resulted in a final judgment on the merits the party raising the issue was a party to or in privity with a party to the prior case and the party was given a full and fair opportunity to be heard on the issue.crumley city of paul,cir stating minnesota legal standard for the doctrine of collateral estoppel cmty.bank of homestead torcise,cir recognizing similar elements under florida substantive law 
manion first argues that the district court erred by relying on findings in his related arbitration proceeding against bda and its members when deciding if any of his claims were collaterally estopped against nagin and the law firms.we disagree.an arbitration award counts as a final judgment for collateral estoppel purposes.wellons,ibberson,cir.while manion complains that he did not get a full and fair hearing in the arbitration,we have considered this argument at length in the related appeal of manion nagin,cir,and rejected manion position.
manion tortious interference with contract claim stems from his allegation that nagin interfered with his employment rights under his management agreement.in order to prove tortious interference,manion is required to show that he had valid contract rights which nagin knew about and procured another party to breach without justification,and that he was damaged by the breach.guercio prod.automation,accord salit ruden,mcclosky,smith,schuster,russell,so d,stating that under florida law,a plaintiff alleging tortious interference must prove the existence of a business relationship accompanied by legally enforceable rights,the intentional and unjustified interference with that relationship,and damages.manion arbitrated the issue of whether bda breached his management agreement without justification.the arbitrator interpreted the contract to permit bda to terminate manion if he was grossly negligent or acted in bad faith.finding that manion demonstrated bad faith in three instances where he failed to act in bda financial interest,the arbitrator held that bda was justified in terminating manion employment contract.
the arbitration decision precludes manion tortious interference with contract claim against nagin and his firms.manion alleged that nagin assisted bda in breaching manion contract.but,as the arbitrator found,bda was justified in terminating manion contract because of his bad faith conduct.to sustain his claim,manion must prove that nagin assisted bda in terminating him without justification,guercio,at salit,so d at,and he can not do so here on account of the arbitrator contrary ruling.
the same analysis applies to the negligence claims dismissed by the district court on collateral estoppel grounds.manion alleged that nagin was negligent in not protecting manion ownership rights to his preferred stock,and that he was damaged by the loss of the stock.the arbitrator,however,found that manion was still the rightful owner of the preferred stock and entitled to all benefits attendant to ownership.since manion claimed damages flowed fro
