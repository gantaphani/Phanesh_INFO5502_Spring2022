plaintiffs,a married couple,bought a home using the standard form california purchase agreement,which required the arbitration of disputes arising out of the agreement or any resulting transaction.the agreement excluded from arbitration an action for bodily injury.before plaintiffs moved into the home,they learned that extensive structural damage had rendered it uninhabitable.
plaintiffs filed this action against their brokers for failing to disclose the structural damage.the complaint alleged that,as a result of the nondisclosure,plaintiffs experienced emotional distress.in addition,the wife contended that the emotional distress caused her to develop a form of diabetes.the brokers moved to compel arbitration.the trial court denied the motion on the ground that the action was one for bodily injury.
we conclude that an action for bodily injury,within the meaning of an arbitration exclusion in a residential purchase agreement,does not encompass the claims alleged here.emotional distress and diabetes caused by emotional distress are not the types of bodily injury that the contracting parties would reasonably expect to fall within the scope of the exclusion.we therefore reverse.
background 
the following allegations and facts are taken from the complaint and the evidence submitted on the motion to compel arbitration.
a.the complaint 
plaintiffs kenny gravillis,and deanna gravillis entered into a residential purchase agreement agreement to buy a home in los angeles,california.their brokers were defendants coldwell banker residential brokerage company coldwell banker brokerage and two of its employees collectively brokers.deanna,kenny wife,participated in the negotiations,home inspection and the purchase of the subject property as a real party to the transaction.
the brokers failed to disclose known material facts and defects about the residence,including termite infestation that rendered the home uninhabitable,earthquake damage that made the home structurally unsound,water intrusion damage,and cosmetic repairs that concealed the structural damage.the brokers failed to discuss the results of a termite inspection report that would have disclosed,or put the gravillises on notice of,the damage.and the brokers were negligent in recommending the company that conducted the termite inspection.if the brokers had made the proper disclosures,the gravillises would not have purchased the home.
at the time of the negotiations and the purchase of the home,deanna was pregnant.when the damage to the home was discovered,deanna was advised that,while on the property,she should wear a mask and special clothing to protect herself and her unborn child from exposure to dry rot,fungus,and other hazardous substances.this advice made the gravillises suffer severe emotional distress,worry,depression,anxiety,and fear.
the complaint alleged four causes of action against the brokers breach of fiduciary duty,negligence,breach of the duty to be honest and truthful,and violation of the california unfair competition law ucl bus,et.the first three claims were premised on the brokers alleged failure to disclose material facts about the condition of the property.the ucl claim alleged that the brokers engaged in a practice of choosing home inspectors and pest control companies that would minimize the disclosure of property defects in exchange for future business as a proximate result of the various nondisclosures,the gravillises suffered severe emotional distress,pain and suffering,property damage,damage to credit,moving expenses,the cost of alternative living arrangements,lost wages,repair costs,investigative costs,and attorney fees.the complaint prayed for damages according to proof.
the gravillises also sued the seller of the property,the seller brokers,the company that inspected the property,and the individual who owned that company.the complaint alleged that these defendants also failed to disclose the structural damage to the home.the brokers are the only parties to this appeal.
motion to compel arbitration 
relying on the arbitration provision in the agreement,the brokers filed a motion to compel arbitration of the claims against them and to stay the action pending the outcome of arbitration.the agreement,a preprinted form prepared by amicus curiae california association of realtors,is,according to the association,the most frequently used form in california for the sale of residential real estate.in,for example,the association sold over forms.
the agreement indicated that the gravillises were buying the property for,of which would be financed through a mortgage with a fixed rate of percent.under the agreement,the seller was obligated to pay for a pest control report to be prepared by a registered structural pest control company of the seller choosing.the seller was also required to disclose known material facts and defects in the property.the property would be sold in its present physical condition subject to buyer inspection rights.the buyer had the right to inspect the property and,based upon the information discovered in those inspections,to reasonably request that seller make repairs,corrections or take other action.the agreement permitted the buyer to inspect for wood destroying pests and organisms.it also stated,note to buyer you are strongly advised to conduct inspections of the entire property in order to determine its present condition since seller may not be aware of all defects affecting the property or other factors that you consider important.the agreement set forth in detail the seller rights and obligations in making repairs and the deadlines for requesting and agreeing that repairs would be made.
the agreement named coldwell banker brokerage and its two employees as the brokers for the gravillises and listed prudential california realty as the broker for the seller.it also stated,if brokers give buyer or seller referrals to persons,vendors,or service or product providers,brokers do not guarantee the performance of any of those providers.
the agreement contained an arbitration provision that stated in part arbitration of disputes buyer and seller agree that any dispute or claim in law or equity arising between them out of this agreement or any resulting transaction shall be decided by neutral,binding arbitration subject to the exclusions noted below.the arbitrator shall render an award in accordance with substantive california law.in all other respects,the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with part iii,title of the california code of civil procedure buyer and seller agree to arbitrate disputes or claims involving either or both brokers.however,a ny election by either or both brokers to participate in arbitration shall not result in brokers being deemed parties to the agreement.
the agreement excluded from arbitration an action for bodily injury or wrongful death.it also excluded any right of action to which code of civil procedure or applies,namely,actions involving construction defects.
the arbitration provision further provided notice by initialing in the space below you are agreeing to have any dispute arising out of the matters included in the arbitration of disputes provision decided by neutral arbitration as provided by california law and you are giving up any rights you might possess to have the dispute litigated in a court or jury trial.by initialing in the space below you are giving up your judicial rights to discovery and appeal,unless those rights are specifically included in the arbitration of disputes provision.if you refuse to submit to arbitration after agreeing to this provision,you may be compelled to arbitrate under the authority of the california code of civil procedure.your agreement to this arbitration provision is voluntary.
we have read and understand the foregoing and agree to submit disputes arising out of the matters included in the arbitration of disputes provision to neutral arbitration.kenny initialed the space for the buyer.the seller also initialed the appropriate space.
in moving to compel arbitration,the brokers argued that the agreement was a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce,and arbitration was therefore required under the federal arbitration act faa.the brokers requested a stay of the action pending the outcome of arbitration.
in their opposition papers,the gravillises argued,first,the arbitration exclusion applied because they sought damages for bodily injury second,the faa was not applicable because the agreement did not involve interstate commerce instead,the california arbitration act caa code civ,applied.finally,under the caa,arbitration should be denied because two of the defendants the inspection company and its owner were not parties to the agreement and thus not subject to arbitration.see code civ,subd.c all further section references are to the code of civil procedure unless otherwise indicated.
at a hearing on september,the trial court stated that it was denying the motion to compel arbitration based on the exclusion for bodily injury.the brokers requested a statement of decision.see.counsel for the gravillises agreed to draft one.by minute order filed the day of the hearing,the trial court denied the motion.
the gravillises lodged a proposed order and statement of decision.the brokers filed objections,which repeated in part their substantive arguments as to why the motion to compel should have been granted.the gravillises filed a reply accusing the brokers of trying to get a second bite at the apple.
on january,the trial court issued an order stating,upon reading the material submitted by the brokers,the court orders this matter to arbitration.the court vacated the dates for the final status conference and the trial.
in response,the gravillises filed a motion for reconsideration based on new circumstances.see,subd.a.the brokers filed opposition papers.the motion was argued on march.the trial court announced at the hearing that it was granting reconsideration and denying the motion to compel arbitration.
on march,the trial court issued an order and statement of decision,explaining this case should be tried rather than arbitrated.actions for bodily injury,which we have here,are excluded from arbitration.the brokers appealed.
discussion 
on petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy,the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists.in a petition to compel arbitration,the moving party,in essence,requests specific performance of a contractual agreement to arbitrate the controversy the trial court must determine in advance whether there is a duty to arbitrate the controversy this determination necessarily requires the court to examine and,to a limited extent,construe the underlying agreement.green diablo hospital dist.d,citations omitted.
the interpretation of an arbitration provision is solely a judicial function unless it turns upon the credibility of extrinsic evidence accordingly,an appellate court is not bound by a trial court construction of a contract based solely upon the terms of the instrument without the aid of evidence.merrick writers guild of america,west,d.accord,brookwood bank of america th,d.where,as here,the language of an arbitration provision is not in dispute,the trial court decision as to arbitrability is subject to de novo review.see coast plaza doctors hospital blue cross of california th,d.
the court should attempt to give effect to the parties intentions,in light of the usual and ordinary meaning of the contractual language and the circumstances under which the agreement was made.because california has a strong public policy in favor of arbitration,arbitration agreements should be liberally interpreted,and arbitration should be ordered unless the agreement clearly does not apply to the dispute in question doubts as to whether an arbitration provision applies to a particular dispute are to be resolved in favor of sending the parties to arbitration.vianna doctors management th,d,citations omitted accord,moses cone hospital mercury constr,d.
arbitration is a matter of contract,and the parties may freely delineate the area of its application.the court role must be strictly limited to a determination of whether the party resisting arbitration agreed to arbitrate.a heavy presumption weighs the scales in favor of arbitrability an order directing arbitration should be granted unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration provision is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.wilshire oil cal d,accord,at t technologies communications workers,d.to the extent possible,an exclusionary clause in an arbitration provision should be narrowly construed.see united transportation union southern cal.rapid transit dist.th,d nilsen securities,see also circuit city stores,adams,d statutory exclusion in faa for certain types of employment contracts should be narrowly interpreted.
the burden is on the party opposing arbitration to show the agreement can not be interpreted to apply to the dispute whether a contract is reasonably susceptible to a party interpretation can be determined from the language of the contract itself the policy in favor of arbitration does not apply when the contract can not be interpreted in favor of arbitration.there is no policy in favor of arbitrating a dispute the parties did not agree to arbitrate.balandran labor ready,th,d,citations omitted.
as a preliminary matter,the brokers contend that the gravillises motion for reconsideration was improper.in general,a prior order may be reconsidered upon a showing of new or different facts,circumstances,or law,subd.a.as stated,the trial court initially denied the brokers motion to compel,announcing its ruling at the hearing and filing a minute order to that effect.but after reviewing the gravillises proposed statement of decision and the brokers objections thereto,the trial court,without notice or a hearing,issued an order granting the motion to compel,relying on the objections.the trial court later granted the gravillises reconsideration motion,issuing a third order again denying arbitration.
the brokers argue,ironically,that the trial court could reverse the first order in response to their objections but could not reinstate the original ruling based on a motion for reconsideration.assuming,without deciding,that the statutory requirements for reconsideration apply when a trial court reverses an order in this manner see,subd.a,we conclude that new circumstances justified the gravillises motion for reconsideration.
in essence,the trial court treated the brokers objections to the proposed statement of decision as a de facto motion for reconsideration and reversed the first order.this abrupt reversal,without notice or a hearing,constituted new circumstances justifying reconsideration under section.see johnston corrigan th,d reconsideration proper based on new circumstances where trial court initially denied special motion to strike without considering memorandum of points and authorities in support of motion kollander construction,superior court th,d new circumstances justified reconsideration so that party moving to set aside dismissal could have full and fair hearing to respond to opposing party posthearing filing of supplemental points and authorities,overruled on another point in le francois goel cal th,fn,d.the trial court could therefore reinstate its original ruling pursuant to the gravillises motion to reconsider.
arbitration exclusion for bodily injury 
the form agreement used in this case has been the subject of prior judicial interpretation.see,frei davey th,d id.at,d citing cases johnson siegel th,d id.at,d citing cases.but no court has construed the arbitration provision bodily injury exclusion.as we now discuss,the injuries alleged by the gravillises do not come within the exclusion.
in opposing the motion to compel arbitration,deanna submitted evidence of her injuries as follows i attribute physical,mental,and emotional injuries to this incident.when we purchased our dream home we were very excited to remodel our home and move in prior to the date of the birth of my second child.we retained a contractor to perform cosmetic remodeling with an estimate of approximately.my husband,my young daughter and i went on a disney cruise hoping to return to our home in a near finished state.instead,we returned home to find a pile of lumber.because i was pregnant my contractor was afraid to inform me on our trip on the status of our remodel and when we returned from our disney cruise there was a fax,which stated that we should call our contractor and come to the site immediately.my husband and i drove to the site and observed our home taken down to the frame.i stood on the sidewalk in front of our home and could see kenny standing in the backyard.this certainly was not anticipated by our cosmetic remodel and we soon discovered that the home had been complete ly obliterated by termite damage which had been cosmetically concealed.
this incident caused me extreme and severe mental and emotional stress and devastation,which manifested itself physically.i developed gestational diabetes,which i had never suffered from in my prior pregnancy.i was in perfect health prior to this horrendous experience and i continued to suffer from emotional,psychological and physical symptoms as a result of the ongoing stress created by the purchase of this pile of wood which left us with a huge mortgage we had to pay on this new home and required us to enter into several other additional loans in order to fund the rebuilding of this home.we were also evicted from our prior residence as the owner had made plans for our prior residence when we gave notice intending to move into our dream home.
the purchase of this residence and all of the damages that flowed therefrom completely ruined the experience of the birth of my second child.i was under incredible stress and required additional treatment what should have been the happiest time of our lives was destroyed and devastated.prior to this event our credit was excellent.after the purchase of this home our credit has been ruined,we are deeply in debt,our business has suffered,my husband and myself have suffered grave emotional,physical and mental stress.
kenny offered this evidence i experienced e xtremely high stress dealing with the discovery that our dream home was no more than a pile of rubble that required a complete rebuild which we could not afford we had already given notice at our prior residence and were being evicted by our landlord when we could not move out due to the fact that we could not move into our new home.we were paying rent at our old residence in addition to the mortgage on this new home.i was extremely nervous,emotional and stressed about my wife pregnancy and her developing gestational diabetes which she had never suffered from before.i was in terrible stress and i continued to be in terrible stress due to the financial fallout from this horrendous experience we then had to take out additional loans in an amount in excess of to rebuild the house.
the gravillises do not contend they suffered emotional distress as a result of living in the home.the structural termite damage was discovered by the remodeling contractor while the gravillises were out of town.after returning from their trip,the gravillises were told about the termite infestation and saw what remained of the structure.the only injury they sustained from being on the property was the distress caused by the advice that deanna wear a mask and protective clothing to protect herself and her unborn child from dry rot,fungus,and other hazardous substances.the gravillises do not allege they were actually exposed to any harmful matter.deanna contends that,as a consequence of the emotional distress,she developed gestational diabetes.
emotional distress 
although courts have not construed bodily injury as used in the agreement arbitration exclusion,that term has been interpreted in insurance policies.the rules of construction generally applicable to contracts govern the interpretation of both arbitration provisions and insurance policies,that is,we interpret the words in their ordinary sense,according to the plain meaning a layperson would attach to them.see hotels nevada,llc bridge banc,llc th,d blasiar,fireman fund ins.th,d.the purpose of the law of contracts is to protect the reasonable expectations of the parties.asp properties group fard,th,d accord,county of solano lionsgate th,d arbitration provision fittante palm springs motors,th,d same julian hartford underwriters ins.cal th,d,insurance policy california auto.ins.hogan th,d same.in construing arbitration provisions,courts may also consider the subject matter of the agreement and the industry involved.see spinello amblin entertainment th,d.
the bodily injury clause in a comprehensive general liability insurance policy has been interpreted on numerous occasions.the cases overwhelmingly hold that the phrase bodily injury,sickness or disease is plain and unambiguous and that coverage under the bodily injury clause is limited to physical injury to the body and does not include nonphysical,emotional or mental harm.
in giving meaning to the term bodily as laypersons commonly understand it,the case law draws on both the dictionary definition s of the word and the general principles of law relating to the interpretation of insurance contracts.bodily under dictionary definition s is equated with physical,corporeal as opposed to mental or spiritual.for example,webster defines bodily as having a body or a material form physical,corporeal bodily contrasts with mental or spiritual.webster new internat.dict.ed,italics in original see also webster new collegiate dict.ed.the american heritage dictionary college ed describes bodily as.of,pertaining to,within,or exhibited by the body bodily organs.physical as opposed to mental or spiritual bodily welfare.in the flesh in person bodily but not mentally present.at,italics in original.the random house dictionary of the english language ed defines bodily as.of,or pertaining to,the body.corporeal or material as contrasted with spiritual or mental.at.similarly,black law dictionary ed defines bodily as pertaining to or concerning the body of or belonging to the body or the physical constitution not mental but corporeal.at.in brief,under definitional unanimity,the ordinary and popular meaning of the word bodily does not reasonably encompass the purely mental,emotional and spiritual.
federal,and california cases are in accord with the dictionary definition s of bodily as the term is used in insurance policies t he term bodily injury in an insurance policy limits the harm covered to physical injury,sickness,or disease and does not include nonphysical,emotional harm to the person.chatton national union fire ins.th,d,discussed with approval in waller truck ins.exchange,cal th,d.
case law outside the insurance context is to the same effect.in eastern airlines,floyd,d eastern airlines,passengers who had been on a flight to the bahamas sought damages for mental distress sustained when they were informed during the flight that,due to engine failure,the plane was going to crash in the atlantic ocean.as it turned out,the plane landed safely at miami international airport.the warsaw convention limited the airline liability to the death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger.convention for the unification of certain rules relating to international transportation by air warsaw convention,stat,see eastern airlines,supra,at.stating that its task was to give the specific words of the treaty a meaning consistent with the shared expectations of the contracting parties eastern airlines,supra,at,the court reviewing dictionary definitions,the treaty negotiating history,and case bodily injury does not include purely mental or psychic injuries or emotional distress id.at.
in reaching that conclusion,the court commented t he unavailability of compensation for purely psychic injury in many common and civil law countries at the time of the warsaw conference persuades us that the signatories had no specific intent to include such a remedy in the convention.eastern airlines,supra,at,fn.omitted.put another way,if recovery for a particular type of injury is not legally cognizable,the parties are not likely to have contemplated it as a bodily injury deserving of protection in a contract.
a similar analysis about the unavailability of damages for emotional distress applies here.under california law,it is doubtful the gravillises can recover for emotional distress given that their claims are based on a broker alleged failure to disclose property termite damage,and the emotional distress was caused solely by what they saw and heard after the property had been damaged.see devin united services auto.th,d emotional distress not compensable for fraud in purchase of property friedman merck.th,d negligent misrepresentation may permit recovery of pecuniary losses allstate ins.miller,no emotional distress damages for failure to disclose property defects,limiting types of damages recoverable in fraud actions involving purchase of property miller starr,cal.real estate ed,discussing types of damages available in real estate litigation cal.civ.prac.real property litigation,to,to,to discussing actions against,and damages recoverable from,brokers witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts,recovery for emotional distress may depend on whether physical trauma is present see also ketchmark northern.public service,plaintiffs could not recover for emotional distress where gas explosion destroyed their home while they were away.
the fact that emotional distress damages may be awarded in some circumstances does not mean they are available in every case in which there is an independent cause of action founded upon negligence.no california case has allowed recovery for emotional distress arising solely out of property damage moreover,a preexisting contractual relationship,without more,will not support a recovery for mental suffering where the defendant tortious conduct has resulted only in economic injury to the plaintiff.erlich menezes cal th,d,erlich,citations omitted.
u nless the defendant has assumed a duty to plaintiff in which the emotional condition of the plaintiff is an object,recovery is available only if the emotional distress arises out of the defendant breach of some other legal duty and the emotional distress is proximately caused by that breach of duty.even then,with rare exceptions,a breach of the duty must threaten physical injury,not simply damage to property or financial interests.potter firestone tire rubber cal th,d,italics added accord,erlich,supra,cal th at,d.
real estate brokers have a legal duty to make certain disclosures to their principals.see cal.civ.prac.real property litigation,supra,to.but we can not say that the mere nondisclosure of termite damage,absent exposure to a real or tangible effect of the infestation for example,the collapse of a wall,threatens a buyer with physical injury.rather,a breach of duty,as alleged in this case,directly affects only a property or financial interest.thus,the gravillises could not have reasonably expected that a claim for emotional distress would exist against a broker in the circumstances here,much less that the claim would be one for bodily injury.
further,some degree of emotional distress often attends home purchases.as our supreme court observed in holding that emotional distress damages are not recoverable for negligent construction of a house the plaintiffs may have hoped to build their dream home and live happily ever after,but there is a reason that tag line belongs only in fairy tales.building a house may turn out to be a project it is much more likely to be the stuff of urban cause of bankruptcy,marital dissolution,hypertension and fleeting fantasies ranging from homicide to suicide no reasonable homeowner can embark on a building project with certainty that the project will be completed to perfection.indeed,errors are so likely to occur that few if any homeowners would be justified in resting their peace of mind on its timely or correct completion erlich,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
thus,if emotional distress were considered a bodily injury,the arbitration exclusion in the agreement could apply in virtually every dispute,rendering the arbitration provision a nullity.few,if any,claims would ever be subject to arbitration.because the exclusion should not swallow the binding arbitration rule san francisco fire fighters local city and county of san francisco cal th,d,we decline to construe bodily injury to include purely emotional distress.
our conclusion is supported by legislative intent in this area.the bodily injury exclusion in the agreement is mandated by section,which provides that i n the event an arbitration provision is included in a contract or agreement to convey real property,it shall not preclude or limit any right of action for bodily injury enacted in,section was not part of the original bill assem.bill reg.sess,as introduced,assemly bill.as first drafted,the bill added only sections and to the code.section,subdivision c,requires a notice clause like the one the contracting parties initialed in this case.see pt,ante.section addresses the filing of a lis pendens.
while the legislation was pending,the california trial lawyers association ctla informed the bill sponsor by letter that it was opposed to the law,stating this bill would require standardized language for agreements to arbitrate disputes arising from contracts to convey real property,and disputes between real estate agents and the buyer or seller who hires the agent.most consumers would probably not realize that they might be giving up their rights to discovery and a jury trial if they suffer injuries from patent or latent defects in the house.ctla,letter to assemblyman byron sher,july.
as noted in a later senate committee analysis,although intended as an expedited process to resolve contract disputes arising out of a real property transaction,this bill could be interpreted to also apply to require the arbitration of personal injury or property damage claims arising out of a real property transaction.for example,the signing of such a provision could be argued to bar a lawsuit by a purchaser of a home for recovery of damages for personal injury,property damage,or wrongful death caused by the negligence or defective product of the.
as ctla contends,it is not at all probable that a prospective purchaser of a home who encounters an arbitration provision in a standardized real estate sales agreement would clearly know that he would,upon signing the arbitration provision,be waiving his right to judicial resolution of any claim for personal injuries caused by the defective construction of the home.more likely,the buyer would expect it to cover matters specifically covered in the contract such as the date of closing,which improvements are included with the house,and matters of that sort.
moreover,the notice provided by the bill would not clearly warn a party that he would be waiving his rights to judicial resolution of a personal injury or property damage claim,as opposed to agreeing to arbitrate a dispute involving the purchase of the home.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill,supra,as amended,underscoring omitted.
the bill was accordingly amended in the senate to add section,requiring the bodily injury exclusion.see assem.bill,supra,as amended.the assembly concurred in the amendment,and the governor approved the bill.see stats,ch,assem.final history on assem.bill,supra.
the gravillises claims reflect matters specifically covered in the agreement,namely,the pest control inspection,the discovery of termite damage,and the disclosure of the damage.the evidence filed in opposition to the motion to compel arbitration focused on termite infestation,not defects in the construction of the home.the agreement expressly covered damage caused by pests the precise type of damage that the gravillises fault the brokers for not disclosing.the complaint also seeks to hold the brokers liable for the failings of the company that inspected the property.but under the agreement,the seller selected the pest control company,and the brokers did not guarantee the performance of any service provider they recommended.
