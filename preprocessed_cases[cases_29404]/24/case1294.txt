following many years of litigation in both california and nevada,the trial court confirmed an arbitration award in favor of defendant and respondent pacific center,including affirmative relief on its counterclaims.plaintiff and appellant louis habash appeals from the judgment confirming the award against him and two companies for which he was determined to be the alter ego,hotels nevada,llc and inns nevada,llc collectively hotels nevada.currently in bankruptcy,hotels nevada dismissed its separate appeal.
we affirm.the trial court properly compelled arbitration,determined that the procedure by which the arbitration was conducted due to one arbitrator unexpected surgery did not exceed the arbitrators power,and confirmed the award,rejecting appellant claims that the issue arbitrated was barred by the law of the case and that there was no basis for personal liability.
factual and procedural background 
the parties and the transaction.
the two limited liability companies that comprise hotels nevada are owned and controlled by appellant.in,hotels nevada owned the alexis park hotel and the americana inns apartments in las vegas,nevada property.at that time,appellant owed million to har inns,nevada,an entity controlled through a limited liability company operated by his accountant and friend,harvey bookstein.appellant also owed to the state of nevada for past due sales tax,to his property manager and million to general creditors.
pacific,operated by wen shan chang,is in the business of buying and selling real property.at the end of,without knowledge of appellant financial difficulties,pacific began negotiating with hotels nevada for the purchase of the property.by march,the parties had settled on a purchase price of million plus additional consideration of million for inns nevada.chang initially signed documents including a purchase and sale agreement agreement and memorandum of agreement memorandum that provided for a month holdback period for the million,but instructed pacific employee eddy chao that the holdback period must be extended to months.chao informed pacific principal negotiator,richard alter,of the required change.
during a march,meeting the following day,alter discussed the month holdback period with appellant.appellant acceded to the month holdback period and then signed the agreement and memorandum.the transaction closed in may,and both checklists and the memorandum ultimately recorded at closing showed a month holdback period.within four months of closing,appellant and his counsel began compiling versions of the transaction documents and researching the possibility of bringing suit against pacific.in april,appellant sent alter a letter indicating a may payment due date alter responded that the payment threshold had not been reached.throughout the same time period,pacific had applied for and received certain building and gaming entitlements that enhanced the value of the property.appellant was aware of pacific development progress.
commencement of litigation.
in may,hotels nevada filed a complaint in california against pacific california action for rescission based on fraud,cancellation of written instruments based on illegality and conspiracy on the basis of allegations that pacific had fraudulently manipulated the memorandum and agreement to provide for a month holdback period to which hotels nevada had not agreed.hotels nevada pacific center,th,hotels nevada.it simultaneously filed a notice of lis pendens.hotels nevada rejected pacific offer of a million payment in exchange for removing the lis pendens.
in july,pacific moved to compel arbitration.hotels nevada,supra,th at.it relied on section of the agreement,which provided in relevant part that each claim,dispute or controversy of whatever nature,arising out of,in connection with,or in relation to the interpretation,performance or breach of this agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,including,without limitation,any claim based on contract,tort,or statute,or the arbitrability of any claim hereunder shall be settled by final and binding arbitration conducted in clark county,nevada.it also relied on a related provision,section of the agreement,providing in part that each signatory to this agreement hereby waives its respective right to a jury trial of any permitted claim or cause of action arising out of this agreement id.at.the trial court denied the motion on the ground that,in light of hotels nevada allegations,pacific failed to meet its burden to show the existence of a valid agreement to arbitrate,and the first appeal ensued.id.at.we reversed and remanded the matter,directing the trial court to hold an evidentiary hearing before ruling on the motion to compel.id.at.we concluded that because pacific met its threshold burden to establish the existence of a valid agreement to arbitrate,hotels nevada was required to offer more than the allegations of its complaint to demonstrate that the agreement was unenforceable.id.at.
meanwhile,pacific continued with its development of the property and in the fall of entered into an agreement with molasky pacific,llc molasky agreement to sell the property for million,contingent in part on pacific removing the lis pendens.in january,the trial court granted pacific motion to expunge the lis pendens on the ground that adequate relief could be secured by the giving of an undertaking thereafter,l.pacific posted an undertaking in the amount of million.it also filed a in california against hotels nevada and appellant individually,alleging causes of action for abuse of process,slander of title,intentional interference with contract and indemnity,and hotels nevada responded by filing a special motion to strike the pursuant to code of civil procedure section.the trial court granted the motion with respect to all claims except indemnity,and we later affirmed the order in hotels nevada ii.
simultaneously with pacific posting an undertaking in the california action,hotels nevada filed a similar and separate action in nevada nevada action,as well as a separate notice of lis pendens in nevada the nevada court denied pacific motions to expunge.as a consequence,pacific could not satisfy the lis pendens contingency in the molasky agreement,and the buyer cancelled the million sale.pacific filed a separate counterclaim in nevada,alleging that hotels nevada filing of the lis pendens was an abuse of process designed to block pacific pending sale of the property.the nevada district court initially denied pacific motion to compel arbitration of the nevada claims,as well as its motion to dismiss or stay the nevada action.pacific appealed,and the nevada supreme court reversed,finding that the evidence did not support the district court order and that judicial economy would be served by staying the nevada action pending resolution of the california action.
order compelling arbitration.
in may,hotels nevada dismissed its california complaint and asserted that the dismissal deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to proceed with pacific motion to compel arbitration the trial court disagreed,ruling that the pending motion to compel arbitration conferred jurisdiction on the court to resolve the issue of arbitrability.
following a day evidentiary hearing,the trial court determined that hotels nevada had failed to meet its burden to establish the defense of fraud in the execution and concluded that the matter should be arbitrated in accordance with the agreement.the trial court acknowledged at the inception and throughout the hearing that the only issue to be resolved was whether hotels nevada could meet its burden to establish fraud in the execution as an affirmative defense to arbitration.though it expressly made credibility findings,it determined those findings would not be entitled to preclusive effect and cautioned that another fact finder could reach a different conclusion.after outlining the evidence showing that the agreement appellant had signed,in fact,contained a month holdback provision,the trial court concluded considering the totality of the evidence including driggs hotels nevada transactional counsel failure to object to the closing checklists,even after he noticed their provision for a month outside payment date,and the uncontradicted testimony that,in the days prior to closing,driggs himself described section b of the contract as a holdback the court finds that there was no fraud in the execution of the agreement containing the arbitration clause at issue.respondents have failed to meet their burden of establishing all the elements of fraud in the execution.in particular,respondents have not established an actual intent by anyone to deceive them,including alter pacific representative,katz pacific counsel,kirkbride pacific counsel,or third party peh escrow officer,at any time.the blatant and repeated statements in the closing checklist as to the duration of the holdback demonstrate that at all relevant times petitioner was frank about its position as to the terms to which it thought it was contracting.the other communications by petitioner to third parties during this period reinforce this conclusion as to petitioner lack of an intent to hide the change it had made to the agreement to reflect a month holdback.
the trial court denied hotels nevada and appellant motion to stay enforcement of the order compelling arbitration and for curative relief on the ground that pacific misrepresented the scope of hotels nevada defenses to arbitration.we denied hotels nevada petition for writ of mandate challenging the order.hotels nevada llc pacific center.
the arbitration.
in,the parties selected an arbitration panel through judicial arbitration and mediation services,jams,comprised of retired california court of appeal justice edward wallin,retired california superior court judge john kennedy,and retired united states district judge david hagen,and the panel ruled on several prehearing motions in late and early.in particular,the parties stipulated and the arbitrators ordered that the claims asserted by pacific in nevada would be added as affirmative claims in the arbitration and that,in turn,hotels nevada would have the opportunity to argue whether the claims were barred by nevada statute.the arbitrators ultimately denied hotels nevada special motion to dismiss,which was brought pursuant to nevada law.
the panel conducted a day arbitration between january and february,following the first week of the hearing,justice wallin learned that he was required to undergo surgery in early february,which would preclude him from being physically present during the remainder of the arbitration.although hotels nevada and appellant objected,the panel determined that the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association aaa rules permitted the arbitration to proceed as scheduled.the panel proposed that judges kennedy and hagen would be physically present at the hearing,while each day justice wallin would be given a transcript and video disk of the most recently transcribed daily hearing,together with document binders to include exhibits identified by witness.justice wallin would physically rejoin the panel when medically feasible.finally,after the presentation of evidence and the submission of posthearing briefs,the panel would collectively deliberate,decide the matter and issue an award.
the panel issued an interim award in july.expressly finding not credible the testimony of appellant and his transactional attorney,jon douglas driggs,the arbitrators determined the evidence showed that the parties agreed to the month outside payment date and,in turn,that pacific made no misrepresentation about the holdback period.the panel further found that pacific had not breached the agreement in any respect,and therefore denied hotels nevada claims for rescission and damages based on fraud and breach of contract.
with respect to pacific affirmative claims,the arbitrators first concluded that the evidence satisfied the elements of alter ego liability under nevada law appellant influenced and governed hotels nevada he had used hotels nevada assets as his personal property and repeatedly disregarded any rights of the companies or investors and it would promote injustice to adhere to the fiction of a separate entity.again applying nevada law as directed by the agreement,the arbitrators next found that the conduct of hotels nevada and appellant amounted to abuse of process and slander of title.the panel further concluded that hotels nevada and appellant conduct subsequent to the filing of the california action constituted intentional interference with the molasky agreement.the arbitrators denied relief for pacific other claims including appellant fraud by concealing his financial condition at the time of the agreement,breach of contract for falsely asserting an outside payment date and breach of the agreement to arbitrate because liability resulted in no actionable damage beyond that shown by the other claims.
the award concluded that pacific had been damaged by hotels nevada and appellant,its alter ego,in the following amounts for the loss of the sale of the property through the molasky agreement representing a payment to molasky for its costs incurred in connection with the molasky agreement for the million bond premium payment and on the indemnity claim for a real estate broker commission.the arbitrators then subtracted the million holdback amount that pacific never paid and awarded damages in the amount of.though finding a factual basis for an award of punitive damages,the arbitrators declined to assess punitive damages in light of the enormous compensatory damages award.
the arbitrators also awarded pacific declaratory relief in the form of quieting title to the property in favor of pacific and cancelling all recorded lis pendens and the memorandum.the panel also awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs to pacific according to proof,leaving as the only outstanding issue the amount of the attorney fee award.
hotels nevada and appellant objected to the interim award and challenged it in multiple ways.they unsuccessfully moved to reopen the proceedings for the purpose of offering additional evidence concerning remedies,including damages and alter ego liability.they unsuccessfully moved jams to disqualify the panel on the ground that judge hagen failed to disclose he knew one of the witnesses.they unsuccessfully applied for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction in the trial court,seeking to stay the balance of the arbitration.they also unsuccessfully applied to the nevada supreme court for an order lifting the stay of the nevada action so that they could proceed with a trial de novo in nevada.
on october,the panel issued a final award.the arbitrator findings of fact and conclusions of law remained unchanged from the interim award.the final award described several of hotels nevada s and appellant challenges to the interim award and expressly denied their request to reopen the proceedings.after making certain corrections to the damage award,which reduced the total to,the arbitrators evaluated the evidence submitted by pacific regarding the amount of attorney fees and costs incurred and awarded million in attorney fees and in costs against hotels nevada and appellant as its alter ego.
confirmation of the arbitration award.
on november,pacific filed a petition to confirm the arbitration award.one day earlier,appellant had filed for bankruptcy on behalf of hotels nevada in nevada pacific acknowledged the automatic stay provisions and therefore pursued confirmation only against appellant individually and another entity not in bankruptcy.the california action was removed to bankruptcy court on november.in january,the bankruptcy court granted pacific motion for which restored jurisdiction over this matter to the trial court.the nevada bankruptcy court likewise entered an order lifting the automatic stay for the purpose of permitting pacific to pursue the confirmation petition and attorney fee motion pending in california 
on january,appellant filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award in federal bankruptcy court,which he later refiled in the trial court the following month,hotels nevada filed a combined motion to vacate and opposition to the petition to confirm the arbitration award in the trial court.
the trial court granted the petition to confirm and denied the motions to vacate the award.it expressly rejected hotels nevada and appellant arguments supporting their motions to vacate,explaining that any argument the award violated this courts decision affirming the grant of the special motion to strike pacific related to an unreviewable legal error the panel had discretion as to how to address justice wallin absence and its procedure did not impinge on hotels nevada and appellant substantive rights there were no grounds to disqualify judge hagen and hotels nevada and appellant waived their other procedural challenges by participating in the arbitration.
judgment was entered in march,and hotels nevada and appellant separately appealed.the chapter trustee for hotels nevada later stipulated with pacific for the dismissal of its appeal.it thereafter filed a limited joinder to one section of appellant opening brief.
discussion 
appellant divides his challenges to the arbitration award by timing,arguing that there was error before,during and after the arbitration.we find no merit to his challenges.
i.the trial court properly compelled arbitration.
the right to arbitration depends upon contract a petition to compel arbitration is simply a suit in equity seeking specific performance of that contract.citations.there is no public policy favoring arbitration of disputes which the parties have not agreed to arbitrate.citation.engineers architects community development th.appellant contends that the trial court should not have granted the petition to compel arbitration because the evidence adduced during the day hearing showed there was no meeting of the minds on a material point of the agreement that included the arbitration provision and,alternatively,that hotels nevada met its burden to show fraud in the execution as a defense to arbitration.see graham scissor tail,cal d,fn.propriety of order compelling arbitration is reviewable on appeal from a judgment confirming the award.
whether the parties formed a valid agreement to arbitrate is determined under general california contract law.citations.hence,when ruling on a petition to compel arbitration,the superior court may consider evidence on factual issues such as contract formation bearing on the threshold issue of arbitrability.citation.city of vista sutro th,accord,engineers architects community development,supra,th at.where the trial court decision on arbitrability is based upon resolution of disputed facts,we review the decision for substantial evidence.citation.in such a case we must accept the trial court resolution of disputed facts when supported by substantial evidence we must presume the court found every fact and drew every permissible inference necessary to support its judgment,and defer to its determination of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence.citation.norcal mutual ins.newton th.
as a threshold matter,we conclude that appellant has forfeited any challenge to the order compelling arbitration due to his failure to provide an adequate record.appellant has provided us with neither a reporter transcript of the day hearing nor copies of the documentary evidence offered during that hearing.it is the duty of an appellant to provide an adequate record to the court establishing error.failure to provide an adequate record on an issue requires that the issue be resolved against appellant.maria riles cal d.barak quisenberry law firm th.this principle stems from the rule of appellate review that a judgment or order is presumed correct and the appellant has the burden of demonstrating prejudicial error.foust san jose construction,th,gee american realty construction,th.by failing to provide an adequate record,appellant can not meet his burden to show error and we must resolve any challenge to the order against him.see hernandez california hospital medical center th.
even absent forfeiture,we would find no merit to appellant contentions.appellant first contends that arbitration should not have been compelled on the ground there was no enforceable agreement to arbitrate he argues there was no meeting of the minds on a material point in the agreement that is,the duration of the million holdback.see banner entertainment,superior court th,california law is clear that there is no contract until there has been a meeting of the minds on all material points.but whether there was a meeting of the minds was not an issue intended to be resolved by the evidentiary hearing.rather,as the trial court explained in the beginning of its order compelling arbitration,during the final status conference the parties confirmed that the sole issue to be resolved in this evidentiary hearing was respondents affirmative defense to arbitration of fraud in the execution because pacific already had met its burden of establishing an agreement to arbitrate and if respondents could not meet that burden,the parties dispute should be ordered to arbitration.all parties agreed and,based upon that understanding,this court exercised its discretion to reorder proof and argument,such that respondents received the first and last word both in terms of evidence and argument.appellant may not repudiate hotels nevada agreement concerning the scope of the evidentiary hearing.in re marriage of broderick d,an appellant waives his right to attack error by expressly or implicitly agreeing or acquiescing at trial to the ruling or procedure objected to on appeal.
we likewise find no merit to appellant alternative contention that the evidence outlined by the trial court established fraud in the execution.selectively quoting from the order compelling arbitration,appellant argues the trial court finding that the agreement holdback provision was altered after signing established fraud in the execution as a matter of law.the trial court made numerous additional factual findings,however,leading it to the conclusion that hotels nevada failed to meet its burden to establish the elements of fraud in the execution.it determined that hotels nevada failed to establish any intent to deceive on the part of pacific,given that its representatives were repeatedly frank and open about their position that they intended for the transaction to contain a month holdback period.see hedden waldeck cal d,plaintiff has burden of demonstrating intent to deceive as an element of fraud in the execution.the factual finding that pacific broadcast its understanding of a supposedly covert change likewise precluded any finding of reasonable reliance on hotels nevada part.see brown wells fargo bank,th,because reasonable reliance is a necessary element of the defense of fraud in the execution,the contract is not considered void due to the fraud if the plaintiff had a reasonable opportunity to discover the true terms of the contract.
accordingly,substantial evidence supported the order compelling arbitration.
ii.the trial court properly concluded that the arbitrators did not exceed their power.
appellant next contends that the arbitrators exceeded their powers by proceeding with the arbitration once justice wallin need for surgery was disclosed he argues the procedure they adopted violated the arbitration provision in the agreement.again,we disagree 
after the first week of the hearing,when justice wallin learned that he was required to undergo an unanticipated surgery,the arbitrators and counsel held two telephonic hearings.the goal of the panel was to not disrupt or unduly delay the hearing,and the arbitrators advised that a continuance of at least seven months would be required if judges kennedy and hagen awaited justice wallin return.to avoid such a delay,the panel proposed that the arbitration would proceed as scheduled with judges kennedy and hagen in the hearing room,and justice wallin reviewing daily a video disk of the hearing and a document binder of the exhibits.the panel further proposed that justice wallin would return to the hearing room if medically feasible.following the presentation of evidence and submission of briefs,all three panel members would deliberate together,decide the matter and issue an award.
the panel rejected appellant arguments that the proposed procedure affected the overall adjudication of the case,and that justice wallin absence would affect his ability to determine witnesses credibility and rule on the admissibility of evidence.it also determined that the aaa rules authorized the proposed procedure by allowing,in the event of a panel vacancy after the hearing has commenced,for fewer than all of the arbitrators to continue with the hearing and determination of the controversy,unless the parties agree otherwise,and further providing arbitrators shall take such steps as they may deem necessary or desirable to avoid delay and to achieve a just,speedy and resolution of large,complex commercial cases.see aaa rules,r b l a.the panel further concluded that its proposed procedure comported with nevada revised statutes.section,subdivision,which permits an arbitrator to conduct an arbitration in such manner as the arbitrator considers appropriate for a fair and expeditious disposition of the proceeding.see also,applying certain provisions of,where two or more arbitrators conduct the arbitration.in denying appellant motion to vacate the award,the trial court concluded that the procedure adopted by the panel was permissible under either california or nevada law.it reasoned that the panel had discretion as to how to address justice wallin physical absence from the proceedings,and that the conduct of the arbitrators did not impinge in any substantive way on these parties statutory or contractual rights regarding the conduct of the arbitration and resulting award.
appellant maintains that the agreement arbitration provision did not allow for this procedure and that,therefore,the arbitrators exceeded their powers,subd.a jordan department of motor vehicles th,an arbitrator exceeds his powers when he acts in a manner not authorized by the contract or by law.in pertinent part,the agreement provided all such arbitrable claims shall be settled by three arbitrators in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules then in effect of the american arbitration association.it further provided that neutral arbitrators would be provided through jams and that,e xcept as provided herein,the federal arbitration act shall govern the interpretation,enforcement and all proceeding s pursuant to this section.in the following paragraph,the agreement stated the arbitration procedures shall follow the substantive law of the state of nevada,including the provisions of statutory law dealing with arbitration,as it may exist at the time of the demand for arbitration,insofar as said provisions are not in conflict with this agreement and excepting certain notice provisions not relevant here.
the powers of an arbitrator derive from,and are limited by,the agreement to arbitrate.citation.awards in excess of those powers may be corrected or vacated by the court.citation.gueyffier ann summers,cal th.the trial court determination as to whether an arbitrator exceeded his powers is an issue of law that we review de novo.advanced micro devices,intel cal th,fn.san francisco housing authority service employees internat.union,local th.in contrast to our review of the trial court judgment,we pay substantial deference to an arbitrator determination of his own authority.citation.any doubts about the arbitrator power to decide these issues must be resolved in his favor.roehl ritchie th.
we conclude that the arbitrators did not exceed the powers accorded them by the agreement in fashioning a remedy that enabled the arbitration to proceed without justice wallin physical presence at the hearing each day.see advanced micro devices,intel,supra,cal th at reviewing court is not in a favorable position to substitute its judgment for that of the arbitrators as to what relief is most just and equitable under the circumstances.the procedure employed by the panel did not violate any provision of the agreement.nothing in the agreement arbitration provision expressly precluded the procedure adopted by the panel nor did it mandate that the arbitration hearing be conducted in such a manner so as to imply that the physical presence of all three arbitrators was mandated.rather,the agreement provided only that any arbitrable claims shall be settled by three arbitrators 
the agreement addressed the procedural requirements of the arbitration by referring albeit somewhat ambiguously to three different sets of rules.nonetheless,the arbitration procedure did not contravene any of the rules embodied in the federal arbitration act,the aaa rules or nevada law.preliminarily,the agreement stated that the federal arbitration act would apply,e xcept as provided herein because the agreement expressly provided for the arbitrable claims to be settled in accordance with the aaa rules and for the arbitration procedures to follow nevada statutory law dealing with arbitration,the federal arbitration act did not apply 
in separate paragraphs,the agreement first provided that the arbitrators were to act in accordance with the aaa rules and thereafter stated that the arbitration procedures were to follow substantive nevada law,including the provisions of statutory law dealing with arbitration,to the extent such provision were not in conflict with the agreement.because the agreement preliminarily directed the arbitrators to follow the aaa rules,we construe it to require the arbitration procedures to conform to nevada statutory law unless in conflict with the aaa rules.according to section,subdivision,a n arbitrator may conduct an arbitration in such manner as the arbitrator considers appropriate for a fair and expeditious disposition of the proceeding.when there is more than one arbitrator,section directs that the powers of an arbitrator must be exercised by a majority of the arbitrators,but all of them shall conduct the hearing under subsection of nrs.while appellant construes the phrase all of them shall conduct the hearing to mean that all arbitrators must be physically present at all times,we read that phrase not in isolation but in the context of the entire sentence.see fernandez california of pesticide regulation th,we do not view the words of a statute in isolation,but construe them in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,interpreting legislation reasonably and attempting to give effect to the apparent purpose of the statute.the statute requires that all arbitrators conduct the hearing in accordance with the procedural requirements of a separate statute that addresses scheduling,appearances and decision.we therefore interpret the requirement that all arbitrators shall conduct the hearing to apply to the manner in which they manage or control the hearing.see generally webster third new international dictionary as a verb,conduct means to lead,run,manage,or direct.we decline to construe the nevada statute to direct that the arbitrators conduct the hearing so as to require all the arbitrators physical presence in all instances.
the aaa rules are not in conflict.like the nevada statutory scheme,the aaa rules are silent on the issue of whether arbitrators may hear a matter via the procedural remedy adopted here.see aaa rules,r addressing attendance of parties and witnesses.but the rules allow arbitrators wide discretion in the management of proceedings,providing that a rbitrator s shall take such steps as they may deem necessary or desirable to avoid delay and achieve a just,speedy and resolution of large,complex commercial cases.aaa rules,l.moreover,though appellant objected to the procedure adopted by the panel,he did not seek relief under the aaa rules,which provide that the aaa may declare an office vacant if it can be shown that an arbitrator is unable to perform the duties of office.aaa rules,r a.in the event of a vacancy,the remaining panel may continue with the arbitration or a substitute arbitrator may be appointed though appellant now argues that justice wallin absence from the hearing room essentially rendered him unable to perform his duties,he did not request that his office be declared vacant.see aaa rules,r any party who proceeds with the arbitration after knowledge that any provision or requirement of these rules has not been complied with and who fails to state an objection in writing shall be deemed to have waived the right to object.the leeway afforded by nevada law and the aaa rules,coupled with appellant failure to pursue all available remedies below,compels the conclusion that the manner in which the arbitration was conducted provides no basis for vacating the award.
the cases on which appellant relies are inapposite.in parker mccaw th,the trial court granted a motion to compel arbitration,but also ordered that two arbitrations be consolidated and conducted before a single arbitrator.the arbitration agreements differed,with one providing for a single arbitrator and the other requiring three arbitrators.ibid.on an appeal from a judgment confirming the award by a single arbitrator,the appellate court concluded that the trial court erred by resolving the conflicting arbitration provisions in favor of a single arbitrator,as the panel was a substantial contractual right.id.at.the parker mccaw court relied on szuts dean witter reynolds,cir,also cited by appellant,where the court held that two arbitrators conducting the arbitration and rendering an award after the third arbitrator was disqualified violated the provision in the arbitration agreement requiring that an arbitration be conducted before three arbitrators.here,in contrast,appellant had the benefit of a panel.see parker mccaw,supra,at a panel allows the arbitrators to hear,consider,and weigh the evidence and arguments presented by the parties,and to participate in consultation and deliberation collectively.
iii.the trial court properly confirmed the arbitration award.
appellant challenges the confirmation of the award against him on two grounds first,he contends that pacific recovery was barred by the law of the case and,second,that he was not a party to the arbitration agreement.we could characterize both of these claims as unreviewable.b ecause it vindicates the intentions of the parties that the award be final,and because an arbitrator is not ordinarily constrained to decide according to the rule of law,it is the general rule that,the merits of the controversy between the parties are not subject to judicial review.citations.more specifically,courts will not review the validity of the arbitrator reasoning.citations.further,a court may not review the sufficiency of the evidence supporting an arbitrator award.citations.thus,it is the general rule that,with narrow exceptions,an arbitrator decision can not be reviewed for errors of fact or law.moncharsh heily blase cal th,see also jones humanscale cal.app th.nonetheless,because appellant claims are equally capable of being characterized as involving acts that exceeded the arbitrators authority code civ,subd.a,we will review his claims on the merits.again,a n appellate court reviews a determination of whether an arbitrator has exceeded his or her powers de novo,but displays substantial deference towards the arbitrator determination of his or her contractual authority.citations.all reasonable inferences must be drawn in support of the award.jones humanscale,supra,at.
pacific claims were not barred by law of the case.
in hotels nevada ii,we relied on california law to conclude that hotels nevada recordation of a lis pendens constituted protected activity under code of civil procedure section,subdivision e and determined that b ecause the alleged slander of title and interference with contractual relations claims were based on the recordation of the lis pendens,they were subject to the statute.hotels nevada ii.we also concluded that the trial court properly rejected pacific assertion that the recordation of the nevada lis pendens did not constitute protected activity because it was illegal as a matter of law.id.at.we reasoned that,at the time of the motion to strike,pacific had failed to establish illegality because the nevada court had three times approved the lis pendens recordation by denying pacific motion to expunge,denying its motion for reconsideration and denying its offer to post a bond.id.at.
in october,approximately five months after our decision,the nevada supreme court issued its decision reversing the district court order denying pacific motion to compel arbitration,but further concluding that judicial economy will be best served by staying the nevada action pending the resolution of the california action,which will bar relitigation of issues actually litigated in california under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.thereafter,in november the parties conducted a pretrial conference before the arbitration panel,one purpose being to finaliz e the scope of the claims to be resolved by the panel in this arbitration,in light of the nevada supreme court october,decision following the conference,the arbitrators issued an order captioned order adding additional claims by pacific center,and setting briefing schedule for anti slapp motion under nevada law,which identified the counterclaims asserted by pacific against hotels nevada and appellant as abuse of process,slander of title,intentional interference with contractual relations and prospective economic advantage and indemnity,and provided to resolve their differences,the parties have stipulated and agreed that a pacific may add its counterclaims asserted in the nevada action to the claims already asserted in this arbitration and b sellers in turn shall have an opportunity to brief and argue whether some or all of pacific claims in this arbitration including,but not limited to,the counterclaims constitute a slapp under nevada statute.all counsel signed the order.
in january the arbitrators denied hotels nevada special motion to strike brought pursuant to nevada law.addressing pacific counterclaims on the merits,the arbitration award described the elements of each claim under nevada law and concluded that the evidence adduced during the hearing satisfied those elements.the judgment following the order confirming the award similarly outlined the procedural history concerning the additional claims,noting that the seller parties stipulated,through counsel of record,that pacific nevada counterclaims all could be added,tried and resolved under nevada law provided that they be allowed to bring an motion under nevada law,which they did and lost.thus,in addition to the original claims asserted at the outset of the arbitration,pacific presented additional tort claims for abuse of process,slander of title,and interference with contract,along with a contract claim for indemnity.
despite having stipulated to resolve pacific nevada claims through arbitration,appellant now contends that the arbitrators exceeded their powers by resolving those claims because they were barred by our earlier decision in hotels nevada ii.he argues pacific tort recovery could not be based on the recordation of the nevada lis pendens because it was the law of the case that such activity was protected under code of civil procedure section.
the law of the case doctrine states that when,in deciding an appeal,an appellate court states in its opinion a principle or rule of law necessary to the decision,that principle or rule becomes the law of the case and must be adhered to throughout its subsequent progress,both in the lower court and upon subsequent appeal.citation.quackenbush superior court th.law of the case may apply even where the appeal is from a decision short of a full trial,including a judgment on a demurrer,a nonsuit order or denial of an motion.bergman drum th,fn.however,the doctrine of law of the case does not prevent retrial of an issue,although it does require that the same conclusion be reached if that matter is retried on the same evidence.citation.people burbine th,see also people scott th,rejecting argument that the law of the case doctrine compelled the same result on retrial of a prior conviction allegation,as the doctrine can not be used to prevent the retrial.it merely means that,in order to succeed,the people will have to produce additional evidence at such retrial.
here,similarly,the law of the case doctrine was unavailable to prevent the arbitration of pacific counterclaims brought in nevada.the
