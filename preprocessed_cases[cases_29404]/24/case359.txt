opinion of the court 
this matter is before the court on an appeal from an order of the district court dated september,denying american cardiovascular systems acs motion for a stay of patent infringement litigation pending arbitration pursuant to.acs sought a stay in this litigation brought by vascular engineering ave so that it could enforce the arbitration clauses in two agreements containing a release and a covenant not to sue,respectively,into which acs had entered with bard,bard.after acs and bard executed these agreements,ave,in,purchased bard coronary catheter business.at that time bard assigned the two agreements to ave and acs agree that the arbitration clauses are valid and that their provisions bind them,but ave asserts that the claims it advances in this patent infringement litigation are outside the scope of the two agreements.the district court agreed with ave and acs appeals.we will affirm the district court order denying the motion to stay the litigation pending arbitration because bard never owned the claims involved in this litigation and,as a result,disputes regarding them are not subject to the arbitration provisions of either agreement.thus,although ave has stepped into bard shoes,inasmuch as it owes to acs only obligations it derived from bard,the arbitration clauses in the two agreements do not apply to ave separate claims involved here.
background 
acs coronary stent delivery systems consist of small pieces of stainless steel that are laser cut from a tube and affixed to a stent delivery catheter.the coronary stent is on a catheter that positions the stent in the appropriate region of the blood vessel.the balloon end of the catheter is inflated to expand the stent and place it against the vessel wall.the catheter then is withdrawn.
a the agreement 
bard,a company involved in the development,manufacture and sale of medical devices,sued acs in,alleging infringement of certain of its patents for catheter technology.see bard,advanced cardiovascular,no.sa cv jsl,dist.lexis.july,app.at.acs then sued bard in,alleging infringement of several of acs patents for catheter technology,but bard asserted counterclaims for infringement of bard catheter technology patents in that litigation.see advanced cardiovascular,bard,no.fms,wl,app.at.in january,acs and bard settled the actions through an agreement the agreement in which they various catheter patents to each other and agreed to pay royalties.
the agreement contained mutual releases which provided that each party 
on behalf of itself and its respective predecessors,successors,parents,subsidiaries,assigns,stockholders,officers,directors,attorneys,agents,employees and representatives hereby releases and discharges the other party,and its respective predecessors and successors,parents,subsidiaries and their respective assigns,stockholders,officers from any and all debts,claims,demands,damages,liabilities,obligations,causes of action,agreements,suits,sums of money,and rights,whether known or unknown,suspected or unsuspected,which are based on any actions or inaction occurring prior to the date of this agreement and which the party now owns or holds,or at any time heretofore owned or held,by reason of any act,matter,cause or thing whatsoever subject to certain exceptions not relevant here.
agreement app.at.
the agreement also provided for arbitration to settle certain disputes 
any dispute between the parties concerning the construction,interpretation,and effect of this agreement or any clause herein contained,or the rights and liabilities of the parties hereunder,or the coverage of any patent claims licensed herein,shall be resolved,if necessary,by binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association,and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator s may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

b the agreement 
in bard sued acs for infringement of certain of its patents for catheters based on actions not covered by the agreement.see bard,advanced cardiovascular.app.at.then in bard sued acs again for infringement of its catheter patents.see bard,advanced cardiovascular,rrm.app.at.to resolve these actions,bard and acs entered into a settlement agreement on or about april,in which acs agreed to pay bard,and the parties certain catheter patents to each other.this agreement did not contain any releases but did include mutual covenants not to sue which,with respect to bard,provided as follows 
bard and its affiliates covenant not to sue acs and its affiliates for any and all debts,claims,demands,and liabilities,whether known or unknown,suspected or unsuspected,which are based in any way on any and all of acs and its affiliates past and current domestic and foreign angioplasty catheters including stent delivery catheters.for purposes of this section,acs and its affiliates past and current domestic and foreign angioplasty catheters including stent delivery catheters shall mean acs and its affiliates past and current domestic and foreign angioplasty catheters including stent delivery catheters and shall specifically exclude any future modifications to such products.
agreement.b app.at.
the agreement required acs to deliver to bard certain catalogues and materials which showed current domestic and foreign angioplasty catheters including stent delivery catheters to identify products exempted from suit by the agreement.see app.at agreement.b.the acs coronary stent delivery systems,including the acs rx and the acs rx hp,were listed and pictured in the materials that acs provided to bard,and these products were the subject of the infringement action.see app.at.the and international product brochures acs delivered listed the integrated stent delivery systems which consist of a stent mounted on a stent delivery catheter.see app.at.
in this agreement,bard and acs also agreed to settle certain disputes by arbitration as provided in the following clause 
any dispute between the parties concerning the construction,interpretation,and effect of this agreement or any clause herein contained,or the rights and liabilities of the parties hereunder,or the coverage of any patent claims licensed herein,shall be resolved,if necessary,by binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association,and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator s may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

c actions between acs and ave and ave purchase of bard business 
during the period of its disputes with bard,acs also was involved in litigation with acs first sued ave in december in the northern district of california,and ave sued acs on february,in the district of delaware.ave complaint for patent infringement of its stent technology patents against acs involves two acs coronary stent delivery systems the acs rx stent delivery system and the acs rx hp stent delivery system.ave also has advanced various state law claims against acs including breach of contract,misappropriation of trade secrets,unfair competition,and wrongful acquisition of property and conversion regarding the development of the stent delivery systems and events that occurred between and.then,in april,acs brought a second patent infringement action in the northern district of california against 
while these three actions were pending,on october,ave purchased the assets of bard coronary catheter business which included its various catheter technology patents.see app.at.the agreement allowed its assignment as long as the patents that were the subject of the agreement were transferred,see app.at agreement,and the agreement allowed its assignment in connection with a merger,consolidation or sale of its stock or sale of the assets of its business.see app.at agreement.accordingly,bard assigned all of its rights and obligations under the two agreements to 
on february,in response to ave action against it and after the california court transferred the two cases pending before it to delaware,acs moved to stay ave district court action,medtronic ave,advanced cardiovascular,pending arbitration of whether either the release in the agreement or the covenant not to sue in the agreement bars the action.in addition,acs filed a demand for arbitration.obviously,the demand for arbitration was somewhat unusual as acs predicated it on provisions in agreements to which ave was not a party when it brought the action.ave opposed acs motion,arguing that bard never owned ave claims against acs for infringement of ave stent patents or the state law claims involved in the litigation between ave and acs.ave also argued that the agreements did not cover these claims and that they were not subject to arbitration.
in march,the district court held a hearing on acs motion and then,on september,denied the motion.see app.at mem.order at.the district court held that it could not interpret the release of all claims held by bard in the agreement or its undertakings in the agreement as applying to separate claims held by bard assignee,see app.at mem.order at.the court stated that a lthough catheters and stents may be bundled for marketing purposes,there can be no question but that catheters and stents involve different technology and patents and that ave developed its stent technology independent of bard the assignor to ave.app.at mem.order at.
subsequently,acs made a motion to reargue its motion to stay the action pending arbitration or,in the alternative,for a stay pending appeal.on march,acs withdrew its motion to reargue and filed an appeal from the district court september,order.on march,acs moved in this court to stay proceedings in the district court pending appeal,and,after ave filed its opposition to acs motion,a motions panel of this court referred acs motion to the merits panel by an order dated may.acs,however,has withdrawn the motion as the district court has stayed the proceedings before it.
d related cases and proceedings 
this case,medtronic ave,advanced cardiovascular systems,has been consolidated with the two proceedings acs brought against ave in the northern district of california and which the california court transferred to the district of delaware,advanced cardiovascular systems,arterial vascular engineering,and advanced cardiovascular systems,arterial vascular engineering.medtronic,ave parent company,also has sued acs twice regarding infringement of medtronic stent patents.see medtronic,advanced cardiovascular.medtronic,advanced cardiovascular,and guidant.acs moved to stay the proceedings based on the arbitration clause in the agreement between bard and acs.the district court denied acs motion,and the court of appeals for the eighth circuit affirmed.see medtronic,advanced cardiovascular,table,wl cir.the court ruled that as the parent corporation of ave,medtronic,was not bound to the agreement.
ii.discussion 
a jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction over this patent infringement case pursuant to and a.we conclude for the reasons we set forth that we have jurisdiction over the appeal of the denial of the motion to stay pending arbitration pursuant to a a and.
the parties in their primary briefs indicated,without substantial discussion,that this court has jurisdiction over this appeal under a a.we,however,questioned this point inasmuch as the district court jurisdiction was based in whole or in part on so that under a the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit would have exclusive jurisdiction over an appeal from a final decision in this case.accordingly,we directed the parties to file supplemental briefs on the jurisdictional point.in their supplemental briefs they have adhered to their position that we have jurisdiction.
after considering these briefs we have determined that we have jurisdiction and thus we adjudicate this appeal on the merits.our starting point is a a which makes the order in this case appealable.section a a,however,does not indicate the court to which such an appeal may be taken.thus,we examine the general statutes providing for the courts of appeals jurisdiction.we conclude that section a does not vest jurisdiction in the court of appeals for the federal circuit because this appeal is not from a final decision.after all,rather than ending the litigation on the merits,see john hancock mutual life ins.olick,cir,the order ensure d that the litigation will continue in the district court.gulfstream aerospace mayacamas,d see aluminum of am.beazer east,cir.furthermore,we see no reason to regard the order as final under the collateral order doctrine as we are satisfied that even if it were not appealable under section a a,it effectively could be reviewed after entry of a final judgment in the district court.see coopers lybrand livesay,d queipo prudential bache,cir.thus,section a does not vest jurisdiction in the court of appeals for the federal circuit over the current appeal in this case.
we also conclude that the court of appeals for the federal circuit could not have jurisdiction over this appeal under c which vests it with exclusive jurisdiction over an appeal from an interlocutory order as described in a or b in cases in which it would have jurisdiction over an appeal from a final decision under section.plainly section b can not be applicable as the procedures for allowing an interlocutory appeal as set forth in that section have not been followed here.
thus,we are left to consider only section a which deals,inter alia,and as possibly applicable here,with orders refusing to grant injunctions.upon consideration of that subsection we are satisfied,in harmony with gulfstream,at.at,and in accordance with the weight of authority,that the order denying the stay should not be regarded as appealable as an order denying an interlocutory injunction under section a.see mclaughlin gormley king terminix int l,cir queipo,at see also cofab,philadelphia joint bd,cir.
in view of the foregoing analysis we come to the conclusion that the court of appeals for the federal circuit would not have had jurisdiction if acs had prosecuted this appeal to that court.that conclusion,however,in itself does not mean that we do have jurisdiction.after all,what we have held with respect to the court of appeals for the federal circuit lack of jurisdiction under section a would apply equally to us if we attempted to exercise jurisdiction under our usual source of jurisdiction,as that section,like section a,provides for jurisdiction only over appeals from final decisions.moreover,we no more can exercise jurisdiction under section a by regarding the order denying the stay as an order denying an interlocutory injunction than could the court of appeals for the federal circuit under section c which incorporates that section.thus,this case is the unusual one that finally turns on the residual jurisdictional statute,which provides,with exceptions that we hold are inapplicable,that an appeal from a reviewable decision of a district court shall be taken to the court of appeals for the circuit embracing the district.inasmuch as the appeal has been taken from the united states district court for the district of delaware,which is within this circuit,we have jurisdiction.
in reaching our result we have not overlooked the opinion of the court of appeals for the seventh circuit in in re bbc international,cir,a case that we brought to the parties attention when we requested the supplemental briefs.in bbc,the regional court of appeals held that it did not have jurisdiction to entertain a petition for a writ of mandamus pursuant to a which authorizes courts of appeals in aid of their respective jurisdictions to issue writs.id.at.in reaching its conclusion,the court indicated that the p ower to issue writs of mandamus depends on the power to entertain appeals when the case ends,and it thus held that it did not have jurisdiction to issue the writ because any appeal from a final decision in the case would have to be taken to the court of appeals for the federal circuit.id.at.thus,for the court to determine whether it had jurisdiction to entertain a writ of mandamus it had to work backwards from its conclusion on the question of whether it would have jurisdiction at the time of a final decision.
here,however,our methodology is different as we are deciding the case on the basis of what court has jurisdiction now.thus,our analysis in no way is confined by a provision such as that in section a that a court may issue writs in aid of its jurisdiction.consequently,the circumstance that the court of appeals for the federal circuit will have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeal from a final decision in this case does not require that we conclude differently than we do with respect to our jurisdiction over the appeal in this case at this time.
b standard of review 
we exercise plenary review over the legal questions concerning the applicability and scope of an arbitration agreement.see harris green tree fin,cir considering a district court denial of a motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings pending arbitration pritzker merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.nevertheless,to the extent that the district court predicated its decision on findings of fact,our standard of review is whether those findings were clearly erroneous see kaplan first options of chicago,cir.
c court decides arbitrability of dispute 
when congress enacted the federal arbitration act,it provided a framework for the development of a body of uniform federal law governing contracts within its scope.therefore,if the arbitration act is applicable,federal law applies in questions regarding the construction and enforcement of an arbitration clause,even in those cases in which the district court jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship see mitsubishi motors soler,d goodwin elkins,cir becker autoradio,becker autoradiowerk,cir.accordingly,if the arbitration act applies,federal law,including general principles of contract law,determines whether there is a valid arbitration clause.see first options of chicago,kaplan,d mitsubishi,at.at harris,at goodwin,at.
in appropriate circumstances,allows litigants to obtain an order requiring a reluctant party to arbitrate a dispute,as it directs the district court to order a party to arbitrate if it is satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not an issue.painewebber hartmann,cir see harris,at.but under section when one party refuses to arbitrate,the issue of whether the dispute is within the scope of the agreement requires district court resolution.see,communication workers of,d painewebber,at.there is an issue in dispute in those circumstances because arbitration is fundamentally a creature of contract,kaplan,at,and thus arbitrators have the authority to resolve disputes only if the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration.see,at.at a rbitration is a matter of contract and a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.accordingly,for a court to enter an order compelling arbitration there must be sufficient evidence that the parties consented to arbitration in an express agreement.see united steelworkers of am.warrior gulf navigation,d kaplan,at painewebber,at mills,stockbridge fabrics,cir.
while a court asked to stay proceedings pending arbitration must determine whether there is a valid agreement to arbitrate and,if so,whether the specific dispute falls within the substantive scope of that agreement,its function nevertheless is very limited when the parties have agreed to submit all questions of contract interpretation to the arbitrator.it is confined to ascertaining whether the party seeking arbitration is making a claim which on its face is governed by the contract.united steelworkers of am.american,d see also united paperworkers int l union misco,d.to determine whether a claim falls within the scope of an arbitration agreement,the focus is on the factual underpinnings of the claim rather than the legal theory alleged in the complaint.svedala,civ,wl,at,citing,inter alia,mitsubishi,at.at.if the court determines that there is an agreement to arbitrate and that the issue in dispute falls within the scope of the agreement,it must submit the matter to arbitration without ruling on the merits of the case.see beck reliance steel prods,cir.
however,federal policy favors arbitration and thus a court resolves doubts about the scope of an arbitration agreement in favor of arbitration.see moses cone,at.at first liberty inv.group nicholsberg,cir kaplan,at.there is a presumption of arbitrability.painewebber,at see pritzker,at stateside mach.alperin,cir doubtful issues regarding the applicability of an arbitration clause are to be decided in favor of arbitration.an order to arbitrate should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.united steelworkers warrior,at.at see also,at.at first liberty inv.group,at schulte prudential ins.of am.in re prudential ins,cir sharon steel jewell coal and coke,cir so long as the appellant claim of arbitrability was plausible,interpretation of the contract should have been passed on to the arbitrator.yet there is a limit as to how far a court should go in resolving a dispute in favor of arbitration because,as we stated in painewebber,while interpretive disputes should be resolved in favor of arbitrability,a compelling case for nonarbitrability should not be trumped by a flicker of interpretive doubt.painewebber,at.
d the settlement agreement and release 
as we have indicated,ave does not dispute that it is bound by the agreements between acs and bard,including the arbitration clauses.accordingly,the question for us to determine is whether the district court erred in holding that the dispute is not within the scope of the arbitration clauses.in the contained in the agreement,each party released the other party from demands,damages,liabilities,obligations,causes of action,agreements,suits,sums of money and rights,which were based on any actions or inaction occurring prior to the date of the agreement and which the party then owned or held.see app.at agreement.the agreement also provided for arbitration of any dispute between the parties concerning the construction,interpretation and effect of this agreement or any clause herein contained,or the rights and liabilities of the parties hereunder.app.at agreement.a.
but even if ave predicates its claims on property interests extant prior to the date of the agreement,inasmuch as bard did not then own or hold the interests of ave,bard could not have agreed to release acs from or arbitrate claims relating to those interests.accordingly,while it is true that when ave accepted the assignment of the agreement from bard it step ped into bard shoes,see premier dental prod.darby dental supply,cir professional collection consultants hanada,d,th,the agreement to arbitrate can not be applied to ave separate interests that bard never owned.therefore,although this litigation is extraordinarily complex,our resolution of it requires nothing more than the application of a rather straightforward principle.
acs argues that svedala industries,wl,supports the view that releases given by an assignor can bar independent,claims of an assignee where the release explicitly applies to successors and assigns.it argues that,like ave,the plaintiff in svedala contended that the release could not bar its independent patent claims because the promisor did not hold rights to the patent at issue at the time of the release.in svedala,two companies,barmac and tidco international,entered into a license agreement in regarding the patent and related products that barmac owned.the patent related to an impact breaking apparatus designed to reduce the size of certain minerals.tidco and svedala industries,svedala were sister companies,as both were subsidiaries of svedala industries,ab svedala ab.see svedala,wl,at.in,tidco,svedala,and svedala ab entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release with kemper equipment over certain disputes regarding the sales and operations of their respective crushing and screening equipment business and ancillary operations.see id.at.
the release agreement provided that the parties on behalf of themselves and their respective 
predecessors,successors,heirs,assigns,subsidiaries,sister companies,parent companies and all persons,connected with them fully release and discharge the other and their respective predecessors,successors subsidiaries,sister companies,parent companies from any and all claims,demands,causes of action,obligations,damages and liabilities of any nature whatsoever,whether or not now known,suspected or claimed 
id.at.about one year later in tidco acquired barmac.see id.at.then in,tidco assigned the patent barmac previously owned to svedala.see id.at.svedala then brought a lawsuit against kemper and rock engineered for infringement of the patent.kemper and rock engineered moved to stay the proceedings and to compel arbitration.see id.at.
the court rejected svedala argument that svedala predicated on a contention that at the time of the release agreement it had no rights in the patent and therefore had no patent infringement claim to release so that the matter did not fall within the arbitration clause.in rejecting the argument,the court reasoned,inter alia,that although svedala did not have rights in the patent at the time of the release,barmac did have rights in the patent at that time,and tidco is the successor of and is a sister company to the plaintiff svedala.see id.at.the release specified that it applied to all successors and sister companies and all persons connected with them,and svedala,in addition to being a party to the release,was a sister company of tidco a party to the release and also later an assign.see id.at.
obviously the situation in svedala is completely distinguishable from that here.first of all,the plaintiff svedala itself was a party to the broad release,whereas ave was not a party to the release between bard and acs.second,even if svedala had not been a party to the release,tidco was a party to the release and entered into it on behalf of its sister companies,of which svedala was one.in this case,ave was not bound to the release agreement between bard and acs through a relationship with either of the parties existing at the time of the execution of the release.because the defendants in svedala put forth evidence that they had made and offered for sale the accused infringing device prior to the time of the release,the fact that svedala was a party to the release is relevant,even if the claim was unknown.
in contrast,in this case,although bard was a party to the release and later assigned the contract to ave,at the time of the release bard did not own and,in fact,never owned the patents that are now the subject of the suit between ave and acs.this is a crucial difference because here,unlike in svedala,the party seeking to invoke the arbitration clause is trying to apply the clause in an action on a patent that was not acquired from a party to the agreement to arbitrate.thus,if ave action against acs concerned patents that bard acquired after the date of the release and bard assigned the contract containing that release to ave,this case would be in a very different posture.
in another case that acs cites to support its case,universal studios viacom,two parties entered into a joint venture agreement relating to the cable television business that included a provision requiring that the participants not engage in the same business as the joint venture.see id.at.another party,viacom,then bought the interests of one of the participants in the joint venture.this acquisition posed a problem because viacom already was in the cable business.after complex negotiations and business developments that we need not describe,litigation ensued.the court held that the clause was effective with respect to viacom.see id.at.
universal studios is different from this case in that the parties there were involved in a joint venture and had signed a agreement and exclusivity agreement,and the purchaser of the interest of one joint venturer stepped into its shoes thereby becoming as subject to the provision of the joint venture agreement as to all its other provisions.accordingly,the joint venture agreement and the and exclusivity agreements gave rise to different fiduciary and contractual obligations and duties than those provided by a release or covenant not to sue which relate to obligations and claims of the parties subject to the agreement rather than claims of a third party.thus,universal studios dealt with the obligations of a party to adhere to the terms of a joint venture when it acquired an interest in the venture.accordingly,the factual pattern in universal studios is so distinct from that here that the case is not useful in resolving the controversy here.
reid contel cellular of louisville,table,wl cir,is a more pertinent citation than svedala and universal studios.in reid,contel acquired a portion of the business of mccaw cellular,reid employer.contel,however,though it hired other mccaw cellular employees,did not hire reid,according to reid because of her physical handicap.reid then filed an action under kentucky law against contel in state court which was removed to the district court.reid,however,remained mccaw cellular employee.
subsequently reid left mccaw cellular employment and at that time received a severance package pursuant to which she released mccaw cellular and its successors and assigns from all possible claims.contel then successfully moved for summary judgment on the ground that it was a of mccaw cellular.on appeal,the court of appeals reversed,indicating that contel assignee status mccaw extends only to the subject matter contained within the purchase agreement and that it is illogical to allow contel to benefit as assignee from every release to which mccaw has been a party since the date of the purchase agreement.id.at.
we certainly agree with reid because a contrary holding would have meant that the successor to a release could apply it to bar claims quite beyond anything the parties to the release could have contemplated.after all,a releasor giving a release to a second party hardly would anticipate that,as a result of an assignment,a third party could apply the release to a claim the releasor had against the third party that was quite independent of its claims against the second party.reid,then,supports the result the district court reached in this case.
moreover,a release usually will not be construed to bar a claim which had not accrued at the date of its execution or a claim which was not known to the party giving the release.see three rivers motors ford motor,cir.while it is true that cases acs has cited support the view that a release can bar even unknown claims,these cases would be relevant only if it were bard unknown claims that ave,stepping into bard shoes,wished to pursue against acs.see id.at holding that although ordinarily words of release will not be construed to bar unknown claim,parties intended to release accrued but unknown antitrust claims san diego hospice san diego,d,th.inasmuch as ave seeks to assert claims that bard never owned,the cases acs cites are not relevant.accordingly,it can be said with positive assurance that the claims in this case which ave asserts against acs are not within the scope of the release in the agreement and that ave thus is not bound to arbitrate disputes regarding them.
e the settlement and covenant not to sue 
the covenant not to sue in the agreement provided 
bard and its affiliates covenant not to sue acs and its affiliates for any and all debts,claims,demands,and liabilities,whether known or unknown,suspected or unsuspected,which are based in any way on any and all of acs and its affiliates past and current domestic and foreign angioplasty catheters including stent delivery catheters.for purposes of this section,acs and its affiliates past and current domestic and foreign angioplasty catheters including stent delivery catheters shall mean acs and its affiliates past and current domestic and foreign angioplasty catheters including stent delivery catheters and shall specifically exclude any future modifications to such products.
agreement.b app.at.however,the covenant not to sue does not apply to ave separate claims that bard never owned.
