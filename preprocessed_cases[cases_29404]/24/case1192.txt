insurance code section requires insurers to provide coverage for bodily injury or wrongful death caused by uninsured motorists.subdivision f of this statute provides that if the insurer and the insured can not agree whether the insured is legally entitled to recover damages from an uninsured motorist and the amount of such damages,those issues shall be determined by arbitration,subd.f.
we granted review in these consolidated cases to decide two related issues.the insurer in bouton usaa casualty insurance company opposed a demand for arbitration on the ground that the claimant was not covered by the insurance policy.we held in van tassel superior court cal d,van tassel that jurisdictional facts,such as whether a claimant is insured under an uninsured motorist provision,are subject to arbitration.but we retreated from this holding the next year,saying in freeman state farm mut.auto.ins.cal d,freeman,that we loosely and unfortunately termed the issue in van tassel jurisdictional.we explained in freeman that insurance code section,subdivision f,read literally,requires arbitration of two issues only whether the insured is entitled to recover against the uninsured motorist and if so,the amount of the damages.freeman,supra,cal d at.
we conclude that our holding in van tassel can not be reconciled with our subsequent holding in freeman and must be overruled.determining whether a claimant is insured under an uninsured motorist provision is not a question of the underinsured tortfeasor liability or damages owed to the insured,and is therefore not subject to arbitration under insurance code section,subdivision f.
state farm mutual insurance company raises the related question whether an arbitrator or a court should decide if a default judgment obtained by the insured against the underinsured tortfeasor binds the insurer.we conclude that this issue is subject to arbitration,because insurance code section,subdivision f requires an insured and his or her insurer to arbitrate the tortfeasor liability and damages owed to the insured,and the binding nature of a default judgment obtained against that tortfeasor falls squarely within those questions of liability and damages statutorily subject to arbitration.
background 
bouton usaa casualty insurance company 
plaintiff lloyd bouton was injured in an automobile accident,and settled his claim against kevin daniels,the driver of the other vehicle,for daniels automobile insurance policy limit of.bouton formally demanded arbitration with defendant usaa casualty insurance company,his sister insurer,seeking damages exceeding the policy limit payment he received from daniels insurer.usaa denied coverage,claiming that bouton was not a resident of his sister household,and was therefore not covered under her insurance policy.
consistent with insurance code section,subdivision b,the policy underinsured motorist provision defines a covered person as the named insured or any family member.the policy defines a family member as a person related to the named insured by blood,marriage,or adoption who is a resident of the named insured household.bouton contends that he constituted a family member of the named insured,his sister,samela bouton,because they were blood relatives permanently residing in the same household.the underinsured motorist provision of the policy provided that usaa would pay compensatory damages which a covered person is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an underinsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury sustained by a covered person and caused by an auto accident.consistent with section,subdivision p,the policy provided that no payment would be made until the limits of liability under any applicable motor vehicle bodily injury liability bonds or policies have been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements,and proof of such is submitted to usaa.
the underinsured motorist provision of the policy contained an arbitration agreement,which stated if usaa and a covered person disagree as to.whether a covered person is legally entitled to recover bodily injury or property damage damages from the owner or operator of an underinsured motor vehicle or.the amount of bodily injury damages that the covered person is legally entitled to collect from that owner then,that disagreement shall be arbitrated this arbitration shall be limited to the two aforementioned factual issues and shall not address any other issues,including but not limited to,coverage questions.any arbitration finding that goes beyond the two aforementioned factual issues shall be voidable by usaa or a covered person.
usaa opposed bouton demand for arbitration,arguing that bouton was not covered under his sister policy.the trial court denied bouton motion to compel arbitration,finding that because the arbitration provision of the insurance policy was no broader than section,subdivision f,the parties were only bound to arbitrate the issues of liability and damages,not coverage.bouton appealed the trial court denial of his motion to compel arbitration.the court of appeal held that the trial court erred in denying bouton motion to compel arbitration,and that the parties were required to arbitrate coverage as part of their agreement to arbitrate the liability and damages issues,consistent with this court decision in van tassel.usaa sought review in this court.
state farm mutual automobile insurance company

discussion 
we have interpreted the scope of section,subdivision f on three occasions,explaining the types of issues that should be determined by arbitration.see orpustan state farm mut.auto.ins.cal d,orpustan van tassel,supra,cal d,freeman,supra,cal d.numerous court of appeal decisions similarly have examined the scope of arbitral issues under section,subdivision f.see,state farm mut.auto.ins.superior court th,d whether insured could arbitrate issues of liability and damages under uninsured motorist provision of insurance policy where tortfeasor insurer became insolvent more than one year following accident furlough transamerica ins.d.whether arbitration provision mirroring,subd.f permitted arbitration of the extent of coverage and amount insurer must pay,in addition to issues of liability and damages hartford accident indemnity jackson d.whether issues of liability and damages arising out of a vehicle collision with a riderless horse were arbitrable.two common themes emerge from this line of cases arbitration of issues other than liability and damages is appropriate if the parties have contractually agreed to arbitrate more than is required by section,subdivision f and,only issues of liability and damages may be decided in an arbitral forum if the parties did not agree to arbitrate more than is required by section,subdivision f.orpustan,supra,cal d at,freeman,supra,cal d at.
in orpustan,we held that whether the plaintiff had been injured by an uninsured vehicle within the meaning of section and the plaintiff insurance policy should be determined by arbitration.the plaintiff in orpustan was injured when he swerved to avoid hitting another vehicle,and his truck went off the highway.orpustan,supra,cal d at.the plaintiff filed a claim with his insurer,arguing that he had been involved in an accident with an uninsured vehicle.ibid.section defines an uninsured vehicle to include a vehicle causing bodily injury arising out of physical contact between the insured vehicle and the vehicle.the plaintiff insurer concluded that the accident did not involve physical contact with the vehicle,and denied the plaintiff claim.the plaintiff then sought arbitration,and the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment.orpustan,supra,cal d at.the defendant prevailed on its motion for summary judgment,arguing that the absence of the statutorily necessary physical contact between the plaintiff vehicle and the vehicle precluded coverage.id.at.
the arbitration provision of the insurance policy contained the language mandated by section,subdivision f,and further stated that if the parties do not agree as to the amount payable hereunder,the parties may demand arbitration.orpustan,supra,cal d at.we held that the parties agreement to arbitrate the issue of whether the insured is legally entitled to recover damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured automobile was sufficiently broad to encompass arbitration of whether the vehicle was an uninsured vehicle within the meaning of the statute and the plaintiff policy.id.at.we reasoned that requiring a court to decide jurisdictional facts when the parties had agreed to arbitrate the questions in dispute would transform a procedure intended to result in prompt resolution into one carrying all the burdens and delays of civil litigation,overlaid by jurisdictional uncertainty between successive tribunals.id.at,quoting felner meritplan ins.d.
relying on this rationale,we held in van tassel that u nder the statute and the provisions for arbitration contained in an uninsured motorist provision such as that in the present case,jurisdictional facts,including the status of the claimant as an insured,are subject to determination by the arbitrator.van tassel,supra,cal d at.in van tassel,the plaintiff daughter was killed in an accident involving an uninsured vehicle.consistent with section,subdivision b,the plaintiff husband insurance policy provided that an insured under the policy included the spouse and relatives of the named insured while residing in the same household as the named insured.van tassel,supra,cal d at.the arbitration provision of the insurance policy provided that whether the insured is legally entitled to recover damages,and if so entitled the amount thereof,shall be made in the event of disagreement,by arbitration id.at,italics omitted.there was a factual dispute about whether the plaintiff deceased daughter had been a resident of the plaintiff household and was therefore covered under the insurance policy.ibid.we held that whether a claimant constituted a covered person under the uninsured motorist policy was a jurisdictional fact to be resolved by arbitration.id.at.
less than one year later,we were again called upon to consider the appropriate forum for the resolution of jurisdictional facts.freeman,supra,cal d.in freeman,the insured plaintiff was involved in a accident.id.at.the plaintiff was hit by a vehicle,and the driver of that vehicle testified that he had been hit by a convertible,which had forced him to collide with the plaintiff vehicle.ibid.within one year of the accident,the plaintiff filed a civil action against the driver of the vehicle that had collided with his car,and against several doe defendants.ibid.after a jury trial,a judgment was issued in favor of the defendant who had hit the plaintiff vehicle.ibid.nearly three years after filing his civil action,the plaintiff demanded arbitration under the uninsured motorist provision of his insurance policy,and filed a motion to compel arbitration.id.at.the plaintiff insurance policy contained an arbitration provision as required by section,subdivision f.freeman,supra,cal d at.
section,subdivision i then required that,within one year following an injury,an insured had to agree with his or her insurer as to the amount due under the policy,formally demand arbitration,or commence litigation against an uninsured motorist.code of civil procedure section governs a trial court discretion to order arbitration,and provides that if a valid written arbitration agreement exists and one party refuses to arbitrate,the court must order the parties to arbitrate the dispute unless the petitioner forfeited the right to compel arbitration.the issue in freeman was whether the trial court was entitled to consider the of limitations issue,or whether an arbitrator should decide whether the plaintiff motion to compel arbitration was and his right to arbitration therefore forfeited.freeman,supra,cal d at.
we held that t he issue of whether the right to compel arbitration has been waived by failure to comply with the former statute of limitation is clearly one for the determination of the court pursuant to the provisions of section of the code of civil procedure.freeman,supra,cal d at.preliminarily,we noted that code of civil procedure section requires a court to examine an arbitration agreement to determine whether there is a duty to arbitrate the controversy.freeman,supra,cal d at.we concluded that section,subdivision f requires the parties to arbitrate the narrow issues of whether the insured is entitled to recover damages from the uninsured or underinsured motorist,and if so,the amount of those damages.freeman,supra,cal d at.we acknowledged the strong public policy favoring arbitration,but stated that there is no policy compelling persons to accept arbitration of controversies which they have not agreed to arbitrate and which no statute has made arbitrable.id.at.
we distinguished our earlier holding in orpustan,concluding that the holding permitting arbitration in that case was based upon the language of the insurance policy and w
