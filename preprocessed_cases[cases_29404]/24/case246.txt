appellant american engineering aec asks us to decide if a party resisting the appointment of an arbitrator has the right to a hearing testing the validity of the arbitration agreement.acequip,won the appointment of an arbitrator to settle a dispute with aec without first seeking to compel arbitration.aec challenges this outcome,primarily arguing that it is entitled to a hearing to test whether it had a valid arbitration agreement with acequip before an appointment is made.we first find that the district court,prior to granting the application,improperly dismissed transact international,transact,the other party who originally brought the application along with acequip and who had purportedly assigned its contract with aec to acequip.therefore,we hold that the district court should restore transact to the lawsuit on remand.given the restoration of transact,we affirm the appointment of an arbitrator,and do not find that aec was entitled to a hearing prior to that appointment.
background 
in november,transact won a contract from the united states air force for the construction of an air cargo handling system at the kadena air base in okinawa,japan.transact then entered into a written subcontract the agreement with aec for the building construction portion of the air force contract.the agreement provided 
this agreement is made in accordance with the laws and statutes of the state of connecticut.in the event of disagreement between the parties to this agreement,arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the laws of and in the state of connecticut,usa.
on or about april,transact assigned its rights under the agreement to acequip.sometime after the assignment,a disagreement arose between acequip and aec under the agreement,although the nature of that dispute is unclear.on march,acequip and transact jointly moved in an appropriate judicial district of the state to have an arbitrator appointed.permits a party to file a motion seeking the appointment of an arbitrator.
after removing the case to the united states district court for the district of connecticut,aec moved to dismiss on various grounds,only one of which,standing,is relevant to this appeal.aec argued that transact had not alleged facts sufficient to prove that it had standing to sue.according to aec,transact had affirmatively alleged that transact had assigned its rights under the agreement to acequip,and thus,by transact own admission,transact no longer had any interest in the agreement.acequip and transact opposed aec motion to dismiss.in their opposition papers,they answered 
the defendant challenges transact standing to bring an application seeking appointment of an arbitrator because transact assigned its interests in the agreement to acequip.if aec has relinquished any challenge to transact assignment of rights to acequip,acequip and transact have no objection to transact removal from this matter.
aec,alleging that it never accepted transact offer,points to the following arguments in its reply papers if this case is not dismissed,aec would prove at trial that the purported assignment of the agreement to acequip is invalid,and transact concedes that it has no standing.therefore,its application must be dismissed with prejudice.
the district court dismissed transact from the action on the theory that aec agreed to the solution proposed by transact 
defendant argues that as transact assigned its rights to plaintiff,it has no standing to bring the current claim.transact has no objection to being dismissed from the action,so long as the assignment of its interests to plaintiff is not challenged.plaintiff sic offers no such objection.transact is therefore dismissed from the case.
in dismissing transact,the district court also issued an order requiring aec to show cause why an arbitrator should not be appointed.
aec argued no arbitrator should be appointed because appointment of an arbitrator would be premature at that stage of the proceedings.aec noted that it had not yet answered the application it wished to present evidence that the purported assignment from transact to acequip was invalid it needed time to conduct discovery to show the assignment was invalid and it wanted a hearing in which to dispute the validity of the assignment.in its reply,acequip argued the question of the validity of the assignment was an issue for the arbitrator,rather than the court.aec sought permission to file reply papers.without addressing aec petition for leave to file a reply,the district court found that an agreement to arbitrate existed,ordered the appointment of an arbitrator,and stated that the issue of the validity of the assignment was one for the arbitrator.this appeal followed.
discussion 
as a threshold issue,we find that this dispute is governed by the federal arbitration act faa,because all the statute criteria for jurisdiction apply there is a written arbitration agreement diversity provides an independent basis for federal jurisdiction and the underlying transaction involves interstate commerce.see see also in re chung and president,cir.we note,however,that the outcome is the same regardless of whether federal or connecticut law applies.
dismissal of transact 
aec correctly argues that it never accepted transact proposed solution regarding standing,and the district court therefore erred when it found aec waived its argument that the assignment rendered the arbitration agreement invalid.
aec argued below that if the facts presented in the pleadings were taken as true as required on a motion to dismiss brought under.b,transact lacked standing to move to appoint an arbitrator because its pleadings alleged that it had no interest in the agreement by virtue of its assignment.in opposing the motion to dismiss,transact stated 
the defendant challenges transact standing to bring an application seeking appointment of an arbitrator because transact assigned its interests in the agreement to acequip.if aec has relinquished any challenge to transact assignment of rights to acequip,acequip and transact have no objection to transact removal from this matter.
aec argues it never accepted transact offer.we agree.in aec reply papers,it states,if this case is not dismissed,aec would prove at trial that the purported assignment of the agreement to acequip is invalid,and transact concedes that it has no standing.therefore its application must be dismissed with prejudice.these statements show that aec continued to pursue its theory that the assignment was invalid and that aec argued only that transact had conceded that it lacked standing.it is clear the district court dismissed transact based on its wrong belief that aec agreed to transact terms,as demonstrated in its denial of aec motion for a stay pending appeal.
in the order denying that motion,the court said 
moreover,it was defendant aec who argued,in its motion to dismiss,that because there was an alleged assignment,transact lacked standing and should be dismissed for this reason.transact and acequip offered no objection to transact being dismissed as long as acequip sic did not subsequently challenge the assignment.defendant did not so object,and on that basis transact was dismissed.if defendant denies the validity of the assignment,it was improper to assert the contrary and to argue that transact should be dismissed.see.b.defendant is held to its argument and may not now whipsaw transact and acequip.defendant can not dismiss both transact because there was an assignment and also dismiss acequip because there was no assignment.
acequip argues that aec buried its assignment argument in sections of its briefing that discussed issues other than standing.we find this argument unpersuasive.aec,in its pleadings below,clearly challenged the assignment at every possible stage of the proceedings.we find that there was no waiver,and next consider the district court appointment of an arbitrator in light of the restoration of transact.
appointment of an arbitrator 
since we have determined that transact should be brought back into the lawsuit as one of the parties supporting the application to appoint an arbitrator,we need not address the question faced by the dist
