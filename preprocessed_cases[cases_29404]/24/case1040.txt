the function of the court is very limited when the parties have agreed to submit all questions of contract interpretation to the arbitrator.united paperworkers int l union,misco,d quotation omitted.with this admonition in mind,we consider the present dispute.lb b associates,lb b appeals from a district court order refusing to vacate an arbitrator award in favor of an employee and member of international brotherhood of electrical workers,local local.as the arbitrator decision draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement and is not contrary to the agreement express language,we affirm.
background 
lb b,a government services contractor that provides operation and maintenance services to the united states army at fort carson,colorado,and local,the collective bargaining representative for lb b employees,entered into a collective bargaining agreement cba in late.the cba contains two provisions specifically relevant to this appeal 
article management rights 
except as hereinafter provided,it is agreed by both parties to this agreement that the right to hire,promote,demote,transfer,suspend or discharge employees for just cause is vested exclusively in lb b,subject to the specific provisions of the agreement.furthermore,disciplinary actions shall be in accordance with lb b established policies and procedures.lb b policies shall take precedence to the extent that they are not in conflict with any provision of this agreement.
any employee engaging in sexual harassment may be subject to immediate discharge.
emphases added.the cba also provides that any grievance may be submitted to arbitration,and that the arbitrator shall have jurisdiction and authority to interpret and apply the cba,but may not add to,change,or modify any of the cba terms.
in february,donald dukart,a union member,was terminated by lb b for making sexually harassing comments to a female employee.at local request,dukart discharge was submitted to arbitration.lb b and local stipulated that the issues for arbitration were was dukart termination for just cause and if not,what was the appropriate remedy after a hearing,the arbitrator issued his award,finding that dukart had engaged in sexually harassing conduct but that termination was not warranted.specifically,the arbitrator found that lb b policies are uncertain in their notice to employees as to the scope of discipline for misconduct that,to the extent that the policies conflicted with the cba just cause for termination standard,the cba took precedence and that just cause for termination did not exist because of dukart positive work record and potential for rehabilitation.after concluding that dukart sexually harassing conduct is not condoned and justifies discipline but not discharge,the arbitrator ordered dukart reinstated with back pay,but also ordered him to apologize to the female employee and personally pay for sexual harassment training.finally,pursuant to the cba provision that the costs of arbitration be borne by the losing party,the arbitrator assessed costs to lb 
lb b then filed a complaint in the district court seeking to vacate the arbitrator award.agreeing that no material facts were in dispute,lb b and local filed for summary judgment the district court ruled in favor of local,finding the award within the power of the arbitrator and consistent with the cba.after the district court entered a final judgment in the matter,lb b timely appealed.

because t he parties have contracted for an arbitrator to resolve their disputes,not a court,our standard of review of an arbitrator award is among the narrowest known to the law.local united food commercial workers int l union king soopers,cir quotations omitted.thus w hether the arbitrator reading of the agreement was strained or even seriously flawed is irrelevant.bruce hardwood floors council of indus.workers,cir.a s long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.misco,at.

a n award does not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement if 
it is contrary to the express language of the contract or is so unfounded in reason and fact,so unconnected with the working and purpose of the agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator or if viewed in the light of its language,its context,and any other indicia of the parties intention,it is without factual support.

lb b argues that the arbitrator award in this case is contrary to the express language of the cba.specifically,lb b points to article immediate discharge provision.were this the only provision in the cba relating to termination,we might agree with lb b claim.however,article is not the cba sole termination provision article provides that lb b may discharge employees for just cause.lb b essentially contends that article provides an example of just cause for which termination is is,any sexual harassment is just cause for termination.that is certainly one interpretation.however,it is not the only interpretation.the arbitrator read the provisions differently,concluding instead that article vests discretion in the issuance of discipline for sexual harassment and article subjects any discharge to the just cause standard for adjudication and review emphasis added.in other words,a sexually harassing employee may be subject to discharge if just cause for discharge exists,or,stated differently,a sexually harassing employee is vulnerable to being discharged because of the serious nature of the offense,but the ultimate act of discharge must still satisfy the just cause criterion of article.this interpretation is also a plausible reconciliation of the two provisions whether it is the best interpretation is irrelevant the arbitrator at least arguably constru ed the cba,misco,at.thus,his decision must stand 
we recognize that in cases construing similar,though not identical,bargaining agreements,some courts have found that the violation of a specific provision authorizing discharge is de facto just cause for termination such that an arbitrator award reinstating an employee can not stand.for example,in warrior gulf navigation united steelworkers of america,cir,on which lb b relies,the eleventh circuit found that an arbitrator similar interpretation of an analogous cba contradicted the express language of the agreement.id.at.there,the cba contained a provision that the court interpreted to require just cause to terminate an employee id.at.in a separate section,the cba also provided that an employee who failed two drug tests was subject to immediate discharge.id.at nn.the arbitrator determined that just cause for termination did not exist by the mere fact that an employee had twice failed a drug test,but the court disagreed,ruling that b ecause the cba expressly addresses the particular contingency of a second positive drug test,we conclude that the cba just cause standard is consistent with this explicit provision and that,as a matter of law,the company had just cause to fire the employee.id.at.
on the other hand,other courts have deferred to the arbitrator interpretation of similar contract provisions.in,local,cir,the third circuit reversed a district court decision vacating an arbitrator award reinstating an employee who,the arbitrator found,was fired without just cause.id.at.there,the cba contained one provision that e mployees absent from work without good and sufficient cause for more than four consecutive days shall be subject to discharge,
