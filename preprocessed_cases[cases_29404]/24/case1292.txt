introduction 
plaintiff stephen michael mayers filed a lawsuit against his former employer,volt management,and its parent corporation,volt information sciences,collectively referred to as defendant,alleging several claims under the california fair employment and housing act,et feha.defendant filed a motion to compel arbitration based on plaintiff agreement to submit claims to final and binding arbitration,as evidenced by his signed employment application,employment agreement,and acknowledgment of receipt of the employee handbook.the trial court denied the motion.
defendant argues the trial court erred because the arbitration provisions were enforceable and did not contain any unconscionable elements.defendant argues that,in any event,the trial court should have severed any offending provisions and ordered arbitration.
we affirm.the arbitration provisions contained in the employment application,employment agreement,and employee handbook each required that plaintiff submit claims to arbitration pursuant to the applicable rules of the american arbitration association in the state where plaintiff was employed or was last employed by defendant.plaintiff was not provided with a copy of the controlling american arbitration association aaa rules or advised as to how he could find or review them.the provisions also failed to identify which set of rules promulgated by the aaa would apply.they further stated that the arbitrator shall be entitled to award reasonable attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party.for the reasons discussed post,such a prevailing party attorney fees term exposed plaintiff to a greater risk of being liable to defendant for attorney fees than he would have been had he pursued his feha claims in court.
under authority,the above discussed arbitration provisions were unconscionable and therefore unenforceable.because the unconscionable terms can not be severed from the rest of the arbitration provisions,plaintiff can not be compelled to arbitrate his claims against defendant.
background 
moves to compel arbitration of plaintiff feha claims.
in december,plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant,alleging claims for disability discrimination,subd.a,failure to accommodate,subd.m,failure to engage in the interactive process,subd.n,retaliation for taking leave under the moore brown roberti family rights act,and age discrimination,subd.a.
defendant filed a motion to compel arbitration of plaintiff claims and to stay judicial proceedings,on the ground that there is a valid,written arbitration agreement between plaintiff and defendant,covering any and all employment related disputes arising out of the conduct of defendant.defendant motion was supported by the declaration of defendant of human resources,louise ross.ross stated based on my understanding,the arbitration provision is a mandatory condition of employment for all defendant employees and defendant only accepts candidates for employment who unequivocally accept the terms and conditions contained in the employment agreement.it is further my understanding that by executing the employment application and employment agreement with defendant and continuing employment with defendant,plaintiff knowingly and voluntarily agreed to the terms and conditions contained in this document,including the mandatory arbitration provision.

discussion 
we review de novo a trial court determination of the validity of an agreement to arbitrate when the evidence presented to the trial court was undisputed.citations.we review under the substantial evidence standard the trial court resolution of disputed facts.citation.whether an arbitration provision is unconscionable is ultimately a question of law.citations.citation.parada superior court th,parada.
the federal arbitration act and at t mobility llc concepcion.
in at t mobility llc concepcion,at t mobility,the united states supreme court recently reiterated the history and purpose of the federal arbitration act et faa and the high court interpretation of its provisions,stating the faa was enacted in in response to widespread judicial hostility to arbitration agreements.citation.section,the primary substantive provision of the act,citation,provides,in relevant part,as follows a written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.we have described this provision as reflecting both a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration,citation,and the fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of contract,citation.in line with these principles,courts must place arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other contracts,citation,and enforce them according to their terms,citation.the final phrase of,however,permits arbitration agreements to be declared unenforceable upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.this saving clause permits agreements to arbitrate to be invalidated by generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,but not by defenses that apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.citations.italics added.
the united states supreme court stated in at t mobility,supra,at page.at page,a lthough saving clause preserves generally applicable contract defenses,nothing in it suggests an intent to preserve rules that stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of faa objectives.the supreme court further stated,w hen state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim,the analysis is straightforward the conflicting rule is displaced by the faa.citation.but the inquiry becomes more complex when a doctrine normally thought to be generally applicable,such as duress or,as relevant here,unconscionability,is alleged to have been applied in a fashion that disfavors arbitration.id.at.at.
the supreme court in at t mobility held that section of the faa preempts a rule under california law classifying most waivers in consumer contracts as unconscionable at t mobility,supra,at.at,because such a rule stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress id.at.at.the supreme court explained,a court may not rely on the uniqueness of an agreement to arbitrate as a basis for a holding that enforcement would be unconscionable,for this would enable the court to effect what the state legislature can not.id.at.at.
in the instant case,plaintiff opposed the motion to compel arbitration by arguing that the specific arbitration provisions before the court contained elements of procedural and substantive unconscionability,which render those elements unconscionable.plaintiff did not argue the arbitration provisions were unenforceable under california law because they required the arbitration of a particular type of claim.see at t mobility,supra,at.at.nor has plaintiff based his unconscionability argument on the uniqueness of an agreement to arbitrate.ibid.we therefore turn to review general principles of unconscionability under california law before applying those principles to the instant arbitration provisions.
general principles of california law on unconscionability 
civil code section,subdivision a provides if the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract,or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause,or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.panels of this court in parada,supra,th,and morris redwood empire bancorp th morris have provided thorough explanations of california unconscionability law.we do not need to fully restate those explanations here and instead provide the following summary of the law.
in morris,supra,th at page,the appellate court stated in california,two separate approaches have developed for determining whether a contract or provision thereof is unconscionable.one,based upon the common law doctrine,was outlined by the california supreme court in graham scissor tail,cal d graham.under graham,the court first determines whether an allegedly unconscionable contract is one of adhesion.upon making this finding,the court then must determine whether a the contract term was outside of the reasonable expectations of the weaker part y,or b was unduly oppressive or unconscionable.citation.a separate test,based upon cases applying the uniform commercial code unconscionability provision,views unconscionability as having procedural and substantive elements.a m produce fmc d the procedural element requires oppression or surprise.citation.oppression occurs where a contract involves lack of negotiation and meaningful choice,surprise where the allegedly unconscionable provision is hidden within a prolix printed form.citation.the substantive element concerns whether a contractual provision reallocates risks in an objectively unreasonable or unexpected manner.jones wells fargo bank th,under this approach,both the procedural and substantive elements must be met before a contract or term will be deemed unconscionable.both,however,need not be present to the same degree.a sliding scale is applied so that the more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th.
the morris court further stated our supreme court in perdue crocker national bank cal d,performed its unconscionability analysis exclusively under the graham approach,but noted the two analytical approaches are not incompatible,declaring both pathways should lead to the same result.id.at,fn.many years later in armendariz,the court approved both approaches without expressing a preference for either one.armendariz,supra,cal th at.in the recent case of little auto stiegler,cal th,our high court employed exclusively the approach derived from a m produce.morris,supra,th at.
the appellate court in morris,supra,th at pages,concluded t he approach provides a useful framework when properly employed,and conforms more closely to cases decided under section of the uniform commercial code,upon which california unconscionability statute is based.see perdue,supra,cal d at,fns.accordingly,we begin our analysis by considering the issue of procedural unconscionability with the following caveat in mind because procedural unconscionability must be measured in a sliding scale with substantive unconscionability,our task is not only to determine whether procedural unconscionability exists,but more importantly,to what degree it may exist.see also parada,supra,th at same.
following morris,supra,th,and parada,supra,th,we consider the extent to which the arbitration provisions here contain elements of procedural and substantive unconscionability in determining their enforceability.
the arbitration provisions have a high degree of procedural unconscionability.
procedural unconscionability concerns the manner in which the contract was negotiated and the circumstances of the parties at that time.citation.it focuses on factors of oppression and surprise.citation.the oppression component arises from an inequality of bargaining power of the parties to the contract and an absence of real negotiation or a meaningful choice on the part of the weaker party.citation.morris,supra,th at.procedural unconscionability occurs when the stronger party drafts the contract and presents it to the weaker party on a take it or leave it basis.trivedi curexo technology th,trivedi.
here,it is undisputed the arbitration provisions constituted contracts of adhesion.they were presented to plaintiff in printed,standardized forms that were drafted by defendant.parada,supra,th at.it is also undisputed that the arbitration provisions were offered to plaintiff on a basis.employment by defendant was expressly conditioned on plaintiff assent to the arbitration provisions.ross declaration further established that the arbitration provision is a mandatory condition of employment for all defendant employees and defendant only accepts candidates for employment who unequivocally accept the terms and conditions contained in the employment agreement.there is no question that plaintiff was in the weaker bargaining position and could not negotiate the terms of the arbitration provisions.
our conclusion,however,that the arbitration provisions are adhesion contracts heralds the beginning,not the end,of our inquiry into its enforceability.citation.a procedural unconscionability analysis also includes consideration of the factors of surprise and oppression.parada,supra,th at.here,the arbitration provisions were not hidden.the arbitration provision in the employment agreement appeared on the first page,was preceded by the heading agreement to arbitrate disputes boldface underscoring omitted,and was in boldface type.the acknowledgment of receipt of the employee handbook specifically referenced the arbitration policy and the employee handbook contained defendant policy on alternative dispute resolution.the employment application that plaintiff signed explained employment with defendant was conditioned on an agreement to arbitrate disputes.arbitration itself is a fairly common means of dispute resolution and would not be beyond the reasonable expectation of the weaker party.parada,supra,th at.
the arbitration provisions,however,required that final and binding arbitration occur in accordance with the applicable rules of the american arbitration association in the state where plaintiff was employed or last employed by defendant.defendant did not provide plaintiff a copy of the applicable rules or advise plaintiff how he could access that information.
in trivedi,supra,th at page,the appellate court stated numerous cases have held that the failure to provide a copy of the arbitration rules to which the employee would be bound supported a finding of procedural unconscionability.fitz ncr th,ncr resolution policy,known as addressing concerns together act,incorporated arbitration rules that were not attached and require d the other party to go to another source in order to learn the full ramifications of the arbitration agreement harper ultimo th,inability to receive full relief is artfully hidden by merely referencing the better business bureau arbitration rules,and not attaching those rules to the contract for the customer to review,which forced the customer to go to another source to learn that the arbitration agreement curtailed his ability to receive full relief gutierrez autowest,th,gutierrez never given or shown a copy of the arbitration rules of the american arbitration association aaa,the designated arbitration provider nor required to initial arbitration clause patterson itt consumer financial th,at signing,borrowers were not given a copy of the procedural rules of the national arbitration forum naf the rules were sent to the borrowers only once itt had initiated a claim against them.the appellate court in trivedi,supra,th at page,concluded that an employment arbitration provision was procedurally unconscionable because the agreement was prepared by the employer,it was a mandatory part of the agreement and the employee was not given a copy of the aaa rules.ibid.
in trivedi,supra,th at pages,the arbitration provision at issue required that disputes be arbitrated pursuant to the aaa national rules for the resolution of employment disputes.here,unlike the arbitration provision in trivedi,the arbitration provisions do not identify the particular set of aaa rules that would apply to the final and binding arbitration of plaintiff claims.instead,the arbitration provisions vaguely refer to the applicable rules of the american arbitration association in the state where plaintiff was last employed by defendant.see zullo superior court th,fn.noting the failure to provide the applicable aaa rules added to the procedural unconscionability of the arbitration agreement and i f the aaa does not publish rules under the title to which the arbitration agreement refers,the discrepancy would add to the oppressive nature of the agreement.
by failing to even identify the set of arbitration rules that would apply to the parties final and binding arbitration of employment disputes,the arbitration provisions subjected plaintiff to unreasonable surprise and oppression.this aspect of the arbitration provisions is directly at odds with the purpose of the faa.as explained by the united states supreme court,the faa principally seeks to ensure that private arbitration agreements are enforced according to their terms at t mobility,supra,at.at,and yet,here,defendant has failed to disclose all the terms of
