this case arises from a longstanding insurance dispute between amerex group,and amerex usa amerex,and their excess insurers,lexington insurance company and westchester surplus lines insurance company excess insurers.amerex initiated this suit on april,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,after nearly four years of investigation of its claim by the excess insurers and mediation between the parties.the excess insurers responded to the complaint by moving to compel appraisal according to the terms of the insurance policies.the district court harold baer,granted the excess insurers motion.in accordance with the parties contract,each side appointed a member of the appraisal panel panel,and,when the parties failed to agree on the appointment of the panel umpire,the district court appointed one at their request.the panel conducted its month valuation and ultimately quantified amerex loss at less than the value of its primary insurance contract,thus rendering the excess insurers policies inapplicable to amerex claims.the excess insurers moved thereafter for partial summary on the basis of this appraisal,and the district court granted the motion,dismissing amerex complaint.
amerex now appeals both the order to compel appraisal and the subsequent order confirming the appraisal and dismissing its complaint,arguing that the excess insurers waived their appraisal rights by failing to demand appraisal prior to the initiation of litigation the appraisers decided questions of coverage,contrary to new york law and the appraisal process became an arbitration with discovery,thus violating amerex due process rights.we conclude that a demand for appraisal was not untimely that the appraisers did not decide questions of coverage and that the appraisal procedures did not violate amerex due process rights even though the appraisal process allowed the excess insurers to make use of evidence gained through their previous investigations without allowing amerex to pursue the additional documentary and testimonial discovery that the company sought.the district court orders are thus affirmed in all respects.
background 
the facts in this case are largely undisputed,except where noted.because the district court granted the excess insurers motion for summary judgment,we review disputed facts in the light most favorable to amerex.see amador andrews,cir.
amerex distributes outerwear in the united states,acting as an intermediary between its wholesale customers and overseas clothing manufacturers.the company stored some of the clothing that awaited shipment to its customers in its warehouse in avenel,new jersey,on a large rack system that facilitated the clothing storage and organization.
on august,the rack collapsed,activating the warehouse sprinkler system,which flooded the premises.the water not only damaged amerex merchandise,but also rendered its computer system inoperable for one to three weeks,and thus prevented amerex from making promised deliveries.the damages associated with the collapse included lost merchandise,cancellation of orders,late charges for orders fulfilled,and lost business income.
to manage the risk of such losses,amerex carried three insurance policies.the first,issued by fireman fund insurance company fireman fund,served as amerex primary insurance,and covered damages associated with the warehouse,business personal property,business income,and other such losses,up to a limit of million.the second and third policies,issued by appellees,provided insurance in excess of the fireman fund policy.each excess policy had a liability limit of million,for a total of million beyond the coverage provided by fireman fund.
the excess insurance policies contained substantially identical clauses that allowed either party to insist in writing on the appointment of an appraisal panel to determine the extent of losses associated with any claim.the appraisal clause does not specify any time limit for making such a demand,and instead focuses on the procedure used to appoint the panel.
two years after the rack collapse,on or about june,amerex submitted its proof of loss to fireman fund and the excess insurers,claiming total damages of million.fireman fund paid the full amount of its policy amerex then sought coverage from the excess insurers for the remaining million.the excess insurers investigated the claim until october.during the course of this investigation,the excess insurers interviewed certain amerex employees concerning the nature of the business and reviewed financial statements and other documents.
at times,amerex appears to have prolonged the excess insurers investigation.some documents requested were not immediately forthcoming.the insurers also requested,but amerex could not produce,various other documents concerning amerex shipping and delivery reports and the quantities prices of merchandise shipped during the period preceding the rack collapse.
ultimately,on february,the excess insurers rejected amerex claim on three bases amerex failure to substantiate a number of aspects of its claims,due to the lack of documentary evidence alternative explanations for the loss of business income that amerex reported,including the september,terrorist attacks,economic recession,and the bankruptcies of some major customers and amerex improper determination of the proper restoration period,that is,the date after which business losses could no longer be attributed to the rack collapse or computer failure.
the parties agreed to meet to discuss the terms of the rejection and the excess insurers claim analysis.during the meeting,the excess insurers consultants and forensic accountants discussed with amerex the findings that led them to recommend rejecting amerex claim.after that meeting,in april,the parties agreed to mediate their dispute.in the mediation,the excess insurers provided significant documentary evidence to amerex.amerex own experts also presented their calculation of damages to the mediator.in april,after conferring with the mediator,the excess insurers made a final offer.without responding to that offer,amerex filed the present lawsuit on april.
ii.district court proceedings 
on june,after amerex had filed its complaint,the excess insurers wrote to amerex demanding appraisal and answered the complaint the next day,listing the appraisal demand among their affirmative defenses.the excess insurers then moved to compel an appraisal.amerex rejected the demand and contested the motion,claiming that the demand was untimely and was asserted only to preclude amerex from prosecuting its claim and obtaining discovery.amerex also argued that appraisal was inappropriate because the nature of its claims would require the appraiser to resolve issues of coverage,which,under governing law,the appraiser was not permitted to do.
the district court granted the excess insurers motion to compel appraisal on september.subject to the terms of their contract,each party appointed one member of the panel,and,when the parties could not agree on the panel umpire,they petitioned the district court to make that appointment.the district court did so and then stayed the litigation pending resolution of the appraisal.
iii.appraisal 
in conducting the appraisal,the panel reviewed documentary and testimonial evidence similar to that reviewed during both the excess insurers initial investigation and the subsequent mediation.the appraisal proceeding included the examination and of witnesses,and a day exclusively set aside for amerex rebuttal.on june,after almost two and a half years of review,the panel issued its valuation decision,finding that amerex damages amounted to approximately million,just more than half of the value of amerex insurance policy with fireman fund.pursuant to the parties agreement,the panel did not disclose most of its valuation methodology.it did,however,determine that the period of restoration concluded on october.amerex appointed panel member did not register a vote on the appraisal,declining to indicate whether he agreed or disagreed with the umpire conclusions.
because the panel valued amerex losses at less than the million the company had already received from its primary insurance carrier,thereby precluding recovery from the excess insurers under the terms of their policies,the excess insurers moved in district court for summary judgment.the district court granted the excess insurers motion and dismissed amerex complaint.in doing so,the district court held,inter alia,that the appraisal panel evaluated only the amount of loss of income suffered by amerex and did not evaluate,for example,the scope of coverage provided by the insurance policy.amerex,lexington ins,civ,wl,at,internal quotation marks omitted.this appeal ensued.
discussion

on appeal,amerex claims that the excess insurers appraisal rights were waived because the excess insurers failed to invoke them within a reasonable period the panel resolved coverage issues,rather than valuation issues,contrary to new york law and the appraisal was conducted as an arbitration whose discovery structure violated amerex due process rights.amerex misapprehends the law in each respect.
appraisal demand 
amerex contends that the excess insurers appraisal rights under the contract were waived,as their june,demand was untimely.amerex is correct that,notwithstanding the policies silence on a time limit for the appraisal demand,new york recognizes that the right to require an appraisal is not indefinite as to time,but must be exercised within a reasonable period.chainless cycle sec.ins.we therefore must determine whether the excess insurers delay in making the appraisal demand was reasonable.in doing so,we recognize that the meaning of that term,in this context,will depend upon the facts of the particular case.id.we also recognize that new york public policy favors an appraisal proceeding over a trial on damages,and under new york law,waiver of the right to an appraisal is not lightly inferred.sr int l bus.ins.world trade ctr.props.llc,civ,wl,at,citing s e motor hire indem,internal quotation marks omitted see also in re penn cent.consol.rail,in re delmar box aetna ins.
in applying new york law to determine the scope of reasonableness for purposes of appraisal demands,amerex urges us to accept the rule articulated by the wisconsin court of appeals in lynch american family mutual insurance.the lynch court held that absent a policy provision to the contrary,an insurance company may not demand an appraisal of a loss after the commencement of an action by the insured on that loss when the insurance company failed to demand the appraisal prior to the lawsuit even though it had an opportunity to do so.id.at.while at least one district court,applying new york law,has expressly considered and rejected the lynch court formulation of this rule,see peck planet ins,civ,wl,at july,the new york court of appeals appears not to have analyzed this issue because of that lack of guidance,we must either predict how the new york court of appeals would resolve the question,or certify the question to the new york court of appeals for a definitive resolution.highland capital mgmt.lp,at.see also regs.tit,a authorizing certification of determinative questions of new york law for which no controlling precedent of the new york court of appeals exists morris schroder capital mgmt.int l,cir.
we resort to certification only sparingly,mindful that,in diversity cases that require us to apply state law,it is our job to predict how the new york court of appeals would decide the issues before us.see dibella hopkins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,we do not certify questions of law where sufficient precedents exist for us to make a determination.id.the precedents here provide us with an adequate basis for determining,without certification,that the new york court of appeals would not follow the lynch court in holding that an appraisal demand is automatically rendered untimely once the opposing party has initiated litigation.the new york court of appeals has held that the exercise of appraisal rights must occur within a reasonable period of,and that this reasonableness determination must depend on the facts of the particular case.chainless cycle,at.because the application of the term reasonable requires a analysis,we interpret the intent of the new york court of appeals to allow courts to address questions of timeliness on a basis,even after litigation has commenced,as several federal district courts have already done.see,sr int l bus.ins,wl,at indian chef,fire cas.ins.of,civ,wl,peck,wl,at.
in light of the kind of inquiry that new york courts instruct us to make when determining the timeliness of an appraisal demand,we do not believe that the new york court of appeals would adopt the mechanistic and rule that amerex suggests.instead,we agree with the framework followed by the district courts that have applied new york law in this area.this framework includes three factors,none dispositive whether the appraisal sought is impractical or impossible that is,whether granting an insurer appraisal demand would result in prejudice to the insured party whether the parties engaged in negotiations over valuation of the loss prior to the appraisal demand and whether an appraisal is desirable or necessary under the circumstances.sr int l bus.ins,wl,at,quoting peck,wl,at internal numbering altered.
we conclude that the new york court of appeals would adopt this analytical framework for three reasons.first,these factors allow courts to determine whether waiver is appropriate based on the particular circumstances of each case,which is what new york appellate courts have interpreted the reasonableness inquiry to require,see chainless cycle,at,and which is the usual inquiry signified in the law by the term reasonableness.and the inconvenience of bringing suit is just one circumstance to be considered in determining whether a delay in demanding appraisal was unreasonable.sch.dist.of silver bow county globe republic ins.of.in some cases,the initiation of litigation may well be the appropriate event that triggers a party waiver of its appraisal rights.in other cases,that will not be so,particularly where investigation or mediation of the dispute is still ongoing when the litigation is filed.
second,the doctrine of waiver appropriately focuses on the actions or inaction of the party against whom waiver operates a waiver is the voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a known right,which is not created by negligence,oversight,or silence.plato const.emco tech const.dormitory auth.of state,dep t.amerex proposed rule undermines this principle.an adversary decision to initiate litigation is outside of the party control,thus taking the party rights out of its own hands and placing them into the hands of its adversary.similarly,while there may be instances where the initiation of litigation is the appropriate boundary for determining the timeliness of a demand,it can not be the default rule,as such a default would encourage the premature initiation of litigation in derogation of alternative dispute mechanisms such as appraisal and mediation.see terra,commonwealth ins.of,applying iowa law.
and third,the lynch court rigid rule is in the minority while many jurisdictions appear not to have reached this question,and some have done so only recently,see rogers state farm fire cas,so d,our research has discovered only a single case in kentucky that appears to follow a rule similar to the one announced in lynch.see continental ins.vallandingham gentry.unless the insurer asks for the arbitration or appraisal before suit brought sic,the failure to appraise is not a defense.even in kentucky,no case since has cited continental ins.for this or any other proposition.see upington commonwealth ins.of.moreover,at least one other court applying state law,besides those applying new york law cited above,has expressly noted the wisconsin rule and rejected it.see terra industries.at.
the lynch court itself relies on hayes allstate ins,cir.while the hayes court did state that a policy must expressly provide that no action may be maintained upon it until after the amount of loss is determined by appraisal in order for a appraisal demand to be effective,there is reason to question the continued authority of this decision.the hayes court,sitting in diversity,applied broad principles of indiana insurance law to reach its conclusion.id.but as the lynch court acknowledges,an indiana court has,rejected the rule that hayes appears to endorse,finding that a appraisal demand by the defendant did not result in waiver when no evidence of prejudice resulting from the delay in demanding appraisal was presented to the trial court.monroe guar.ins.backstage.we regard the indiana court interpretation of indiana law as more authoritative than the conflicting federal decision.
those courts that have addressed the issue have generally embraced a more flexible approach similar to the one utilized by federal district courts applying new york law.see rogers,so d at alabama monroe guar.ins,at indiana school dist,at montana hanby.cas,see also terra.at.given the scant authority in favor of the lynch court rule,the support for a more flexible rule expressed in the multiple other jurisdictions to have considered the question,and the rule other debilities cited above,we are confident that the new york courts would not join wisconsin in this respect.
applying the framework set forth above,we conclude that the excess insurers did not waive their appraisal rights by asserting them after amerex initiated litigation.the first factor,whether the appraisal demand would result in prejudice to the party,sr int l bus.ins,wl,at,must be assessed as of the time the demand is made,without the benefit of knowing how the appraisal unfolded after that demand.that the appraisal ultimately lasted three years is,therefore,of no moment for our analysis.viewing the excess insurers demand from that perspective,we see no reason to have expected that the appraisal process would be unduly burdensome for either party.amerex challenges of the panel ultimate valuation and the time taken to reach that valuation are merely criticisms of the appraisal process and results and do not provide a reason why the district court should have anticipated at the time the appraisal was demanded that the appraisal would prejudice amerex.had the appraisal been conducted more expeditiously,and reached a result more favorable to amerex,the prejudice amerex claims would not have occurred.nor is it clear that the actual appraisal process was more complex and than litigation would have been,particularly in light of the fact that litigation would likely have resulted in motion practice addressed to assorted coverage issues raised in the excess insurers answer before the ultimately dispositive valuation of the claim even commenced.
amerex argues that the long delay between the rack collapse and the appraisal demand suggested that the excess insurers appraisal demand would prejudice amerex.the argument is unconvincing.although the separation between the collapse and the appraisal demand was significant almost six years it is undisputed that much of the delay was due to amerex inaction.the excess insurers assert,and amerex does not dispute,that amerex refused to interact with the insurers between the date of the collapse and the presentation of its claim almost two years later.moreover,the insurers subsequent investigation included significant,apparently avoidable delays due to amerex failure to promptly produce documents necessary to the investigation.indeed,many of the excess insurers claims in mediation dealt with amerex failures to produce the information sought.
the second factor asks whether the parties have engaged in negotiations over valuation of the loss prior to the appraisal demand.sr int l bus.ins,wl,at.if so,a party appraisal demand in the midst of negotiations is likely to be timely.the excess insurers demand satisfies this test.that the insurers made a settlement offer just two weeks before amerex filed suit,while mediation was still in progress,demonstrates that negotiations were continuing when the lawsuit was filed.it was amerex,not the excess insurers,that terminated the mediation and settlement negotiations by initiating this action.although amerex claims that the appraisal demand was designed to deny it the opportunity to conduct discovery,in light of the evidence adduced above,we find no reason to conclude that the parties ongoing negotiations and the excess insurers previous investigation had been conducted for any purpose other than the fair resolution of amerex claims.
the final inquiry is whether an appraisal is desirable under the circumstances.id.the factors relevant to inquiry include,among other factors,whether the appraisal is likely to facilitate a speedier resolution of the dispute than would occur in the district court proceeding the expected expertise of an appraisal panel in making its valuation determinations and the complexity of the valuation.here,at the time the excess insurers made their demand,the district court expressed expectation was that the appraisal process would facilitate a prompt resolution to an extended,complicated,wholly factual dispute concerning the extent of amerex damages,and that the panel would be sufficiently expert to resolve the questions placed before it.it was eminently reasonable for the district court to conclude that,if the value of the claim could be authoritatively fixed,the parties might well be able to resolve the dispute by settlement,without the need to address legal issues regarding coverage.
all of these factors suggest that the appraisal was thus desirable under the circumstances when the demand was made.id.the district court expressly anticipated that the appraisal process would lead to a prompt resolution of the most basic dispute between the parties.given the parties own participation in selecting the members of the panel,the parties could help to ensure the panel expertise.moreover,the complexity of the valuation undertaken here is beyond dispute.the widely differing valuations of lost business income advanced by each party and the length of the investigations conducted by the primary insurer,the excess insurers,and the mediator suggest that determining the valuation of amerex loss is highly technical and.such complexity or lack thereof is precisely why determining the timeliness of an appraisal demand is such a affair.in cases where insurance companies have ample experience and the valuation investigation is routine such as damage to an insured house following a hurricane the reasonable period during which the parties can demand appraisal will likely be relatively short.see,sanchez prop,ins.of hartford,no.h,wl,holding that a near delay in making an appraisal demand was unreasonable on the facts of that case.but the reasonable length of time during which appraisal can be demanded correlates directly with the complexity and novelty of the valuation the more complex the valuation,the longer the period during which a party can assert its appraisal rights.
in light of the foregoing analysis,we conclude that,under new york law,the excess insurers did not waive their contractual appraisal rights,and that their demand for appraisal was timely.
ii.scope of appraisal 
amerex next contends that the district court should not have upheld the appraisal award because the panel improperly decided questions of law.amerex correctly identifies the limit to an appraisal panel authority under new york law.a basic proposition of insurance law provides that the scope of coverage provided by an insurance policy is a purely legal issue that can not be determined by an appraisal,which is l
