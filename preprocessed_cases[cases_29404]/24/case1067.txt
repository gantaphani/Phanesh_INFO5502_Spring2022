conoco appeals the district court decision to submit a series of grievances filed by the plaintiffs,the oil,chemical atomic workers international union and its local the union to arbitration.after staying the instant action pending the completion of arbitration,the district court issued an order explaining that it had not yet made a dispositive ruling on the issue of whether the grievances were arbitrable.we hold,consistent with developing case law,that the district court should have decided whether the grievances at issue were arbitrable before submitting them to arbitration.accordingly,we vacate the district court orders and remand the case to the district court.
background 
in and,the union filed a series of grievances against conoco challenging the company handling of job reductions at its ponca city,oklahoma refinery.the union alleged that conoco had hired a number of nonunion personnel to fill vacant positions and had thereby violated the provisions of three separate collective bargaining agreements governing three different groups refinery workers,technology workers,and clerical workers.
each agreement contains a management rights clause that sets forth certain functions that are solely the responsibility of management,aplt app.vol.i,at,including h iring,maintaining order,and discipline or discharge for just cause and the assignment of work subject only to other provisions of the agreement.see id.each management rights clause proceeds to list additional,functions in some detail.importantly,all of the clauses state that g rievances originating under the management rights clause are subject to the grievance procedure but can not be submitted to arbitration and no arbitrator has the authority to rule on the management rights clause with the exception of determination of just cause.id.at.
the union grievances proceeded through the initial stages outlined in the collective bargaining agreements.when they could not be resolved,the union requested arbitration.conoco objected,arguing that the grievances were governed by the management rights clauses and were therefore not arbitrable.
in july,the union filed this action.it alleged that conoco had refused to submit to arbitration,and it requested specific performance of the arbitration clauses in the collective bargaining agreements.conoco filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that the management rights clauses rendered the grievances.the district court denied conoco motion,reasoning that there were controverted issues of material fact as to the arbitrability of the grievances and stating that there would be a trial on the question.the court also ordered the parties to evaluate each individual grievance to determine whether each was subject to arbitration.
after hearing further arguments from the parties,the court entered an order finding that doubts regarding the arbitrability of plaintiffs grievances require that this case be submitted to arbitration.id.vol.ii,at district court order,filed may.conoco moved for reconsideration,and,on july,the district court entered an order reaffirming its original decision.
the court explained that it was not deciding the question of the whether the management rights clauses barred arbitration.according to the court,the parties could reargue that issue at the conclusion of arbitration 
plaintiff union respond s that to the extent the arbitrator has jurisdiction to decide a matter and does decide a matter,then his decision is binding unless it falls within the narrow exceptions that give the court the power to review.
the court agrees with plaintiffs analysis.the court order does not permit the arbitrator to decide whether a grievance falls within the management rights clause of the agreement,because any decision by the arbitrator affecting the question of arbitrability is not subject to the high level of deference suggested by conoco.the existence of a management rights clause in this case alters the otherwise applicable standard for reviewing an arbitrator decision as to whether the grievances alleged in this case are arbitrable.accordingly,the court decision to compel arbitration neither constitutes a dispositive ruling on this issue of arbitrability nor works a manifest injustice on conoco.

conoco then filed a motion with the district court requesting leave to file an interlocutory appeal.the district court denied the motion,and conoco then filed this appeal.
ii.discussion 
appellate jurisdiction 
in light of the district court denial of conoco request to certify its order as appealable,as well as its statement that it had not made a dispositive ruling on the issue of arbitrability,we must first consider whether we have appellate jurisdiction.as a general rule,this court has jurisdiction over only final orders,those that end the litigation on the merits and leave nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.coopers lybrand livesay,d quoting catlin united states.
however,in cases involving a district court order directing arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement subject to of the labor management relations act,the supreme court has established a particular rule of appellate jurisdiction.see united textile workers of,d.if the arbitration ordered by the district court is not merely a step in judicial enforcement of a claim nor auxiliary to a main proceeding,but the full relief sought,then the district court ruling constitutes a final decision within the meaning of.see also bottling of,soft drink brewery workers union,local,int l of teamsters,cir concluding that the district court order denying the plaintiff employer motion for summary judgment and directing arbitration was appealable because it den ied the only relief sought in the c ompany declaratory judgment action laborers int l union of,foster wheeler energy,cir finding appellate jurisdiction to review the district court determination that the parties were required to arbitrate a grievance international union,united auto.aerospace agric.implement workers of am.united screw bolt,cir because the district court has ordered enforcement of the arbitration provision in the collective bargaining agreement,a final decision has been made and it is appealable under.on the other hand,appellate jurisdiction is lacking if the order directing arbitration is made in the course of a continuing suit for other relief.zosky boyer,cir quoting rogers schering,cir 
like the plaintiff in,the union here seeks an order compelling specific performance of grievance arbitration clauses.by entering its may,order compelling the parties to submit to arbitration,the court granted the union the full relief sought.see,at.as we later explain in this opinion,the court should have first decided whether the grievances were arbitrable before ordering arbitration.but,as concluded in,at,the district court skipping that step and ordering arbitration at the outset does not deprive this court of jurisdiction.
we therefore conclude that the district court order requiring the parties to submit to arbitration constitutes a final order that we have jurisdiction to review.see generally university life ins.unimarc,cir noting that i f the appeal is postponed too long,the appellant may be deprived of a meaningful appellate review and the parties and the trial court harrowed by lengthy proceedings that could have been averted if the error on which they were founded had been corrected by the appellate court earlier.we therefore proceed to the merits of conoco appeal.
b.the district court refusal to issue a dispositive ruling on arbitrability 
on the merits,conoco argues that the district court postponement of a ruling on the arbitrability of the grievances violates established principles regarding the construction of collective bargaining agreements,depriving it of its right to a judicial determination of that issue.the union responds that conoco has not been deprived of such a determination but instead must simply wait until the conclusion of the arbitration proceedings to receive it.
