plaintiff filed this action against her former employer and three employees,alleging she was constructively discharged and subjected to discrimination and harassment based on race and sex.the employer and two of the employees filed a motion to compel arbitration pursuant to an arbitration agreement between plaintiff and the employer.plaintiff opposed the motion,arguing the agreement was unconscionable.the trial court ruled in plaintiff favor and denied the motion.defendants appealed.
we conclude the trial court erred.although the arbitration agreement was a contract of adhesion,it was not substantively unconscionable.in particular,we do not find unconscionable a provision in the arbitration agreement allowing either party to seek provisional remedies such as a temporary restraining order or an injunction in court.nor is any other provision substantively unconscionable.we therefore reverse the order denying the motion to compel arbitration.
background 
the facts and allegations in this appeal are taken from the complaint and the declarations and exhibits submitted in connection with the motion to compel arbitration.

motion to compel arbitration 
on september,forever,forever logistics,llc,darlene yu,and herber corleto collectively defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration of plaintiff claims pursuant to the federal arbitration act faa and the california arbitration act caa code civ,all undesignated section references are to the code of civil procedure.attached to the motion was an arbitration agreement agreement dated november,and bearing a signature reading,maribel baltazar.in their supporting papers,defendants argued that the agreement satisfied the arbitration standards set forth in armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th.
plaintiff filed an opposition,asserting the agreement was unconscionable.in a supporting declaration,plaintiff stated that on november,she had an interview at the forever warehouse in downtown los angeles.when she arrived,she was greeted by a korean man,chung,who introduced himself and handed her an employment application.the application consisted of pages,several of which required plaintiff signature at the bottom of the page.the signature lines were highlighted in yellow.page was entitled,agreement to arbitrate.the agreement continued onto the ninth page,at the bottom of which was a yellow highlighted signature line.plaintiff signed all of the signature lines in the application with the exception of the one for the agreement.she handed the application to chung.he reviewed the application and gave it back to her,saying she had to sign the agreement.plaintiff shook her head,indicating she would not do so.chung took the application and spoke to another forever employee,shin.the men spoke in korean,and plaintiff did not understand what they said.eventually,shin told plaintiff,sign it or no job.plaintiff had no other choice but to sign the agreement.after plaintiff signed the agreement,she was hired and started to work that day.
the motion to compel arbitration came on for hearing on october.the trial court denied the motion,stating the agreement was unconscionable.the trial court found that the agreement was substantively unconscionable because it required the arbitration of employee but not employer claims,it gave forever the right to take all necessary steps to protect its trade secrets or other confidential information,and it mandated arbitration even if the agreement was unenforceable.
defendants appealed.
discussion 
whether an arbitration provision is unconscionable is ultimately a question of law.on appeal,when the extrinsic evidence is undisputed,as it is here,we review the contract de novo to determine unconscionability.suh superior court th,citations omitted accord,mercuro superior court th,mercuro.
we interpret the agreement in light of its plain meaning under the plain meaning rule,courts give the words of the contract their usual and ordinary meaning w e interpret the words in their ordinary sense,according to the plain meaning a layperson would attach to them.valencia smyth th,citations omitted.
as a preliminary matter,the parties disagree as to whether the agreement is governed by the faa or the caa.the agreement is silent on the issue.volt info.sciences leland stanford,fn.parties may adopt procedural provisions of caa in arbitration agreement otherwise governed by faa valencia smyth,supra,th at pp,faa procedural provisions do not apply in state court unless arbitration agreement expressly adopts them.
the faa applies to a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce,italics added.the united states supreme court has interpreted the term involving commerce in the faa as the functional equivalent of the more familiar term affecting commerce words of art that ordinarily signal the broadest permissible exercise of congress commerce clause power because the statute provides for the enforcement of arbitration agreements within the full reach of the commerce clause,it is perfectly clear that the faa encompasses a wider range of transactions than those actually in commerce that is,within the flow of interstate commerce,congress commerce clause power may be exercised in individual cases without showing any specific effect upon interstate commerce if in the aggregate the economic activity in question would represent a general practice subject to federal control.only that general practice need bear on interstate commerce in a substantial way.hedges carrigan th,citations omitted.
in woolls superior court th,the court of appeal addressed whether the faa governed a dispute between a homeowner renovating his single family home and the contractor retained to perform the work.the court of appeal stated because the contractor has not presented a factual record to establish that the parties agreement involves interstate commerce,his reliance on hedges carrigan,supra,th is misplaced.hedges found an agreement to purchase a single family residence was a contract which evidenced a transaction involving commerce within the meaning of the faa.there,the evidence showed,t he anticipated financing involved the use of a federal housing administration home loan which is subject to the jurisdiction of the united states department of housing and urban development headquartered in washington,further,the various copyrighted forms used by the parties and their brokers could only be utilized by members of the national association of realtors.unlike the showing made in cases such as hedges,the contractor has not presented any facts to show the instant transaction involved interstate commerce.this case is akin to steele collagen th,wherein the party asserting the application of the faa made no attempt to establish its actions fell within the ambit of federal law.we conclude the contractor failed to meet his burden of establishing the faa applies woolls superior court,at pp,citations omitted see hoover american income life ins.th,party seeking to compel arbitration has burden of proving that underlying agreement involves interstate commerce shepard edward mackay enterprises,th,discussing whether faa applies in context of real estate transactions.
in the present case,defendants have offered no evidence showing that plaintiff employment or any pertinent transaction involved interstate commerce,nor have they cited anything in the record to that effect.instead,they contend the faa governs an arbitration agreement unless the parties expressly opt out of its coverage.for that proposition,defendants rely solely on wolsey,foodmaker,cir.but wolsey addressed whether the terms of the parties contract constituted an agreement to arbitrate under the faa.the ninth circuit held that the parties dispute resolution procedures created an enforceable arbitration agreement under the faa even though the arbitrators decision was nonbinding.see wolsey,at pp.the ninth circuit then discussed whether the agreement was governed by the procedural provisions of the caa in light of the following contractual language t his agreement shall be interpreted and construed under the laws of the state of california,id.at.the court concluded that california arbitration provisions did not apply.id.at pp.that aspect of wolsey has been rejected by our supreme court.see cronus investments,concierge services cal th,fn,followed in mastick td ameritrade,th,see also mount diablo medical center health net of california,th,disagreeing with wolsey analysis valencia smyth,supra,th at pp,caa procedural provisions apply in state court unless arbitration agreement expressly adopts faa procedural provisions.
in sum,wolsey does not support the application of the faa in this case and there is no evidence that plaintiff employment or any relevant transaction involved interstate commerce.we therefore conclude the agreement is governed by the caa.
on appeal,defendants contend the agreement is not unconscionable and should be enforced.plaintiff argues in favor of the trial court ruling.we conclude the agreement is not substantively unconscionable in any respect and reverse the trial court.
doctrine of unconscionability 
in,the legislature enacted civil code section,which codified the principle that a court can refuse to enforce an unconscionable provision in a contract as section,subdivision a states if the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract,or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause,or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.because unconscionability is a reason for refusing to enforce contracts generally,it is also a valid reason for refusing to enforce an arbitration agreement under the caa,which provides that arbitration agreements are valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.the united states supreme court,in interpreting the same language found in section of the faa,recognized that generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements 
u nconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element,the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,the latter on overly harsh or results the prevailing view is that procedural and substantive unconscionability must both be present in order for a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability.but they need not be present in the same degree t he more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,supra,cal th at,citations omitted accord,bruni didion th.the party resisting arbitration bears the burden of proving unconscionability.pinnacle museum tower pinnacle market development us,llc cal th.
the procedural element of unconscionability focuses on two factors oppression and surprise oppression arises from an inequality of bargaining power which results in no real negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice.surprise involves the extent to which the supposedly terms of the bargain are hidden in a prolix printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce the disputed terms.bruni didion,supra,th at.
of course,simply because a provision within a contract of adhesion is not read or understood by the nondrafting party does not justify a refusal to enforce it.the term may only be denied enforcement if it is also substantively unreasonable substantive unconscionability focuses on whether the provision is overly harsh or and is shown if the disputed provision of the contract falls outside the reasonable expectations of the nondrafting party or is unduly oppressive.where a party with superior bargaining power has imposed contractual terms on another,courts must carefully assess claims that one or more of these provisions are and unreasonable.gutierrez autowest,th,citations omitted.
substantive unconscionability pertains to the fairness of an agreement actual terms and to assessments of whether they are overly harsh or a contract term is not substantively unconscionable when it merely gives one side a greater benefit rather,the term must be so as to shock the conscience.pinnacle museum tower pinnacle market development us,llc,supra,cal th at,citations omitted,italics added.simply put,the contract term must be either overly harsh or so as to shock the conscience.see id.at,citing hour fitness,superior court th,substantive element traditionally involves contract terms that are so as to shock the conscience,or that impose harsh or oppressive terms italics added.
b.the agreement 
page of the employment application began as follows and continued onto the ninth page 
agreement to arbitrate 
for california stores only 
this agreement to arbitrate hereinafter agreement is entered into by and between forever,and its subsidiary and affiliated companies,and each of their officers,directors,agents,benefit plans,insurers,successors,and assigns hereinafter collectively the company and handwritten name of plaintiff,hereinafter employee located at warehouse 
it is the desire of the parties to this agreement that,whenever possible,disputes relating to employment matters will be resolved in an expeditious manner.each of the parties hereto is voluntarily entering into the agreement in order to gain the benefits of a speedy,impartial procedure.
the company and employee mutually agree that any dispute or controversy arising out of or in any way related to any dispute,as defined herein,shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration.such arbitration shall be held in los angeles,california pursuant to the model rules for arbitration of employment disputes of the american arbitration association then in effect.
for purposes of this agreement,the term disputes means and includes any claim or action arising out of or in any way related to the hire,employment,remuneration,separation or termination of employee.the potential disputes which the parties agree to arbitrate,pursuant to this agreement,include but are not limited to claims for wages or other compensation due claims for breach of any employment contract or covenant express or implied claims for unlawful discrimination,retaliation or harassment including,but not limited to,claims based on employment benefits except where an employee benefit or pension plan contains a claims procedure which expressly provides for a final and binding arbitration procedure different from this one,and disputes arising out of or relating to the termination of the employment relationship between the parties,whether based on common law or statute,regulation,or ordinance.
each of the parties voluntarily and irrevocably waives any and all rights to have any dispute heard or resolved in any forum other than through arbitration as provided herein.this waiver specifically includes,but is not limited to,any right to trial by jury.
this agreement does not cover claims that employee my have for worker compensation benefits or unemployment compensation benefits 
pursuant to california code of civil procedure either party hereto may apply to a california court for any provisional remedy,including a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.

the promises of the parties herein to arbitrate differences,rather than litigate them before courts or other bodies,provide consideration for each other.capital letters,underscoring,and boldface in original.
at the bottom of page was a line for the employee signature and a line for the date.
procedural unconscionability 
because plaintiff was required to sign the agreement as a condition of employment,was unable to negotiate the terms of the agreement,and had no meaningful choice in the matter,the agreement was oppressive and procedurally unconscionable.see ajamian,th,martinez master protection th.but the agreement was not hidden in a prolix printed form drafted by forever bruni didion,supra,th at,italics added and therefore did not involve an element of surprise.on the contrary,the agreement was prominently featured as part of the employment application,plaintiff read the agreement when filling out the application,and,having read the agreement,initially refused to sign it.
substantive unconscionability 
plaintiff contends the agreement is substantively unconscionable in four respects.we discuss them in turn.
unilateral arbitration 
an arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable if employees are required to submit their disputes to arbitration while the employer remains free to pursue its claims in any forum.see armendariz foundation health psychcare services,supra,cal th at pp.kinney united healthcare services,th.
here,plaintiff cites the examples of disputes set forth in the agreement fourth paragraph and argues that forever did not have to submit its disputes to arbitration.but the list of examples claims for wages or other compensation due claims for breach of any employment contract or covenant express or implied claims for unlawful discrimination,retaliation or harassment albeit limited to causes of action that only an employee would bring,is prefaced by include but are not limited to,indicating the list is not exclusive.original italics fitz ncr th,fitz where arbitration agreement listed examples of covered disputes,all of which were employee claims,employer was expressly permitted to seek judicial resolution of disputes involving confidentiality and noncompete agreements,and discovery was significantly curtailed,trial court properly found agreement unconscionable.
the agreement,when read as a whole,leaves no doubt that forever must submit its disputes to final and binding arbitration.for instance,the agreement second paragraph states in part each of the parties hereto is voluntarily entering into the agreement in order to gain the benefits of a speedy,impartial procedure.italics added.in the third paragraph,the agreement provides the company and employee mutually agree that any dispute or controversy arising out of or in any way related to any dispute shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration.italics added.the term dispute is defined as any claim or action arising out of or in any way related to the hire,employment,remuneration,separation or termination of employee.that definition is sufficiently broad to encompass any claim forever might have against an employee.the paragraph immediately following the list of examples states in boldface each of the parties voluntarily and irrevocably waives any and all rights to have any dispute heard or resolved in any forum other than through arbitration as provided herein.this waiver specifically includes,but is not limited to,any right to trial by jury.italics added.and both parties promise d to arbitrate differences,rather than litigate them before courts or other bodies.
thus,forever and its employees are bound to submit their disputes to final and binding arbitration.the agreement is bilateral,not unilateral.
availability of provisional relief 
the agreement provides pursuant to california code of civil procedure either party hereto may apply to a california court for any provisional remedy,including a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.section,subdivision b,is part of the caa.it states a party to an arbitration agreement may file in the court in the county in which an arbitration proceeding is pending,or if an arbitration proceeding has not commenced,in any proper court,an application for a provisional remedy in connection with an arbitrable controversy,but only upon the ground that the award to which the applicant may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual without provisional relief.italics added.section defines provisional remedy to include p reliminary injunctions and temporary restraining orders,subd.a.it was enacted primarily to allow a party to an arbitration or subject to an arbitration agreement to obtain provisional judicial remedies without waiving the right to arbitrate,as some early cases had suggested.stirlen supercuts,th,stirlen.plaintiff contends the agreement incorporation of section is unconscionable.we disagree.
in stirlen,supra,th,the employer exempted from arbitration a ny action initiated by the company seeking specific performance or injunctive or other equitable relief in connection with any breach or violation of its intellectual property rights.stirlen,at see mercuro,supra,th at pp.discussing stirlen.the arbitration agreement also limited the parties remedies to a money award not to exceed the amount of actual damages for breach of contract and excluded any other remedy at law or in equity,including but not limited to other money damages,exemplary damages,specific performance,injunctive relief.stirlen,at.
the court of appeal concluded that the agreement lack of mutuality was unconscionable,explaining one of the most significant discrepancies,of course,is the unilateral restriction on employee remedies and the nature of the rights employees are deprived of in this manner.while supercuts is deprived of no common law or statutory remedies that may be available to it under the intellectual property provisions of the employment contract,remedies available to employees in employment disputes are severely curtailed.not only are employees denied punitive damages for tort claims,they are also denied relief for statutory claims supercuts arbitration clause not only deprives employees of the exemplary damages and equitable relief available under some federal statutes,but deprives them as well of the reasonable attorney fees,including litigation expenses,and costs,that prevailing parties can obtain under those statutes the only remedy left to employees actual damages for breach of contract may bear no relation whatsoever to the extent of the wrong and the magnitude of the injuries suffered at the hands of the employer.this would amount to denial of the underlying cause of action,which would be preserved in name only.stirlen,supra,th at pp.
the court continued the mandatory arbitration requirement can only realistically be seen as applying primarily if not exclusively to claims arising out of the termination of employment,which are virtually certain to be filed against,not by,supercuts.supercuts identifies no provision of the employment contract and no statute likely to give rise to a claim supercuts would be compelled to submit to arbitration.the only employment disputes likely to be initiated by supercuts such as claims that an employee violated a agreement or divulged confidential information need not be arbitrated.in short,the arbitration clause provides the employer more rights and greater remedies than would otherwise be available and concomitantly deprives employees of significant rights and remedies they would normally enjoy.stirlen,supra,th at pp,italics added.
in mercuro,supra,th,t he arbitration agreement specifically cover ed claims for breach of express or implied contracts or covenants,tort claims,claims of discrimination based on race,sex,age or disability,and claims for violation of any federal,state or other governmental constitution,statute,ordinance,regulation or public policy.thus the agreement required arbitration of the claims employees were most likely to bring against the employer.on the other hand,the agreement specifically exclude d claims for injunctive other equitable relief for intellectual property violations,unfair competition the use unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets or confidential information thus the agreement exempt ed from arbitration the claims the employer was most likely to bring against its employees.id.at pp,italics added.the court of appeal concluded that the lack of mutuality rendered the arbitration agreement unconscionable.id.at.
in fitz,supra,th,an employer informed its employees about a new arbitration policy by sending them a brochure.a letter accompanying the brochure stated that the new policy would be used to settle concerns over almost anything at work,ranging from disagreements over assignments to perceived discriminatory treatment.id.at.but the arbitration policy was not to be used to resolve disputes over agreements or intellectual property rights.id.at,italics added.relying on stirlen,supra,th at pages and see fitz,at pp,the court of appeal concluded that the lack of mutuality was unconscionable,saying an agreement may be unfairly if it compels arbitration of the claims more likely to be brought by the weaker party but exempts from arbitration the types of claims that are more likely to be brought by the stronger party the employer asserts that the arbitration policy is completely bilateral because the policy does not carve out particular types of claims where employees are required to arbitrate,but the company is permitted to seek redress for the same claim in a judicial forum the employer states that both the company and an employee may submit disputes regarding noncompete agreements and intellectual property rights to the courts.though the employer cites cases where employees have filed actions against employers over noncompete agreements and intellectual property claims,it is far more often the case that employers,not employees,will file such claims 
the arbitration policy is unfairly because it compels arbitration of the claims more likely to be brought by an employee,the weaker party,but exempts from arbitration the types of claims that are more likely to be brought by the employer,the stronger party the arbitration policy fails to overcome the armendariz threshold,which states that arbitration agreements imposed in adhesive contexts lack basic fairness if they require one party but not the other to arbitrate all claims arising out of the same transaction or occurrence for example,in a wrongful termination dispute where the employee claims age discrimination and the employer argues the employee was fired for divulging trade secrets to a competitor,the employee is required to arbitrate her claim while the employer is permitted to seek judicial review.fitz,supra,th at pp,citation omitted.
we agree with stirlen,mercuro,and fitz but not with the analysis of mutuality in trivedi curexo technology th trivedi.there,an arbitration agreement provided in part p rovisional injunctive relief may,but need not,be sought in a court of law while arbitration proceedings are pending,and any provisional injunctive relief granted by such court shall remain effective until the matter is finally determined by the arbitrator.trivedi,at.the court of appeal concluded that the language authorizing provisional injunctive relief was coextensive with section of the caa.trivedi,at pp.nevertheless,the court found the clause unconscionable,reasoning that allowing the parties access to the courts only for injunctive relief favors the employer,because it is more likely that the employer would seek injunctive relief.while the trial judge did not cite authority supporting this conclusion,it is not a novel or unsupportable proposition.id.at.the court of appeal cited mercuro and fitz as support for the trial
