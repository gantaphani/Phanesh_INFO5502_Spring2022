in this appeal,the california correctional peace officers association ccpoa claims that the superior court erred in vacating an arbitrator award on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded her powers in making the award.code civ,subd.a.
an arbitrator exceeds his or her powers if the arbitration award violates a statutory right or otherwise violates a public policy.jordan department of motor vehicles th,d.that occurred here,as we will explain in the published part of this opinion,when the arbitrator determined that a written collective bargaining memorandum of understanding mou between ccpoa and the department of personnel administration dpa did not comport with the parties actual agreement.
the arbitrator reformed the mou after it had been ratified and approved by the legislature pursuant to the ralph dills act dills act,formerly known as the state relations act,et.in changing the terms of the mou after it was approved by the legislature,the arbitrator exceeded her powers by violating the dills act and the important public policy of legislative oversight of state employee contracts.
accordingly,we shall affirm the superior court order granting dpa petition to vacate the arbitration award.
in the unpublished part of our opinion,we address ccpoa other arguments,which are of no benefit to ccpoa in light of our conclusion that the award exceeded the arbitrator power.
this appeal arises from a dispute concerning the terms of an mou negotiated in between dpa and ccpoa,which is the exclusive representative for employees in bargaining unit.the dispute centers on section of the mou concerning the release time bank rtb,which permits employees to contribute hours of paid leave for the use of other employees to conduct bona fide ccpoa business.
the ground rules governing the contract negotiations provided in pertinent part.all proposals by both parties shall be made by the respective chief negotiators only at the master bargaining table and shall be reduced to writing before any tentative agreements are reached.when a proposal is passed to modify or change the existing bargaining unit mou language,the parties agree to indicate new language by underlining additions to the mou.when a proposal is passed to delete language from the existing mou,the parties agree to indicate language proposed to be deleted by placing strikeouts through the existing mou language.oral or written understandings reached outside the master bargaining table shall not bind either side nor shall such understandings constitute bargaining history for any proposal.
on september,ccpoa passed a proposal regarding section a of the mou.as proposed by ccpoa,accepted by dpa,and memorialized in the mou,section a states a ccpoa release time bank shall be established to which employees may contribute any earned leave credits,with the exception of sick leave.the contributions shall be in two or more hour increments.contributions in fractions of hours will not be allowed.credit may not be transferred between departments.contributions to the release time bank shall be computed once a month,provided they are received by the second friday of that month.
prior contracts entered into by ccpoa and dpa,and approved by the legislature,included a cap on accumulated leave in the rtb.ccpoa proposal struck the following language from section a an employee may only make one donation between july and december,and one donation between january and june,during the contract year.a maximum of ten thousand hours may be credited and used by ccpoa during the above contract year.the ten thousand hours shall be divided in proportion to each department unit membership,hundred hours,cdc and hundred hours,cya.
thus,the parties not only eliminated from section a the limitations on contributions to the rtb and the manner in which the cap was split between departments,they eliminated the cap altogether.however,ccpoa did not submit a written proposal to eliminate a similar cap in section b,which sets forth the procedures for employees to contribute hours of leave to the rtb.section b of the mou states in relevant part in no case shall ccpoa accumulate or use more than ten thousand cto vacation hours from the bank during the term of this mou.the term of the mou is from july,through july.
pursuant to the dills act,the mou was submitted to the legislature for its approval.the enrolled bill report states the mou will p rovide a mutually agreed upon amount of employee release time annually for activity related to collective bargaining dpa,enrolled bill on bill january.there is no mention of eliminating the cap.
on may,dpa wrote a letter to ccpoa,stating a review of the rtb between and disclosed that the release time used by employees exceeded the limits set forth in section b of the mou.dpa said our review has shown that ccpoa has used a total of hours cdc and ya combined since the enactment of the current mou,or hours more than the hours authorized by section.the amount of release time used exceeds the limits of the clear language contained in section.obviously,both parties ccpoa and the state have been remiss in monitoring the use of section.nevertheless,the hour cap established in section has been greatly exceeded and there is now no authority to continue releasing ccpoa representatives under this section of the mou.therefore,any future request for both donations and release time pursuant to section must be denied,and any ccpoa representative currently on section release time must return to state employment no later than june.
contending the cap did not apply,ccpoa demanded immediate arbitration of the matter,pursuant to the arbitration provision of the mou.
at the arbitration hearing,ccpoa asserted that the parties agreed to eliminate the cap but,due to a scrivener error,they modified only section a and neglected to modify section b.ccpoa presented evidence that in,during a period when there was no collective bargaining agreement in place,dpa permitted ccpoa to accumulate more than release time hours in the rtb.ccpoa wanted to continue this practice and drafted a side letter to section,in which the parties agreed to not enforce the caps of,cdc,and cya hours,and will continue to allow employees to make more than one contribution in either of the two periods of time.dpa and ccpoa signed the side letter on september.according to ccpoa,the parties intended to incorporate the side letter agreement into the mou by amending the terms of the mou to eliminate the cap.
dpa responded that the side letter agreement no longer was relevant in light of the parties subsequent contrary agreement in the mou.they agreed only to eliminate the departmental limits between the release time available for cdc and cya,which limits existed in prior agreements,but did not address the cap in section b.according to dpa,it might have been remiss in enforcing the cap in the past but that did not preclude it from insisting on compliance with the contract language,which unambiguously establishes a cap.
ccpoa chief negotiator,steve weiss,testified that it was the union intent to remove the cap and,in attempting to do so,he shared the side letter agreement with the negotiators.ccpoa passed the proposal with the language about a cap stricken out of section a,and after a brief discussion off the record,the parties signed the tentative agreement.according to weiss,he did not realize that the language about a cap appeared in the contract twice,and he erred in failing to remove it from section b.
linda buzzini,the lead spokesperson for dpa,testified that the parties discussed removing the cap she recalled agreeing to ccpoa demand,and the proposal eliminating the cap from a reflected their agreement.buzzini could not recall if these discussions,which are not reflected in the bargaining notes,occurred away from the bargaining table.she testified that she never received a proposal from ccpoa about section b.
the arbitrator ruled that the weight of the evidence disclosed the parties mutually agreed,off the record but at the bargaining table,to remove the cap.the arbitrator found that it was highly unusual in a vigorously contested case like this to have the spokespers
