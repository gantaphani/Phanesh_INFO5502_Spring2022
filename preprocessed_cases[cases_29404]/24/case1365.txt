this case involves claims of wrongful death of decedent jerome birl,elder abuse,and related causes of action brought against a nursing home facility and its owner.the issue on appeal is whether an arbitration clause should apply.
defendants heritage care,llc,dba heritage rehabilitation center,and roy martinez hereinafter collectively referred to as heritage appeal from the trial court denial of their petition to compel arbitration of the claims made by plaintiffs areatha birl wife,joyce ashley daughter and regina daughter.we conclude that because the other codefendants in the action the hospital and doctors are third parties unaffected by this arbitration agreement,and the plaintiffs alleged several causes of action in their individual capacity as third parties not bound by the arbitration agreement,the trial court did not misapply the law code civ,subd.c or abuse its broad discretion in refusing to enforce the arbitration agreement to avoid the possibility of conflicting rulings on common issues of law or fact 
therefore,we reject heritage position that would have resulted in severing claims against it from claims against other defendants and permitted only heritage to defend in an arbitration context.we thus affirm the trial court order.
factual and procedural summary 
as alleged in the first amended complaint,in march of,birl underwent surgery at the kaiser permanente hospital at sunset hereinafter,kaiser for a ventricular shunt replacement.approximately a month later,even though birl still needed acute hospital care,he was transferred to the brier oak terrace care center nursing facility where he developed an infection from alleged improper care.he was then readmitted to kaiser.birl was then transferred to the fountain view subacute and nursing center,where he was again allegedly improperly cared for and developed another infection.he was then transferred back to kaiser emergency room.he remained at the hospital for several days until may,when he was discharged and then admitted to the heritage nursing facility.
the staff at heritage knew,based on birl medical history and the assessments performed on him there,that he was at high risk for infection,dehydration,malnutrition,and pressure ulcers if he was not provided with the necessary supervision,care,and services.as further alleged in the complaint,heritage personnel nonetheless continually failed to keep birl hydrated and failed to provide him with needed nutrition.as a result,his condition further deteriorated.on may,when birl family visited him,they found him unresponsive and his breathing very shallow.the staff did nothing to attend to him or to assess his condition.
birl was transported by ambulance to hospital.when he arrived at the emergency room,he was dehydrated,malnourished,and septic.birl also had developed a decubitus pressure ulcer,which became infected because it had gone untreated.birl died later that day.
as a member of kaiser health care plan,birl received physician services from doctors working for southern california permanente medical group scpmg,which is a kaiser affiliate.doctors provided services to birl at each of the residential nursing facilities to which he was sent,including heritage.
however,as alleged in the complaint,while birl was a patient at heritage,the doctors breached the duty of care owed to him,as established in various federal and state nursing home laws and regulations.for example,the doctors allegedly failed to take responsibility for birl medical treatment and improperly delegated such responsibility to nonphysician personnel at heritage.after improperly delegating responsibility for determining the level of medical care,the doctors also failed to supervise the care provided to birl.the doctors also failed to inform birl or his legal representative of his health status,and failed to participate in preparing and reviewing a care plan for birl and in monitoring and revising such a plan.
moreover,as alleged in the complaint,the doctors knew that the department of health services had cited heritage for serious deficiencies in patient care in violation of various laws,and they knew that birl showed signs of suffering from the same type of patient neglect for which heritage had previously been cited.nonetheless,the doctors continued to fail to properly supervise birl care and failed to report the signs of such neglect to the appropriate government agency,as required by laws addressing elder abuse and neglect issues.
the first amended complaint,filed by birl wife and adult daughters,alleged causes of action against kaiser and its various entities and against the three residential nursing facilities,including heritage.the three plaintiffs sued in three distinct behalf of birl as successors in interest,as persons having a statutory right to pursue a wrongful death action,and as individuals for breach of duties owed to them personally.
in their capacity as successors in interest,birl wife and daughters alleged elder abuse first cause of action,willful misconduct second cause of action,negligence fourth cause of action,breach of contract sixth cause of action,fraud seventh cause of action,unfair business practices eighth cause of action,and breach of statutory duties and resident rights ninth cause of action.in their capacity as persons entitled to sue for the wrongful death of another,birl wife and daughters alleged wrongful death fifth cause of action and pursued damages for their loss of birl love,companionship,affection,and society.in their individual capacities as plaintiffs to whom heritage breached duties owed to them personally,birl wife alleged loss of consortium cause of action,and his wife and daughters alleged the negligent infliction of emotional distress cause of action.
regarding the procedural status of the various defendants,neither the brier oak terrace care center nor the fountain view subacute and nursing center had an arbitration agreement with birl those defendants filed answers to the complaint,and the action is proceeding to a jury trial.the defendants filed a petition to compel arbitration,which the trial court denied,and they have not appealed that order.they filed an answer to the complaint,and the action apparently will proceed to a jury trial.
heritage filed a petition to compel arbitration,but only as to some of the causes of action alleged.heritage did not move to compel arbitration as to the claims for wrongful death fifth cause of action and breach of statutory duties and resident rights ninth cause of action.those causes of action apparently will proceed to trial regardless of the outcome of the present appeal.
however,heritage did petition the court to order arbitration on the following causes of action,which are the subject to the present appeal the successor in interest claims of elder abuse first cause of action,willful misconduct second cause of action,negligence fourth cause of action,breach of contract sixth cause of action,fraud seventh cause of action,and unfair business practices eighth cause of action,as well as the individual claims for loss of consortium cause of action,and negligent infliction of emotional distress cause of action.
after a hearing on february,the trial court denied heritage petition to compel arbitration.the arbitration agreement had been signed on may,by birl wife,who wrote after her signature poa indicating power of attorney and above a line stating she was the resident.the trial court denied the petition to compel arbitration on two separate grounds.first,court exercised its discretion under section,subdivision c,and refused to enforce the arbitration agreement to avoid the possibility of conflicting rulings on common issues of law or fact.second,the court determined that heritage arbitration agreement did not conform to certain legal requirements regarding the language,format,and font,as required by health and safety code section,and as implemented by california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision d.
