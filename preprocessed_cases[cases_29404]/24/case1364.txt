richard corona appeals from postjudgment orders confirming an arbitration award providing his former spouse claire corona with certain distributions and sales proceeds from a formerly community property asset ordering him to pay plus interest as his share of claire federal and state income tax obligation and imposing in sanctions for taking an unreasonable position in connection with claire request for unpaid support in the form of specified housing costs.with respect to the order confirming arbitration,richard contends the arbitrator impermissibly modified the parties final judgment in their dissolution action and thus exceeded his authority by,inter alia,forcing a liquidation of claire interest in a general partnership in lieu of continued spousal support.richard further contends the court erred by requiring him to pay an unnecessary and excess amount of claire tax liability due to her chosen tax filing status.finally,richard contends the court abused its discretion by ordering him to pay sanctions.
we grant claire motion to dismiss richard appeal from the family court order confirming the arbitration award because the order is interlocutory.otherwise,we affirm the trial court orders.
factual and procedural background 
in,in connection with the dissolution of their marriage,richard and claire entered into a marital settlement agreement msa,which was incorporated into a supplemental judgment.among other things,the msa addressed the parties percent community interest in an office complex known as mission grove properties the mission property,awarding richard a separate interest of percent and claire a separate interest of percent to be held as tenants in common.the msa also sets out richard spousal support obligations,which shall terminate upon the death of husband or the death of wife,whichever occurs first,but shall not terminate upon wife remarriage.
under the msa,richard is required to pay claire per month for support and maintenance commencing september,through and until december.additionally,the msa obligates richard to pay a portion of claire income taxes he shall pay a sum equal to of wife federal and state income tax obligation directly attributable to wife receipt of spousal support paid by husband in the tax years through,such income tax payable either to wife or on behalf of wife,at husband election,which shall be as and for spousal support.
the msa addresses claire support after december,as follows commencing january,and continuing each month thereafter,husband shall only pay support and maintenance to wife in a sum as is necessary,if at all,to assure that wife monthly income,including that which wife derives from her and percent interest in mission grove properties,at least equals the sum of plus wife housing costs for the renaissance residence claire condominium as those housing costs are hereinabove defined.claire housing costs were defined in the msa as mortgage principal,mortgage interest,property taxes,and homeowner fees on the renaissance residence.with respect to the provision for support after december,the msa states such support is based upon the fact that wife will have no financial responsibility for the children of the parties,who will be well beyond minority and upon the fact that this section provides for the continuity of spousal support payable to wife irrespective of her remarriage.
a.the arbitration 
disputes arose between the parties,and in they agreed to submit various issues to binding arbitration before an identified arbitrator.that arbitrator was replaced in november and following hearings,the arbitrator in may issued an interim arbitration award relating to claire entitlement to distributions or proceeds from a refinance and sale of the mission property.the arbitrator declined to award claire a conveyance of title to the mission property.however,he found she was entitled to a percent share of net distributions made to richard or for his benefit from the refinancing.as to that award,the arbitrator stated,the amount,if any,to be distributed to claire would have to be based upon an accounting,which was not stipulated to be before the undersigned.the arbitrator further determined that if distributions from the refinancing were made to richard,claire was entitled to a distribution equaling percent of richard original percent interest in the net sale proceeds of the mission property.the arbitrator concluded that by stipulation and consent,claire distribution from the net sale proceeds would terminate her spousal support derived from the net rental income provision in the msa.the arbitrator again stated that the amount of such proceeds would have to be based on a later accounting that he was not authorized to conduct.
claire thereafter petitioned to confirm and enter judgment on the interim arbitration award.richard responded by claiming the arbitrator had exceeded his power and that the award constituted a material modification of the msa and final judgment of dissolution.he argued the msa express terms prevented the arbitrator from implying new,material terms liquidating claire interest in the mission property partnership or awarding her distributions generated in,because the msa stated she would not receive distributions from that property until.according to richard,the award undermined the msa by modifying its spousal support provisions and liquidating claire interest as of without terminating or crediting support paid by richard after that time.richard asked the court to deny claire petition and vacate the award.
in august,the arbitrator issued a final award addressing the bifurcated issue of attorney fees and costs.claire thereafter filed an amended petition to confirm the final award as well as a motion for an accounting to establish the amount of the arbitrator award and for an order that richard pay certain income taxes,arrears and sanctions that were the subject of a prior court ruling discussed post.
orders to show cause re claire income taxes and housing costs 
while the arbitration proceedings were pending,claire in april filed an order to show cause asking the trial court to determine richard share of her income tax liability and appoint a special master to make a recommendation on other extras assertedly due her under the msa,including payments for her telephone long distance bills and automobile insurance.claire maintained her income tax liability was more complex than in prior years because she had been awarded arrears and interest by the arbitrator,and she presented a letter from her accountant,james helfand,explaining that she had incurred in tax liability,of which was richard share.richard opposed the motion,asserting that claire claim was based on an unfiled tax return as well as hearsay statements,unqualified legal opinions,and incompetent conclusions from helfand.in part,he argued he was entitled to the full benefit of claire schedule a itemized deductions form,schedule a in calculating his portion of her tax liability.in an accompanying declaration,richard averred that claire had asked him to effectively pay taxes on substantial nonspousal support income that his calculation of taxes owed on basic spousal support income was,which he had paid to claire by a check for and application of in debt he claimed claire owed to him.claire responded in part with objections to richard declaration.she argued she was entitled to from richard for her income tax liability based on the unambiguous terms of their integrated msa,which was drafted by richard,then a practicing attorney.
in may,the family court judge the thomas hendrix appointed a special master,set the matter of claire income taxes for an evidentiary hearing,and ordered richard to pay an approximate disputed amount into an interest bearing trust account.thereafter,in august,claire filed an order to show cause requesting an order that richard pay interest on his unpaid portion of her income tax obligation.she submitted another declaration from accountant helfand who set forth his criticisms of richard calculation of claire income tax liability,as well as her own declaration stating she had not overpaid her income taxes.
following the parties evidentiary hearing with the special master,richard filed supplemental points and authorities challenging claire calculation of her tax liability under her chosen tax filing status married filing separately,arguing that her filing status unnecessarily and substantially increased her tax obligation.he maintained claire had a duty to mitigate and minimize her tax liability under the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and the express terms of the msa that the amount she could recover from him was limited to that which a reasonable person under the same circumstances would have incurred.richard asked the court to adopt his methodology that would calculate her income tax liability to be under a married,filing jointly status.
at about the same time richard raised the issue of claire tax filing status,claire moved to establish support arrears owed to her in the amount of,which she asserted represented of her actual housing costs.she argued the msa required richard to pay her the greater of percent of the net rental income from the mission property or the guaranteed sum of per month plus her housing costs.claire stated richard had paid her only,which was plus of her housing costs,and had refused to pay the remaining housing costs on grounds her current spouse had paid that expense.she asked the family court to award her attorney fees and costs for richard conduct in forcing her to file the motion,as well as sanctions on grounds that as an attorney and drafter of the agreement richard was well aware of his obligations.
on july,the family court judge the lisa foster considered arguments on claire claim as to her income taxes and motion for housing costs arrears,as well as claire request for an order awarding her attorney fees and sanctions in connection with her requests.finding it could not dictate how claire could designate her tax filing status,the court ruled that richard obligation under the most fair method of calculating claire income tax liability would be to pay one half of,which was.applying richard prior payments,it found richard was to pay an arrearage of plus interest.as for claire housing costs,the court found richard arrearage to be,based on its view that richard obligation as set out in the msa was not contingent on claire remarriage or on any other person paying her expenses.the family court reserved the issue of attorney fees,but found based on the msa plain language richard position and his unilateral action with respect to claire housing costs was unreasonable and taken in bad faith.it ordered richard to pay in sanctions with respect to that issue.
in november,richard filed an order to show cause asking the family court to clarify its prior orders and to determine certain credits he claimed were due him for overpaid spousal support.he stated that at the time of its ruling,the court was unaware that in claire had refinanced her residence,increasing the principal amount of the loan by to pay for new vehicles,and also that her new husband was paying of the mortgage.he asked that his obligation be reduced by percent and then halved based on claire actual monthly mortgage expense.richard further argued that the order awarding in sanctions was inappropriate because his adjustments to his obligations were based on his good faith belief about the msa requirements.as for the order pertaining to claire income taxes,richard expressed confusion as to the court calculation and stated his belief that its determination was inappropriate and overstated the amount of taxes based on the evidence.on that issue,he asked the court for clarification as to how the court reached its conclusion 
trial court rulings 
on december,the family court filed its findings and order after hearing on the matters considered on july,including its order that richard pay to claire in sanctions.
the next day,the family court heard claire petitions to confirm the arbitration award and motion for accounting,as well as claire requests for orders directing richard to pay the housing cost and income tax arrearages.it granted claire motion to confirm the award.the court observed that there was no dispute that the arbitrator had resolved the questions put before him by the parties,and it found the matter did not present a situation of the arbitrator exceeding his power.having made those findings,the court ruled under moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,moncharsh it was not authorized to review the arbitrator determinations in fashioning a remedy.it also ordered the accounting contemplated by the arbitrator in the award,appointing the arbitrator as a special master to supervise the accounting.
as for the issues of claire income taxes and the housing costs,the court stated it would consider richard motion for reconsideration of those orders.it took claire request for attorney fees and richard request for certain credits under submission.thereafter,richard moved to have the family court consider his november motion for clarification in which he raised the issue of claire joint loan obligations with her new husband and the refinance of her residence.he asked the court to alternatively treat the motion as one for reconsideration and a new motion for a determination of claire housing costs from july forward.
the court denied richard reconsideration motion,finding he had not established his alleged new facts could not have been discovered had he exercised diligence.with respect to richard request that the court rule on his november clarification motion,the court stated it had implicitly denied that motion when it signed the findings and order after the july,hearing.it dated those findings and order after hearing december,nunc pro tunc,and denied richard motion for clarification.
richard appeals from the court december,orders.
discussion 
motion to dismiss appeal from order confirming arbitration award 
before filing her respondent brief in this matter,claire moved to dismiss richard appeal from the trial court postjudgment order confirming the arbitration award.she argued this court lacks jurisdiction due to the interlocutory nature of the arbitrator decision that due to the order for an accounting by a special master and the fact further judicial action is necessary to finally determine the monetary amounts richard owes her,the postjudgment order is not appealable.additionally,claire contended the judgment underlying the postjudgment order is not prerequisite for appealability of the postjudgment it was entered on the parties stipulation.at oral argument,claire purported to withdraw the motion,asking us to consider richard contentions about the family court order on the merits.
we will nevertheless consider the motion to dismiss.parties can not confer jurisdiction on this court if the family court order is interlocutory and not appealable.appealability of the order goes to our jurisdiction,leaving us dutybound to consider it on our own motion olson cory cal d,and dismiss on our own motion if necessary hollister convalescent,rico cal d.the fact claire no longer disputes appealability does not matter,for jurisdiction can not be conferred by the consent or stipulation of the parties,estoppel,or waiver estate of hanley cal d,in re marriage of king th,d or by the relative merits of an appeal in re fredrick d.
our focus is on whether the family court postjudgment order confirming the arbitration the arbitrator interlocutory or final for purposes of this appeal in determining whether a particular decree is essentially interlocutory and nonappealable,or whether it is final and appealable i t is not the form of the decree but the substance and effect of the adjudication which is determinative.as a general test,which must be adapted to the particular circumstances of the individual case,it may be said that where no issue is left for future consideration except the fact of compliance or noncompliance with the terms of the first decree,that decree is final,but where anything further in the nature of judicial action on the part of the court is essential to a final determination of the rights of the parties,the decree is interlocutory.belio panorama optics,th,d,quoting lyon goss cal d,see also griset fair political practices com.cal th,d.a judgment or order is final when it terminates the litigation between the parties on the merits of the case and leaves nothing to be done but to enforce by execution what has been determined.sullivan delta air lines,cal th,d,see also code civ,a judgment is the final determination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding.w here anything further in the nature of judicial action on the part of the court is essential to a final determination of the rights of the parties,the decree is interlocutory and not appealable.olson cory,supra,cal d at.
with regard to postjudgment orders,code of civil procedure section,subdivision a provides in part an appeal,other than in a limited civil case,may be taken from any of the following from a judgment from an order made after a judgment made appealable by paragraph.as claire points out,not every postjudgment order that follows a final judgment is appealable despite the inclusive language of code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,not every postjudgment order that follows a final appealable judgment is appealable.to be appealable,a postjudgment order must satisfy two additional requirements the first requirement is that the issues raised by the appeal from the order must be different from those arising from an appeal from the judgment the second requirement is that the order must either affect the judgment or relate to it by enforcing it or staying its execution.lakin watkins associated industries cal th,d,lakin see also olson cory,supra,cal d at,roden amerisourcebergen th,d.lakin held a postjudgment order denying an award of attorney fees was appealable because it satisfied those requirements it affects the judgment or relates to its enforcement because it determines the rights and liabilities of the parties arising from the judgment,is not preliminary to later proceedings,and will not become subject to appeal after some future judgment.lakin,at,d.
two courts of appeal have applied lakin principles to postjudgment marital dissolution proceedings,each concluding both postjudgment orders were interlocutory and not appealable because they were preliminary or preparatory to later proceedings.in re marriage of levine th,d in re marriage of ellis th,d.in levine,the court dismissed an appeal from a postjudgment order relating to the sale of certain assets that were to result in a guaranteed receipt of a specified sum of money.levine,at,d.following disputes and the filing of an order to show cause,the family court entered an order in part specifying how the parties were to procedurally resolve additional disputes and reserving the issue of attorney fees and costs.id.at,d.the court of appeal held the order was not sufficiently final,which was an essential element of an appealable postjudgment order under lakin.id.at,d.
in ellis,the court of appeal found not appealable a postjudgment order finding a community property interest in health insurance subsidy benefits.in re marriage of ellis,supra,th at,d.relying on lakin,supra,cal th,d,and in re levine,supra,th,d,the appellate court observed some postjudgment orders are not appealable because,although following an earlier judgment,they are more accurately understood as being preliminary to a later judgment,at which time they will become ripe for appeal.such postjudgment orders lack finality in that they are also preparatory to later proceedings.ellis,th at,d,quoting lakin,at,d.in ellis,the family court order determined that the court had authority to evaluate and divide the medical subsidy,but it was only preliminary to actually doing so.ellis,at,d.under those circumstances,the appellate court dismissed the appeal as from a nonappealable order.id.at,d.
here,as claire points out,in its postjudgment order the family court did not simply confirm the arbitrator award,it also appointed a retired superior court judge the robert may as a special referee to select the forensic accountant to perform the accounting pursuant to the final arbitration award and to oversee the accounting process.the order continues if judge may is unable or unwilling to accept the appointment,the parties shall meet and confer to select a cpa to perform the accounting.the parties may return to the court on an ex parte basis to have a forensic accountant appointed,if needed.the record indicates that at richard request,the family court expressly designated the appointment of judge may as a special reference.see code civ,in re marriage of petropoulos th,d in re estate of beard th,d.when a reference is special,the referee decision does not become the decision of the court until it is adopted by the judge.yeboah progeny ventures,th,d,citing code civ,subd.b see also in re estate of beard,at,d referee factual findings under a special reference are advisory recommendations only and do not become binding unless adopted by the court.the family court order plainly contemplates further judicial proceedings to adopt the referee findings following the accounting to determine claire distributions from the refinance and sale of the mission property.because the order is preliminary to further proceedings and interlocutory under lakin principles,richard appeal from that order must be dismissed.
price slawter d,and taylor taylor d,relied upon by richard,do not convince us otherwise.the authority on which these holdings are based,zappettini buckles cal,has been impliedly overruled by subsequent california supreme court decisions.see kinoshita horio d.discussing conflict at length kinsmith financial gilroy th,d.these later decisions of the california supreme court among others,gunder gunder cal,di blasi di blasi cal,middleton finney cal,hollar saline products,cal d,indicate it is now settled that a decree that determines the basic issues between the parties and orders an accounting is not appealable.kinoshita,supra,d at.further,neither price nor taylor involve the appointment of a special referee,which is the circumstance creating a need for further judicial action.see gunder gunder,cal.at,distinguishing zappettini and another case and pointing out i n neither of those cases did the decree involve a reference for an accounting,but in each case it ordered a sale of property and specified the distribution to be made of the proceeds.there was therefore in those cases no further judicial action required on the part of the court to adjudicate finally the rights of the parties.
finally,the policies underlying the final judgment piecemeal dispositions and multiple appeals,reducing uncertainty or delay in the trial court,and obtaining a single complete and final resolution of the issues best served by denying appellate jurisdiction under the present circumstances.accord,kinoshita horio,supra,d at.based on the foregoing,we must dismiss richard appeal as to the family court order confirming the arbitration award.
ii.order regarding claire income taxes 
richard asks us to set aside the family court order that he pay as his share of claire income tax obligation.without explaining the appellate standard of review,he reiterates the arguments he made to the family court below that under the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and civil code sections and,claire was obligated to act reasonably and not impose excess liability by her selection of tax filing status and she had a duty to mitigate and minimize the amount of her tax liability.richard argues claire should not be able to recover any portion of tax liability that she could have reasonably foreseen and avoided by taking reasonable efforts and steps without incurring undue expense.
claire responds that the relevant questions on appeal are first,whether her chosen filing status was permissible under the msa,and second,whether the method of determining richard tax liability was proper under the msa.she argues her selection of her married filing separately tax filing status was not unreasonable since the msa does not dictate how she was to choose her filing status and that civil code sections and are inapplicable in the absence of evidence that the msa can not be carried out without some implied provision mandating her tax filing status.she maintains richard has not demonstrated with any authority that she had a duty to choose a tax filing status that would result in the smallest tax liability for him.
it is a well settled proposition that the law implies in every contract a covenant of good faith and fair dealing.see wilson century ins.cal th,d,jonathan neil associates,jones cal th,d.the covenant creates a duty of good faith and fair dealing in a contract performance and enforcement.jonathan neil,at,d.as to the scope of the covenant,t he precise nature and extent of the duty imposed by such an implied promise will depend on the contractual purposes.citation.initially,the concept of a duty of good faith developed in contract law as a kind of safety valve to which judges may turn to fill gaps and qualify or limit rights and duties otherwise arising under rules of law and specific contract language.citation.as a contract concept,breach of the duty led to imposition of contract damages determined by the nature of the breach and standard contract principles.ibid.
in this case,however,the parties msa was incorporated into their judgment of dissolution.the significance of such incorporation was explained in in re marriage of jones d.a merged separation agreement is superseded by the decree,and the obligations imposed are not those imposed by contract,but are those imposed by decree,and enforceable as such.once the contract is merged into the decree,the value attaching to the separation agreement is only historical.citation.merger,then,replaces the obligations of the contract with those of the decree and the merger itself has extinguished the contract obligations.see also zastrow zastrow d.
the question of whether a marital settlement agreement is merged into the divorce decree is one of law.mitchell marklund d.the msa and judgment here satisfy the criteria for a merger.the msa is attached to and explicitly incorporated by reference in the supplemental judgment,which states the marital settlement agreement executed by the parties herein,the original of which is attached hereto,is incorporated into and made a part of the judgment of dissolution of marriage filed and entered with this court on august,as though set forth in full therein.some capitalization omitted.because the msa was merged into the judgment,its obligations are not those imposed by contract and not enforceable as such.hough hough cal d,see also westinghouse electric newman holtzinger th,d once an agreement is merged into the court order,neither party has a right of action based on the agreement because the obligations imposed are not imposed by the agreement but by the order and are enforceable as such through contempt and other sanctions available to the court.under these circumstances,we find no basis to imply a covenant of good faith and fair corresponding the terms of the parties merged judgment.nor has richard provided us with authority implying a covenant in these circumstances.
our conclusion is different with respect to the potential application of civil code sections and,as those provisions are rules of contract interpretation.but see,binder aetna life ins.th,d the supplying of an omitted term is not technically interpretation,but the two are closely related courts often speak of an implied term,quoting rest d contracts,com.statutory rules of construction and interpretation are generally applicable to marital settlement agreements that are incorporated into a dissolution judgment.in re marriage of iberti th,d.civil code section provides stipulations which are necessary to make a contract reasonable are implied,in respect to matters concerning which the contract manifests no contrary intention.civil code section provides in part all things that in law or usage are considered or incidental to a contract,or as necessary to carry it into effect,are implied therefrom,unless some of them are expressly mentioned therein,when all other things of the same class are deemed to be excluded.
as claire acknowledges,nothing in the msa mandates that claire use any particular tax filing status when preparing her tax returns or more specifically,use a tax filing status that would result in the lowest income tax payment.the agreement is silent on that precise question.there being no express term on that point,the question at hand is whether such a term may be implied without altering or varying the terms of the agreement and whether the circumstances give rise to other conditions permitting a court to imply such terms.lambros metropolitan life ins.th,d frankel board of dental examiners th,d frankel.
implied terms are not favored in the law,and should be read into contracts only upon grounds of obvious necessity.frankel,supra,th at,d.a court may find an implied contract provision only if the implication either arises from the contract express language or is indispensable to effectuating the parties intentions it appears that the implied term was so clearly within the parties contemplation when they drafted the contract that they did not feel the need to express it legal necessity justifies the implication the implication would have been expressed if the need to do so had been called to the parties attention and the contract does not already address completely the subject of the implication.frankel,at,d see also foley euless cal,cousins inv.hastings clothing d,to imply a covenant in the express terms of a contract,it must appear that it is necessary in order to give effect to and effectuate the purpose of the contract as a whole.
richard does not meaningfully address these requirements on appeal.in his supplemental papers raising claire tax filing status in the family court,he cited to the civil code sections and relied on case authority,mainieri magnuson d,standing for the proposition that if a promise can not be performed without some other act or forebearance,such act or forebearance will become a condition in his accompanying declaration below,he referred to an august mutually signed letter which he averred set forth the basic terms of the agreement and provided some indication of the parties intent as to the general expected amount of claire income tax obligation.the letter does not appear in the appellate record,and in resolving the income tax issue,there is no indication the family court provisionally considered the extrinsic evidence or undertook to interpret the msa to ascertain the parties intent with regard to claire filing status richard does not contend the family court erred by failing to consider testimony or extrinsic evidence to determine the parties intentions or agreement with respect to such a term.
ultimately,we reject richard contentions under civil code sections and because he does not explain how the msa can not be performed without a provision requiring claire to apply a particular tax filing status,how such a provision is necessary to make the msa reasonable,italics added,or why such a provision is otherwise indispensible or legally necessary to carry the msa into effect.nor does he address the impact of his proposed implied contract term on the msa provisions that richard would pay designated spousal support which included of claire income taxes irrespective of her remarriage,provisions that arguably express a contrary intention,and might be altered by an implied term requiring claire to file under a particular tax filing status.richard main point is that it is reasonable to expect that claire would select a tax filing status that would minimize her overall tax liability.but i t is not enough to say a proposed implied provision is necessary to make the contract fair,or that it ought to have contained a stipulation which is not found in it,or that,without such covenant,it would be improvident or unwise or would operate unjustly for parties have the right to make such contracts.cousins inv.hastings clothing,supra,d at.absent a showing of legal necessity for the implied term,we are compelled to affirm the family court order that richard pay with specified credits towards claire income taxes.
iii.sanctions order 
richard advances several challenges to the family co
