this construction industry labor litigation involves the interplay between the use of standard work preservation and clauses in collective bargaining agreements and the strong federal policy favoring arbitration.the clauses at issue in this litigation appear in a collective bargaining agreement signed by a texas corporation,but a different company in california performed the challenged work.the california union seeking arbitration did not sign an agreement with the company doing the work.we conclude,as did the district court,that because the plaintiff union has no agreement with the employer that it seeks to take to arbitration,and it can not show that the employer against whom it filed its claim controls the company doing the work in california,the employer is entitled to judgment.we therefore affirm.
background 
is district council of the international union of painters and allied trades,glaziers,architectural metal and glass workers,local local or the union.it is located in northern california and is signatory to a collective bargaining agreement cba with contractors in santa clara county.the union filed this action in the northern district of california in against b b glass,a texas corporation bbtx.the union seeks to compel bbtx to arbitrate the union claim that another corporation,b b glass,incorporated,an arizona company bbaz,violated the texas agreement bbtx signed with local texas counterpart,painters and glaziers local union local.the california dispute concerned work bbaz was doing at san jose state university in santa clara county.
bbtx appeared specially to contest the district court personal jurisdiction over it,asserting that it was not doing the work in california and therefore was not present in the state.in support of its assertion,bbtx provided declarations that the persons controlling bbtx had no control over bbaz business decisions.without producing additional evidence,local countered that,because bbtx and bbaz had a majority of shareholders in common,bbtx exercised sufficient management control over bbaz that the court should compel arbitration of the dispute between local and bbtx.
in granting bbtx motion to dismiss,the district court relied on the following undisputed facts.bbaz was formed in as an arizona corporation by robert and barbara buckholz.their son,bryan buckholz,purchased the company in.he now owns a interest in bbaz,with the other being owned by rick churchill,bernie hagerman,and john collier,equally.bbaz conducts most of its business in arizona,with some in california,utah and new mexico.it does not hire employees who are unionized.bryan buckholz incorporated bbtx under the laws of texas in,and he subsequently sold his entire interest in bbtx to rick churchill,bernie hagerman,and john collier.bbtx is a union shop.
bbaz and bbtx do not compete for projects,contracts,subcontracts or bids.the companies do not share business offices,phone numbers,mailing addresses,business licenses,employees,supervisors,managers,payrolls,workers compensation policies,tax identification numbers,state unemployment numbers,tax records,corporate records or bank accounts.importantly,each company has a different operation manager the person responsible for bidding on and negotiating work contracts for the company.
in march,rick churchill,the operation manager of bbtx,signed the texas cba.in july,plaintiff local entered into a cba with various employers in fourteen northern california counties,including santa clara county,in which san jose state university is located.bbaz began its work at san jose state in july.
in march,this dispute arose between bbtx and local.local claimed that bbaz work in california violated the texas cba.the terms of the texas cba,if applicable to the california work,would bind bbaz,through bbtx,to adhere to the terms of the california cba.the california cba provides that any dispute between the parties is to be resolved through a grievance procedure,the final step of which is binding arbitration.on march,local filed its petition to compel arbitration with bbtx in the northern district of california.local contends that the california cba applies to bbaz california work through the texas cba,because bbtx three owners also own a majority of shares of bbaz.therefore,local contends,bbaz work is the work of bbtx.
the clause in the texas cba requires bbtx,when engaged in work outside the area covered by the agreement,to abide by the terms of the agreement in effect in that other area.it states the employer must 
comply with all the lawful clauses of the collective bargaining agreement in effect in said other geographic jurisdiction and executed by the employers of the industry and affiliated local unions in that jurisdiction.this provision is enforceable by the local union or district council in whose jurisdiction the work is being performed,both through the procedure for settlement of grievances set forth in its applicable collective bargaining agreement and through the courts,and is also enforceable by the union party to this agreement.
local first argued to the district court that this clause required bbaz to comply with the california cba.the district court properly rejected this argument.as the district court pointed out,if bbtx physically engages in work outside of the dallas metropolitan area,in san jose,california,bbtx must comply with all of the clauses of the cba in effect in san jose but bbtx engaged in no work at san jose state only bbaz did so.therefore,the district court determined that the clause was not sufficient to support compelling arbitration.
local then invoked the texas cba manganaro clause.a manganaro clause,also known as a work preservation provision,is common practice in the construction industry.painters allied trades dist.council of the int l brotherhood of painters and allied trades,manganaro.it is designed to prevent union contractors from acting directly or indirectly as contractors.the texas cba manganaro clause reads 
to protect and preserve,for the employees covered by this agreement,all work they,union members have performed,and to prevent any device or subterfuge to avoid protection and preservation of such work,it is agreed as follows if the employer performs construction work under its own name or the name of another corporation where in the employer,through its officers,directors,owners or stockholders,exercises directly or indirectly m anagement control or majority ownership,the terms and conditions of this agreement shall be applicable to all such work.
local argued that the texas cba bound bbaz to the terms of the california cba because bbtx consented to the jurisdiction of the district court when it signed the collective bargaining agreement with texas local.local contended that bbtx exercised majority ownership of,and thus controlled,bbaz business decisions.because of the manganaro clause in the texas cba,bbaz was bound by the texas cba.therefore,local contended,because bbaz work at san jose state constituted construction work under the name of another corporation controlled by bbtx,the clause in the texas cba covered bbaz work in california,subjecting it to the california cba arbitration provision.
on june,the district court granted bbtx motion to dismiss the petition to compel arbitration,finding that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over bbtx.applying manganaro,the court held that bbtx was not present in san jose it had successfully demonstrated that it did not exercise active control over bbaz.see manganaro,at requiring that the signatory to one cba must exercise actual or active control of the work of the for work preservation provision to apply.the district court found that,although local initially presented evidence of the substantial overlap of ownership between the companies,the union did not follow up with additional evidence demonstrating that bbtx had any hand in bbaz business decisions.nor did local contradict the companies showing that different individuals controlled the management of each company.
this timely appeal followed.

local contends that the district court improperly held that it was required to establish by a preponderance of
