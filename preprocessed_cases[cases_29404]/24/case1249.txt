introduction 
plaintiff and appellant gregory saffer worked for washington mutual bank wamu between may and january.in september,wamu failed.in short order,the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic was appointed as receiver for the bank,and jp morgan chase bank,jpmc purchased some of wamu assets and liabilities.the fdic published notices informing creditors that claims against wamu had to be submitted to the fdic by the end of december.in june,saffer filed suit against wamu,chase manhattan bank,his former supervisor at wamu,and wamu former ceo.the suit alleged the defendants constructively discharged saffer in violation of public policy and in breach of express or implied employment contracts.jpmc successfully compelled the suit to arbitration.once in the arbitral forum,jpmc moved to dismiss the action.jpmc asserted neither the arbitrator nor any court had subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate saffer claims because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies pursuant to the financial institutions reform,recovery and enforcement act of,et.firrea the arbitrator agreed and dismissed the case.the trial court subsequently confirmed the arbitration award.
saffer now appeals the order compelling binding arbitration and the order confirming the arbitration award.saffer contends the arbitration agreement was unenforceable.he also argues the arbitrator award should have been vacated because the arbitrator substantially prejudiced his rights by denying him discovery,and exceeded her powers by dismissing the case without a hearing on the merits.jpmc contends no court,including this court,has subject matter jurisdiction to entertain saffer claims,and his complaint should accordingly be dismissed.
we conclude saffer failure to timely comply with the mandatory administrative exhaustion requirements of firrea created a jurisdictional bar to his claims.for that reason we vacate the judgment and remand to the trial court with directions to enter an order of dismissal against saffer for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
factual and procedural background 
saffer began working for wamu in late may as a mortgage loan consultant.at some point near the beginning of his employment,saffer signed a binding arbitration agreement.in the agreement,saffer and wamu agreed that arbitration shall be in lieu of any and all lawsuits or other civil legal proceedings relating to his employment.
in january,saffer employment with wamu ended.
in september,the office of thrift supervision seized wamu and appointed the fdic as the bank receiver.at essentially the same time,the fdic sold certain of wamu assets and liabilities to jpmc 
on october and october,the fdic published notices in the wall street journal informing creditors of wamu that any claims against wamu had to be submitted in writing to the fdic by december,the bar date.the notices warned under federal law,with certain limited exceptions,failure to file such claims by the bar date will result in disallowance by the receiver,the disallowance will be final,and further rights or remedies with regard to the claims will be barred.section d c d.
in june,saffer filed suit against wamu,chase manhattan bank,the former ceo of wamu,and his former wamu supervisor,susan wolf.saffer asserted claims for wrongful termination in violation of public policy breach of express and contracts not to terminate employment without good cause breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing failure to pay wages in violation of the labor code and industrial welfare commission work orders false representations and fraudulent inducement and negligent hiring,retention,and supervision.the complaint alleged saffer refused to engage in fraudulent schemes aimed to defraud clients,wamu and chase manhattan bank constructively discharged him in retaliation,and all defendants negligently hired,retained,or supervised employees who illegally retaliated against him.the complaint further alleged wamu and chase manhattan bank breached an oral agreement not to terminate him except for good cause,and did not pay all wages due to him.the complaint asserted the defendants,including wolf,knowingly made false representations to him about wamu financial position to induce him to accept employment with wamu.
in july,jpmc answered the complaint,identifying itself as jp morgan chase bank,as acquirer of certain assets and liabilities of washington mutual bank from the fdic acting as receiver.wolf subsequently also answered the complaint in october,jpmc filed a petition to compel arbitration.saffer opposed the petition,arguing he was fraudulently induced to sign the agreement,and it was unenforceable due to procedural and substantive unconscionability.following an evidentiary hearing,the trial court granted the petition to compel arbitration in april.
the parties proceeded to arbitration under the auspices of the american arbitration association.the record does not reveal what took place over the next two years.in june,jpmc informed the arbitrator and saffer it would move to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,based on firrea.in response,saffer noticed the deposition of jpmc person most knowledgeable regarding firrea.jpmc objected to the notice and sought a protective order preventing the deposition,which the arbitrator issued.in august,jpmc moved to dismiss the complaint,arguing saffer failure to exhaust administrative remedies with the fdic in accordance with firrea barred him from pursuing his claims in the arbitration or in any court.
in september,saffer filed a claim with the fdic.he also opposed jpmc motion to dismiss,arguing firrea was not applicable because he never received proper notice of the fdic receivership of wamu.he further contended the time to file a claim with the fdic should be equitably tolled.
in november,the arbitrator concluded the court and the arbitrator lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear saffer claims and dismissed the case.saffer subsequently filed a motion to vacate the arbitration ruling in the superior court.saffer contended his rights were substantially prejudiced by the arbitrator refusal to allow discovery to determine whether the fdic could have resolved his claims.he further argued the arbitrator should have waited until the fdic issued a response to his claim.jpmc opposed the motion,arguing that neither the arbitrator nor the courts had jurisdiction to entertain saffer claims.however,instead of asserting the trial court should dismiss the action,jpmc contended there was no basis to vacate or review the arbitrator award and it should be confirmed.in december,the trial court confirmed the arbitrator award.this appeal followed 
discussion 
i.the case must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
on appeal,saffer contends the trial court erred in granting jpmc petition to compel arbitration and subsequently in confirming the arbitration award.jpmc disagrees,but also contends neither the trial court,nor this court has subject matter jurisdiction to entertain any aspect of saffer claims.subject matter jurisdiction may be raised for the first time on appeal.totten hill th,totten.in addition,an alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be addressed whenever it comes to a court attention.in re gloria th,totten,supra,at.a respondent may raise the issue in a respondent brief.totten,supra,at.
saffer first argument is that the trial court erred in compelling him to arbitrate his claims.however,if indeed the courts of this state lack subject matter jurisdiction over saffer claims,any issues regarding arbitrability are moot even if the arbitration agreement was unenforceable,the trial court would still lack the ability to adjudicate his claims.thus,we independently consider jpmc jurisdictional challenge we conclude the action must be dismissed due to a lack of subject matter jurisdiction,resulting from saffer failure to timely exhaust his administrative remedies with the fdic as required by firrea.
firrea background 
under firrea,the fdic has authority to act as receiver or conservator of a failed institution for the protection of depositors and creditors.citation.firrea provides detailed procedures to allow the fdic to consider certain claims against the receivership estate,see,d,to ensure that the assets of a failed institution are distributed fairly and promptly among those with valid claims against the institution,and to expeditiously wind up the affairs of failed banks,citation.firrea requires that a plaintiff exhaust these administrative remedies with the fdic before filing certain claims.benson jpmorgan chase bank,cir,benson properties,resolution trust th,properties.
once the fdic is appointed receiver,it must promptly publish notice to the institution creditors to present claims to the receiver by a specified date,known as the bar date.see,intercontinental travel marketing cir,intercontinental.the notice must be republished one and two months later,subd.d b.the fdic must also mail a similar notice to known creditors,subd.d c.within days of the filing of a claim,the fdic must determine whether to allow or disallow the claim,and notify the claimant of the determination,subd.d a.within days after a claim is disallowed,or after days of the claim filing,the claimant may either seek administrative review of the claim,or file suit on such claim or continue an action commenced before the appointment of the receiver in the district or territorial court of the united states for the district within which the depository institution principal place of business is located or the united states district court for the district of columbia and such court shall have jurisdiction to hear such claim,subd.d a.judicial review of a disallowed claim is de novo,subd.d e brady dev.resolution trust cir,brady.if the claimant fails to seek administrative or judicial review within the day period,the claim shall be deemed to be disallowed as of the end of such period,such disallowance shall be final,and the claimant shall have no further rights or remedies with respect to such claim,subd.d b.
section,subdivision d d states except as otherwise provided in this subsection,no court shall have jurisdiction over i any claim or action for payment from,or any action seeking a determination of rights with respect to,the assets of any depository institution for which the corporation has been appointed receiver,including assets which the corporation may acquire from itself as such receiver or ii any claim relating to any act or omission of such institution or the corporation as receiver.thus,f ailure to comply with the claims procedure bars any lawsuit against a failed depository institution.robbins foothill nissan th.
it is undisputed that saffer did not exhaust administrative remedies under firrea before filing suit.however,saffer contends this failure is not fatal to his claims,or this appeal,for several reasons.he contends judicial action on his claims is not barred because exhaustion of administrative remedies does not implicate fundamental jurisdiction under california law.he thus asserts exhaustion was a procedural defense jpmc could,and did,waive.saffer also argues he was not required to exhaust administrative remedies under firrea because his claims employment claims were not susceptible of resolution by the fdic he did not receive adequate notice of the claims bar date or the receivership and he was not required to exhaust as to jpmc or as to wolf.
failure to exhaust administrative remedies under firrea deprives courts of subject matter jurisdiction 
a threshold question is whether saffer failure to exhaust his administrative remedies under firrea calls into question the courts subject matter jurisdiction over his claims.we conclude that it does.
subject matter jurisdiction principles 
subject matter jurisdiction is a fundamental requirement for judicial consideration of claims.the california supreme court has defined subject matter jurisdiction thusly subject matter jurisdiction is the power of the court over a cause of action or to act in a particular way.citations.by contrast,the lack of subject matter jurisdiction means the entire absence of power to hear or determine a case,an absence of authority over the subject matter.citations.where the evidence is not in dispute,a determination of subject matter jurisdiction is a legal question subject to de novo review.dial fesbinder th.subject matter jurisdiction may not be conferred by consent,waiver,agreement,acquiescence,or estoppel.citation.totten,supra,th at.as noted above,t he adequacy of the court subject matter jurisdiction must be addressed whenever that issue comes to the court attention.citation.id.at in re gloria,supra,th at.thus,it may be considered for the first time on appeal people lara cal th,lara,and requires no particular procedural vehicle.great western casinos,morongo band of mission indians th.a ny judgment or order rendered by a court lacking subject matter jurisdiction is void on its face citation.varian medical systems,delfino cal th,varian.
ii.failure to exhaust firrea administrative remedies deprives courts of subject matter jurisdiction 
it is now well established that exhaustion of the act administrative review process is a precondition to litigation against the fdic to recover a debt owed by a failed bank.neman commercial capital bank th,neman.s ection d d denies jurisdiction to any court,state or federal,to consider claims except in accordance with section d s ection d grants jurisdiction to certain courts only,and then in only two cases a judicial review of the receiver determination of the claimant appeal if it seeks administrative review,d a and b over suits filed or continued by a claimant following the receiver denial of a claim,or the expiration of days after the filing of a claim.d a.properties,supra,th at.
as our colleagues in division seven explained in properties the exhaustion of administrative remedies is mandatory when,as here,congress imposes an exhaustion requirement by statute.citations.further,the relevant case law interpreting section d confirms that completion of the claims process is a mandatory prerequisite to judicial review.citations.congress expressly withdrew jurisdiction to resolve claims to a failed bank assets from all courts,except as provided in,d t he administrative procedure exhaustion requirement of firrea is statutory,not judicial.citation.we are therefore not at liberty to ignore the statutory command.citation.u nless a claimant has exhausted the administrative claims process,no court has jurisdiction to hear the claim.properties,supra,th at,italics in original,fn.omitted.
likewise,numerous federal authorities conclude the failure to exhaust firrea administrative remedies prior to filing suit on a covered claim deprives courts of subject matter jurisdiction to consider the claim.see,acosta ramírez banco popular de puerto rico cir,aber shukofsky jpmorgan chase d,aber shukofsky t he second circuit has consistently held that courts lack subject matter jurisdiction to hear a claim against a failed bank taken into receivership by the fdic unless the plaintiff has exhausted the administrative claims process althouse resolution trust cir,elmco properties,second nat.fed.sav.ass cir,elmco farnik cir,farnik bueford resolution trust cir,intercontinental,supra,at damiano cir,freeman.
iii.california cases regarding administrative exhaustion are not controlling on the question of whether failure to exhaust firrea procedures implicates subject matter jurisdiction 
despite section d d and the many authorities interpreting it,saffer contends that under california law,a failure to exhaust administrative remedies does not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction and the defense can be waived.we disagree.
in abelleira district court of appeal cal d abelleira,the california supreme court described exhaustion of administrative remedies as a jurisdictional prerequisite to the courts.id.at.in green city of oceanside d green,the court rejected the argument that abelleira determined exhaustion of administrative remedies implicated subject matter jurisdiction.instead,the green court described abelleira as making it abundantly clear that the exhaustion doctrine does not implicate subject matter jurisdiction but rather is a procedural prerequisite originally devised for convenience and efficiency and now followed under the doctrine of stare decisis citation.it is jurisdictional only in the sense that a court failure to apply the rule in a situation where the issue has been properly raised can be corrected by the issuance of a writ of prohibition.green,at.the green court thus concluded the defense of failure to exhaust administrative remedies could be waived by the defendant failure to raise it before or during trial.id.at.subsequently,other courts have adopted similar reasoning and concluded the failure to exhaust administrative remedies does not deprive a court of subject matter jurisdiction,and the defense may be waived.see,cummings stanley th,cummings mokler county of orange th,mokler.
however,these cases concerned administrative exhaustion schemes that were neither mandatory,nor part of a statute that explicitly stripped courts of jurisdiction in the absence of compliance with the relevant exhaustion requirements.for example,in green,the plaintiff was terminated from employment with the city of oceanside.an agreement between the city and an employee association to which the plaintiff belonged provided an internal grievance procedure,including various administrative appeals.the plaintiff did not challenge his termination through the employees grievance procedure but filed suit in the superior court.the court found the internal grievance procedure was simply a procedural prerequisite,creating only a potential procedural defense that could be waived.green,supra,d at.
similarly,in mokler,a county employee was terminated internal grievance procedures were available to her to challenge the termination.mokler,supra,th at.the grievance procedures expressly provided that they were subject to waiver by mutual consent.id.at.the county did not raise the employee failure to exhaust administrative remedies until after a full trial on the merits the court concluded the defense was waived.ibid.likewise,in cummings,the relevant statute provided an elector may seek a writ of mandate prior to an election to challenge the eligibility of candidates on an election ballot.cummings,supra,th at.the court concluded the defendant waived an administrative exhaustion defense by failing to raise it in the trial court.id.at.
although these cases,like the instant one,concerned administrative exhaustion,the strictures of firrea and its explicit stripping of jurisdiction from the courts render green and its progeny inapposite to the case at bar.unlike administrative remedies set forth in a contract between the parties,or a permissive statutory procedure,firrea exhaustion requirements are set forth by federal statute,they are mandatory,they do not allow for waiver by consent,and they explicitly state courts do not have jurisdiction to consider claims subject to exhaustion unless the claimant first follows the administrative procedures.see rosa resolution trust cir,rosa noting w e are not confronted with a judicially created exhaustion requirement,but with one that is mandated by statute.further,congress made this statutory exhaustion requirement explicitly jurisdictional.
this is consistent with the purpose of the statute.as explained in properties,in firrea,congress enacted a comprehensive and mandatory statutory scheme to enable the rtc the predecessor to the fdic,when acting as receiver for a failed institution,to carry out its fundamental functions of conserving and preserving the assets of the failed institution,and ultimately making pro rata distributions of those assets to the creditors of the institutions the administrative claims process provides a centralized mechanism for consideration and resolution of the bulk of claims against insolvent thrifts without the delay and expense of litigation,by requiring that all claims be submitted to the receiver within a finite time period,and by allowing the receiver the initial opportunity to review and resolve the claims.properties,supra,th at,fns.omitted.
moreover,the california supreme court analysis in lara,supra,cal th,supports the conclusion that the firrea administrative exhaustion requirements implicate subject matter jurisdiction.the court explained a lack of jurisdiction in its fundamental or strict sense results in an entire absence of power to hear or determine the case,an absence of authority over the subject matter or the parties.citation.on the other hand,a court may have jurisdiction in the strict sense but nevertheless lack jurisdiction or power to act except in a particular manner,or to give certain kinds of relief,or to act without the occurrence of certain procedural prerequisites.citation.when a court fails to conduct itself in the manner prescribed,it is said to have acted in excess of jurisdiction.citations.whether the failure to follow a statute makes subsequent action void or merely voidable has been characterized as a question of whether the statute should be accorded mandatory or directory effect.if the failure is determined to have an invalidating effect,the statute is said to be mandatory if the failure is determined not to invalidate subsequent action,the statute is said to be directory.citation.citation.whether a particular statute is intended to impose a mandatory duty is a question of interpretation for the courts.citation.unless the legislature clearly expresses a contrary intent,time limits are typically deemed directory.citation.id.at.
as noted above,not only does firrea language indicate courts have no jurisdiction unless the claims process is first followed,federal courts interpreting firrea administrative exhaustion requirements have consistently interpreted the procedures as creating a mandatory precondition to litigation,and as depriving courts of subject matter jurisdiction if the claims procedures are not first followed.in addition to cases cited above see also,tellado indymac mortg.servs.cir,benson,supra,at brady,supra,at,interface kanner,llc jpmorgan chase bank cir.several state courts,including courts of this state,have come to the same conclusion.see,properties,supra,th at neman,supra,th at thomas fdic,schettler ralron capital,mclaughlin,failure to timely file exhaust with fdic fatal to appeal jinadu centrust mortgage,bobick community southern bank.
we agree with the many other courts that have concluded a failure to exhaust firrea administrative remedies creates a jurisdictional bar and implicates a question of subject matter jurisdiction.the reasoning of greenand its progeny is not applicable,given firrea specific mandates see also varian,supra,cal th at without subject matter jurisdiction trial court actions are void,not merely voidable totten,supra th at,erisa completely preempted state law cause of action and trial court had no subject matter jurisdiction trial court judgment vacated and case dismissed.thus,unless saffer claims were not subject to firrea exhaustion requirements,any judicial action on his claims was invalid,other than dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.jpmc could not waive the issue by failing to promptly raise it.
saffer claims were subject to firrea administrative exhaustion requirements 
saffer argues he was not required to exhaust administrative remedies under firrea before filing his claims.we find his contentions unavailing.
saffer claims were not exempt from exhaustion because they were employment claims 
saffer contends he was not required to file a claim with the fdic because his claims were not susceptible of resolution through the claims procedure.we disagree.saffer contention refers to a phrase employed by some courts to explain that firrea bars judicial review of any claim,monetary or nonmonetary,which is susceptible of resolution through the claims procedure.citation.henderson bank of new england cir,quoting rosa,supra,at.in rosa,the court concluded the plaintiffs claims seeking nonmonetary injunctive relief that would bar retroactive termination of an erisa plan were not susceptible of resolution through the claims procedure.as a result,the claims were not subject to the jurisdictional bar.
however,the rosa court conclusion of was not due to a finding that the fdic lacked the necessary substantive expertise in erisa to review the claims.instead,the court determined section d d i addressed claims looking directly to payments from assets,or in some respect determining rights with respect to assets,and did not encompass purely injunctive claims relating to retroactive termination of an erisa plan.rosa,supra,at.the court also concluded the claims procedure gave the resolution trust corporation rtc the authority to allow or disallow claims,and pay creditor claims,but the court was at a loss to understand how rtc would determine,or allow or disallow,a claim seeking an order barring retroactive termination of the plan,or how it would pay such a claim if allowed.id.at.the court thus found the claims for injunctive relief did not require exhaustion.
unlike the rosa plaintiffs claims,saffer claims were monetary,and exclusively concerned the acts of the failed bank,wamu.courts have concluded that claims of varying subject matters required firrea exhaustion,including claims,so long as they were claims relating to the acts or omissions of a failed depository institution over which the fdic was appointed receiver.westberg d,fn.omitted westberg plaintiffs claim would have been susceptible to resolution through the administrative procedure because it is an action that seeks a determination of rights with respect to the assets of the failed bank for which the fdic was appointed receiver,and thus,it is the very type of action covered by section d d.am.ins.fdic,claim against a bank for its own wrongdoing is not a claim requiring exhaustion under firrea.
for example,in bueford resolution trust,supra,the plaintiff asserted age and employment discrimination claims against her former employer,a bank.while her suit was pending,the rtc was appointed receiver of the bank.the court of appeals concluded she was required to comply with firrea administrative exhaustion procedures.because she had not done so,the trial court properly dismissed her case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.in demelo bank ass demelo,the court rejected the plaintiffs argument that their claims against a failed bank for violation of state consumer protection laws were not creditors claims requiring firrea exhaustion.id.at.the court explained firrea bars jurisdiction over any claim relating to any act or omission of the failed financial institution.d d ii we have given this provision the full scope that its text demands and,in doing so,we have not limited it to creditors claims.id.at.
in aber shukofsky,the district court dismissed the plaintiffs claims that wamu violated the fair labor standards act flsa,as well as state wage and labor laws.the plaintiffs were former wamu employees suing jpmc for alleged overtime wage violations by wamu.the plaintiffs failed to exhaust firrea administrative remedies before filing suit,thus the court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.aber shukofsky,supra,d at.the court rejected arguments that flsa trumped firrea,as well as the argument that a plaintiff need not exhaust administrative remedies because he or she has reason to believe the fdic will disallow the claim.id.at.see also mcmillian fdic cir,requiring exhaustion of warn act claim severance pay claim was filed with the fdic and disallowed received judicial review ladd second bank,failure to exhaust firrea administrative remedies created a jurisdictional bar requiring dismissal of plaintiff claims that the fdic,as receiver,violated the family and medical leave act in connection with her termination jinadu centrust mortgage,supra,at because plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies under firrea,trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over employment discrimination and other claims asserted against financial institution in receivership.
we reject the argument that saffer was not required to exhaust his administrative remedies because his claims were not susceptible of resolution through the process,due to their subject matter.saffer claims concerned the acts or omissions of a depository institution for which the fdic was appointed receiver,and he sought a monetary recovery.his claims were well within the realm of section,subdivision d d.see also benson,supra,at rejecting argument plaintiffs offered no reason to believe firrea exhaustion would have been futile had claims been timely submitted.
ii.naming jpmc as a defendant did not excuse saffer from exhausting firrea administrative remedies 
saffer further contends he was not required to exhaust administrative remedies to pursue his claims against jpmc as the successor bank.yet,several courts have concluded firrea exhaustion requirements apply even when a claim is asserted against a successor bank,rather than the failed bank or the fdic.section d d ii withdraws jurisdiction over any claim relating to any act or omission of a failed institution or the corporation as receiver.thus,as the ninth circuit court of appeals explained in benson,where a claim is functionally,albeit not formally,against a depository institution for which the fdic is receiver,it is a claim within the meaning of firrea administrative claims process.citation.firrea jurisdictional bar applies to claims asserted against a purchasing bank when the claim is based on the conduct of the failed institution.benson,supra,at,fn.omitted,citing am.ins.fdic,supra,at see also demelo,supra,at farnik,supra,at vill.of oakwood state bank trust cir,american first,lake forest park,cir,purchaser of challenged asset stood in the shoes of the rtc and acquired its protected status aber shukofsky,supra,d at stewart jpmorgan chase,schettler ralron capital,supra,at.
in benson,the court noted section d d ii distinguishes claims on their factual bases rather than on the identity of the defendant it asks whether claims relate to any act or omission of a failed institution or the fdic.notably,the provision does not make any distinction based on the identity of the party from whom relief is sought.benson,supra,at.since the benson plaintiffs claims concerned the actions of wamu,rather than independent conduct of jpmc,the plaintiffs were required to comply with firrea administrative exhaustion requirements 
here,all of saffer claims challenge the actions or omissions of the failed bank,wamu.the complaint contains no allegations that involve actions taken by any party after the receivership or the sale of wamu assets.instead,saffer seeks legal recourse for the conduct of wamu and wamu agents,before the fdic was appointed receiver,and before jpmc purchased wamu assets.there are no allegations based on jpmc own conduct,nor could there be given the time period relevant to saffer claims.these are squarely the kinds of claims that must first be presented to the fdic under section d d ii.tellado indymac mortg,supra,at claim that was wholly dependent on failed bank wrongdoing was subject to firrea exhaustion requirements.
we also find instructive the reasoning of the aber shukofsky court in its determination that the plaintiffs before it were required to exhaust claims asserted against jpmc.in that case,only wamu was alleged to have violated state wage and hour laws during the plaintiffs employment with wamu,well before wamu failure and seizure on september,the fdic appointment as receiver,and wamu acquisition by defendants.the court explained section d d ii refers to any claim relating to any act or omission of a failed institution and does not make its application contingent upon whom the claim is against.emphasis added.thus,the statutory provision,by its plain language,applies with equal force to a successor in interest to the failed institution.in short,given the plain language of firrea,the court finds that plaintiffs can not evade firrea mandatory exhaustion requirement simply by asserting claims against defendants,as purchasers of the failed bank assets,for acts or omissions that relate to wamu.aber shukofsky,supra d at westberg,supra,d at.
saffer additionally contends there is a possibility jpmc contractually assumed liability for claims such as his,but he was unable to determine whether this was the case without discovery,which the arbitrator improperly denied.he acknowledges a version of the purchase and assumption agreement between the fdic and jpmc is available on the fdic website,and other courts have taken judicial notice of that agreement and its legal effect.see,scott jpmorgan chase bank,th,trial court did not abuse its discretion in taking judicial notice of purchase and assumption agreement between jpmc and fdic,as posted on fdic website,as well as the legal effect of the agreement as transferring certain assets but not certain liabilities collecting similar cases.yet,he asserts there could be collateral agreements or modifications,thus the completeness of the agreement should not be a matter for judicial notice in this case.
several courts have rejected similar arguments regarding successor institutions.for example,in benson,the plaintiffs argued wamu knowingly provided banking services that facilitated a ponzi scheme,and jpmc was liable because it assumed wamu liabilities pursuant to a purchase and assumption agreement with the fdic.benson,supra,at.the court rejected this argument by relying on wamu alleged wrongdoing,plaintiffs claims plainly relat e to any act or omission of a depository institution for which the fdic has been appointed receiver.d d.and because plaintiffs did not exhaust administrative remedies,their claims are jurisdictionally barred by firrea.ibid.similarly,in aber shukofsky,the plaintiffs argued they were excused from the exhaustion requirements because jpmc accepted certain assets and liabilities as wamu successors in interest,and firrea was intended to protect the fdic,which was no longer operating as wamu receiver.aber shukofsky,supra.at.the court rejected this argument,concluding section d d ii referred to any claim relating to any act or omission of a failed institution,the plaintiff flsa claims related solely to wamu acts or omissions,and the provision applied with equal force to a successor in interest to a failed institution.aber shukofsky,supra,at.we find the reasoning persuasive 
iii.saffer was not excused from exhaustion requirements because of a lack of notice 
saffer additionally argues he was excused from following firrea claim process because he failed to receive adequate notice of the receivership,or the bar date,as a creditor of wamu.we again disagree.
firrea requires the fdic to provide two different kinds of notice.under section d b i ii,the fdic must promptly publish notice to creditors to present their claims to the receiver by the bar date,and republish the notice.the fdic must also mail a similar notice to any creditor shown on the failed institution books either i to the creditor last address appearing in the books,or ii upon discovery of the name and address of a claimant not appearing on the institution books within days after the discovery of such name and address.d c ii.as the first circuit court of appeals recently explained firrea only requires that the fdic mail notice to known creditors or claimants,see d c.demelo,supra,at.when,as here,the plaintiff claim is not advanced until after the financial institution has failed,the claims could not have been known to the fdic at the time of the receivership.notice was given by publication,and notice by publication is sufficient for inchoate claims.elmco,supra,at.the fdic was not required to mail notice to saffer after being appointed receiver of wamu.
moreover,we agree with the numerous courts concluding that even if the receiver fails to mail the required notice of the claims process and bar date,a plaintiff is not excused from exhausting administrative remedies.elmco,supra,at intercontinental,supra,at freeman,supra,at,meliezer resolution trust company cir,ladd second bank,supra.at.the only exception to the strict requirement of exhaustion of remedies,is where the claimant does not receive notice of the appointment of the receiver in time to file his claim.citation,d c.this exception will only apply if the plaintiff did not receive notice of the fact of the appointment of a receiver.the exception does not apply to claimants who are aware of the appointment of a receiver but who do not receive notice of the filing deadline.citation.rtc mortg.trust nz haith cir.further when there is sufficient inquiry notice of the receivership,the failure to receive mailed notice does not avoid the jurisdictional bar of the statute.ibid.even where the claimant may not know the exact nature of the receiver role,knowledge of the receiver involvement may sufficiently place the claimant on inquiry notice as to require further inquiry into the details of the administrative process.ibid.
here,the fdic published notice in the wall street journal,a national publication,on at least two occasions at the beginning and end of october.saffer claims accrued no later than january,when he resigned from wamu.he did not file his complaint until,well after the failure of wamu,the appointment of a receiver,and the passing of the bar date.this case is thus similar to tillman resolution trust cir tillman,which the elmco court described t he claimant in tillman was not one that the rtc discovered before its bar date.in fact,tillman did not assert his claims against the failed bank until months after that bank entered receivership.citation.also,his claim was not based on a standard arrangement,but on an alleged contract under which the bank had promised to reimburse him for expenses he incurred in the course of unrelated litigation.as a result,tillman interest appears not to have been known to rtc or to have been of a type that rtc should be required to discover on its own,and thus he fell within a class of claimants for whom notification by publication is sufficient.elmco,supra,at.
the elmco court found the tillman approach consistent with mullane central hanover tr,in which the supreme court explained notice by publication is sufficient for those whose interests are contingent,future,or not likely to come to a trustee attention in the normal course of business.this is in contrast to those with an identified,present property interest whose address is known or reasonably ascertainable as to such parties mere constructive notice by publication is insufficient.mullane,at.elmco,supra,at.
saffer had sufficient inquiry notice of the receivership.as a result,lack of notice did not excuse him from exhausting his administrative remedies under firrea.see demelo,supra,at rejecting lack of notice argument and successor liability arguments see also schettler ralron capital,supra,at successor in interest to fdic entitled to benefit from exhaustion provisions,despite fdic failure to mail required notice to plaintiff rathbun indymac mortg.servs.d,successor bank had no duty to provide notice any fdic failure to give notice did not render administrative claims process inapplicable bobick community southern bank,supra,at plaintiff required to exhaust claims against failed institution failure to exhaust not excused by failure of fdic to provide notice taylor anb bancshares,d,rejecting equitable tolling argument based on alleged inadequate notice by the fdic.
iv.saffer claim was insufficient to meet the exhaustion requirements 
similarly,to the extent saffer contends his claim filed in september was sufficient to satisfy the firrea exhaustion requirements,we disagree.in wujick dale dale,cir,the court of appeals rejected the very arguments saffer makes here.in wujick,the plaintiffs filed suit in pennsylvania state court against a failed depository institution.after filing their suit,they submitted an administrative claim to the receiver.the receiver removed the case to federal court.the appellate court concluded that at the time the plaintiffs filed suit,no court had subject matter jurisdiction over the suit because plaintiffs had failed to exhaust the administrative remedies mandated by section d d of firrea.id.at.the court rejected the plaintiffs argument that their belated filing of a claim should allow them to pursue their claims,under a no harm,no foul line of reasoning,since congress expressly withdrew jurisdiction from all courts over claims to a failed bank assets made outside the firrea procedures.id.at pp.the appellate court directed the lower court to dismiss the claims.id.at see also althouse resolution trust,supra,at failure to file timely claim bars claimant from receiving de novo review in court to receive de novo review the disallowance must be for other reasons potter jpmorgan chase bank,ca.may,no.cv cas agrx wl,potter under firrea,no court has subject matter jurisdiction to hear a claim filed with fdic after the bar date,unless the claim meets statutory exception for claims that could not have been filed before bar date.
as noted above,federal courts have routinely found the failure to file a claim with the fdic,before instituting litigation in court,prevents a court from having subject matter jurisdiction over covered claims.saffer cites carlyle,supra,for the proposition that firrea does not create a jurisdictional bar for claims,but we find carlyle inapposite.in carlyle,the court concluded firrea did not create a jurisdictional bar for claims accruing after the bar date,and thus untimely filed with the fdic after the bar date.carlyle,at.the reasoning of carlyle does not apply here,since saffer claims accrued well before the bar date,and he did not file a claim with the fdic before suing in court.
in miller,supra,and campbell,supra,the seventh circuit court of appeals,citing carlyle and recent united states supreme court jurisprudence,including henderson shinseki,concluded that while firrea bars claimants from going directly to court without first going through an administrative process,the time limits for submitting claims to the fdic are claims processing rules that are not jurisdictional,and thus may be subject to waiver,estoppel,or tolling.miller,supra,at campbell,supra,at.yet,campbell and miller do not conflict with the principle that firrea creates a jurisdictional bar when,as here,there is a wholesale failure to exhaust administrative remedies prior to filing suit,as to a claim arising well before the bar date.as the miller court explained,carlyle and campbell involved the fdic deadline for submitting claims to the agency,and the opinions addressed whether the failure to timely file deprived the district court of jurisdiction to entertain complaints seeking judicial review of the disallowed claims.miller,at,italics added.carlyle,campbell,and miller do not suggest a court may have subject matter jurisdiction over a claim where the plaintiff has not filed any claim with the fdic,timely or untimely,prior to filing suit in court.whether with a timely or untimely claim,a claimant must first complete the claims process before seeking judicial review.henderson bank of new england,supra,at.
as in wujick,saffer untimely filed claim with the fdic does not satisfy the firrea exhaustion requirements,and his claims were barred saffer claim arose well before the december bar date.it was not impossible for him to file the claims before the bar date because they had not yet arisen,or he had failed to discover them.he did not pursue his administrative remedies prior to filing suit against wamu.at the time he filed suit,no court had subject matter jurisdiction over his claims due to the failure to exhaust firrea remedies.robbins foothill nissan,supra,th at potter,supra,wl,see also bravo united states ass,cv env lb wl,fn.
no allegations support treating wolf differently 
finally,we must also reject saffer argument that he was not required to follow firrea claims procedures to pursue his claims against wolf.saffer complaint alleges wolf was his supervisor at wamu,and that all defendants were acting as agents of the other defendants.there are no specific allegations relating to wolf.thus,even though wolf was named as a defendant,it is clear the entire complaint alleges only claims relating to actions or omissions of the failed bank,wamu,and to the extent wolf was implicated,it was as an employee of wamu.exhaustion of those claims was necessary.friederichs gorz d,fn.plaintiffs had to exhaust against defendant related to failed institution where complaint was devoid of any substantive allegations against the related defendant brabant jp morgan chase bank,no.cv tuc jgz wl,firrea jurisdictional bar applied to claims against employees of the failed institution where plaintiffs claims are based on the wrongdoing alleged to have been committed by the individual as an employee of the failed institution.
ii.conclusion 
saffer failure to exhaust firrea administrative remedies before filing suit prevented the trial court from acquiring subject matter jurisdiction over his claims.i n the absence of subject matter jurisdiction,a trial court has no power to hear or determine the case.citation.varian,supra,cal th at.we acknowledge it would have been preferable for jpmc to raise saffer failure to exhaust under firrea much earlier in the process,rather than compelling the case to an unauthorized arbitration.however,t he administrative prerequisite to suit set forth in firrea has been strictly construed and is considered an absolute and unwaivable jurisdictional requirement this court has no power to excuse a condition precedent to jurisdiction regardless of the reason the condition was not met.citation.the doctrines of waiver and estoppel do not apply to subject matter jurisdiction determinations.brady,supra,at intercontinental,supra,at.we therefore direct the trial court to vacate the judgment and order the action dismissed.properties,supra,th at totten,supra,th at.

saffer filed his notice of appeal after the trial court entered an order denying his motion to vacate the arbitration award and confirming the award.however,no judgment was entered on the order at that time,making the appeal premature.cinel christopher th,cummings future nissan th.on november,we informed the parties of the absence of an appealable order or judgment in the record,and invited them to either augment the record with a judgment,or file letter briefs on the issue of this court jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.on november,appellant augmented the record with a judgment entered nunc pro tunc.we therefore treat saffer notice of appeal as filed immediately after entry of judgment.cal.rules of court,rule d.
we note that in at least two unpublished federal district court decisions,courts have refused to allow arbitration to proceed when the claims related to the actions or omissions of a failed financial institution,and the plaintiffs had not yet exhausted mandatory administrative remedies under firrea or a similar statute.multibank sfr venture llc saunders,cv jcm cwh wl enjoining arbitration against purchaser of failed bank assets where plaintiffs had not first exhausted administrative remedies pursuant to firrea ncua bd.lormet cmty fed.credit union,cv wl concluding claims falling within the purview of the federal credit union act,which has limitations on judicial review nearly identical to those of firrea,may not be arbitrated defendant could not avoid administrative claims procedure by relying on an arbitration provision.
at least one court has concluded that while firrea administrative exhaustion requirements are jurisdictional,certain time limits set forth in the statute are directory claims processing rules.see miller fdic cir miller and campbell federal deposit insurance corporation campbell cir,see also carlyle towers condo ass fdic cir.as discussed in greater detail below,the reasoning of these cases does not aid saffer,since he completely failed to exhaust administrative remedies under firrea prior to filing suit.
