in what appears to be an issue of first impression in california,we must determine whether the ostermans are entitled to prejudgment interest between the time the trial court vacated the arbitration award in their favor and our reinstatement of the award in the previous appeal in this case.stated another way,we must determine whether the trial court erred in suspending the accrual of prejudgment interest,subd.a hereafter section we conclude that prejudgment interest accrued during the pendency of the appeal in tenzera i,and no statutory exception applies.thus,the trial court erred in suspending the accrual of interest during the previous appeal in this case.accordingly,we reverse in part,affirm in part,and remand the matter to enable the trial court to consider the ostermans attorney fees request and to amend the judgment to recalculate prejudgment interest.
