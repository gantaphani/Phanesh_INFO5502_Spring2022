because arbitration is a matter of contract,generally one must be a party to an arbitration agreement to be bound by it or invoke it.molecular analytical,supra,th at accord,matthau superior court th,right to arbitration depends on a contract and a party can be compelled to submit a dispute to arbitration only if the party has agreed in writing to do so.however,both california and federal courts have recognized limited exceptions to this rule,allowing nonsignatories to an agreement containing an arbitration clause to compel arbitration of,or be compelled to arbitrate,a dispute arising within the scope of that agreement.see suh superior court th,describing six theories by which a nonsignatory may compel or be bound to arbitrate a incorporation by reference b assumption c agency d or alter ego e estoppel and f beneficiary boucher alliance title company,th,boucher same,citing federal cases see also ryan sons,rhone poulenc textile cir.
these exceptions to the general rule that one must be a party to an arbitration agreement to invoke it or be bound by it generally are based on the existence of a relationship between the nonsignatory and the signatory,such as principal and agent or employer and employee,where a sufficient identity of interest exists between them.jones jacobson,supra,th at,fn.accord,thomas westlake th,allegations in complaint that defendants acted as agents of one another sufficient to allow alleged to compel arbitration westra marcus millichap real estate inv.brokerage,th,t he common thread in these cases is the existence of an agency or similar relationship between the nonsignatory and one of the parties to the arbitration agreement see,dryer los angeles rams cal d,defendants who were sued as agents of corporate defendant,a signatory to arbitration agreement,could invoke the arbitration clause as to claims arising out of arbitration agreement,even though they were not signatories to contract county of contra costa kaiser foundation health plan,th,describing third party beneficiary exception.
in allowing zsc,a nonsignatory to the arbitration agreement,to compel arbitration in the instant case,the trial court relied on the doctrine of equitable estoppel,concluding dms claims against zsc were based on,and inextricably intertwined with,the deductible agreements containing the arbitration clause.under this theory,a nonsignatory defendant may invoke an arbitration clause to compel a signatory plaintiff to arbitrate its claim when the causes of action against the nonsignatory are intimately founded in and intertwined with the underlying contract obligations.molecular analytical,supra,th at accord,boucher,supra,th at goldman kpmg,llp th,goldman jsm,supra,th at doctrine of equitable estoppel may also apply to permit signatory to arbitration agreement to compel nonsignatory to arbitrate.the reason for this equitable rule is plain one should not be permitted to rely on an agreement containing an arbitration clause for its claims,while at the same time repudiating the arbitration provision contained in the same contract.see jones jacobson,supra,th at purpose of equitable estoppel doctrine is to prevent a party from using the terms or obligations of an agreement as the basis for his or her claims against a nonsignatory,while at the same time refusing to arbitrate with the nonsignatory under another clause of that same agreement boucher,at a party may not make use of a contract containing an arbitration clause and then attempt to avoid the duty to arbitrate by defining the forum in which the dispute will be resolved molecular analytical,at t he rule applies to prevent parties from trifling with their contractual obligations.
the trial court erred in compelling arbitration under the doctrine of equitable estoppel because dms claims against zsc are not founded in,or inextricably intertwined with,the deductible agreement containing the arbitration clause 
zsc contends equitable estoppel was properly applied in this case because dms claims against it are inextricably intertwined with the deductible agreements containing the arbitration clause.an examination of the complaint,however,reveals otherwise.see goldman,supra,th at b ecause equitable estoppel applies only if plaintiffs claims against the nonsignatory are dependent upon,or inextricably bound up with,the obligations imposed by the contract plaintiff has signed with the signatory defendant,we examine the facts alleged in the complaints molecular analytical,supra,th at same.
dms complaint alleges zsc breached its administrator duties under the claims administration agreement it does not allege,nor could it against zsc,a breach of the deductible or policy agreements to which zsc is not a party.similarly,it does not rely on any provision in those agreements to support its claims.see,jones jacobson,supra,th at o f the causes of action asserted by the joneses,only two are based on contract and both of those causes of action are against the jacobson appellants for breach of the joint venture agreement,which has nothing to do with the account agreement containing the arbitration clause boucher,supra,th at where employee sued employer and employer successor under employment contract containing arbitration agreement,successor,a nonsignatory to agreement,could invoke arbitration clause under doctrine of equitable estoppel molecular analytical,supra,th at where plaintiff sued defendant and defendant assignee pursuant to plaintiff contract with defendant containing arbitration provision,equitable estoppel permitted defendant assignee,a nonsignatory to the arbitration agreement,to compel arbitration of plaintiff complaint.accordingly,there is no basis to find that the complaint against zsc for breaching the claims administration agreement is intimately founded in the deductible agreement containing the arbitration clause.see goldman,supra,th at the sine qua non for allowing a nonsignatory to enforce an arbitration clause based on equitable estoppel is that the claims the plaintiff asserts against the nonsignatory are dependent on or inextricably bound up with the contractual obligations of the agreement containing the arbitration clause.because the contractual obligations in the operating agreements were unrelated to the plaintiff claims against the nonsignatory accountants and lawyers,there is no basis in equity for preventing the plaintiffs from suing the accountants and lawyers in court.
in support of its equitable estoppel argument,zsc contends,as it did successfully in the trial court,the instant case is on all fours with ns holdings llc american international group,sacv dist.lexis ns holdings.american international group,aig and american international specialty lines insurance company aislic had issued a series of insurance policies to ns holdings.chartis claims chartis,pursuant to a contract with aislic,was aislic claims administrator.aislic contract with ns holdings included an arbitration provision aig contract with ns holdings did not.pursuant to each of the insurance contracts,all claims against the policies were to be submitted to aig even though the policies themselves were under aislic name.
