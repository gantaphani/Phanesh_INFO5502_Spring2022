facts and procedural background 
szynalski is a defendant in this action,entitled rosenthal company llc.alexander alex szynalski aka alexander alex goen,et case number,which case was filed in respondent court.this case arises from an underlying class action lawsuit,belkins la rosa nutramerica,et case number belkins case,which case was also filed in respondent court,and in which szynalski is a named defendant.
szynalski filed a motion to quash service of the summons and complaint in the belkins case on the ground that he was not subject to personal jurisdiction in the state of california.that case,however,settled prior to the hearing on szynalski motion to quash.the settlement agreement was among belkins la rosa,individually,and on behalf of the settlement class,on the one hand,and nutramerica corporation,trimspa corporation,goen technologies corporation,and szynalski,on the other hand.as part of the settlement agreement,the parties agreed to retain a settlement administrator to administer the settlement.the defendants in that case,including szynalski,agreed to pay the settlement administrator costs and fees associated with administering the settlement agreement.
the settlement agreement contains the following provisions all disputes relating to the settlement administrator ability and need to perform its duties shall be referred to the court,if necessary,which will have continuing jurisdiction over the terms and conditions of the settlement agreement,until all payments and obligations contemplated by the settlement agreement have been fully carried out.the parties acknowledge that alex szynalski,aka alex goen,has specially appeared in this action for sole purpose of contesting the assertion of jurisdiction over him by the los angeles county,california,superior court.szynalski moved to quash plaintiff service of summons on him on the grounds that he was not subject to the jurisdiction of los angeles county,california,superior court.the parties and the court subsequently agreed that the court need not yet rule on that motion.consequently,szynalski has not generally appeared in this action nor has he submitted to the los angeles county,california,superior court jurisdiction.in light of the foregoing,the parties agree that szynalski enters this settlement agreement in the state of new jersey.
all parties to the belkins case signed the settlement agreement,including szynalski on his own behalf and on behalf of the other defendants,and it was submitted to respondent court for an order granting final approval of the agreement.as part of respondent court order,real party in interest rosenthal rosenthal was confirmed as the settlement administrator,and jurisdiction was retained by respondent court as to all matters relating to the administration,consummation,enforcement and interpretation of the settlement agreement.
rosenthal undertook to administer the settlement agreement in compliance with respondent court order.rosenthal filed an action against szynalski and the three companies of which szynalski had been president for for services in administering the settlement in the belkins case.the claims were based on theories of an oral agreement,implied agreement,and third party beneficiary contract.after rosenthal filed its action,the defendants,including szynalski,removed the action to the united states district court based on diversity.the federal court remanded the action to respondent court on the ground that respondent court had retained jurisdiction over matters relating to the settlement agreement,including payment obligations to rosenthal.szynalski then brought a motion in respondent court to quash service of the summons and complaint.szynalski asserted that he is a resident of new jersey,and has never lived,voted or had any license in california.he had been president of companies that potentially did business in california,but he personally never did business in california.szynalski further argued that neither the settlement agreement nor the court order approving it conferred jurisdiction over him.respondent court denied szynalski motion.we issued an order to show cause.we received a return to the petition from szynalski as real party in interest and his request for judicial notice 
burden of proof and standard of review 
when a nonresident defendant challenges personal jurisdiction,the plaintiff has the initial burden of demonstrating facts justifying the exercise of jurisdiction.vons companies,seabest foods,cal th,d,vons.this burden applies to minimum contacts and consent for purposes of personal jurisdiction.see snowney harrah entertainment,cal th,d,holland america line wärtsilä north amer.cir.if the plaintiff meets this initial burden,then the defendant has the burden of demonstrating that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable.pavlovich superior court cal th,d,snowney harrah entertainment,supra,cal th at,d.when no conflict in the evidence exists,the question of jurisdiction is purely one of law and the reviewing court engages in an independent review of the record.citation.vons,supra,cal th at,d.
discussion 
jurisdiction principles.specific jurisdiction 
california courts may exercise jurisdiction over nonresidents on any basis not inconsistent with the constitution of this state or of the united states.code civ.code of civil procedure section manifests an intent to exercise the broadest possible jurisdiction,limited only by constitutional considerations.sibley superior court cal d.the united states constitution permits a state to exercise jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant if the defendant has sufficient minimum contacts with the forum such that maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.citations.internat.shoe washington.the substantial connection citations,between the defendant and the forum state necessary for a finding of minimum contacts must come about by an action of the defendant purposefully directed toward the forum state.citations.asahi metal industry superior court,d.
personal jurisdiction may be either general or specific.vons,supra,cal th at,d.when determining whether specific jurisdiction exists,courts consider the relationship among the defendant,the forum,and the litigation.helicopteros nacionales de colombia hall,d,quoting shaffer heitner,d.a court may exercise specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant only if the defendant has purposefully availed himself or herself of forum benefits vons,supra,cal th at d,the controversy is related to or arises out of the defendant contacts with the forum,quoting helicopteros,supra,at.at and the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with fair play and substantial justice vons,supra,cal th at d,quoting burger king rudzewicz,d burger king.pavlovich superior court,supra,cal th at,d,see snowney harrah entertainment,supra,cal th at,d.
due process permits the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant,inter alia,when the defendant consents to jurisdiction.muckle superior court th,d see burnham superior court of california,marin county,d.a party,even one who has no minimum contacts with this state,may consent to jurisdiction in a particular case.estate of heil d.see witkin,cal.procedure ed.jurisdiction.a person consent to jurisdiction may be expressed by words or by conduct.rest d,conf.of law,cmt.a.

szynalski contentions 
szynalski argues that he does not have minimum contacts with california sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over him.he adds that his mere presence in california to negotiate and sign the settlement agreement in the belkins case does not,standing alone,grant the state personal jurisdiction over him.he argues that he specifically disclaimed any personal jurisdiction when he entered into the settlement agreement and that any agreement with rosenthal was a separate,oral agreement,not subject to any of the provisions in the settlement agreement for jurisdictional purposes.szynalski also contends that although the settlement agreement provides for jurisdiction over all disputes related to the settlement administrator ability and need to perform its duties italics added,it says nothing about jurisdiction regarding the retention of or terms with the settlement administrator,including payment of the settlement administrator.szynalski argues that the retention of jurisdiction provision in the settlement agreement and court order only apply to matters relating to the administration,consummation,enforcement and interpretation of the settlement agreement,not to rosenthal seeking damages under a separate oral contract.
jurisdiction over szynalski 
there is authority for the proposition that a party presence in the state for settlement negotiations may not necessarily result in personal jurisdiction over the party in that state.see north american catholic educational programming foundation,cardinale d,north american the court has serious misgivings about construing an attempt at settlement within a particular forum as a jurisdictional contact red wing shoe,offer for a license within a cease and desist letter likened to offer of settlement,and alone,does not confer personal jurisdiction holdings,proteq telecommunications,cir,courts have hesitated to use unsuccessful settlement discussions as contacts for jurisdictional purposes in re shipowners litigation,but see labonte preyer,settlement discussions by agent can confer jurisdiction over principal.but szynalski actions in california were more than mere settlement negotiations.
although szynalski disputed that he was subject to personal jurisdiction in california for purposes of the underlying class action,he not only settled that action,he sought and obtained judicial approval from a california court of that settlement agreement,and,as part of the settlement agreement,agreed to retain the settlement administrator and to pay the settlement administrator fees.see north american,supra,d at although misgivings about attempt at settlement conferring jurisdiction,result might be otherwise were this litigation intended to remedy a breach of a settlement agreement that had been negotiated or executed in the forum state.szynalski thereafter accepted the benefits of the settlement administrator efforts.in approving the settlement,respondent court in the belkins case issued an order,not challenged by szynalski,that stated that respondent court would retain jurisdiction as to all matters relating to the administration,consummation,enforcement and interpretation of the settlement agreement.italics added.by virtue of that order,respondent court retained the right to enforce szynalski obligation to pay the admininstrator.
by obtaining court approval of the settlement,retaining a administrator,accepting the benefits of the administrator services,and agreeing to pay the administrator with the understanding that respondent court retained jurisdiction to adjudicate issues relating to the settlement consented to jurisdiction in california for the purpose of adjudicating issues arising out of the settlement agreement.payment of the administrator is a matter arising out of the settlement agreement.
in addition,szynalski,by accepting the benefits of a california settlement administrator performing services in california as part of a california case,and undertaking to pay the administrator in california,has purposefully avail ed himself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state,thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.hanson denckla,d see burger king,supra,at.the controversy arises out of szynalski contracts with settlement agreement and court order.accordingly,he has sufficient minimum contacts with california to support specific jurisdiction over him in the administrator action for payment,regardless of whether the petitioner might have been subject to california court jurisdiction in the belkins case.see fireman fund ins.national bank of cooperatives,supra,at see also vorys,sater,seymour pease ryan d.a california resident who intervenes in ohio litigation and goes there for negotiation resolving the litigation has sufficient minimum contacts with ohio to enable its courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over him in an action by his ohio attorney for attorneys fees minnesota min.nippon carbide industries cir,court may use personal jurisdiction in action to enforce a settlement agreement over a party that entered the forum state to negotiate and execute the agreement.
it should be no great burden on szynalski to litigate in california a case involving the california settlement administrator with whom he had been dealing.as a california court appointed the settlement administrator and retained jurisdiction over the matter,california has an interest in adjudicating the dispute.the plaintiff,rosenthal,has an interest in having the court that appointed it adjudicate the dispute.as the california court retained jurisdiction over the settlement,resolution of this dispute in california is an efficient way of handling the matter and is consistent with a policy of not having a multiplicity of jurisdictions involved.in view of these factors asahi metal industry superior court of california,solano county,supra,at.volkswagen woodson,d,the exercise of personal jurisdiction over syznalski is not unreasonable.under the circumstances in this case,the exercise of jurisdiction over szynalski in this case does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.burger,supra,at.accordingly,the three prongs or requirements necessary to establish availment,relatedness,and fairness and reasonableness see snowney,supra,cal th at,d,have been met.
reservation 
that szynalski purported in the settlement agreement to reserve his contention concerning personal jurisdiction is to no avail here.rosenthal was not a party to that agreement.moreover,it is szynalski conduct and his consent to jurisdiction in connection with this specific matter that control.one can not alter by reservation the personal jurisdiction conferred by minimum contacts or consent.it has been stated that private parties can not divest a court of personal jurisdiction by agreement.smith,valentino smith,superior court cal d,it is true that the parties may not deprive courts of their jurisdiction over
