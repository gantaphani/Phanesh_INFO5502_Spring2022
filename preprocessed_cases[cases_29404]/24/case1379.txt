appellant has moved to dismiss this appeal on the ground that the dispute between the parties was resolved by a settlement agreement.we shall grant the unopposed request.
the remaining issue is whether counsel lengthy delay in notifying the court of the settlement,in violation of rule of the california rules of court,warrants imposition of monetary sanctions.the rules of court authorize the imposition of sanctions on a party or an attorney not only for the filing of a frivolous appeal or motion or for including in the record matters not reasonably material to the appeal,but also for c ommitting any other unreasonable violation of these rules.cal.rules of court,rule a.we shall impose monetary sanctions payable to the court on appellant counsel because,as we explain,his violation of rule is not just unsatisfactorily explained and unreasonable but also injurious to the court,other appellate parties,and the taxpayers.
this appeal is from a december,order of the lake county superior court directing appellant to pay a discovery sanction of.appellant counsel,andrew dimitriou,filed appellant opening brief and two volumes of appendices on july.respondent counsel,elizabeth brekhus,thereafter informed deputy clerk stacy wheeler that respondent did not wish to file a responsive brief and understood that,pursuant to rule of the california rules of court,the court would decide the appeal on the record,the opening brief,and any oral argument appellant might wish to present.
on october,the standard oral argument waiver notice was issued to counsel for the parties,the first paragraph of which states as follows 
this case is now fully briefed and has been tentatively assigned to the judicial panel indicated below.counsel are directed to advise the court immediately if settlement discussions are underway or are being considered or if there is any other basis for an early dismissal of the appeal.emphasis in original 
that notice further states that if either party feels oral argument is necessary,a written request with proof service must be filed with the court within days from the date of the notice.
on october,dimitriou filed appellant request for oral argument.on august,the court sent counsel for the parties an order setting the appeal for oral argument on september,at 
the day before that set for oral argument an associate of dimitriou faxed the presiding justice of this division a letter notifying him that the underlying case was settled in december and dismissed in the trial court in january,and requesting that the appeal be taken off calendar.that same day we issued an order granting the request to take the matter off the calendar and directing counsel for the parties to file a joint declaration,under penalty of perjury,explaining why counsel did not inform this court that settlement discussions were underway pursuant to this court notice to the parties dated october,why a request for dismissal was not filed with this court once settlement had culminated and why this court should not impose sanctions on counsel for their failure to timely inform this court of the above actions.
in response to the foregoing order counsel filed a joint declaration stating in material part that on october,the date of our standard oral argument waiver notice,settlement discussions were not underway or being considered,and the case did not settle until november.according to the declaration,a letter was sent by an unidentified person on an unspecified date to deputy clerk wheeler informing her of the settlement and that in light of the settlement the appeal would be mooted.because the joint declaration was not,as directed,made under penalty of perjury,we issued an order directing the parties to file a new joint declaration complying with that directive no later than october.the parties have never complied with that order.
on october,respondent counsel elizabeth brekhus and peter brekhus,on behalf only of themselves,filed a letter and accompanying declaration under penalty of perjury explaining that their client had instructed them not to file a response to the appeal or incur any more money in connection with his motion in the trial court to compel discovery because the discovery sanctions ordered by the trial court did not come close to covering the costs he incurred as a result of the litigation.the client instructions were the same with respect to settlement,brekhus was directed to keep costs down and make appellant incur the expenses of drafting the agreement and effecting the settlement and dismissal.brekhus specifically recalled that she insisted and dimitriou agreed to take the necessary steps to dismiss the appeal.accordingly,the draft joint declaration prepared by respondent counsel,stated that dimitriou advised respondent that whatever the procedure is,are or were,appellant would follow them and the exact words were proper procedures would be followed to advise the appellate court to take the appeal off calendar.dimitriou law firm asked that this sentence be deleted as we do not have a recollection of this statement.dimitriou also asked for the addition of a statement that appellant counsel had telephoned the appellate court and informed the clerk that we were going to dismiss the action because the case had settled.peter brekhus revised the proposed joint declaration by deleting the sentence dimitriou objected to and adding instead the statement that a ppellant counsel advised respondent that it sic would take appropriate steps to take the appeal off calendar.the revision also added the statements that o n november,appellant counsel telephoned and informed clerk stacy wheeler that the case was going to be dismissed because the case had settled.the clerk requested that counsel write a letter to this effect,and a letter addressed to the attention of wheeler informing her of the settlement and that in light of the settlement the appeal would be mooted was sent.however,the letter transmitting the revised joint declaration to dimitriou asked him,are you sure that the court was advised by letter in november of the settlement we did not receive such a letter.maybe a copy of it should be attached.dimitriou responded in writing,stating,we are sure that the court was advised by letter.dimitriou did not,however,provide a copy of the alleged letter.
on october,dimitriou filed a letter and declaration in response to our september,order inquiring why sanctions should not be imposed on counsel for their failure to timely inform the court of the settlement and why a request to dismiss the appeal had not then or ever been filed.dimitriou states in his declaration that he received notice of oral argument right before he left for vacation and requested that his associate contact the court and remind the court the case had settled.dimitriou declaration also states he does not recall ever stating to brekhus that he would take care of dismissing the appeal.
dimitriou declaration also asserts that on november,he or an associate telephoned deputy clerk wheeler to advise of the settlement discussions and settlement of the underlying action placed on the record in the trial court and after the clerk refused to accept an oral advisement and requested written notice sent the court a letter that same day advising that the underlying case had settled.the letter,which is attached to the declaration as exhibit a,is a file copy of an unsigned letter without a letterhead from dimitriou to the clerk of this court,dated november,advising the court that the underlying case has settled which for all intensive sic purposes moots the issues on appeal.the parties are in the process of distributing a written settlement agreement.with the court indulgence,once the settlement agreement is fully and properly executed,appellant will dismiss her appeal.we anticipate this occurring within the next week.
a request to dismiss the appeal was not filed by dimitriou on behalf of appellant within the next week,but nearly a year later on october,simultaneously with dimitriou response to our september,order relating to sanctions.moreover,there is reason to question the veracity of dimitriou representation regarding
