the federal arbitration act codifies congress desire to uphold private arbitration agreements that produce prompt and fair dispute resolution without involving the courts.in furtherance of this interest,a court must scrupulously honor the bargains implicit in such agreements and interfere only when an award is severely problematic.see,mcmahon,d.this appeal asks us to determine whether or not an arbitration award should be upheld where an arbitrator inexplicably cites language in his decision that can not be found in the relevant collective bargaining agreement.because we conclude that such a mistake,while glaring,does not fatally taint the balance of the arbitrator decision in this case,we affirm the decision of the district court upholding the award.
factual background 
brentwood medical associates bma and the united mine workers of america umwa are parties to a collective bargaining agreement that covers the terms and conditions of employment for a unit of employees at bma facility in brentwood,pennsylvania.this agreement provides a mandatory grievance and arbitration procedure for disputes between the parties.arbitration of grievances is conducted by an arbitrator chosen from a panel,and that arbitrator decision shall be final and binding upon the employees,the union and the employer.joint appendix at.under the agreement,an arbitrator is explicitly prevented from add ing to,subtract ing from,or modify ing in any way any of the provisions,terms or conditions of the agreement.id.
the grievance that gave rise to this appeal alleged that bma violated the collective bargaining agreement when it refused to allow a union member to exercise her seniority rights under article viii.in february,denise cope a member of umwa was offered the position of charge entry associate,for which she left her position as a phlebotomist.on november,bma announced it would be abolishing the charge entry associate classification effective november.cope requested permission to bump outside her classification of charge entry associate and return to her position as a phlebotomist,thereby displacing the least senior person in that classification.this request was refused,and bma instead offered cope the position of front office clerk 
on november,cope filed a grievance with bma pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement,claiming that bma had violated article viii,sections,and on february,bma denied this grievance.bma and umwa then proceeded to binding arbitration pursuant to article xiv of the collective bargaining agreement.arbitrator john felice was selected to conduct the arbitration,and on august,he issued a decision sustaining the grievance and ordering bma to permit cope to exercise her seniority rights and bump the least senior phlebotomist.at.in that decision,the arbitrator asked rhetorically why,if bumping was not permitted under the collective bargaining agreement as bma contended,was the following language governing bumping present in article viii,section 
employees who exercise seniority rights and bump must have the skill,qualifications,ability and physical fitness to perform all of the work remaining in that classification 
at.this language does not exist in either article viii,section,or anywhere else in the collective bargaining agreement.
bma filed a complaint with the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania pursuant to section of the labor management relations act of,as amended,et,seeking to vacate the award.the parties filed for summary judgment,and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of umwa on march.adopting the appropriate deferential standard of review,the district court concluded that the parties had agreed that an arbitration award would be final and binding,and the arbitrator decision reached a rational result consistent with the terms of the agreement.at.

a collective bargaining agreement represents a contractual accord reached between an employer and its employees.if such a contract includes an arbitration clause,it is assumed that the parties bargained for a grievance resolution procedure in which an arbitrator would interpret the agreement.it is thus not the role of a court to correct factual or legal errors made by an arbitrator.major league umpires ass american league of professional baseball clubs,cir.a district court may determine only whether or not an arbitrator award draws its essence from the parties collective bargaining agreement,united paperworkers int l union,misco,d,and we apply this same standard in reviewing the arbitration award.pennsylvania power local union of the int l of workers,cir.once a court is satisfied that an arbitrator award draws its essence from a collective bargaining agreement,it is without jurisdiction to consider the award further.

bma contends that the arbitrator exceeded his authority when he added language to the collective bargaining agreement supporting his conclusion that cope could bump a less senior employee in a different classification,which signals a violation of a.if this alleged overstep by the arbitrator is the only leg that supports his decision,it is within our discretion to vacate the award.therefore,the narrow issue before us is whether the arbitrator conclusion is supported,in any way,by a rational interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement.we reiterate that it is our duty to resist the urge to conduct de novo review of the award on the merits.see united paperworkers union,at.we are not authorized to reconsider the merits of an award even though the parties may allege that the award rests on errors of fact or on misinterpretation of the contract.rather,we ask merely whether the parties to the collective bargaining agreement got what they bargained for,namely an arbitrator who would first provide an interpretation of the contract that was rationally based on the language of the agreement,and second would produce a rational award.bma contends that the arbitrator reference to the language not found in the collective bargaining agreement fatally taints the award,because this reference is essential to the arbitrator ultimate conclusion and is inseparable from the remainder of the award.as such,our focus must be on whether the arbitrator discussion can still support the award if we excise the anomalous language.we believe that it does provide such support.
the arbitrator first stated that he was confronted with contrary interpretations of article viii,section offered by bma and umwa.as framed by the parties,the issue before the arbitrator was essentially whether use of the plural term classifications in article viii,section enables employees affected by layoff to exercise their seniority rights by bumping into another classification.after taking notice of the fact that arbitrators generally hold seniority provisions to be at the heart of any collective bargaining agreement,he set about reviewing the agreement various provisions.the arbitrator pronounced that a conjunctive interpretation of article viii of the collective bargaining agreement leads to the inescapable conclusion that the parties have consistently recognized seniority preference at.this is born out by a review of the collective bargaining agreement.article viii,section,expressly identifies seniority in terms of the entire bargaining unit.section of that article goes on to say that seniority rights apply only as expressly provided for in the agreement.this is a clear basis upon which the arbitrator could have concluded that seniority preference existed this alone provides ample basis to uphold the award.
in additional support for his conclusion,the arbitrator cited several provisions of the agreement 
for example,section defines seniority as bargaining and not within classification.section provides that the principle of seniority is a factor in layoffs,recalls and certain types of promotional opportunities provided the employee is fully qualified.section specifies that in filling vacancies when the qualifications of two or more applicants are relatively equal,preference will be based on seniority.section,specifies that when the employer decides to affect a recall from layoff,it will consider employees with recall rights first within the classification from which they were laid off,then by seniority,the most senior first,based upon the position preferences on the designated forms.this proviso obviously entitles senior employees to be recalled in reverse order of layoff to a position other than to the position from which they were laid off,provided they are qualified.
id.furthermore,he explained 
the language in inverse order of seniority in the classification affected in article viii,section of the collective bargaining agreement can not be interpreted to prohibit senior employees affected by a layoff from exercising their bargaining seniority rights and bump less senior employees outside of their classification,provided they are qualified.
at.the arbitrator concluded his review by noting that no provision in article viii of the agreement would prevent bumping bargaining.at.
after reviewing the totality of the arbitrator decision,we are confident that his award does not rest solely upon the aberrant language added by the arbitrator.while it is true that the clearest support for the arbitrator conclusion comes from the language he interpolated there is sufficient substance in the remainder of the discussion to pass the minimum rationality threshold.faced with what he perceived as an incongruity between bma position and the bargaining seniority rights of employees,the arbitrator attempted to construe together,and then give effect to,all provisions of the agreement.while bma may take issue with his contractual interpretation,this is not sufficient to justify vacatur of the award by this court.see major league baseball players ass garvey,d per curiam if an arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,the fact that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.internal quotations omitted.
bma entire argument rests on the arbitrator inexplicable quotation of language that was not present in the agreement.certainly,this was a mistake.moreover,this mistake clearly violates article xiv,section prohibition against the arbitrator adding to,subtracting from,or modifying the agreement.nonetheless,this error is insufficient to warrant vacation of the award.judicial review of the arbitrator decision would annul the bargain between bma and umwa for an arbitrator construction of their agreement and replace it with a judicial interpretation that was not bargained for.stroehmann bakeries,at.only where there is manifest disregard for the agreement can we override an arbitrator.because the remainder of the justification for the award offered by the arbitrator was capable of separation from the aberrant language,his decision reflects an interpretation of the contract that is at least minimally rooted in the collective bargaining agreement,and not his own brand of industrial justice.united paperworkers intern.union,at.consequently,the arbitrator error was harmless,since he would have arrived at the conclusion he reached here,even absent the discussion of the aberrant language.as such,our inquiry into the award has reached its jurisdictional limit,and we must uphold it.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the decision of the district court.
i believe this case presents the rare situation in which it is appropriate for our court to vacate an arbitration award.therefore,i respectfully dissent.
although our review of arbitration awards stated by my colleagues in the deferential,courts are nonetheless neither entitled nor encouraged to simply rubber stamp the interpretations and decisions of arbitrators.matteson ryder,cir.the federal courts retain a significant role in the review of labor arbitration awards and may vacate awards under certain circumstances.id.at.one such circumstance occurs when the arbitrator shows manifest disregard for the terms of the collective bargaining agreement cba or agreement at issue.see,major league umpires ass am.league of prof l baseball clubs,cir,cert.denied,d,wl a n award may be vacated if the arbitrator demonstrates manifest disregard for the cba.newark morning ledger newark typographical union local,cir i n that rarest case of manifest disregard of the collective bargaining agreement,the court must draw the line.internal quotation omitted.
an arbitrator derives authority from the terms of the cba and the scope of the issues submitted by the parties.major league umpires ass n,at.in this case,the cba provides that an arbitrator decision is final and binding on the parties.cba art.xiv step.importantly,the cba also explicitly states that t he arbitrator shall not add to,subtract from,or modify in any way any of the provisions,terms o r conditions of this agreement.id.emphasis added.despite this language,it is undisputed that,in rendering an arbitration award in favor of the union,the arbitrator modified the language in the cba to include a provision allowing for bumping where no such provision exists in the actual text of the cba in doing so,the arbitrator violated the provision of the cba that prohibited him from modifying its terms.he thus exceeded the scope of his contractually delegated authority.pennsylvania power local union,cir vacating an arbitration award because the arbitrator exceeded his powers under the cba by altering the cba in direct violation of the cba provision that he had no power to do so.see also a providing that a federal court may vacate an arbitration award where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.because,s imply stated,an arbitrator may not venture beyond the bounds of his or her authority,major league umpires ass n,at internal quotation omitted,i would vacate the arbitration award on this ground alone.
my colleagues in the majority recognize that the arbitrator inexplicable quotation of language not in the cba was a clear violation of article iv of that agreement.they nevertheless conclude that the arbitrator award can not be vacated because it was rationally based on the language of the cba.i agree,of course,that an arbitration award must be upheld if it is in any rational way related to the language of the agreement.see,id.at.but i do not agree that this standar
