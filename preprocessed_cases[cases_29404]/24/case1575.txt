introduction 
defendant,universal city studios,has filed a mandate petition which seeks to compel the respondent court to seal various documents pertinent to an arbitration dispute.we do not at this juncture decide the merits of defendant mandate petition.this is because in conjunction with the mandate petition,defendant has filed a motion with the clerk of this court to seal the aforementioned documents pursuant to california rules of court,rule e as required by rule e,we permitted the aforementioned documents to be conditionally lodged under seal pending resolution of the merits of defendant sealing request.additionally,after we issued several orders,defendant sought to narrow its sealing request to include only two documents.the two documents consist of an october,settlement agreement and a june,stipulation and sealing order in a federal case.we conclude the sealing requests pending before us should be denied.hence,we will return the aforementioned documents to defendant as required by rule e.
without the foregoing documents,the denial of defendant mandate petition is now foreordained because it will not be supported by the documents it seeks to have sealed.rule c sherwood superior court cal d.but we are required by rule e to return the documents to defendant.we will allow defendant days to file any supporting documents it wishes,but they must not be lodged under seal.we will defer final decision on the merits of the mandate petition for days.
ii.procedural history 
proceedings in the respondent court 
on november,plaintiff,unity pictures corporation,filed its complaint for rescission of the arbitration clause in the october,settlement agreement fraud and declaratory relief.the complaint,which is not sealed,alleged that the october,settlement agreement provided for strict confidentiality of its terms.hence,the complaint indicated,further more specific facts would be alleged only when a sealing order had been secured.the first cause of action for rescission of the arbitration clause in the october,agreement alleged defendant made material misrepresentations concerning the arbitration clause in the october,agreement plaintiff relied on those misrepresentations and on october,plaintiff gave notice of rescission of the arbitration clause in the october,agreement.the second cause of action alleged that defendant misrepresentations as to the arbitration clause were fraudulent and intended to deceive plaintiff the misrepresentations concerning the arbitration clause in the october,agreement were made with the intent of depriving plaintiff of its rights plaintiff had been damaged because it had expended money for attorney fees,costs,and arbitrator expenses and plaintiff was entitled to an award of punitive damages.the third cause of action for declaratory relief alleged a controversy had arisen between plaintiff and defendant plaintiff had various claims it could bring against defendant plaintiff contended the statute of limitations on those claims had been tolled,but defendant contended the statute of limitations had not been tolled plaintiff alleged that it was entitled to a judicial determination as to whether the rescission of the arbitration clause restored it to its position before it entered into the october,agreement and plaintiff was entitled to a judicial determination as to whether the statute of limitations on its,claims had been tolled.
on november,plaintiff and ram ben efraim filed a request pursuant to rule d to conditionally lodge under seal a motion to vacate certain interlocutory arbitration orders and for a preliminary injunction.ben efraim is not named as a party in the complaint.on december,defendant filed a motion to permit the filing of certain documents under seal pursuant to rules and.the documents defendant sought to be sealed were a motion to dismiss the present action a motion to stay the present action pending the arbitrator ruling and a judicial notice request.further,defendant sought permission to file under seal its opposition to all of plaintiff motions.also,defendant sought to permit plaintiff to file under seal its reply to the dismissal and stay requests.defendant also sought the following sealing order the parties may also file under seal motions,briefs,declarations other pleadings filed in this action that refer to any of the information contained in the motion to dismiss,opposition and reply,as well as other information or materials from the arbitration that the arbitrator may authorize the parties to file.finally,defendant requested that the respondent court order the parties and their counsel not to disclose the contents of any sealed documents to other persons or during any public court proceedings.defendant asserted the following justification for sealing the foregoing documents an order sealing selected materials is necessary in order to preserve and protect the rights and obligations of the parties to the arbitration agreement,to maintain the confidentiality of certain information and to comply with the orders of the arbitrator in an arbitration currently pending before the honorable eli chernow ret.pursuant to the arbitration agreement.absent a sealing order,defendant would suffer irreparable prejudice,as defendant would be unable to provide the court with information necessary to allow the court to fully and fairly adjudicate the issues before it or would be forced to disclose protected confidential information.the evidence relied upon by defendant in the respondent court is the same as presented to us.we will delineate that evidence shortly.
on march,the respondent court held a hearing on the sealing motions.the respondent court denied the sealing motions.the respondent court found the only justification for sealing the various motions and papers was the contractual agreement of the parties this understanding,by itself,did not constitute an overriding interest and none of the other interests set forth in nbc subsidiary,superior court cal th,footnote,d,warranted sealing the documents.the respondent court ordered the documents lodged conditionally under seal returned to the parties submitting the documents.
defendant mandate petition and current sealing motion 
on april,defendant filed a mandate petition seeking to set aside the respondent court march,order denying its rule b sealing motion.plaintiff has not challenged the respondent court order denying the sealing motions.accompanying defendant mandate petition is a motion to seal various documents.in this opinion,we only resolve the issue of the current motion before us to seal the documents which have been lodged conditionally under seal by defendant.defendant requests we seal the october,settlement agreement which includes an arbitration clause a dismissal motion a motion to stay the present civil suit pending resolution of certain issues by the arbitrator and a judicial notice request.
the judicial notice request contains numerous documents other than the october,settlement agreement which includes an arbitration clause.because the documents attached to the judicial notice request have been conditionally lodged under seal,we will refer to them generically or only by title.we will however refer to factual matters which are revealed in unsealed documents.defendant has lodged the first amended complaint in the case of ben efraim universal city studios,no.the ben efraim action and its attached exhibits.the attached exhibits to the february,ben efraim first amended complaint consist of a movie agreement a filed by defendant in the case of kirchmedia gmbh universal studios,no.a judgment on the pleadings motion in the kirchmedia gmbh case filed by defendant on june,various accounting statements for a film a letter dated april,and a revenue statement for some films.the judicial notice request,which defendant seeks to seal,also includes a september,minute order and notice of ruling filed october,in the ben efraim action a sealed court of appeal order dated october,a notice of ruling in the ben efraim action filed november,a december,notice of entry of an order in the ben efraim action a november,order in the ben efraim action a court of appeal order denying a writ petition ben efraim superior court,nonpub.order an answer and filed march,in the case of universal city studios,ben efraim,no.and minute orders issued march,and august,in this latter lawsuit which also involves ben efraim.
in support of the foregoing sealing request,defendant relies upon the following facts.on october,plaintiff entered into a settlement agreement with defendant.because the october,settlement agreement has been conditionally lodged under seal,we will only generally describe its contents.as will be noted,publicly filed documents have revealed much about the nature of the october,agreement.a portion of the october,agreement required that certain disputes between plaintiff and defendant be arbitrated.further,the agreement required that its terms remain confidential except certain disclosures could be made to an arbitrator.attached to the october,settlement agreement were exhibits which consisted largely of four pages which reflect monetary payments to be made between the parties.every one of the monetary sums set forth in the four pages conditionally lodged with us and the respondent court were redacted.also,attached to the october,agreement was a promissory note.the sums due under the promissory note are redacted.none of the financial specifics in the october,agreement as executed by the parties appear in any documents filed in the respondent court and with us.a total of separate redactions,all of which involve financial figures,have been made to the october,agreement.finally,attached to the october,agreement was a letter from ben efraim to a of defendant.
additionally,defendant relies on a series of sealing orders in related litigation.on june,a superior court judge signed a sealing order in the ben efraim lawsuit.on an uncertain date in october,a different court of appeal division issued an order sealing the entirety of any document which refers to the october,agreement.a second sealing order was issued by that court of appeal division on february.further,defendant relies on a november,order issued by a superior court judge in the ben efraim litigation compelling arbitration and staying the civil lawsuit.moreover,defendant cites to an order denying a mandate petition issued by division two of this appellate district.ben efraim superior court,nonpub.order.additionally,defendant cites to an april,order by a superior court judge sealing a motion to stay pending arbitration filed by defendant.also,defendant relies upon a stipulation and order in a federal lawsuit which allows all documents referring to the october,agreement to be filed under seal.finally,defendant relies on an october,order filing documents under seal issued by a superior court judge.enright universal city studios,no.
iii.discussion 
disclosure principles 
in nbc subsidiary,superior court,supra,cal th at pages,d,the california supreme court identified the constitutional requirements applicable to a request to seal court records as follows b efore substantive courtroom proceedings are closed or transcripts are ordered sealed,a trial court must hold a hearing and expressly find that i there exists an overriding interest supporting closure sealing ii there is a substantial probability that the interest will be prejudiced absent closure sealing iii the proposed closure sealing is narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest and iv there is no less restrictive means of achieving the overriding interest.italics fns.omitted.in terms of trial courts,the judicial council promulgated rules and,which govern sealing requests in the trial courts in order to comply with the constitutional standards set forth in the nbc subsidiary decision.in re providian credit card cases th,fn,d jud.council of,advisory com,reprinted at pt.west,rules supp.foll.rule.for reviewing courts,the judicial council promulgated rule as in the case of rules and,rule was adopted in response to the nbc subsidiary decision.jud.council of,advisory com,reprinted at pt.west,rules supp.foll.rule.the parties agree that the present case is subject to rule e,which permits the conditional lodging under seal of documents a party seeks to have sealed.when a document is sealed by a trial court,it must be filed under seal in the court of appeal.rule c.
once documents are lodged conditionally under seal,the justices rule whether the papers may be sealed.rule e requires the court of appeal to make the findings set forth in rule d through e before documents may be sealed.if the sealing motion is denied,the conditionally lodged documents must be returned to the moving party by the court clerk.rule e.rule d through e,which sets forth the findings we must make in order to seal the conditionally lodged records,states d express findings required to seal records the court may order that a record be filed under seal only if it expressly finds that there exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to the record the overriding interest supports sealing the record a substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored and no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.e scope of the order an order sealing the record must i specifically set forth the factual findings that support the order,and ii direct the sealing of only those documents and,if reasonably practicable,portions of those documents and contain the material that needs to be placed under seal.all other portions of each document or page must be included in the public file.
the issue we confront at present is whether to allow the conditionally lodged documents to be sealed pursuant to rule e.in order to seal the papers offered by defendant,we must make the findings in rule d through e.defendant argues that sealing is warranted because of its binding contractual obligation with plaintiff not to disclose the contents of the october,agreement.in nbc subsidiary,superior court,supra,cal th at page,footnote,d,the supreme court explained that closure of a court hearing and,by inference,sealing of documents may be justified if necessary to protect a civil litigant fair trial rights.the supreme court then identified other examples of where an overriding interest had been found which warranted closure of civil proceedings as follows courts have acknowledged various other overriding interests.globe newspaper superior court,d protection of minor victims of sex crimes from further trauma and embarrassment accord,superior court,fn,d superior court of cal,d privacy interests of a prospective juror during individual voir dire rovinsky mckaskle cir,protection of witnesses from embarrassment or intimidation so extreme that it would traumatize them or render them unable to testify publicker industries,cohen cir,protection of trade secrets,protection of information within the privilege,and enforcement of binding contractual obligations not to disclose nbc subsidiary,superior court,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
in publicker industries,the third circuit decision cited in footnote of the nbc subsidiary decision,the enforcement of binding contractual obligation justification for closure and inferentially sealing was described follows unless such an overriding interest exists,there is a presumption that the proceedings will be open to the public.citation.the overriding interest can involve the content of the information at issue,the relationship of the parties,or the nature of the controversy.for example,an interest in safeguarding a trade secret may overcome a presumption of openness.see zenith radio matsushita electric industrial.the content of the information is critical in that context.however,in the situation where a plaintiff seeks an injunction to prevent his former lawyer from disclosing certain information arguably within the privilege,it is the relationship between the parties not the content of the information which might overcome the presumption of openness.see du pont powder masland.a similar situation would be presented where there is a binding contractual obligation not to disclose certain information which to the court seems innocuous but newsworthy in that situation unbridled disclosure of the nature of the controversy would deprive the litigant of his right to enforce a legal obligation.publicker industries,cohen,supra,at,italics added.
defendant quite obviously relies on the foregoing language in publicker to support its contention that footnote of nbc subsidiary permits sealing of the documents at issue.however,a thorough reading of all of the publicker opinion makes it clear that the third circuit requires more than a mere agreement of the parties to seal documents filed in a public courtroom.at another point in the publicker opinion,the third circuit panel noted the public may be excluded from a civil trial only upon a showing that the denial of access serves important governmental interest publicker industries,cohen,supra,at in addition,there must be a no less restrictive way to protect that governmental interest ibid.in order to close a civil proceeding there must be evidence of serious injury and the serious injury must be shown with specificity.id.at.other courts applying publicker have emphasized that closure or sealing can only occur under the third circuit rule when there has been a specific showing of serious injury.in re cendant cir,pansy borough of stroudsburg cir,miller indiana hosp.cir,dombrowski bell atlantic d,paul farmer d,charlie whitman,bonin world umpires ass,caver city of trenton,merit industries,feuer,dentsply,county council,northampton county systemhouse,damiano sony music entertainment,aetna cas.sur.george hyman const,fn.krahling executive life ins.app.citing publicker,a third circuit panel later held in delineating the injury to be prevented,specificity is essential.citation.broad allegations of harm,bereft of specific examples or articulated reasoning,are insufficient.in re cendant,supra,at.we have been unable to find any appellate court decision which construes publicker to permit sealing of court documents merely upon the agreement of the parties without a specific showing of serious injury.we therefore,with respect,reject defendant broad reading of the citation to publicker in footnote of nbc subsidiary.
the third circuit analysis is consistent with the nbc subsidiary holding.in nbc subsidiary,the trial court ordered closure of proceedings where the jury was not present in order to protect the litigants fair trial rights.nbc subsidiary,superior court,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court agreed that the protection of a fair trial right can be an overriding interest which would justify closure.however,the supreme court noted in nbc subsidiary that the mere assertion of a fair trial can not support a closure order.the supreme court held we believe that the trial court stated of the underlying civil litigants right to a fair,in the abstract,an overriding interest,and that the first amendment and hence code of civil procedure section do,in an appropriate case,permit closure to protect that interest.the trial court,however,made no finding supporting the proposition that prejudice to that interest was substantially probable absent closure and temporary sealing,original italics,fns.omitted.the first of the two omitted footnotes in the quoted portion from nbc subsidiary in the immediately preceding sentence is footnote,which refers to publicker and the right to closure or sealing in furtherance of the potential overriding interest of enforcement of a binding contractual obligation not to disclose.nbc subsidiary,superior court,supra,cal th at,fn,d,see publicker industries,cohen,supra,at.nonetheless,once it is established there is a potential overriding interest,the party seeking closure or sealing must prove prejudice to that interest is substantially probable.nbc subsidiary,superior court,supra,cal th at,d.
in terms of the overriding interest requirement of a closure or sealing order,nbc subsidiary identifies two separate elements.the first element requires the identification of an overriding interest.nbc subsidiary,superior court,supra,cal th at,d,see in re providian credit card cases,supra,th at,fn,d.defendant has identified such a potential overriding binding contractual agreement not to disclose.the second element of the overriding interest analysis is there must be a substantial probability that it will be prejudiced absent closure or sealing.nbc subsidiary,superior court,supra,cal th at,d,pack kings county human services agency th,d.as we will note,defendant has not shown a substantial probability any such interest in the present case will be second element of overriding interest analysis identified in nbc subsidiary.this analysis has now been promulgated by the judicial council as one of the findings that must be returned before a sealing order can be entered.rule d a substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed.
b.the two sealing requests 
the october,settlement agreement 
independent of its broader requests,defendant requests that we seal the october,settlement agreement.we agree with defendant that its contractual obligation not to disclose can constitute an overriding interest within the meaning of rule d.publicker industries,cohen,supra,at nbc subsidiary,superior court,supra,cal th at,fn,d.however,the confidentiality provisions of the october,settlement agreement involved a document which is materially different from the one conditionally lodged with us on april.as noted previously,there have been separate redactions to the october,settlement agreement.all references to financial data have been deleted from the october,settlement agreement.defendant has not demonstrated any prejudice to its business interests if it is revealed the parties entered into the october,settlement agreement.no admissible evidence has been presented showing defendant will be harmed if the october,agreement or any of its nonfinancial terms are made public particularly in light of the redactions which have deleted any reference to financial data.the fact the parties entered into the october,settlement agreement is a matter of public record.it is discussed in the complaint which is not sealed.it is discussed at length in the mandate petition filed in this case which is unsealed.defendant has expressly indicated it is not seeking to seal its mandate petition.the mandate petition refers times to the october,arbitration and settlement agreement by doing so,defendant identifies the parties to the agreement explicitly states that a confidential arbitration has been going on before retired superior court judge eli chernow since january on five different pages identifies the motion picture which gave rise to the dispute,private school explains ben efraim relationship to the dispute and identifies a relative of ben efraim who has knowledge of some of the facts.apart from the financial figures which have been redacted,the october,agreement is a routine settlement document.defendant has presented no evidence that disclosure of any of the substantive provisions as distinguished from the redacted financial terms of the october,agreement will prejudice any legitimate confidential business practice.finally,the arbitration which has been conducted in secret since january can continue out of the public eye.
to sum up,no substantial prejudice to the contractual obligation not to disclose has been proven.the heavily redacted october,agreement is not the same document presented to us.defendant has failed to make any showing of prejudice to any of its legitimate commercial interests if the heavily redacted october,agreement is unsealed.
the remaining papers except the financial records 
in addition to the october,settlement agreement,defendant has requested we seal its motion to dismiss and stay as well as the judicial notice request,which were the documents lodged additionally under seal with the respondent court.at the outset,we emphasize the point we just made.defendant has presented no admissible evidence as to how its legitimate confidential financial interests will be compromised or its competitive abilities adversely affected if the lodged documents are made available to the public.disclosure will n
