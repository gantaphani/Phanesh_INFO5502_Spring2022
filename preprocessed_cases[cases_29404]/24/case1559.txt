relevant factual and procedural background 
on july,appellants submitted a petition for arbitration to the los angeles county bar association dispute resolution services,drs seeking mandatory and binding arbitration of an attorney fee dispute.the petition alleged that glassman,an attorney,sought in fees from appellants,who denied the validity and basis of glassman claim.

on february,the parties executed a written stipulation for binding arbitration.this stipulation,which is signed by glassman and by mcnab for himself and for scirocco,provides we agree to binding arbitration in the fee arbitration case.we understand that the award will become final and binding immediately,and that a new trial may not be requested.the stipulation also contains the following handwritten notation,accompanied by mcnab and glassman initials notwithstanding the above it is understood jurisdiction and relationship are still issues in this proceeding,and rulings thereon binding as provided by law.
on may,the los angeles county bar association dispute resolution services,drs arbitrators issued their award,which contains a detailed description of the parties contentions,the evidence presented during the arbitration,and the arbitrators findings.in enumerating the claims of the parties,the arbitrators indicated that appellants had asserted that no relation was ever formed,and the drs arbitrators therefore lack ed jurisdiction under the business and professions code.
regarding the issue of jurisdiction,the award states the parties signed a written stipulation for binding arbitration as to all issues,including jurisdiction.in a footnote,it elaborates through a convoluted series of objections and maneuvers,the jurisdiction issue was passed off to the state bar,then returned to drs and tentatively decided both ways,to the satisfaction of no one.the arbitrators agreed to treat the petition for arbitration as simply a choice of forum,not a submission to jurisdiction,provided that our ultimate determination of the issue will be final.both parties so stipulated in writing.
according to the award,the following facts were substantially uncontested during the arbitration scirocco is in the business of borrowing funds to buy real estate secured obligations at a discount and attempting to collect their full value for profit.the arbitration proceedings in question ultimately stemmed from a promissory note secured by real property owned by a partnership known as pine avenue partners.in february,this partnership entered a bankruptcy proceeding,and the note went into default.
the award further states in may,tpm holdings,tpm,bought the note from its prior holder,and it asked glassman,who had represented the note prior holder,to represent tpm.tpm then sold the promissory note to scirocco.in retaining glassman,tpm notified glassman of the sale,but stated that it retained responsibility for servicing and collecting on the note.glassman appeared in the bankruptcy proceedings,represented himself as scirocco attorney,and engaged in negotiations intended to achieve a settlement that would permit scirocco to foreclose,sell,or collect on the note.
the award further states in may,scirocco sued tpm in an action,unknown to glassman.according to the operative complaint,tpm and scirocco were joint venturers engaged in the business of purchasing notes,with scirocco supplying the funding and tpm providing services regarding the notes.the complaint further alleged that tpm had been taking hidden profits on the notes.scirocco and tpm settled this action in september.wicks stephens ii,an attorney who represented scirocco in its action against tpm,advised glassman of the settlement,and told him that scirocco would henceforth service the note.glassman sent a letter to tpm stating that scirocco had asked him to continue representing it,and sent a copy of this letter to stephens.neither mcnab nor stephens objected to glassman statement in this letter.
the award further states glassman subsequently wrote to scirocco,asking it to confirm his representation and to pay his accumulated fees.scirocco declined to retain glassman,rejected his claim for fees,and independently reached a settlement in the bankruptcy proceeding.according to the arbitrators,so far as anyone is aware,tpm is no longer extant and can not be found.
following a detailed assessment of the correspondence and communications between tpm,scirocco,and glassman,the award concludes that there was an relationship between scirocco and glassman,and that glassman was entitled to in fees plus interest.
on june,glassman filed a petition to confirm the award.the trial court confirmed the award on february.this appeal followed.
discussion 
appellants contend that the trial court erred in confirming the award.they are mistaken.
to enforce the finality of arbitration,the statutes governing nonjudicial arbitration awards minimize judicial intervention.moncharsh heily blase cal th,d.once a petition to confirm an award is filed,the superior court has only four courses of conduct to confirm the award,to correct and confirm it,to vacate it,or to dismiss the petition.united brotherhood of carpenters,local demello d.witkin,cal.procedure ed.proceedings without trial.
here,appellants central contention is that the arbitrators lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the issue concerning the existence of an relationship.appellants thus rely on subdivision a of code of civil procedure section,which provides that the trial court shall vacate an award when t he arbitrators exceeded their powers and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted.
under this provision,the trial court is authorized to vacate an arbitrator determination that he or she has the jurisdiction to resolve an issue when this issue is outside the scope of an arbitration agreement,or the statutes permitting or requiring arbitration.national union fire ins.stites law d,d stites.we review de novo the trial court determination that the drs arbitrators did not exceed their authority in determining that there was an relationship.see advanced micro devices,intel cal th,fn,d.
