opinion of the court 
goldman sachs and athena venture partners participated in an arbitration to settle a million dispute.in that proceeding,athena asserted claims of misrepresentation,securities fraud,common law fraud and breach of fiduciary duty,among others.following a arbitration hearing,conducted under financial industry regulatory authority finra rules,the panel ruled in favor of goldman.after the award,athena conducted a background investigation on demetrio timban,one of the panel members.the investigation revealed that timban failed to make disclosures regarding numerous regulatory complaints against him.
on a motion to vacate the award,based on these,the district court ruled in favor of athena and ordered a new arbitration hearing.the district court reasoned that athena rights were compromised by an arbitrator who misrepresented his ability to serve on the arbitration panel and then abandoned the panel before its final ruling.because we find that athena waived its right to challenge the arbitration award,we reverse the district court order vacating the award.
athena is a limited partnership that invested in several funds through goldman.in,goldman approached athena with an investment opportunity in liquidity partners,describing it as a terrific,low principal risk,short term investment with potential higher yields than other available cash investments.in addition,goldman explained that the investment was a diverse portfolio of very safe,debt securities.
in supposed reliance upon these representations,athena invested million in the liquidity partners fund.by late,however,athena incurred about million in losses on the investment.believing that goldman misrepresented the risks associated with the investment,athena initiated arbitration proceedings under the parties subscription agreement.the agreement specified that rules and regulations applied to the arbitration.a panel of arbitrators heard evidence in separate sessions in november and october.after the first panel session,finra disclosed to the parties that one of the panel members,demetrio timban,had been charged with the unauthorized practice of law in connection with an appearance in a new jersey municipal court at this point,neither party,nor finra,objected to timban continued participation on the panel.likewise,neither party conducted further due diligence to follow up on this disclosure.following these hearings,the panel issued its written decision finding in favor of goldman.two of the panel members signed the award,but timban did not.under the subscription agreement,only two members of the panel needed to sign the award for it to have binding effect.
after the award,athena conducted a background check on timban purportedly based on his failure to sign the award.this background check revealed that timban sole disclosure was misleading,and that he had failed to disclose additional legal troubles.with respect to his disclosure,timban represented his unauthorized practice as a incident.in reality,timban maintained an office in cherry hill,new jersey for many years,including from he represented debtors in bankruptcy courts in both pennsylvania and new jersey and he had many complaints lodged against him for the unauthorized practice of law in,and.in other words,when timban described his unauthorized practice charge as a simple oversight,he misrepresented the true scope of his problems.
as to the subsequent legal issues,first,in april,a formal complaint against timban was filed with the attorney discipline board for the state of michigan,citing timban for issuing bad checks totaling,with intent to defraud.this allegation constitutes not only a violation of the michigan rules of professional conduct,but the conduct is considered a felony criminal offense under michigan law.
second,in july,another formal complaint against timban was filed with the attorney discipline board for the state of michigan.this complaint cited timban for engaging in conduct involving dishonesty,fraud,deceit,misrepresentation,or violation of the criminal law as a result of the unauthorized practice of law in the state of new jersey.
third,in october,timban entered into a stipulation with the grievance administrator for the attorney discipline board for the state of michigan,pleading no contest to the allegations of the two formal complaints.he agreed to a day suspension of his license to practice law.neither timban,nor finra,disclosed any of these issues,which occurred prior to the second arbitration session,to the parties at any time.in november,days after the parties submitted briefs to the panel,the attorney discipline board for the state of michigan entered an order suspending timban.
after athena conducted this background check and unearthed these additional legal issues,it filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award.in the district court,athena argued that vacatur was proper because timban conduct and his failure to disclose violated both finra rules and the parties agreement to arbitrate.the district court agreed and,therefore,granted athena motion to vacate and denied goldman application to confirm the arbitration award.holding that timban initial disclosure was so grossly misleading and incomplete,the district court rejected goldman argument that athena waived its right to challenge the panel award.in so finding,the district court held that finra failed to provide the parties with three qualified arbitrators and that vacatur was the proper remedy under the federal arbitration act,u.a,and a.accordingly,the district court vacated the arbitration award and remanded for rehearing before a new panel.
goldman raises two main issues on appeal the district court erred in holding athena did not waive its right to challenge the arbitration award and the district court erred in vacating the award 
goldman argues that,by waiting to challenge timban participation on the panel until after the award,athena waived its right to seek vacatur of the award.to determine whether athena waived this right,we must decide how waiver applies in the arbitration context,a question of first impression in this circuit 
although many circuits generally agree that a party waives a claim based on the conduct of an arbitrator if the party fails to raise those concerns prior to or during the arbitration hearings,most have recognized that a blanket waiver rule is inappropriate.for instance,in the sixth circuit,waiver applies only if the party knew of the facts suggesting bias during the proceeding the ninth circuit,along with several others,applies a constructive knowledge standard,finding waiver where a party has constructive knowledge of a potential conflict but fails to timely object.the ninth circuit viewed this as a better approach in light of its policy favoring the finality of arbitration awards.
constructive knowledge is defined as the k nowledge that one using reasonable care or diligence should have,and therefore that is attributed by law to a given person.our sister circuits have interpreted constructive knowledge in this context to mean that a complaining party either knew or should have known of facts indicating partiality or other misconduct of an arbitrator.relevant to this point,the first circuit commented that a party which was put on notice of the risk when it signed the contract and chose not to inquire about the backgrounds of the committee members either before or during the hearing waived the right to challenge the decision likewise,the eighth circuit applied constructive knowledge where a party did not have full knowledge of all the relationships to which they now object,but they did have concerns about the arbitrator impartiality and yet chose to have her remain on the panel rather than spend time and money investigating further until losing the arbitration.the second circuit has stated that where the complaining party should have known of the relationship or could have learned of the relationship just as easily before or during the arbitration rather than after it lost its case,constructive knowledge existed and resulted in waiver constructive knowledge in the arbitration context reasonably requires par
