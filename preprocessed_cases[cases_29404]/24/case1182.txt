appellants philips corporation and philips electronics north america corporation collectively philips appeal the decision of the united states district court for the district of arizona denying philips motion to compel arbitration.microchip tech.philips.june.because the district court properly denied philips motion to compel arbitration,we affirm.
background 
reduced to the essentials,the background for this case may be simply stated.philips is the owner of patent the patent and the patent,which generally relate to electronic circuits and apparatuses used to communicate between integrated circuits in a wide variety of applications,including televisions,computers and cellular phones.in october,philips sued a number of companies in the southern district of new york the new york action alleging infringement of the patent.the appellee,microchip technology incorporated microchip,was not one of the original defendants,but in reasonable apprehension of an infringement suit by philips,microchip sought a declaratory judgment in the district of arizona the arizona action that it did not infringe and was licensed to practice the patent.subsequently,microchip amended its complaint in the arizona action to seek an additional declaratory judgment it did not infringe and was licensed to practice the patent.philips counterclaimed for infringement of both patents,asserting that microchip did not have a license.philips also added microchip as a defendant in the new york action,alleging infringement of the patent.
the license dispute centered upon a agreement the agreement between philips and general instrument corporation gi.the agreement granted gi a license to specified philips patents microchip claimed to be gi successor to the agreement and thus licensed under that agreement because it was spun off from a wholly owned subsidiary of gi.at.philips argued that microchip never became a party to the agreement.
the agreement also included an arbitration clause that provided 
all disputes arising out of or in connection with the interpretation or execution of this agreement during its life or thereafter shall be finally settled according to the rules of conciliation and arbitration of the international chamber of commerce by one or more arbitrators in accordance with the rules the award of the court of arbitration shall be final and binding.
at.on december,philips commenced an arbitration proceeding against microchip in the international court of arbitration the ica of the international chamber of commerce seeking resolution of the license dispute including the issue of microchip successorship to the agreement.
microchip refused to arbitrate.while continuing to urge that microchip was not a party to the agreement,philips moved in the arizona district court to compel microchip to proceed with arbitration,and the ica agreed to hold the arbitration in abeyance.philips asserted that the issue of whether microchip was a successor to the agreement,and other issues concerning the existence and scope of the license,were subject to arbitration.microchip responded by filing a motion to stay the arbitration,contending that the question of whether microchip was a party to the agreement was a gateway issue for the district court to resolve prior to referring the matter to arbitration and all of the disputed issues were for the court to decide because the arbitration clause had,by terms of the contract,expired although the license remained in effect.
the district court denied philips motion to compel arbitration,but did not finally decide the issue of arbitrability,successorship or expiration of the arbitration clause.the court stated that 
before it can determine arbitrability,the court must first determine if both microchip and philips are parties to the gi agreement.this is admittedly in dispute and is the primary basis for declaratory relief.making this determination would require the court to undertake an intense factual inquiry inappropriate for a motion to dismiss.accordingly,because the court is unable to determine the applicability of the gi agreement to these parties,it is unwilling to enforce the arbitration clause contained therein.
microchip,slip op.at.microchip motion to stay the arbitration was also granted.id.philips appealed from the district court denial of its motion to compel arbitration.
discussion 
before addressing the merits,we must consider the issue of appellate jurisdiction,which is governed by the law of this circuit.nystrom trex.the district court decision in this case was not final.therefore we do not have jurisdiction under a.however,we conclude that section of the federal arbitration act the faa,rendered the order appealable under a.
the faa is applicable to settlement and license agreements involving patents,crp,see.the faa allows a party aggrieved by the alleged failure,neglect,or refusal of another to arbitrate under a written agreement to petition a district court for an order compelling arbitration.congress amended the faa in to allow a party to appeal an order denying a motion to compel arbitration.judicial improvements act,tit.x,a,stat,codified at.the act provides that an appeal can be taken from an order denying a petition to order arbitration to proceed.a b.
we conclude that section of the faa removes the barriers to appellate jurisdiction under a.our reasoning is as follows.an order compelling arbitration is in effect a mandatory injunction.see sinclair ref.atkinson,d.denial of a mandatory injunction is ordinarily appealable under section a.gulfstream aerospace mayacamas,d.however,under the supreme court decision in gulfstream,an order that has the practical effect of granting or denying an injunction such as an order compelling or refusing to compel arbitration would only be appealable under section a if it had serious,perhaps irreparable,consequence.id.at.quoting carson am.brands,d.before the enactment of section,some regional circuits concluded that the denial of an order to compel arbitration did not have such consequences congress however disagreed and,through the enactment of section,directed that orders denying such motions be appealable.
section is not itself a jurisdictional provision.it does not appear in the judicial code,nor does the word jurisdiction even appear in the statutory language.rather,section renders appealable under section a the denial of an injunctive order,motions to compel arbitration that otherwise would not be appealable under gulfstream since the district court had jurisdiction under,and the order is appealable under section a,we,rather than the regional circuit,have appellate jurisdiction.c but see medtronic ave,advanced cardiovascular,cir.
we agree with our sister circuits that section allows for appeal of orders denying motions to compel arbitration even when the issue of arbitrability has not been finally decided.in snowden checkpoint check cashing,cir,the fourth circuit held that it possessed appellate jurisdiction under section to consider an order denying a motion to compel arbitration.there the district court denied a motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings without prejudice and stated its intention to revisit the ruling at a later time.id.at.the fourth circuit noted that this triggered alarm bells of a premature appeal,but concluded that it possessed jurisdiction because the faa expressly permits an immediate appellate challenge to a district court denial of a motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings.id.other circuit courts have reached similar results.see,sandvik ab advent int l,cir finding jurisdiction under section to review the denial of a motion to compel arbitration where the district court indicated that it could not order arbitration until it determined the validity of the underlying contract koveleskie sbc capital,cir holding that,despite the district court indication that discovery was needed before a decision could be reached on the arbitration issue,there was no doubt that the order denied the motion to compel arbitration,and was thus appealable.
while district courts might be well advised to defer acting on a motion to compel arbitration until the issues of a
