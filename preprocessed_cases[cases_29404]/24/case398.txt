long john silver restaurants,incorporated,and long john silver,incorporated collectively,ljs,seek appellate relief from a january,ruling of the district court declining to vacate an arbitration award.long john silver,cole,d the opinion in the underlying arbitration proceedings,three former ljs managerial employees,erin cole,nick kaufman,and victoria mcwhorter the claimants,contended that ljs violated the fair labor standards act the flsa by failing to pay them and other ljs employees the overtime compensation required by law.in september,the arbitrator ruled,in his class determination partial final award the class award that the class certification provision of the flsa codified at b did not apply in the arbitration proceedings.the arbitrator also ruled that,pursuant to the controlling arbitration agreement,the arbitration proceedings were governed by the class certification provision of the supplementary rules for class arbitrations of the american arbitration association the aaa class rules.
in this appeal,ljs contends that the district court erred in two respects when it declined to vacate the class award first,in failing to recognize that the arbitrator,in making the award,had manifestly disregarded controlling legal principles and,second,in failing to recognize that the arbitrator had exceeded the scope of his authority.as explained below,we reject these contentions and affirm.
as background in this matter,the claimants are former managers and managerial assistants of various ljs restaurants.they maintain that ljs has been engaged in unlawful employment practices,subjecting them and others to payroll deductions and salary givebacks to cover losses in ljs restaurant operations.these unlawful practices,according to the claimants,violated the flsa and its regulations on overtime pay,and resulted in insufficient compensation being paid to them and others.
in,ljs initiated a mandatory arbitration procedure and commenced the use of a uniform arbitration agreement for disputes with its employees.the arbitration agreement prepared for this purpose was executed by each of the claimants.the agreement provides,in pertinent part,that 
a ny arbitration will be administered by the american arbitration association under its commercial arbitration rules except as modified herein the arbitrator shall apply the substantive law and the laws and remedies,if applicable,in the state in which the claim arose,or federal law,or both,depending upon the claims asserted.
the aaa class rules empower an arbitrator to make certain determinations about whether an arbitration agreement permits an arbitration proceeding to be conducted as a class arbitration.in the event that the agreement so permits,the arbitrator must decide whether the arbitration should proceed as a class arbitration by considering the criteria enumerated in the aaa class rules,as well as any law or agreement of the parties the arbitrator determines applies to the arbitration.see aaa class rule a.when the arbitrator has decided that the arbitration should proceed as a class arbitration,he must set forth the basis for that decision in a class determination award,which defines the class,the notice to be given,and the grounds for exclusion of class members.see aaa class rule.aaa class rule provides that a final award on the merits of a class arbitration must define the class with specificity,including those who have elected to opt out of the class.
like the aaa class rules,b of the flsa contains a provision governing class action proceedings.unlike the provision of the aaa class rules,however,b of the flsa is an class provision,providing that 
n o employee shall be a party plaintiff to any action under the flsa unless he gives his consent in writing to become such a party and such consent is filed in the court in which such action is brought.

on january,claimants cole and kaufman initiated an arbitration proceeding before the aaa,on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated.they alleged that ljs,in failing to properly compensate them,had violated the flsa on march,the claimants filed an amended arbitration complaint with the aaa,adding mcwhorter as a representative claimant and seeking class certification pursuant to the aaa class rules.ljs then secured rulings from the arbitrator on certain class certification issues,ultimately leading to this appeal.
first,on june,the arbitrator made a clause construction award,ruling that the arbitration agreement did not preclude a class arbitration proceeding.although the award did not decide whether a class would ultimately be certified in the arbitration proceeding,ljs promptly initiated suit in the district court,seeking to vacate the award.ljs made two assertions in its lawsuit that the flsa b provision permitting employees to pursue collective actions is a procedural right,and thus had been waived by the arbitration agreements and that conducting a class arbitration proceeding is inconsistent with the flsa.on september,the district court dismissed that suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.see cole long john silver,d 
next,on september,the arbitrator issued its class award,which ljs challenges in this appeal.in the class award,the arbitrator ruled that the claimants could serve as representative plaintiffs in an class arbitration class being composed of current and former ljs managerial employees having potential flsa claims.in rendering the class award,the arbitrator was called upon to address the apparent conflict between the aspect of the flsa b provision,on the one hand,and the aspect of the aaa class rules,on the other.in the class award,the arbitrator decided that,because there is no evidence of any congressional intent to make the right to the requirement of the b provision nonwaivable,the flsa did not preclude enforcement of the parties agreement to arbitrate pursuant to the aaa class rules.class award.accordingly,the arbitrator applied the provisions of aaa class rule.
on october,ljs filed suit in the district of south carolina,seeking to vacate the class award,and challenging the arbitrator ruling that the flsa b provision was not controlling on january,the district court filed its opinion denying ljs request for relief.by the opinion,the court rejected ljs contention that the flsa dispositively provides employees a nonwaivable substantive right to proceedings under the b provision.having determined that no clear principle of law bound the arbitrator in this case,the court further ruled that the arbitrator had satisfied his obligation to render a reasoned award,that he had not manifestly disregarded the applicable legal principles,and that he had instead thoroughly analyzed the relationship of the b provision and the arbitration agreement.opinion.indeed,as the court recognized,because the arbitration agreement undoubtedly gave the arbitrator authority to invoke equity,it provided him with the power to render any relief which a court could award.id.at.ljs has appealed,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to.
