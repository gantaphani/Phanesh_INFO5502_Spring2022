in february,perez employment with globe ended.perez contends she was terminated,but globe asserts she abandoned her job.in february,perez filed this action alleging gender discrimination in violation of title vii.globe,answering the complaint,raised the arbitration agreement as an affirmative defense.moving to compel arbitration under of the federal arbitration act,globe requested that the trial court dismiss or stay the court action.perez argued in opposition that her employment disputes were not governed by the federal arbitration act because she was an employee engaged in foreign or interstate commerce the provision rendered the agreement unenforceable and the agreement was void because she did not understand what she was signing.
based on evidence of the financial circumstances of perez and the costs of arbitration,the district court found the provision created an unreasonable barrier to assertion of title vii rights because the required arbitration would be prohibitively expensive for perez.the district court denied globe motion to compel arbitration this appeal followed.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
this court has jurisdiction over an appeal from an order denying a motion to compel arbitration under the federal arbitration act.a.the standard of review is de novo.see kidd equitable life assur.soc y of,cir.
discussion 
a.the applicability of the federal arbitration act 
the validity of an agreement to arbitrate is generally governed by the federal arbitration act faa or the act,enacted in to reverse longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration.see gilmer interstate johnson lane,d.the act requires a court to enforce a written arbitration agreement as it would any other contract.see a written provision to settle by arbitration a controversy shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.see also paladino avnet computer technologies,cir.the faa embodies a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.see randolph green tree fin,cir.
perez claims the faa does not govern this dispute because exempts from the faa coverage arbitration agreements contained in contracts of employment of seamen,railroad employees,or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.perez,a security agent at miami international airport,argues she was engaged in interstate commerce because she inspected goods,materials,and people that were headed to locations around the united states and,indeed,around the world.
the supreme court has now held that the faa engaged in commerce exception should be narrowly construed to apply only to transportation workers.see circuit city adams,d.the exception specifically names two classes of exempt workers,seamen and railroad employees,and the final exempt group,workers engaged in commerce,must be defined in light of the narrowness of the other two exemptions.id.at.in circuit city,the court cited with approval a definition adopted by the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in cole burns int l security services workers actually engaged in the movement of goods in interstate commerce,see circuit city.at.
in cole,a security guard working in union station was held not engaged in commerce under of the faa,because he did not participate in the actual movement of goods in commerce.see cole,at.likewise perez,an airport security guard,was not engaged in the transportation of goods in commerce she merely inspected or guarded such goods prior to their transport.the engaged in commerce exemption does not apply,so the faa governs this dispute.
b.the expense of arbitration 
the district court found the provision rendered the arbitration agreement unenforceable because it inhibited perez from asserting her statutory rights by requiring her to advance costs and fees she could not afford.subsequent to that decision,the supreme court held,where a party seeks to invalidate an arbitration agreement on the ground that arbitration would be prohibitively expensive,that party bears the burden of showing the likelihood of incurring such costs.green tree fin.randolph,d.globe asserts that perez failed to show she would incur prohibitive expenses by pursuing arbitration 
the arbitration agreement before the court in green tree did not specify which party would bear the initial costs of arbitration.see green tree.at.here,the arbitration agreement e
