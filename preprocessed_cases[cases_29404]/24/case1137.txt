the national treasury employees union nteu seeks review of a decision of the federal labor relations authority flra or authority upholding an arbitration award in favor of the united states bureau of customs and border protection customs nteu chapter,wl may,flra.before october customs was bound under the terms of its national inspectional assignment policy niap and a national labor agreement nla to bargain with nteu chapter chapter over changes in rotation and regular days off rdos for its el paso,texas passenger customs inspectors.in its decision the flra concluded that customs effectively revoked its consent to bargain over rotation and rdos in when it implemented its revised niap rniap,which by its terms superseded both the niap and the nla,which had expired in.because the flra decision is not arbitrary,capricious or otherwise contrary to law,we deny the nteu petition for review.
this case involves a continuing dispute between the nteu and customs over the extent of customs obligation to bargain over changes wrought pursuant to the rniap.although the federal service relations statute statute,et,generally obligates an agency to negotiate with its employees bargaining representative over conditions of employment,id.a,personnel policies,practices,and matters affecting working conditions,id.a,section of the statute reserv es to management officials the authority to,inter alia,make budget,organization,and work assignments.nteu flra,quoting flra dep t of justice,alteration in original.section b identifies permissive subjects of bargaining involving such management rights over which bargaining may take place at the election of the agency,namely,on the numbers,types,and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision,work project,or tour of duty,or on the technology,methods,and means of performing work.b see ass of gov t employees,local flra,quoting am.fed of gov t employees,local flra,local.as to these decisions,the agency is permitted but not required to negotiate with the labor organization.local,at.these rights of unilateral action,however,are not unqualified a lthough an agency is not required to bargain with respect to its management rights per se,it is required to negotiate about the impact and implementation of those rights.nteu flra,at quoting dep t of the navy flra,alterations added.further,as the flra has interpreted the statute,the mandatory bargaining obligation over impact and implementation attaches only at the level of exclusive recognition,which in the case of bargaining between customs and the nteu is at the national level,so that bargaining over impact and implementation below that level is permissive.see nteu chapter,citing food drug,dep t of defense dependents,wl.
in the president issued executive order directing that all federal agencies negotiate over the subjects set forth in b,d,that is,the permissive subjects of bargaining explicitly set out there.in accordance with the executive order,the niap required that such subjects as workweek length,work hours,scheduling,staffing levels and days off be negotiated and determined at the local level.see niap a,ja.accordingly,customs agreed in the nla to bargain locally over various permissive subjects of bargaining,including,specifically,work station rotation.nla article,section.b specifically provided that customs will give timely notice and the opportunity to bargain when a change is to be made in an established rotation system which has an impact,or one which is sic reasonably foreseeable,on conditions of employment,ja,and article,section.b stipulated that p roposed changes which apply within one organizational office such as the el paso rotation system will be negotiated within that office,that is,at the local level,ja.thus,under the nla,recurring rotation regimes that applied only locally were required to be negotiated locally.the nla expired in.
on february,executive order was revoked by executive order,which directed that all executive agencies promptly move to rescind any orders,rules,regulations,guidelines,or policies implementing or enforcing executive order.on august,customs sent the nteu a copy of the rniap along with a cover letter announcing that customs had decided to exercise its statutory right to terminate and no longer be bound by the provisions in the national agreement in which we agreed to bargain over matters covered by usc b.ja.section of the rniap expressly provides that it supersedes and replaces the niap as well as all local agreements that address matters contained within the rniap.ja.section more broadly states that the rniap policies and procedures take precedence over any and all other agreements,policies,or other documents or practices executed or applied by the parties previously,at either the national or local levels,concerning the matters covered within this handbook.ja emphasis added.section also states that n o further obligation to consult,confer,or negotiate,either upon the substance or impact and implementation of any decision or action,shall arise upon the exercise of any provision,procedure,right or responsibility addressed or contained within this handbook.id.section then directs that agency managers,in accordance with workload,operational needs budgetary limitations,are to make decisions regarding such scheduling and staffing levels matters as length of workweek,work hours,days off,scheduling,staffing levels,staffing flexibility and shift swaps.ja.customs cover letter states the rniap is to take effect on september.
on october,the el paso port director notified chapter of a change in personnel rotation and rdos.up to that time,each customs passenger inspector in el paso was rotated among three bridges for two weeks at each bridge,then starting the sequence received a weekend every three weeks.under the new policy,each passenger inspector was to be assigned to a single bridge for a term and to receive a weekend only every five to six weeks.on october,the nteu filed a request to bargain over the change pursuant to the nla,which customs denied.on october,customs implemented the rniap the nteu filed a grievance alleging an unfair labor practice in violation of a and.when customs failed to respond,the nteu invoked arbitration.
the arbitrator issued an award in favor of customs,rejecting the nteu contentions that the rniap violates articles and of the nla because,the arbitrator concluded,these provisions were trumped by the flra decision in united states department of the treasury customs service,wl,review denied,nteu flra,in which the flra upheld customs implementation of the rniap.the arbitrator further found that the rniap,unlike its predecessor niap,did not contain provisions authorizing local bargaining and observed that he was bound to the authority conclusions as well as case law holding that the obligation to bargain attaches at the level of exclusive recognition.flra at quoting arbitration award at.accordingly,the arbitrator concluded that w ithout an obligation to bargain at the local level there can be no violation of the statute for a failure or refusal to bargain.id.quoting arbitration award at.
the nteu excepted to the arbitral award and the flra denied its exceptions in a decision issued may.in upholding the award,the authority relied principally on its decisions in customs service and in nteu chapter,recons.denied.in chapter,the authority determined that customs had no obligation to bargain at the local level over a change in local sunday overtime assignments because rniap section terminated locally negotiated agreements concerning inspectional assignment matters,as well as the agency obligation to bargain at the local level regarding such matters.at.
