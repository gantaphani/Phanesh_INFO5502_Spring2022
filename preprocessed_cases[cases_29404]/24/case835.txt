background 
on january,marathon oil marathon and ashland,ashland formed map as a joint venture to engage in crude oil refinery and distribution operations.marathon and ashland acquired interests in map in return for their contributions of assets to map.among other things,ashland contributed a refinery located in paul park,minnesota,and its equipment.ashland also loaned the members of local to map.the members were subject to the collective bargaining agreement between the union and ashland ashland cba,but map administered the ashland cba on behalf of ashland.the cba was effective from june,to may.article of the ashland cba provided for arbitration of any controversy aris ing over the interpretation of the application of the contents of this agreement.it also provided for arbitration of a violation of the provisions of the terms of this agreement relating to seniority rights,wages,hours of work,overtime differentials,vacations,or any other provisions of this agreement.some of ashland employees became map employees,including the refinery general manager james nelson.after map creation,marathon and ashland continued to operate as separate entities.neither engaged directly in refining crude oil.
in february,map and the union began negotiations for a collective bargaining agreement between the parties to be effective on the expiration of the ashland cba.map offered to grant a extension of the ashland cba with wage increases and new benefits.one of the benefits was the success through people stp bonus program.the union rejected the offer.in october,map again extended the offer.in a letter to the employees,map noted that the stp bonus was only available if the union accepted map offer before october.the union did not respond to the offer by the deadline.
on may,map issued stp bonus checks to its employees.map did not provide bonuses to any ashland employee.on may,joe riley filed a grievance on behalf of local members against map.riley asserted that the members were entitled to the stp bonus and had been discriminated against being ashland employees.the grievance was stayed pending the contract negotiations.
during negotiations,map agreed to the union proposal that the collective bargaining agreement provide for participation in the stp bonus program.map,however,did not agree to the union proposal that its members receive the stp bonus as settlement of the riley grievance.on june,map and the union entered into a tentative collective bargaining agreement,which was ratified and effective from june,to may.map and the union agreed that the riley grievance would go forward without prejudice,which meant that the grievance would proceed just as if the issue had never been raised at all in the negotiations.map and the union also entered into a letter agreement providing that the map employees represented by the union were eligible to participate in the stp program as of january.the letter agreement further provided that participation or in the program,the receipt or of payment under the terms of the program,and any such action shall not be subject to arbitration.
map denied the riley grievance on september,and the union requested arbitration.after receiving notice of the union request for arbitration,map wrote the union that the grievance was not subject to arbitration,noting that the stp bonus was not covered in the ashland cba and that the union members were not map employees at the relevant time.map again wrote the union stating that although map would participate in selecting a panel of arbitrators,it was not waiving its position that the grievance was not subject to arbitration.
on december,map filed an action in district court seeking a declaration that it was not obligated to arbitrate the grievance.the district court granted map motion for summary judgment.the district court rejected the union argument that map was subject to the arbitration provision of the ashland cba and the union alternative argument that map conduct created a duty to arbitrate the grievance.in addition,the district court rejected the union argument that the riley grievance implicated the ashland cba discrimination provision,noting that the grievance did not allege a deprivation resulting from an motivation.
