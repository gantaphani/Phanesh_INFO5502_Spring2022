concurrence by judge hurwitz 
dissent by judge ikuta 
arbitration mandamus 
the panel denied a petition for a writ of mandamus in a labor law case in which the defendants sought to compel arbitration.
in a prior appeal,the court of appeals held that the district court,rather than an arbitrator,must decide whether the dispute was exempt from arbitration under,which provides that the federal arbitration act does not apply to contracts of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.on remand,the district court issued a scheduling order for discovery and a trial on the issue.
in a companion appeal,van dusen swift,the panel held that it lacked jurisdiction to review the district court interlocutory scheduling order.defendants also sought a writ of mandamus ordering the district court to vacate its order and decide defendants petition to compel arbitration without discovery or trial.
the panel denied the mandamus petition because defendants had a remedy in urging their position before the district court in dispositive motions and in the form of direct appeal following the issuance of a final order.normal litigation expense did not constitute sufficient prejudice to warrant relief,and the discovery cost had already been incurred.and,most crucially,the district court order was not clearly erroneous.
concurring,judge hurwitz wrote that the extraordinary remedy of a writ of mandamus was not warranted.
dissenting,judge ikuta wrote that a writ of mandamus should be granted because the district court clearly erred in ordering discovery,pretrial proceedings,and trial rather than addressing the only legal issue before it whether the workers contract was a contract of employment for purposes of of the federal arbitration act.she wrote that other factors also weighed in favor of granting the writ.
per curiam 
in this companion case to van dusen swift,van dusen iii,swift transportation company,interstate equipment leasing,and senior executives at both companies collectively swift seek a writ of mandamus ordering the district court to vacate its case management order and decide the petition to compel arbitration without discovery or trial.we deny the petition for a writ of mandamus.
the factual background of this case is set forth in some detail in the opinion in van dusen iii.in short,two interstate truckers collectively van dusen entered into contracts with swift that designated them as independent contractors and also contained a clause requiring them to arbitrate a ll disputes and claims arising under,arising out of or relating to the a greement s.after contract termination,van dusen filed a collective and class action complaint against swift alleging that swift misclassified van dusen and others as independent contractors.swift moved to compel arbitration and dismiss or stay the district court action.van dusen objected that of the federal arbitration act prevented the district court from compelling arbitration.the district court granted swift motion to compel arbitration.the court also determined that an arbitrator should decide whether the exemption applies.the court subsequently denied van dusen motion to reconsider or certify an appeal.van dusen petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus.in re van dusen,cir.van dusen i.in van dusen i,we held that the district court was required to assess whether a exemption applies before ordering arbitration.id.at.we denied the mandamus petition,holding that the district court had not committed clear error because there was no controlling precedent.id.on remand,the district court denied van dusen motion for reconsideration,reiterated its original opinion,and certified an interlocutory appeal.
on appeal,we applied law of the case as determined by van dusen i,and held that the district court,not an arbitrator,should decide the exemption in the first instance.van dusen swift transp,app x cir.van dusen ii.we remanded with instructions to determine whether the contractor agreements between each appellant and swift are exempt under of the faa before consider ing swift motion to compel.id.at.on remand,the district court issued a case management order that included a discovery schedule,motion deadlines,and set a potential trial date.swift moved the court for a stay of proceedings and for an order determining the issue without discovery or trial.swift filed an interlocutory appeal,which we dismissed for lack of jurisdiction in van dusen iii,and this petition for a writ of mandamus.
the writ of mandamus is a drastic and extraordinary remedy reserved only for really extraordinary causes.van dusen i,at quoting ex parte fahey,internal quotations omitted.issuance of the writ is in large measure a matter of the court discretion.johnson,cir.quoting united states sherman,cir.internal quotations omitted.we weigh five factors to determine whether mandamus relief is appropriate.bauman dist,cir.see also in re united states,cir.reiterating bauman factors.we consider whether 
the party seeking the writ has no other adequate means,such as a direct appeal,to attain the relief he or she desires.the petitioner will be damaged or prejudiced in a way not correctable on appeal.this guideline is closely related to the first.the district court order is clearly erroneous as a matter of law.the district court order is an error,or manifests a persistent disregard of the federal rules.the district court order raises new and important problems,or issues of law of first impression.
bauman,at citations omitted.
these factors are not exhaustive and should not be mechanically applied.in re united states,at internal quotations and citations omitted.
the first bauman factor is whether there is any other adequate means,such as a direct appeal,to attain the relief the petitioner desires.here,swift has the remedy of direct appeal of the district court final order denying or compelling arbitration.the district court has not decided that question,and it is by no means certain that the district court will not ultimately compel arbitration on the basis of the contractor agreements alone.the case management order sets forth dates for the parties to file dispositive motions,and the court has not determined whether there is any fact deduced in discovery that would affect its determination of whether arbitration should be compelled.once the district court has issued a final order with respect to arbitration,swift can appeal directly.
the second bauman factor,which is closely related to the first,examines whether the petitioner will be damaged or prejudiced in a way not correctable on appeal.swift argues that litigation of the exemption issue will determine the ultimate issue raised by plaintiffs claim.but even if this were the case,swift can still appeal the district court final order.any prejudice from the legal effect of the determination is correctable on appeal.
swift also argues that it will incur unnecessary litigation expense if the district court proceeds with its case management order.however,litigation costs are a factor weighing in favor of mandamus relief only in the most extreme circumstances.in re orange,cir.citing varsic dist,cir.swift has not shown that the expenses in this case are so outside the realm of normal litigation expense as to be considered among the most extreme circumstances.further,discovery has now closed,so the cost of discovery has already been incurred and is not correctable by mandamus relief.the second bauman factor weighs against swift.
the third bauman factor is whether the district court order is clearly erroneous as a matter of law.this factor is the most important for our consideration.while all the factors need not be present to issue the writ the absence of factor three clear error as a matter of law will always defeat a petition for mandamus.in re united states,at internal quotations and citations omitted.see van dusen i,at clear error as a matter of law is a necessary condition for granting a writ of mandamus citing hernandez tanninen,cir.
clear error is a highly deferential standard of review.van dusen i,at citing cal.dep t of water res.powerex,cir.we will not grant mandamus relief simply because a district court commits an error,even one that would ultimately require reversal on appeal.id.at quoting wilson dist,cir.instead,we must have a definite and firm conviction that the district court interpretation was incorrect.id.at internal quotations omitted quoting degeorge dist,cir.
it is well established that t he absence of controlling precedent weighs strongly against a finding of clear error.van dusen i,at citations omitted.if no prior ninth circuit authority prohibited the course taken by the district court,its ruling is not clearly erroneous.in re morgan,cir.further,a question of first impression not yet addressed by any circuit court in a published opinion can not satisfy the third bauman factor,requiring a showing of a clear error by the district court.medhekar dist,cir.
the district court did not commit clear error when it issued its case management order.it did so in response to our instructions in van dusen ii that the district court must determine whether the contractor agreements between each appellant and swift are exempt under of the faa before it may consider swift motion to compel.app x at.crucially,in neither van dusen i nor van dusen ii did we instruct the district court to make the determination in a certain way.certainly our opinions did not direct the district court to decide the issue on briefing alone,as swift contends.therefore,when the district court sought to resolve the question through discovery and a trial,it did not contravene our instructions.the district court management and planning order is not clearly erroneous on the basis of our opinions in this case.
nor is the district court case management order contrary to other precedents of the supreme court or this circuit.further,there do not appear to be any decisions from our sister circuits on the question of whether the faa compels a certain procedural choice in a district court determination.the absence of precedent weighs heavily against finding clear error.in re morgan,at.accordingly,we can not say that the district court committed clear error.van dusen i,at medhekar,at.
the fourth bauman factor is whether the district court order is an error,or manifests a persistent disregard of the federal rules.given the lack of precedent,we can not say that the alleged error is.and the issuance of a case management order is not only consistent with,but required by,the federal rules.see fed.civ.b.
the final bauman factor is whether the district court order raises new and important problems,or issues of law of first impression.the question of whether the faa compels district courts to decide exemptions on the basis of briefing alone is an issue of first impression,so this factor weighs in favor of swift.however,swift does have a remedy in the form of direct appeal to make its argument.
in sum,the bauman factors weigh against the grant of mandamus relief.swift has a remedy in urging its position before the district court in dispositive motions and,if the district court is adverse to swift,in the form of direct appeal following the issuance of a final order.normal litigation expense does not constitute sufficient prejudice to warrant relief,and the discovery cost has already been incurred.most crucially,in the absence of controlling precedent,the district court order was not clearly erroneous.the district court order is not an error,if indeed it is an error at all,and certainly does not manifest a persistent disregard of the federal rules.although the question may be one of first impression,swift has a remedy.therefore,applying the bauman factors,we conclude that swift is not entitled to the extraordinary relief of the issuance of a writ of mandamus 
petition denied.
if this were a direct appeal from a district court order denying swift motion to compel arbitration,i might agree with judge ikuta that the issue before the district court is one of law not requiring discovery.but,because the district judge has neither granted nor denied swift motion,there is no appealable order.what is before us,rather,is a petition for mandamus.
mandamus is a drastic remedy and is to be used only in extraordinary circumstances.johnson,cir.quoting united states sherman,cir.here,virtually nothing would be gained by granting the writ.the district court will shortly decide whether van dusen contract is one of employment under the federal arbitration act.if the court decides that it is not,it will order arbitration,mooting the mandamus petition.and,if the court finds that van dusen contract is one of employment and denies the motion to compel arbitration,swift can appeal.id.a b.even assuming,as judge ikuta persuasively argues,that the issue before the district court could have been resolved without discovery,discovery is now complete.there is no extraordinary need to interrupt the proceedings below.
interstate truck driver van dusen signed an agreement with swift designating van dusen as an independent contractor.the agreement also stated that the parties would arbitrate any dispute.van dusen now says that she was actually an employee and the contract was really one of employment,so it was exempt from the federal arbitration act faa.we have twice before given this district court a single task decide whether the agreement falls into the category of contracts of employment for purposes of the faa.instead,six years after our first ruling,the district court is erroneously requiring the parties to undertake an evidentiary hearing on the merits to decide whether van dusen is functionally an employee.under the circumstances of this case,the extraordinary remedy of a writ of mandamus is warranted.
van dusen entered into a contractor agreement with swift for the interstate transportation of freight.the parties agreed that van dusen was an independent contractor who would determine the method,means and manner of performing work and services under the agreement and could provide the same services for others.the parties also bargained to arbitrate a ll disputes and claims arising under,arising out of or relating to the contractor agreement,including the arbitrability of disputes between the parties.
notwithstanding this agreement,van dusen and other interstate truckers brought a lawsuit in claiming that they were functionally employees and that swift had violated the fair labor standards act flsa,and state wage laws by failing to pay them minimum wages including overtime and by making unlawful deductions from their wages.van dusen sought to certify a class of essentially all truckers who had driven under a contract with swift since.
swift immediately moved to compel arbitration of these claims as provided in the contractor agreement.van dusen moved to block arbitration on the ground that the agreements themselves were exempt from arbitration under of the faa,which states,nothing herein contained shall apply to contracts of employment of seamen,railroad employees,or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce.van dusen claimed that the contractor agreements for interstate transportation of freight were contracts of employment.
the district court initially concluded that the arbitrator should decide whether the form agreements were contracts of employment.we disagreed.see in re van dusen,cir.van dusen i.instead,we concluded that explicitly carves out a category of cases exempt from the provisions of the act,and therefore a district court has no authority to compel arbitration where exempts the underlying contract from the faa provisions.id.at.although we declined to grant van dusen mandamus petition,we sent the case back to the district court expressly holding that the district court must decide,as a matter of law,whether the contractor agreement between swift and van dusen was of the kind that is exempt from the faa.id.at.
instead of making this legal determination,the district court granted van dusen motion for certification of an interlocutory appeal.when the case came back to us with the same question,whether a district court should assess whether a exemption applies,we unsurprisingly did not change our mind.we stated that our prior ruling was law of the case and law of the circuit,and w
