this case presents the issue of whether relief under code of civil procedure section,subdivision b is available when a party files an untimely request for a trial following an arbitration conducted pursuant to the mandatory fee arbitration act,business and professions code section et the mfaa.section,subdivision b authorizes a court to relieve a party from a judgment,dismissal,order,or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.section,subdivision b also requires a court to grant relief from a default,default judgment,or dismissal resulting from a mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect attested to by an attorney in a supporting affidavit.here,defendants demanded arbitration under the mfaa in response to a lawsuit initiated by plaintiff,defendants former attorney,seeking attorney fees.after an arbitration panel issued an award in plaintiff favor,defendants demanded a trial following arbitration,as allowed by the mfaa.due to miscommunication between defendants attorney and his secretary,however,the request for a trial following arbitration was filed with the court after the applicable statutory deadline.defendants then sought relief under section,subdivision b on the ground that their failure to timely file the request resulted from their attorney excusable error.the trial court denied relief,holding that section,subdivision b did not apply under the circumstances.the court of appeal disagreed and reversed.
we conclude that section,subdivision b can not remedy a failure to meet the deadline for seeking a trial following arbitration under the mfaa.in allowing parties to seek a trial de novo after fee arbitration,the mfaa incorporates a procedure analogous for present purposes to a conventional appeal.as a general rule,section,subdivision b can not extend the period in which a party must file a notice of appeal.no persuasive justification exists for departing from this principle here,as the mfaa terms,policy goals,and legislative history all indicate that the legislature did not intend for the deadline for seeking a trial after fee arbitration to be subject to extension through invocation of section,subdivision b.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeal.
factual and procedural background 
the parties agree that these are the relevant facts.on august,plaintiff james maynard,an attorney,sued defendants louise brandon satyananda apaji tagra,also known as frederick saylor lakoo kriya church,successor organization to the joy life church and the institute of spiritual education and evolution in riverside county superior court.with his lawsuit,plaintiff sought to recover legal fees allegedly owed him for his work in a dispute involving a trust.instead of answering the complaint,defendants invoked their right under the mfaa to compel arbitration of the dispute.plaintiff suit was stayed pending completion of the arbitration.
after a hearing on the merits,the arbitration panel awarded plaintiff,an amount representing some,though not all,of the fees he sought.the panel mailed the notice of award to plaintiff and to defendants prior counsel on august.defendants retained new counsel on september.
an arbitration award becomes binding under the mfaa days after the mailing of the notice of award,unless a party has within that time filed a request for a de novo trial after arbitration with an appropriate court.bus,subd.b,subds.b,c.on september,defendants new counsel mailed a rejection of arbitration award to plaintiff.however,the rejection was not filed with the riverside county superior court until october,by which time the period for seeking a trial following arbitration already had expired.
defendants subsequently filed a request for relief under section,subdivision b.defendants request for relief claimed that the arbitration award had become binding only due to their attorney mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect in failing to timely file the request for a trial following arbitration.in a declaration filed in connection with the request for relief,defendants counsel attributed the late filing to his secretary unforeseen departure from work due to a death in her family.
after finding that defendants had improperly noticed their request for relief,on december,the trial court granted plaintiff petition to confirm the arbitration award.on january,the trial court denied defendants noticed motion for relief under section,subdivision b from the order confirming the award.in denying the motion,the trial court concluded that the mfaa deadline for seeking a trial following arbitration was not amenable to section,subdivision b relief.three days later,the court issued a judgment for plaintiff in the amount of.
defendants appealed,and the court of appeal reversed the judgment.the court of appeal likened the procedure for a trial after mfaa least in situations where the arbitration is commenced after an attorney initiates a lawsuit seeking recovery of the right to a trial de novo following judicial arbitration.cal.rules of court,rule a.as the judicial arbitration statute and california rules of court both expressly authorize section,subdivision b relief in connection with a party failure to timely seek a trial de novo following judicial arbitration cal.rules of court,rule d,the court of appeal reasoned that the same relief should be available here.
in so holding,the decision below recognized the disagreement between the courts of appeal regarding the availability of section,subdivision b relief upon a failure to comply with the deadline for seeking a trial following arbitration under the mfaa,with simpson williams d.simpson holding that such relief is authorized,and shiver,mcgrane martin littell d.holding to the contrary.we granted review to resolve this conflict 
discussion 
the present dispute concerns the interplay between section,subdivision b and the mfaa deadline for seeking a trial after fee arbitration.defendants argue that upon a showing of mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect,section,subdivision b allows a court to relieve a party in their position from the consequences of a failure to meet this deadline.plaintiff,for his part,contends that the deadline is mandatory and jurisdictional and that section,subdivision b therefore does not apply.
section,subdivision b provides in pertinent part that t he court may,upon any terms as may be just,relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,dismissal,order,or other proceeding taken against him or her through his or her mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect,provided relief is sought within a reasonable time,in no case exceeding six months,after the judgment,dismissal,order,or proceeding was taken.in addition to authorizing discretionary relief,section,subdivision b requires a court to vacate a default,default judgment,or dismissal resulting from attorney mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or neglect where the culpable attorney timely files a sworn affidavit attesting to his or her error.
t he provisions of section of the code of civil procedure are to be liberally construed and sound policy favors the determination of actions on their merits.citation.zamora clayborn contracting group,cal th,d.b ecause the law strongly favors trial and disposition on the merits,any doubts in applying section must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default.elston city of turlock cal d.
the term proceeding,as used in section,subdivision b,incorporates a ll the steps or measures adopted in the prosecution or defense of an action.citation.zellerino brown d,d.accordingly,section,subdivision b may afford parties relief from the consequences of a wide variety of procedural errors committed in the course of an action.errors held to be amenable to section,subdivision b relief include the issuance of untimely demands for expert witness disclosures zellerino,at,d,erroneous offers to compromise zamora clayborn contracting group,supra,cal th,d,inadvertent dismissals palace hardware smith cal,failures to timely respond to requests for admissions under section elston city of turlock,supra,cal d,and the untimely filing of cost bills soda marriott,just to name a few.
notwithstanding the broad construction afforded section,subdivision b,the statute does not offer relief from mandatory deadlines deemed jurisdictional in nature.estate of simmons cal,witkin,cal.procedure ed.attack on judgment in trial court.thus section,subdivision b can not extend the time in which a party must move for a new trial,since this time limit is considered jurisdictional.union collection oliver cal,kisling otani d.nor does section,subdivision b generally apply to dismissals attributable to a party failure to comply with the applicable limitations period in which to institute an action,whether by complaint castro sacramento county fire protection dist.th,d hanooka pivko th,d or by writ petition kupka board of administration d.
furthermore,except as authorized by statute,section,subdivision b may not excuse the untimely filing of a notice of appeal.pressler donald bren cal d,fn.pressler.the requirement as to the time for taking an appeal is mandatory,and the court is without jurisdiction to consider one which has been taken subsequent to the expiration of the statutory period.in the absence of statutory authorization,neither the trial nor appellate courts may extend or shorten the time for appeal,even to relieve against mistake,inadvertence,accident,or misfortune.stuart whitman,cataldo d.
with these principles in mind,we turn to the mfaa provisions regarding the arbitration of fee disputes.arbitration under the mfaa is limited to disputes concerning legal fees,costs,or both.bus,subd.a.in the absence of written consent to arbitration,only one party to a fee compel submission of the controversy to an mfaa arbitration panel,subd.c.attorneys may invite,but can not require,clients to participate in mfaa arbitration.ibid.fee arbitration may occur either before an attorney files a complaint seeking recovery of fees,or after such an action has been initiated but before the client files an answer,subd.b.the filing and service of a request for arbitration automatically stays a pending lawsuit pertaining to fees,which remains stayed until the arbitrators issue their decision or the arbitration is otherwise terminated.bus,subd.c.an mfaa arbitration award is not binding unless the parties agree otherwise,subd.a.yet the mfaa also provides that e ven if the parties to the arbitration have not agreed in writing to be bound,the arbitration award shall become binding upon the passage of days after mailing of notice of the award,unless a party has,within the days,sought a trial after arbitration,subd.b.this trial after arbitration is conducted de novo,essentially as if no arbitration had occurred,subd.e aguilar lerner,supra,cal th at,d.
the mfaa provisions for trial after arbitration were incorporated into the statute in response to attorney concerns that compulsory arbitration would otherwise deny them a jury trial on their claims relating to fees.special com.on resolution of attorney fee disputes,letter to bd.of governors,state bar of.absent stipulation to binding fee arbitration,either party shall be entitled to a trial after arbitration if sought within days after mailing of notice of the arbitration award.bus,subd.a.as explained by the chairman of the state bar committee that proposed what would become the mfaa,if a trial de novo is desired,the party seeking the trial de novo must do so within thirty days of the mailing of notice of the arbitration award.frank farella,letter to peter behr re senate bill reg.sess.if there is an action pending,the trial after arbitration shall be initiated by filing a rejection of arbitration award and request for trial after arbitration in that action within days after mailing of notice of the award.bus,subd.b.if no action is pending,the trial after arbitration shall be initiated by the commencement of an action in the court having jurisdiction over the amount of money in controversy within days after mailing of notice of the award,subd.c.
in addressing a party right to seek a trial de novo,courts have historically applied the rules governing conventional appeals.sinnamon mckay d.and upon inspection,a trial following arbitration under the mfaa resembles a conventional appeal in a number of respects.an appeal is a proceeding undertaken to have a decision reconsidered by bringing it to a higher authority.blacks law dict.ed.the mfaa procedure for trial after arbitration resembles a conventional appeal in that it allows a court to entertain a dispute previously presented to and decided by another tribunal,in this case an mfaa arbitration panel.and just as filing a notice of appeal constitutes a prerequisite to appellate review pressler,supra,cal d at,only the filing of a request for a trial after arbitration authorizes the trial court to try a fee dispute de novo bus,subd.b,subd.a.but a trial following fee arbitration differs from a traditional appeal in other respects.whereas most conventional appeals are taken from judgments entered by a trial court,a request for a trial after arbitration nullifies an award issued by an arbitration panel.and unlike the limited review typically conducted by appellate courts,for the most part a trial following fee arbitration proceeds in the trial court as if there had been no arbitration at all.
the relevant question thus becomes whether the rule prohibiting section,subdivision b relief in connection with an untimely appeal applies here notwithstanding the differences between a traditional appeal and a trial following mfaa arbitration.in pressler,supra,cal d,we considered whether a deadline for seeking de novo judicial review of an administrative decision could be extended due to a party mistake,inadvertence,or excusable neglect.the court in shiver,mcgrane martin littell,supra,d at pages,relied on pressler in concluding that section,subdivision b can not excuse a failure to meet the mfaa deadline for requesting a trial following fee arbitration,and we agree that pressler analysis applies to the situation before us.
in pressler,supra,cal d,we addressed labor code provisions that specify the procedure for taking an appeal from an order,decision,or award issued by the labor commissioner in a wage dispute.under the labor code,a party to a wage dispute heard by the labor commissioner may,within days after service of the labor commissioners order,decision,or award,appeal the outcome to the superior court,where the matter is heard de novo,subd.a.the employer in pressler filed its notice of appeal three days after the statutory deadline had passed.pressler,at.pressler held that neither section nor equitable grounds could excuse the untimely filing.pressler,at.
pressler likened the procedure for appealing a decision by the labor commissioner to a conventional appeal,even though appeals in these wage disputes are taken after administrative proceedings and are heard de novo by the trial court.pressler,supra,cal d at.these differences were immaterial,pressler concluded,because the relevant labor code provisions manifested the legislature intent to immunize the limit from extension.pressler held,in this case,the statutory framework established by the legislature for the administrative resolution of wage disputes clearly demonstrates the mandatory and jurisdictional nature of the requirement that a party notice his or her appeal within days.id.at.in pertinent part,the labor code provides that a failure to timely file a notice of appeal from an order,decision,or award issued by the labor commissioner shall result in the decision or award becoming final,subd.a.once an order,decision,or award becomes final,a conforming judgment is to be entered by the clerk of the appropriate court,former subd.d,now subd.e.pressler held that t he import of these provisions is clear.the time for filing a notice of appeal from a decision of the labor commissioner is mandatory and jurisdictional.a late filing may not be excused on the grounds of mistake,inadvertence or excusable neglect.this conclusion is in harmony with the legislature purpose in providing an administrative forum for the resolution of wage disputes.the policy underlying this process is sound for it ensures the expedition of the collection of wages which are due but unpaid.citation.public policy has long favored the full and prompt payment of wages due an employee.citation.requiring strict adherence to the time requirement governing appeals from decisions of the labor commissioner can only help to assure the achievement of this overriding goal.pressler,at.
like the labor code provisions involved in pressler,the mfaa frames the deadline for seeking a trial following fee arbitration in uncompromising language,stating that the arbitration award shall become binding upon the passage of days after mailing of notice of the award,unless a party has,within the days,sought a trial after arbitration.bus,subd.b,italics added.the mfaa thus envisions the deadline for seeking a trial following fee arbitration as injecting a measure of finality into a dispute.a party who fails to timely request a trial de novo normally may be presumed to have acquiesced in the result reached through arbitration.consistent with pressler,the significant consequences attendant to a failure to timely seek a trial after mfaa arbitration indicate that the right to seek a trial following fee arbitration should be treated like a conventional appeal for purposes of determining the availability of relief under section,subdivision b.
and as in pressler,excluding the possibility of section,subdivision b relief here would promote the mfaa underlying policies.the policy behind the mandatory fee arbitration statutes is somewhat more specific than the general policy favoring arbitration.manatt,phelps,rothenberg tunney lawrence d.the mfaa was first proposed by the board of governors of the state bar of california in when,finding that disputes concerning legal fees were the most serious problem between members of the bar and the public,the board sought to create a mechanism for arbitrating disputes over legal fees and costs.recognizing the disparity in bargaining power in attorney fee matters which favors the attorney in dealings with infrequent consumers of legal services citation,that many clients could not afford hiring additional counsel to litigate fee disputes in the civil courts citation,and that previous schemes that called for voluntary arbitration were ineffective citation,the legislature enacted the mfaa.aguilar lerner,supra,cal th at,d,see also hargarten ardisson,fine tuning california mandatory attorney fee arbitration statute,hargarten ardisson.the mfaa thus makes available an arbitration mechanism designed to alleviate the disparity in bargaining power in attorney fee matters which favors the attorney by providing an effective,inexpensive remedy to a client which does not necessitate the hiring of a second attorney.manatt,phelps,rothenberg tunney lawrence,supra,d at.
just as strict enforcement of the deadline for challenging a decision by the labor commissioner serves the policy goal of ensuring prompt payment of wages due employees,rigid adherence to the mfaa deadline for seeking a trial following arbitration advances the statute goal of ensuring clients an efficient and effective procedure for resolving fee disputes that minimizes the disparities in bargaining power that necessarily arise whenever the court system is implicated in a fee dispute.in order to comply with the purpose of expeditious resolution of disputes through arbitration,time limits in which to challenge arbitration awards must be strictly enforced.knass blue cross of california d.authorizing section,subdivision b relief here would undermine the finality of binding fee awards,lead to additional reliance on the courts for resolving fee disputes,require more clients to hire counsel to represent them in litigating section,subdivision b motions and in subsequent proceedings,and worsen the disparity in bargaining power between clients and attorneys.these results would conflict with the legislature design in enacting the mfaa.
the mfaa legislative history also supports the conclusion that section,subdivision b relief is unavailable here.in describing what would become the mfaa,the statute crafters stated that the right to a trial following arbitration is similar to the right of a trial de novo following a small claims judgment.special com.on resolution of attorney fee disputes,letter to bd.of governors,state bar of,supra.it already was established by the time of the mfaa genesis that section can not extend the period for taking an appeal from a judgment by a small claims court.mills superior court d,fn.it follows from the above that section,subdivision b does not apply in the present circumstances.
in summary,the terms,goals,and legislative history of the mfaa all direct us toward the conclusion that section,subdivision b can not relieve a party from the consequences of a failure to meet the deadline for seeking a trial following mfaa arbitration,and we so hold.the court of appeal below and simpson,supra,d.reached the contrary result,however,by analogizing arbitration under the mfaa to judicial arbitration,under which section,subdivision b relief is available.this analogy to judicial arbitration is superficially attractive,but ultimately provides an insufficient basis upon which to find relief available here.
the judicial arbitration statute provides for arbitration of disputes with limited amounts in controversy,subd.b.the judicial arbitration statute and the california rules of court promulgated thereunder authorize a party to seek a trial de novo following judicial arbitration,provided it does so within days after the filing of the arbitration award.cal.rules of court,rule a.the judicial arbitration statute and california rules of court also provide that a party who fails to comply with the deadline for requesting a trial following judicial arbitration may seek relief under section from the judgment that is entered automatically upon such default.cal.rules of court,rule d.
the court of appeal concluded that under the present circumstances,in which defendants sought arbitration following plaintiff institution of a civil action seeking fees,mfaa arbitration was analogous to judicial arbitration and section,subdivision b relief therefore should be available to defendants.the court of appeal distinguished pressler,holding that at the time defendants here compelled arbitration jurisdiction had already vested in the trial court with the filing of plaintiff complaint.as with a judicial arbitration,the trial court did not lose jurisdiction over the instant case while the fee dispute was being arbitrated but continued to monitor its progress,further distinguishing it from administrative review cases where the trial court has no jurisdiction until the appeal is filed.in likening mfaa arbitration to judicial arbitration,the court of appeal followed simpson,supra,d,which had concluded that s ection relief is available in the context of judicial arbitration.we can see no justification to deny it in connection with arbitration under the mfaa.id.at.
although similarities exist between judicial arbitration and arbitration under the mfaa,there are significant differences as well.most obviously,the judicial arbitration statute and california rules of court expressly authorize section relief from a judgment entered following judicial arbitration cal.rules of court,rule d,while the mfaa makes no mention of section,subdivision b.simpson,supra,d.attempted to explain away this difference by noting that,as first adopted,rule d of the california rules of court which predated the present,and the relevant provisions of which are now contained within rule d limited the grounds upon which a judgment following judicial arbitration could be attacked or set aside to those expressly discussed in the rule,which did not mention section.simpson,at.given this proscription,an explicit reference to section had to be added to rule d in order to make section relief available.simpson,at.simpson noted that the relevant provisions of the mfaa contain no comparable limiting language.simpson,at.simpson inferred from this distinction that section relief was not prohibited under the mfaa.simpson,at.in effect,in simpson view section,
