appellants winston and elaine lambert sued respondents chris carneghi and robert dailey for negligence over their alleged failure to adequately advance their position in a fire insurance appraisal proceeding pursuant to insurance code section section.the trial court sustained respondents demurrers,and appellants appealed from the subsequent judgments.we conclude that an appraisal proceeding pursuant to section is an arbitration,and that respondent carneghi was immune from suit over his role as an appraiser.however,we find that the litigation privilege,subd.b does not protect respondent dailey from suit over his role as an expert hired by appellants.we therefore affirm the trial court order sustaining respondent carneghi demurrer,but reverse the trial court order sustaining dailey demurrer.
factual and proceduralbackground 
the appeal in this case is from a judgment of dismissal entered after the sustaining of a general demurrer.accordingly,in setting forth the relevant facts for purposes of our review,we are guided by the familiar rules applicable in this setting.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions,or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.citation.moore conliffe cal th,d.we can not,and do not,consider the declaration of respondent dailey that was submitted to the trial court in connection with his demurrer,because the limited role of the demurrer is to test the legal sufficiency of the complaint.donabedian mercury ins.th,d.
appellants owned a home in los altos hills that was totally destroyed by an accidental fire in march.the residence was insured by a policy issued by fire insurance exchange fie,which determined that the policy fully covered the fire damage.appellants policy provided guaranteed replacement cost coverage,as well as a building ordinance or law coverage endorsement,which provided that fie would also pay the full replacement cost to replace or repair the lamberts residence in conformity with applicable laws,processes and regulations respecting the premises.italics omitted.fie hired two appraisers,and provided appellants with checks based on the appraisers reports.appellants accepted the checks with the understanding that they represented a deposit until a determination of the full replacement cost of their residence.
it took approximately four years for appellants to obtain the necessary permits to replace their home.during this time,appellants incurred a very substantial amount of rent and other soft costs in architectural,legal,surveying,engineering consulting fees,town fees and interest expenses,fie and appellants were unable to agree on the replacement cost value to rebuild appellants entire home.appellants therefore invoked their right to appraisal in accordance with the terms of their insurance policy.
appellants did not attach a copy of their fie insurance policy to their complaint however,the parties agree that fie was required under california insurance code to include the following provision in its fire policy regarding appraisals in case the insured and this company shall fail to agree as to the actual cash value or the amount of loss,then,on the written request of either,each shall select a competent and disinterested appraiser and notify the other of the appraiser selected within days of the request.where the request is accepted,the appraisers shall first select a competent and disinterested umpire and failing for days to agree upon the umpire,then,on request of the insured or this company,the umpire shall be selected by a judge of a court of record in the state in which the property covered is located.appraisal proceedings are informal unless the insured and this company mutually agree otherwise.for purposes of this section,informal means that no formal discovery shall be conducted,including depositions,interrogatories,requests for admission,or other forms of formal civil discovery,no formal rules of evidence shall be applied,and no court reporter shall be used for the proceedings.the appraisers shall then appraise the loss,stating separately actual cash value and loss to each item and,failing to agree,shall submit their differences,only,to the umpire.an award in writing,so itemized,of any two when filed with this company shall determine the amount of actual cash value and loss.each appraiser shall be paid by the party selecting him or her and the expenses of appraisal and umpire shall be paid by the parties equally.italics omitted.
appellants hired attorneys to represent them in the appraisal process.one of the attorneys hired respondent dailey as an expert to define,describe and estimate the replacement cost of appellants home for the appraisal process.original italics.appellants also hired respondent carneghi as their appraiser,to provide appraisal services in connection with the appraisal at issue,essentially to determine replacement cost and to be their advocate in the appraisal process and to make sure those relevant to the appraisal understood the meaning and application of the term replacement cost and to convince those involved in the appraisal of the correctness of his valuation by supporting it with facts and logic.original italics.
appellants attorneys selected a retired judge who had never conducted a replacement cost appraisal as an umpire.according to appellants,the umpire demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding of replacement costs at the beginning of the hearing on the appraisal.according to appellants complaint,none of the people hired by appellants changed,or even adequately tried to change,the umpire understanding,even though they had been hired to do so.they likewise failed throughout the appraisal hearing to clarify the meaning of the term replacement cost.because the people who appellants hired failed to adequately define the correct standard of replacement cost for the appraisal,appellants were not awarded proper replacement costs.appellants allege they were damaged by at least million.
appellants sued respondents carneghi and dailey in connection with the allegedly flawed appraisal process as amended,their complaint alleged a single cause of action for negligence against respondents.respondents both demurred to the complaint.the trial court sustained both demurrers without leave to amend,and judgments were entered for respondents this timely appeal followed.
discussiona.standard of review.
our standard of review is well established.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.zelig county of los angeles cal th,d,quoting blank kirwan cal d.
no error to sustain carneghi demurrer without leave to amend.
appraisal procedure is an arbitration.
in arguing that the trial court should sustain his demurrer without leave to amend,carneghi argued below that the appraisal process mandated by the insurance code and described in appellant complaint constituted an arbitration,and that he was entitled to arbitral immunity because his role as an appraiser was analogous to that of an arbitrator.in their opposition,appellants essentially conceded that the appraisal process in this case was a form of arbitration,referring to carneghi as a party appraiser,or arbitrator.appellants argued that because carneghi was alleged to have played a role as a advocate,he was not subject to arbitral immunity.the trial court stated at the hearing on the demurrer that carneghi had prevailed,but left open the question whether it would grant appellants leave to amend.the court ultimately sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
appellants opening brief to this court raises a single argument,not raised below,that the appraisal process set forth in section is not an arbitration.having failed to raise this issue below,they have arguably waived it.people ex rel.of transportation superior court th,d as a general rule,issues not raised in trial court can not be raised for first time on appeal.
even assuming the argument was not waived,it clearly lacks merit.it is well settled that a n agreement to conduct an appraisal contained in a policy of insurance constitutes an agreement within the meaning of code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,and therefore is considered to be an arbitration agreement subject to the statutory contractual arbitration law.citation.louise gardens of encino homeowners,truck ins.exchange,th,d considering award issued after appraisal pursuant to section see also appalachian insurance rivcom d.appalachian as used in the code of civil procedure,an agreement providing for an appraisal pursuant to section is included within the concept of agreements to arbitrate.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group,appraisal proceedings are form of arbitration and are subject to rules governing arbitrations.as this court recognized more than a decade ago,the appraisal process set forth in section is akin to arbitration.gebers state farm general ins.th,d.although it is true,as appellants argue,that this court did not specifically state that an appraisal is identical to an arbitration,appellants present no compelling argument that the appraisal process in section is not,in fact,an arbitration.
appellants acknowledge that under california arbitration act,the term a greement includes but is not limited to agreements providing for appraisals code civ,subd.a,italics added.the term appraisals was added to the arbitration act in to expressly extend the coverage of the statute to appraisal proceedings.klubnikin california fair plan d.appellants argue that although an appraisal is an agreement,it is not an agreement to submit to arbitration,which is referenced elsewhere in the arbitration act.code civ,a written agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy thereafter arising is valid,enforceable and irrevocable.what this argument fails to acknowledge is that the term arbitration is not itself defined in the arbitration act.renaissance hotel associates th,d.in determining whether an internal employee review committee procedure was an agreement to arbitrate,our colleagues in division two concluded that although arbitration can take many procedural forms,a dispute resolution procedure is not an arbitration unless there is a third party decision maker,a final and binding decision,and a mechanism to assure a minimum level of impartiality with respect to the rendering of that decision.id.at,d.in reaching its conclusion,the court pointed to section and acknowledged that california case law recognizes that this appraisal provision is an arbitration agreement,supra,at,d.although it may be true,as appellants argue,that the insurance code does not specifically define an appraisal as an arbitration,appellants simply ignore the fact that a decision from this district has concluded that the appraisal process is an arbitration.ibid.
appellants argue that an insurance appraisal is vastly different from an arbitration.they point to the fact that the appraisal clause mandated by section does not specify how an umpire and two appointed appraisers will decide issues where the appraisers fail to reach an agreement,and does not provide for the discovery,testimony,briefing,or any of the other accouterments that we associate with litigation or with arbitration.although it is true that arbitration can take many procedural forms renaissance hotel associates,supra,th at,d,it does not follow that a fire insurance appraisal is not an arbitration simply because it does not have the accouterments that appellants claim are required in order for a procedure to be considered an arbitration.original italics.this is especially true in light of the fact that california law does not automatically guarantee the right to discovery in arbitration proceedings,except in certain types of cases or unless the parties agree.code civ,subd.a witkin,cal.procedure ed.proceedings without trial.moreover,in general,appraisal proceedings are subject to the rules governing contractual arbitration proceedings.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra.
we likewise reject appellants argument,based on jefferson ins.superior court cal d,and safeco ins.sharma d.safeco,that because appraisers powers are somewhat different from those of arbitrators in other contexts,that means an appraisal pursuant to section is not an arbitration.the supreme court held in jefferson that the trial court had properly vacated an appraisal award pursuant to section,because the appraisers had based the appraisal award on a misconception of the law.jefferson,supra,at.the court noted that appraisers generally have more limited powers than those of arbitrators,and the appraisers in jefferson had exceeded those powers when they did more than simply determine the actual cash value of an insured building.id.at.safeco likewise held that appraisers had exceeded their powers by doing more than simply determine the amount of loss.safeco,supra,at.just because the role of appraisers may be more limited than that of powers may of course always be limited by contract bonshire thompson th,d that does not make an appraisal any less of an arbitration.in fact,both jefferson and safeco acknowledged the similarities between appraisals and arbitrations.jefferson,supra,at,fn,enforcement procedures respecting arbitration are applicable to appraisals safeco,supra,at.because of similarity between arbitration and appraisal enforcement proceedings,court applied standard of review applicable to arbitration awards 
we also reject appellants unsupported assertion that because appraisers are not permitted to determine issues of law or coverage,decisions of fire insurance appraisers lack the finality of an arbitrator award.this claim of lack of finality is directly contradicted by section,which provides that when an award is submitted to the insurance company,it shall determine the amount of actual cash value and loss.the parties are then free to confirm the award issued by the panel in the same manner in which an arbitration award is enforced.jefferson ins.superior court,supra,cal d at,fn,louise gardens of encino homeowners.truck ins.exchange,supra,th at,d.a confirmed award of appraisers and umpire is treated as a confirmed arbitration award,which has the same force and effect as a judgment in a civil action.klubnikin california fair plan,supra,d at.although it is true that a party to a fire insurance contract retains jury trial rights as to other issues,the party simply has no jury trial right as regards the setting of the dollar amount of the loss under the policy.appalachian,supra,d at.
appellants do not dispute the fact that several published appellate decisions have held that an appraisal pursuant to section is an arbitration,but argue that none of the cases includes the close reading of the plain words of the arbitration act statute that appellants advocate.for example,appellants attempt to distinguish klubnikin california fair plan,supra,d at page,which held that a confirmed award of appraisers and an umpire in a fire insurance appraisal shall be treated as a confirmed award in arbitration under california arbitration statute,by arguing that the court likened an appraisal to arbitration for that limited purpose.but klubnikin holding that a judgment confirming an appraisal award is not subject to collateral attack except for grounds that would be available to attack any other civil judgment is directly relevant to this appeal.having apparently failed to petition the trial court to vacate the appraisal award,appellants may not now collaterally attack the award by suing their appraiser.ibid.
appellants also criticize appalachian,supra,d,which reversed the denial of a petition to compel an appraisal pursuant to section.id.at.in considering whether an appraisal clause deprives an insured of the right to a jury trial,the court concluded that an agreement providing for an appraisal is included within the concept of agreements to arbitrate code civ,subd.a,and noted that the appraisal clauses in fire insurance policies had been enforced for almost years.appalachian,supra,at,citing saucelito cal.it cited a ninth circuit case that referred to the appraisal process as a quasi judicial process of arbitration.appalachian,supra,at,quoting hyland millers nat.ins.cir.appellants criticize appalachian for relying on saucelito,which predated the statutory procedure at issue,but fail to acknowledge that the predecessor to section was adopted in,and was referred to as a quasi judicial process of arbitration as early as years ago.appalachian,supra,at.
we reject appellants argument that other cases simply cite appalachian,supra,d with a dearth of reasoning or analysis as to whether the appraisal process in section is an arbitration.appellants argument rests on the mistaken assumption that appalachian reached an erroneous conclusion,and that appalachian should have analyzed the difference between an agreement and an agreement to submit to arbitration.as appellants acknowledge,no case supports the interpretation of section that they advocate.they note that several opinions from the second district holding that a fire insurance appraisal is an arbitration are not binding on this court.however,given that this court already has stated that the appraisal process pursuant to section is akin to arbitration gebers state farm general ins,supra,th at,d,we find no compelling reason to reject case law holding that a fire insurance appraisal pursuant to section is an arbitration.
carneghi is protected by arbitral immunity.
appellants argue generally that the legislature has not provided a shield to those who are hired to do a job for a party to a fire insurance appraisal and through their negligence fail to do it and thereby cause injury to the party employing them.although they acknowledge that carneghi argued below that he had arbitral immunity,they do not specifically address this issue in their opening brief,other than to say that t he arbitral immunity carneghi argued was based on the notion that appellants suit against them,based upon their misconduct in the appraisal process,was really complaining about their actions in an arbitration since an appraisal does not constitute an arbitration,carneghi is not immune to suit.having failed to address the issue of arbitral immunity in their opening brief,they have arguably waived it.in re marriage of sheldon d.well settled that appellate court may consider as waived any issue not raised in appellant opening brief.
even assuming the issue was not waived,it clearly lacks merit.it long has been recognized that,in private arbitration proceedings,an arbitrator enjoys the benefit of an arbitral privilege because the role that he or she exercises is analogous to that of a judge this arbitrators in private contractual arbitration proceedings from tort well established in california.citation.moore conliffe,supra,cal th at,d,witness who testifies at deposition in private,contractual arbitration proceeding protected by litigation privilege.arbitrators are judges chosen by the parties to decide the matters submitted to them arbitrators have been extended the protection of judicial immunity,because they perform the function of resolving disputes between parties,or of authoritatively adjudicating private rights.stasz schwab th,d.although we agree with appellants that no case has specifically extended arbitral immunity to appraisers,we disagree with appellants assertion that any analysis of arbitral immunity is wide of the mark,given the similarities between arbitrations and appraisals pursuant to section.
coopers lybrand superior court d.coopers is not to the contrary,as appellants argue.coopers considered whether the trial court erred in overruling defendants demurrer,based on the fact that the auditor in a binding audit had arbitral immunity.id.at.the court interpreted former code of civil procedure section as conferring full arbitral immunity upon arbitrators in appraisals,valuations and similar proceedings,such as audits,irrespective of the arbitrator particular role in a given situation.coopers,supra,at,italics added.the court rejected the argument that an arbitrator misconduct or fraud cuts off arbitral immunity,holding that t he remedy for arbitrator misconduct lies in vacation of the award under code of civil procedure section.ibid.the court nonetheless held that the specific agreement for a binding valuation at issue was not per se an agreement for arbitration,and that something more was required to show that it was an arbitration.id.at.here,by contrast,it is well settled that an appraisal pursuant to section is an arbitration as a matter of law.coopers,supra,at.
appellants argue for the first time in their reply brief that the duties of party appraisers are analogous to those of lawyers,and that appraisers therefore should not be subject to arbitral immunity.appellants cite no authority for their claims that,for example,appraisers advocate their appraisals to the umpire just as lawyers advocate their client positions before a judge,or that it is their duty to write appraisals and present them to the other side appraiser,argue his or her positions and,failing to convince the other and reach agreement on them,to argue those positions on those appraisals as to which there is disagreement to the umpire who makes the decision.the comparison of appraisers to lawyers is contrary to the holding in klubnikin california fair plan,supra,d at page,that appraisers empowered by the terms of a policy of fire insurance to determine the cash value and loss utilized to ascertain the amount payable on the policy are arbitrators within the meaning of code of civil procedure section.
in fact,this court opinion in gebers state farm general ins,supra,th,d,analogized the role of an appraiser to that of an arbitrator.the court held that an insurance company was not permitted to alter a fire insurance policy to describe appraisers as independent and therefore potentially biased toward a party in light of the requirement in section that an appraiser be disinterested.gebers,supra,at,d.the court noted that the entire appraisal panel the umpire and both appraisers are held to a higher standard of impartiality than are arbitrators generally,because the legislature has mandated appraiser impartiality.id.at,d.because the appraiser selected by the insurance company in gebers had a direct pecuniary interest in ongoing litigation work with the company and was therefore presumably biased,the court vacated the underlying award issued by the arbitration panel.id.at,d,citing code civ,award must be vacated if there was corruption in any of the arbitrators.given the fact that this court has held that the legislature has made appraiser impartiality a statutory requirement gebers,supra,at,d,we disagree with appellants unsupported assertion that the party appraiser duties are more like the duties of an attorney.
appellants also argue,again for the first time in their reply brief,that even if carneghi was considered an arbitrator,the vast differences in both the ethics and duties of a and a true neutral arbitrator compel a finding that carneghi was not subject to arbitral immunity.appellants rely on a seventh circuit case interpreting the federal arbitration act,a new york appellate court case,and a provision in the american arbitration association code of ethics for arbitrators in commercial disputes,canon x eff.sphere drake ins.all american life ins.cir,arbitrator on a tripartite panel is supposed to be an advocate astoria medical group health ins.plan of gr,arbitrators are not neutral in the sense that neutral arbitrator or judge is am.arb,supra,canon x ethical standards for arbitrators.having failed to raise this argument with the trial court or in their opening brief,appellants have doubly waived the argument.heiner kmart th,d.we note that appraisers appointed under the statutory scheme at issue here must make the same disclosures to the parties as are required of neutral arbitrators generally.croskey et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra,italics added.in any event,we disagree that it would be nonsense to provide arbitral immunity to appraisers,because of whatever difference exists in the role played by a appraiser as opposed to an umpire.we see no reason why an appraiser who is required by statute to be disinterested should be subject to tort liability in connection with his role as an appraiser,given this state preference to provide immunity to those who perform the function of resolving disputes between parties.stasz schwab,supra,th at,d.
we also find unpersuasive the canadian case that appellants cite in their reply brief.ivarson lloyd underwriters,kelowna,bcsc,wl lexis.first,we are of course not bound by a decision from a court in british columbia,which obviously did not analyze california insurance code.second,the court in ivarson did not hold,as appellants claim,that an appraiser is not subject to arbitral immunity.the court specifically stated that i t may be that an appraiser does enjoy immunity against a claim for damages in negligence or breach of contract for his or her actions in an appraisal process,but that summary dismissal was inappropriate on the record before it.italics added.
appellants argue,once again for the first time in their reply brief,that because the appraisal proceeding at issue was an atypical anomaly among appraisals,setting the precedent of immunity for all appraisers based upon the record in this case would be very unwise.unnecessary capitalization removed.they claim,without citation to any source whatsoever,that it is rare for an umpire to be selected in a fire insurance appraisal,and that almost no appraisals involve a hearing.even assuming arguendo that those unsupported facts are true,it does not follow that an appraiser should not be subject to arbitral immunity.appellants claim that providing arbitral immunity to appraisers could lead to unintended and disastrous results,because arbitrators may escape liability when they ignore irrefutable proof that supports a party position.the remedy for arbitrator misconduct lies in vacation of the award under code of civil procedure section.coopers,supra,d at.see also klubnikin california fair plan,supra,d at.appellants were of course free to petition the trial court pursuant to the arbitration act to vacate the appraisal award.jefferson ins.superior court,supra,cal d at,gebers state farm general ins,supra,th at,d.again,having failed to do so,they may not now collaterally attack the award by suing an appraiser for any alleged acts or omissions in the appraisal process.
finally,as respondent carneghi correctly notes,appellants did not seek leave from the trial court to amend their complaint,and they do not argue on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion in sustaining carneghi demurrer without leave to amend.although appellants were not required to request below to amend their pleading in order to raise the issue on appeal code civ,subd.a,they have not presented any reason that they should have been granted leave to amend their complaint,and our review has revealed none.the trial court did not err in sustaining carneghi demurrer without leave to amend.
sustaining dailey demurrer was error.
in arguing that the trial court should sustain his demurrer without leave to amend,respondent dailey argued below that his expert testimony was protected by the litigation privilege,subd.b.in their opposition,appellants argued that the litigation privilege protects only experts of a party opponent,not experts hired by a plaintiff.they relied on mattco forge,arthur young th,d mattco,which held that the litigation privilege does not protect a negligent expert witness from liability to the party who hired him.at the hearing on dailey demurrer,the trial court stated that it was inclined to overrule the demurrer.the trial court did not rule on the demurrer at the hearing as it had done with carneghi demurrer,but ultimately sustained dailey demurrer without leave to amend.appellants contend that the trial court erred by sustaining dailey demurrer.
appellants first argue that because the appraisal proceeding did not constitute an arbitration,the litigation privilege did not apply we have already rejected appellants argument that the appraisal proceeding did not constitute an arbitration.additionally,appellants again argue on appeal,relying on mattco,supra,th,d,that the litigation privilege does not apply where a plaintiff sues his own expert for negligence.this contention has merit.
civil code section,subdivision b provides that a privileged publication is one made i n any legislative proceeding,judicial proceeding,in any other official proceeding authorized by law,or in the initiation or course of any other proceeding authorized by law and reviewable pursuant to chapter commencing with section of title of part of the code of civil procedure,with exceptions not relevant here.
several policies underlie the privilege.first,it affords litigants free access to the courts to secure and defend their rights without fear of harassment by later suits.second,the courts rely on the privilege to prevent the proliferation of lawsuits after the first one is resolved.third,the privilege facilitates crucial functions of the trier of fact.mattco,supra,th at,d.i n immunizing participants from liability for torts arising from communications made during judicial proceedings,the law places upon litigants the burden of exposing during trial the bias of witnesses and the falsity of evidence,thereby enhancing the finality of judgments and avoiding an unending roundelay of litigation,an evil far worse than an occasional unfair result.silberg anderson cal d.
the statutory privilege protects attorneys,judges,jurors,witnesses,and other court personnel from liability arising from publications made during a judicial proceeding.citation.although originally enacted in the context of defamation actions,the privilege now applies to any communication,whether or not it amounts to a publication citations,and all torts except malicious prosecution.citations.further,it applies to any publication required or permitted by law in the course of a judicial proceeding to achieve the objects of the litigation,even though the publication is made outside the courtroom and no function of the court or its officers is involved.citations.mattco,supra,th at,d.
the usual formulation is that the privilege applies to any communication made in judicial or proceedings by litigants or other participants authorized by law to achieve the objects of the litigation and that have some connection or logical relation to the action.silberg anderson,supra,cal d at.the litigation privilege is broadly applied citation and doubts are resolved in favor of the privilege citation.ramalingam thompson th,d.the privilege protects statements made in private,contractual arbitration proceedings in order to encourage witnesses to provide open and candid testimony.moore conliffe,supra,cal th at,d.it has been used to protect the expert witness of a party opponent id.at,d,as well as experts jointly hired by parties,ramalingam thompson,supra,th at,d gootee lightner d.
the court in mattco held that the litigation privilege does not bar a plaintiff lawsuit against an expert witness hired by the plaintiff to assist him in litigation.th at page,d.mattco forge,mattco hired an accounting firm to provide litigation support in a federal action against an electric company,including calculating and testifying about profits mattco allegedly lost because of the electric company conduct.id.at,d.to calculate estimated lost profits,mattco recreated estimate sheets and gave them to their accountants.id.at,d.the federal district court held that mattco created and produced fraudulent documents,with an intent to deceive its party opponent and the court.ibid.the court ruled that mattco had engaged in fraudulent conduct,and ordered the company to pay defendant electric company million in sanctions or have its case dismissed.ibid.the accounting firm never participated in the federal court proceedings.id.at,d.mattco later sued the firm,alleging professional malpractice and other torts.id.at,d.
the mattco court reversed a grant of summary judgment,finding that the litigation privilege did not bar the lawsuit against the accounting firm.mattco,supra,th at,d.the court concluded that although the privilege bars suits against the expert witness of a party opponent,and against an expert jointly retained by the parties,it does not protect one own expert witnesses.id.at,d.the court explained,in such a situation,policy considerations that would usually favor the privilege here argue against applying it.distinguishing cases holding the privilege applies to jointly retained experts,the court stated,freedom of access to the courts and encouragement of witnesses to testify truthfully will be harmed if neutral experts must fear retaliatory lawsuits from litigants whose disagreement with an expert opinions perforce convinces them the expert must have been negligent in forming such opinion.gootee lightner,supra,d at.id.at,d,italics added.in both mattco and the present case,the expert witness being sued was not a neutral expert,but rather was retained by the party suing him.the mattco court concluded that none of the cases that have applied the litigation privilege to jointly retained experts provides a precedent for applying the statutory privilege to protect a friendly expert witness.id.at,d.
the mattco court discussed at length one case which did apply the litigation privilege to a friendly expert,the washington state supreme court decision in bruce associates eng,bruce.after noting that bruce is not controlling precedent in california and that it relied on the common law immunity of parties and witnesses not on a statute,as in california,the mattco court emphasized that the suit in bruce followed the expert trial testimony,while the suit in mattco never proceeded to trial.if an expert witness negligence and breach of contract cause dismissal of the party who hired that expert witness,that does not expand freedom of access to the courts.applying the privilege in this circumstance does not encourage witnesses to testify truthfully indeed,by shielding a negligent expert witness from liability,it has the opposite effect.applying the privilege where the underlying suit never reached the trial stage would also mean that the party hiring the expert witness would have to bear the penalty for the expert witness negligence.that result would scarcely encourage the future presentation of truthful testimony by that witness to the trier of fact.mattco,supra,th at,d.
the mattco court further noted that the policy of placing upon litigants the burden of exposing during trial the bias of witnesses and the falsity of evidence,thereby enhancing the finality of judgments and avoiding an unending roundelay of litigation did not logically apply in a pretrial dispute between a party and its own expert witness that arose during discovery.mattco,supra,th at,d.in the present case,appellants complaint primarily focused on dailey testimony at the appraisal proceeding at issue.appellants alleged that they hired dailey to define,describe and estimate the replacement cost of their home,and that dailey was negligent in failing to correct the umpire fundamental misunderstanding of the term replacement cost.italics omitted.
appellants argue that mattco was not limited in its application to those cases where the expert does not testify,and that it held generally that the policies underlying the litigation privilege never apply where a party sues his own expert.subsequent california appellate cases have cited mattco with approval,without necessarily limiting its application to cases where the expert does not testify.kolar donahue,mcintosh hammerton th,d mattco,supra,th,d,considered whether the litigation privilege protected an expert witness who was sued for malpractice by his client based on the expert testimony at trial and held that the privilege did not apply key purpose of promoting freedom of access to courts and encouraging truthful testimony without fear of retaliatory lawsuits not furthered by shielding expert from malpractice suit by own client wentland wass th,d mattco found policies underlying litigation privilege not furthered in suit in contract and tort against expert hired to assist hiring party encouraging expert to testify truthfully advanced only by shielding neutral or adverse experts from liability ramalingam thompson,supra,th at,d where a party brought an accounting malpractice action against its own allegedly negligent experts,it was held that the litigation privilege did not apply t he litigation privilege does not exist to protect one own expert witness,but to protect adverse witnesses from suit by opposing parties,citing mattco,supra,th at,d.
additionally,as appellant notes,the majority of cases addressing the issue of the applicability of the litigation privilege to a party own witness have reached a similar conclusion.pollock panjabi,policy upon which witness immunity in connecticut witnesses speak implicated in suit against party own expert horvitz associates,wl.lexis doctrine of witness immunity does not bar claim for negligence against expert retained to provide litigation support services by retaining party llmd of michigan,doctrine of witness immunity does not bar professional malpractice action by party who hired expert murphy mathews witness immunity not applicable to litigation support services court declines to reach applicability to actual testimony of expert levine wiss,accountants not immune from suit marrogi howard so d expert who provided pretrial analysis and litigation support services not immune from suit merely because he or she provides testimony james brown negligent diagnoses may be actionable despite reports to probate judge being privileged.two cases have,however,reached a contrary conclusion.bruce,supra,expert witness who testified for party immune from suit by that party panitz behrend,expert medical witnesses have absolute immunity for testimony given,even if adverse to party hiring them.although policy arguments may be made on both sides,we believe that the majority view is the better reasoned approach to this issue.
as the court in,supra,wl super.lexis explained,in bruce assocs.eng,citation a plurality of the washington supreme court held that witness immunity barred a malpractice suit by plaintiffs against an expert they had retained to calculate the costs of corrective work the plurality in bruce focused on the chilling effect that the threat of subsequent litigation would have on the expert testimony a loss of objectivity would result because experts would be encouraged to assert the most extreme position favorable to the party for whom they testify.citation.moreover,imposition of civil liability on expert witnesses would discourage anyone who is not a professional expert witness from testifying because only professional witnesses will be in a position to carry insurance covering such liability.ibid.the court was not persuaded by the first argument,and although the second caused it greater concern,it ultimately disagreed with the bruce,supra,conclusion,stating,like other courts which have considered the issue,i do not agree with the reasoning of the plurality in bruce that the prospect of civil liability will discourage frank and objective testimony by experts.first,it ignores the reality that,by definition,expert witnesses retained by a party are not objective witnesses moreover,the existence of liability will encourage experts to be more careful and thorough resulting in more accurate,reliable testimony the second factor relied on by the plurality in bruce is more troublesome although this issue could presumably be addressed by contract,the prospect of liability may well hamper the ability of the parties to secure the litigation services of an expert who does not derive a significant portion of his income from providing such services.ibid.the court balanced this concern against the fact that witness immunity is an exception to the general rules of liability and against the fact that the negligent expert would enjoy immunity at the expense of the right of the party who
