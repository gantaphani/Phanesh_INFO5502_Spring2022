background 
schilli is the parent corporation of three subsidiaries.one of those subsidiaries,truck transport,is a motor carrier providing regulated,transportation services.in,it operated out of a terminal in batesville,arkansas,where its employees were represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters local union local.truck transport and local had negotiated a series of consecutive collective bargaining agreements cbas that obligated truck transport to contribute specified amounts to central states pension fund on behalf of all employees in the batesville bargaining unit.the most recent of those cbas extended from july,through january.
in addition to the cbas,on may,truck transport and local signed a separate document entitled participation agreement.the participation agreement obligates truck transport to contribute to central states a set amount per week for its bargaining unit employees pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.the parties to the document agree to be bound by all of the terms of the trust agreement s creating central states.it provides,moreover 
this agreement shall continue in full force and effect until such time as the employer notifies the fund s by certified mail with a copy to the local union that the employer is no longer under a legal duty to make contributions to the fund s.the employer shall set forth in the required written notice to the fund s the specific basis upon which the employer is relying in terminating his obligation to make contributions to the fund s.the employer expressly agrees and hereby acknowledges by the signing of this agreement that its obligation to make contributions to the fund s shall continue until the written notice is received by the fund s and the trustees acknowledge the employer termination in writing.
central states bills participating employers on a monthly basis for their contributions to the pension fund.it requires that employers sign a form with the following language when they submit their monthly contributions 
the employer hereby reaffirms his obligation to make contributions required by the collective bargaining agreement and further represents that all employees eligible to participate in the fund,in accordance with the rules of the fund and the employee retirement income security act of,are being reported and only those eligible employees are being reported.
truck transport signed and submitted these monthly certification clauses along with each payment it made to central states.
in november,employees at the batesville terminal filed a petition with the national labor relations board nlrb under c a ii,asserting that local no longer represented a majority of the workers in the batesville bargaining unit.the nlrb then held an election,and a majority of the employees voted to decertify the union as their representative.on november,the nlrb confirmed the election results and announced that local no longer served as the exclusive bargaining representative of the batesville employees.
following the election,truck transport conducted business as usual.many of its employees kept their same jobs fulfilling their same duties.in december and january,truck transport submitted its monthly contributions accompanied by signed certification clauses on behalf of its employees.at no time during did truck transport notify central states of the decertification or contend that it had been relieved of its duty to contribute to the fund.
in january,truck transport lost its largest customer to a competitor.the substantial drop in business forced truck transport to close the batesville terminal on january.it ceased contributing to central states on that date.although central states was aware of the terminal closing soon thereafter,it did not learn of local decertification until march.
the mppaa requires that,upon an employer withdrawal from a multiemployer plan,the plan determine the amount of withdrawal liability due under a statutory formula,notify the employer of the amount of liability,and collect that amount from the employer.after some initial confusion about the timing of the events in question,central states judged that truck transport had withdrawn from the fund in.it determined that schilli other two subsidiaries,which also had been contributing to the fund,withdrew in.because all businesses under common control are treated as a single entity when assessing withdrawal liability,see b,central states concluded that schilli had partially withdrawn in and completely withdrawn in.it demanded payment accordingly.b b.
although schilli contested central states assessment,it paid the demanded sum.see c requiring prompt payment to the plan notwithstanding any request for review or appeal.after the parties failed to resolve their disagreement informally,they submitted the dispute to arbitration as required by the act.see a.in determining the timing of truck transport withdrawal,the arbitrator noted that,for present purposes,an employer withdraws from a plan only when it ceases to have an obligation to contribute.the arbitrator found that the participation agreement bound truck transport to contribute to the fund until it complied with the agreement notice provision,and that truck transport had not given the prescribed notice in.thus,it held that truck transport had not withdrawn in and that schilli could not be assessed partial withdrawal liability for that year.accordingly,the arbitrator ordered central states to refund schilli the amount it had paid for allegedly withdrawing in.
central states then filed this action in the northern district of illinois to vacate the arbitrator award.see b.on for summary judgment,the district court held that schilli had not partially withdrawn in and affirmed the arbitrator award.central states appeals.
ii.discussion 
because this case turns on a question of law,the district court properly reviewed the arbitrator conclusions de novo.see central states,areas pension fund midwest motor express,cir.we,in turn,review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.id.at.summary judgment is appropriate only if our resolution of the legal issue shows that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c apfel,cir.
multiemployer plans are plans,meaning that they must pay beneficiaries a set level of benefits even if the contributions they expected to receive do not materialize.central states,areas pension fund gerber truck,cir en banc.accordingly,when an employer withdraws from a multiemployer plan and stops contributing,there is a risk that the burden of funding its employees benefits will be shifted to the other employers in the plan or to the pension benefit guaranty corporation,which ensures these benefits.central states,areas pension fund slotky,cir.the mppaa guards against this risk by imposing withdrawal liability on employers who pull out of multiemployer plans.a.the statute sets this liability at an amount equal to a proportionate share of the withdrawing employer unfunded vested benefits.connolly pension benefit guar,d.liability is imposed both for partial and complete withdrawals from a plan.a.
the parties agree that in,two of schilli subsidiaries that previously had been contributing to central states withdrew from the plan.the principal issue in this appeal is whether its third subsidiary,truck transport,withdrew in or.if truck transport withdrew in,then schilli may be assessed withdrawal liability for that year only,when all of its subsidiaries withdrew.if,however,truck transport withdrew in,schilli may be assessed liability for a partial withdrawal in in addition to its complete withdrawal in.see b treating all businesses under common control as a single entity.
subject to exceptions not relevant here,an employer partially withdraws in a given year if for such plan year there is a partial cessation of the employer contribution obligation.a.
there is a partial cessation of the employer contribution obligation for the plan year if,during such year the employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under one or more but fewer than all collective bargaining agreements under which the employer has been obligated to contribute under the plan but continues to perform work in the jurisdiction of the collective bargaining agreement of the type for which contributions were previously required 
b a i.thus,to assess schilli for a partial withdrawal in,central states must show that truck transport i ceased having an obligation to contribute to the fund in and ii continued to perform work at the batesville terminal after its contribution obligation ended.schilli admits that truck transport continue d to perform work in the jurisdiction of the collective bargaining agreement through.the only dispute,therefore,is whether truck transport obligation to contribute ceased in.
central states contends that the decertification of the union in automatically extinguished truck transport obligation to contribute.schilli agrees that decertification terminated truck transport obligations under the cba.it argues,however,that truck transport remained bound to contribute to the fund under the participation agreement until it complied with that document notice provision.because it did not give the prescribed notice in,schilli asserts that truck transport remained obligated to contribute until 
central states rejoins that even if the decertification did not void the participation agreement by operation of law,the terms of that document condition truck transport obligation to contribute upon local status as the exclusive bargaining representative of the batesville employees.central states also argues that it waived its contractual right to receive the prescribed notice,thereby releasing truck transport from its obligations and triggering a partial withdrawal in.finally,it asserts that the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing precludes truck transport from relying on its failure to give notice to avoid withdrawal liability.we address these arguments in turn.
decertification 
central states argues that the decertification of local terminated truck transport obligation to contribute under both the cba and the participation agreement by operation of law.because the nlrb confirmed the results of the election on november,central states contends that truck transport withdrew from the plan that year.schilli suggests,without stating explicitly,that central states is judicially estopped from making this argument because it took the opposite position in a prior case.schilli brief neither uses the term judicial estoppel nor cites any authority on that doctrine.a litigant who fails to press a point by supporting it with pertinent authority,or by showing why it is sound despite a lack of supporting authority,forfeits the point.smith northeastern,cir quoting tyler runyon,cir.accordingly,schilli has forfeited any claim of judicial estoppel.
turning to the merits,schilli contends that although the decertification voided the cba,the terms of the participation agreement make clear that truck transport obligations survive that event.schilli highlights the language of the notice clause,which provides that the agreement shall continue in full force and effect until such time as truck transport notifies central states that it is no longer under a legal duty to make contributions to the fund s.that clause emphasizes that truck transport obligation to make contributions to the fund s shall continue until the written notice is received and acknowledged by central states.because truck transport did not give this notice in,schilli argues that its subsidiary remained obligated to contribute until despite the decertification of the union.
we analyze truck transport obligation to contribute by considering who might enforce the participation agreement.at the outset,we conclude that decertification terminated the union right to enforce the agreement.local negotiated the participation agreement on behalf of all of the members of the batesville collective bargaining members of the union or not.the union enjoyed the authority to act as the exclusive representative of the bargaining unit,speaking for its supporters and detractors alike,only because federal law vested it with that power.see a brooks nlrb.but federal law grant of that authority is conditioned upon local being designated or selected by the majority of the employees in the bargaining unit.a.the employees vote to decertify the union and the nlrb confirmation of that election established conclusively that local no longer enjoyed the support of a majority of the employees in the unit.see a,c.accordingly,local authority to represent all bargaining unit employees and to enforce any contractual rights it had negotiated on behalf of those employees as a class dissolved at that point.see pioneer natural res.usa,paper,allied,chem.energy workers int l union local,cir local union,int of workers stokes,cir sheet metal workers int l ass n,local coast sheet metal,cir peter lareau,labor employment law b ii.retail clerks int l ass montgomery ward,cir.because local negotiated the participation agreement in its capacity as the exclusive bargaining representative of all employees in the batesville unit,its right to enforce that agreement ended at decertification.
this is true despite truck transport failure to comply with the notice clause of the participation agreement.decertification terminates a union rights by operation of law without regard to the language of the contract.just as decertification nullified the cba before it would have expired by its terms,the participation agreement dissolved despite language purporting to continue it in full force and effect until the described notice was given.
the union is not the only party with standing to enforce that agreement,however.the mppaa authorizes multiemployer plans to sue for delinquent contributions owed under the terms of the plan or under the terms of a collectively bargained agreement.see also d.moreover,gives a multiemployer plan greater rights under these documents than the union itself,entitling a plan to enforce the writing without regard to understandings or defenses applicable to the original parties.central states,areas pension fund gerber truck,cir en banc.thus,many of the defenses that truck transport might raise in an action brought by local would not be viable in an action brought by central states.
schilli argues that if truck transport would have been liable in a action for contributions through,it remained obligated to contribute for withdrawal liability purposes until then.we assume without deciding that this is true on this assumption,the question becomes whether decertification is a defense in a action.if so,central states could not have prevailed against truck transport for contributions after the union decertification,and truck transport ceased having an obligation to contribute for withdrawal liability purposes at that point.
central states urges us to recognize decertification as a defense to liability.we conclude,however,that our precedents foreclose this course.in gerber truck,we ruled that the lack of majority support for the union and the consequent ineffectiveness of a contract under labor law is not a valid defense in a action.at en banc.we took a similarly narrow view of the available defenses in moriarty svec,cir.in that case,a pension f
