in these three consolidated appeals,plaintiff shanel stasz seeks to avoid the effect of an arbitration provision contained in a settlement agreement to which she and defendant hugo quackenbush are parties.we reject all of stasz contentions and affirm.
disagreements arose between stasz and quackenbush that were settled by way of a written agreement negotiated by their respective counsel.the agreement mandated the arbitration of all subsequent disputes before the american arbitration association aaa.disputes later arose.instead of initiating arbitration,stasz filed a civil action against quackenbush.he successfully moved to compel arbitration of the matter before the aaa.he also filed his own claim against stasz in the arbitration.the arbitrator found in quackenbush favor on all claims.the trial court confirmed the arbitration award and entered judgment accordingly.stasz appeals.in the nonpublished portion of this opinion,we affirm the judgment because stasz has not shown that the arbitration award should be vacated on any statutory grounds.see code civ,subd.a.
stasz filed a separate civil action against,among others,quackenbush attorneys,alleging wrongdoing on their part in negotiating and drafting the settlement agreement and in pursuing quackenbush claim against her in the arbitration.relying on a similar theory,stasz named quackenbush employer,the charles schwab corporation the schwab firm,as a defendant.the attorneys and the schwab firm moved to strike the complaint as a strategic lawsuit against public participation slapp code civ.the trial court granted the motion and entered an order striking the complaint.stasz appeals.in the nonpublished portion of this opinion,we affirm the order because stasz sought to impose liability based on conduct protected by the statute,and she did not make a sufficient showing that she would prevail at trial.
in the same action,stasz also sued the aaa,alleging that it had been biased against her and should have stayed the arbitration proceedings pending the outcome of her appeal in a case in which she challenged the arbitration provision.the aaa demurred to the complaint on the ground that,under california common law,it was immune from liability.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and ordered the case dismissed.stasz appeals.in the published portion of this opinion,we,too,conclude that the aaa is immune from liability and affirm.
background 
quackenbush is an employee of the schwab firm,a securities broker.he is a longtime friend of the firm founder,charles schwab 
from to,stasz and quackenbush had an intimate relationship.it came to a bitter end.in,he filed an action in san francisco county superior court and obtained a temporary restraining order against her quackenbush stasz super.city and county,no.fl.she threatened to file a countersuit and embarrass quackenbush by making public statements about him,charles schwab,and the schwab firm.stasz claimed to have found embarrassing information while going through quackenbush personal papers and effects.she intended to disclose that information generally to the public and also in connection with the pending and contemplated litigation.
quackenbush and stasz decided to settle their disputes.quackenbush was represented by counsel in negotiating a written settlement agreement.stasz,who has a law degree,was also represented by counsel of her choosing.several drafts of the agreement were exchanged.effective may,stasz and quackenbush entered into a confidential settlement agreement and general release settlement agreement or agreement.
the settlement agreement obligated both parties to keep confidential the existence and terms of the agreement and the nature of their disputes.stasz agreed to make no statement to any third person about quackenbush,charles schwab,the schwab firm,or the firm officers or directors,except that she could refer to the schwab firm in nondisparaging terms.similarly,quackenbush agreed to make no statement to any third person about stasz.both parties were allowed to state to others that they had been in a relationship together,had disagreements,and parted ways.neither party was to contact or communicate directly with the other in any way,including by telephone,in person,or in writing.the parties were allowed to contact one another through counsel.within three days after the execution and delivery of the agreement,each party was to return to the other party all originals and copies of the other party personal papers.
under the agreement,quackenbush was to pay stasz,secured by a deed of trust on an apartment building he owned.an initial payment of million was due when stasz vacated an apartment in that building.additional payments of were to be made on the first,second,and third anniversaries of the agreement effective date,provided stasz complied with all of the provisions of the agreement.
the agreement contained an arbitration provision,stating any and all disputes of any kind between the parties,including but not limited to ones arising out of or related to interpretation or enforcement of any provision of this agreement,shall be resolved by confidential binding arbitration before the aaa large,complex commercial dispute panel in san francisco,california before a single neutral arbitrator under the aaa large,complex commercial dispute rules and rules for emergency measures of protection and california law.all aspects of the arbitration including but not limited to,discovery if any and hearing procedures shall be kept strictly confidential and sealed.the arbitrator shall have the power to award provisional,ancillary,temporary,preliminary and permanent equitable remedies,including but not limited to injunctive relief but either party may at its option without waiving its right to arbitration hereunder seek injunctive relief from a court with jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter.the arbitrator award or awards shall be final and binding,and judgment on any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter all pleadings and other documents in any court proceedings between the parties shall be filed to the extent legally permitted under seal.
stasz moved out of the apartment,and quackenbush paid her million.in the months that followed,stasz contacted quackenbush directly by telephone on several occasions.during some of the calls,stasz said that,unless quackenbush gave her more money,she would make statements to third parties that would embarrass him,his colleagues,and the schwab firm.she also sent letters to the schwab firm,discussing quackenbush and the settlement agreement.
on july,quackenbush initiated arbitration proceedings against stasz,filing a claim with the aaa and alleging violations of the noncontact and confidentiality provisions of the settlement agreement.stasz refused to pay her share of the aaa filing fee,so quackenbush paid it on her behalf.stasz filed a counterclaim in the arbitration,seeking specific enforcement of the agreement.
shortly after commencing arbitration,quackenbush filed an application with the aaa,seeking an interim restraining order against stasz to stop her from committing further violations of the settlement agreement.the aaa appointed a retired superior court judge to serve as arbitrator and hear the application.while the application was pending,stasz sent quackenbush counsel a letter in which she threatened to file suit unless she was paid million.a copy of a draft complaint was attached to the letter.
stasz stipulated to the entry of an interim restraining order,which was issued on november.over stasz objection,the arbitrator made findings in issuing the order,concluding that the claims asserted in stasz draft complaint had to be resolved through arbitration,not in court,and that some of the allegations,if made public,would violate the confidentiality provisions of the settlement agreement.the order directed stasz to comply with the noncontact and confidentiality terms of the agreement.
on or about november,stasz filed an action in los angeles county superior court stasz quackenbush,no.stasz i,challenging the validity of the arbitration provision in the settlement agreement.she brought a motion to excise the arbitration provision,asserting that it was unconscionable.by order dated january,the superior court,judge ronald cappai presiding,denied the motion,finding that the arbitration clause in the parties agreement was not unconscionable,and was fully enforceable.stasz appealed.we affirmed the order in a nonpublished opinion stasz quackenbush,wl.
on june,stasz filed a second action against quackenbush stasz quackenbush,no.stasz ii,alleging causes of action for invasion of privacy,breach of fiduciary duty,intentional infliction of emotional distress,fraud,and deceit.stasz also sought injunctive relief.the complaint alleged that quackenbush had contacted stasz directly,asking her to modify the settlement agreement in certain respects,and that,when she refused,he threatened to embarrass her by publicly disclosing private information about her.the complaint was based on the same claims that had appeared in stasz draft that,under the arbitrator interim restraining order,were to be pursued through arbitration,not in court.
on august,quackenbush filed a motion to compel arbitration in stasz ii,relying on the arbitration provision in the settlement agreement.stasz filed opposition papers.by order dated october,the trial court,judge marvin lager presiding,granted the motion and stayed the action pending the outcome of arbitration.
in december,stasz filed an ex parte application in the trial court,seeking to stay the arbitration proceedings until the resolution of her appeal in stasz i,which challenged the validity of the arbitration provision.the trial court denied the application.in june,stasz sought another stay on the same basis,failing again.stasz also sought a stay from the arbitrator,who denied it.
on december,stasz sent a letter to the schwab firm containing statements about quackenbush,the settlement agreement,the parties disputes,and the pending arbitration.some of the statements about quackenbush were inaccurate and disparaging.
on january,stasz filed a third lawsuit stasz schwab,no.stasz iii,alleging causes of action against,among others,quackenbush attorneys,charles schwab,the schwab firm,and the aaa.in the first cause of action,stasz alleged that quackenbush attorneys had committed fraud by using vague and ambiguous terms in negotiating and drafting the settlement agreement and,with the exception of one attorney,by pursuing an arbitration claim against her.in a cause of action denominated tortious interference,stasz alleged that quackenbush attorneys had interfered with her rights under the settlement agreement by filing vexatious litigation against her.in a cause of action for conspiracy to commit fraud,she asserted that all defendants had engaged in various wrongful acts in connection with the drafting of the settlement agreement and the handling of the arbitration proceedings.for example,she alleged that the aaa was biased against her and should have stayed the arbitration proceedings while she pursued an appeal in stasz in the final cause of action,for intentional infliction of emotional distress,the complaint alleged that defendants had engaged in outrageous conduct in causing quackenbush to breach the settlement agreement.
on february,in stasz iii,all of the defendants with the exception of the aaa filed a special motion to strike the complaint under the statute code civ,arguing that the complaint was based on act s in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue,subd.b and that stasz had not established that there was a probability that she will prevail on the claim ibid.all further statutory references are to the code of civil procedure unless otherwise indicated.
stasz filed opposition papers to the motion and submitted evidence to support the allegations of the complaint.defendants filed general and specific objections to the evidence.by order dated march,the trial court,judge victor person presiding,sustained all of defendants specific objections and granted the motion.the trial court later awarded defendants in attorneys fees.see,subd.c.stasz appeals.
on june,the aaa demurred to the complaint in stasz iii,contending that,as the organization sponsoring the arbitration,it is immune from liability under california common law.stasz filed opposition papers.by order dated august,the trial court,judge lager presiding,sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the case.stasz appeals.
meanwhile,quackenbush arbitration claim against stasz and her counterclaim against him,which were filed directly with the aaa,and her claims against him in stasz ii,which the trial court ordered to arbitration,came before the arbitrator for hearing by way of quackenbush motion for judgment on all claims and counterclaims.although stasz had actively participated in the early months of the arbitration proceedings,she chose not to attend the hearing on quackenbush motion,notwithstanding proper notice.nor did she submit any evidence.in stasz absence,the arbitrator required quackenbush to present evidence in support of his claim.
on july,the arbitrator issued a final award,finding in quackenbush favor on all claims.as recited in the award,stasz breached the settlement agreement by directly contacting quackenbush and threatening to make embarrassing statements about him to third parties filing suit against quackenbush stasz ii instead of pursuing her claims through arbitration making allegations in the stasz ii complaint that violated the confidentiality provisions of the agreement and that were unnecessary to plead her causes of action sending a letter to the schwab firm on december,that contained inaccurate and disparaging assertions about quackenbush and filing another suit related to the agreement stasz iii in which she made unnecessary,disparaging remarks about quackenbush,the schwab firm,and some of the firm officers.
the award further stated quackenbush has been embarrassed before his colleagues at work,one of whom,charles schwab,is a lifelong personal friend h e has suffered personal humiliation,emotional anguish and anxiety in his personal and professional life quackenbush has also suffered further injury in the form of a substantial diminution of the value of the settlement agreement to him.the agreement expressly provides that stasz acknowledges and agrees that if she fails to satisfy strictly any one or more of her noncontact and confidentiality obligations this agreement loses much or all of its value to quackenbush and that any failure strictly and continuously to comply with those obligations shall,without further notice or demand,also constitute and be treated as a material breach of this agreement,entitling quackenbush to any remedies that may be available at law or in equity,including damages and injunctive relief 
the arbitrator granted various forms of declaratory and injunctive relief,including the declaration that quackenbush was excused from making further payments under the agreement and an injunction enforcing the agreement noncontact and confidentiality provisions against stasz.the arbitrator awarded quackenbush approximately million in damages and costs.
quackenbush and stasz then returned to the trial court stasz ii,which had ordered the arbitration of stasz claims.quackenbush moved to confirm the arbitration award,and stasz moved to vacate it.on september,the trial court,judge lager presiding,confirmed the award in its entirety and entered judgment accordingly.stasz appeals.
by order dated january,we ordered the consolidation of all three appeals for purposes of briefing,oral argument,and decision.
discussion 
we examine the trial court rulings in the order in which they were made granting the motion and dismissing stasz civil action as to quackenbush attorneys and the schwab defendants sustaining the demurrer of the aaa without leave to amend and confirming the arbitration award in quackenbush favor.
a.the motion 
b.the aaa demurrer 
in stasz iii,the aaa demurrer was based on the doctrine of arbitral immunity as established under california common law.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.we conclude that the aaa enjoys common law immunity because,just as an arbitrator is immune from liability for bias or the failure to stay arbitration proceedings,so is the organization that sponsors the arbitration.
stasz contends that arbitral immunity does not apply because the aaa was biased against her.in support of that contention,she states the aaa accepted a payment from quackenbush to cover her portion of the aaa filing fee after she refused to pay it the arbitrator was familiar with an attorney at the law firm representing quackenbush see fn,ante and the aaa sold memberships to law firms,including the firm representing quackenbush 
stasz also argues against immunity on the theory that the aaa should not have gone forward with the arbitration proceedings while her appeal in stasz challenged the validity of the arbitration pending in this court.as stasz sees it,the arbitration was automatically stayed during the appeal.see,subd.a in general,perfecting of appeal stays proceedings in trial court with respect to order or judgment from which appeal is taken.
common law immunity for arbitrators 
as our supreme court has stated arbitrators are judges chosen by the parties to decide the matters submitted to them arbitrators have been extended the protection of judicial immunity,because they perform the function of resolving disputes between parties,or of authoritatively adjudicating private rights.in re marriage of assemi cal th,d,citation omitted.it long has been recognized that,in private arbitration proceedings,an arbitrator enjoys the benefit of an arbitral privilege of immunity because the role that he or she exercises is analogous to that of a judge there is hardly any aspect of arbitration law and practice more settled,both in domestic and international relations,than the immunity of arbitrators from court actions for their activities in arriving at their award.this arbitrators in private contractual arbitration proceedings from tort well established in california.moore conliffe cal th,d,citations omitted.
dating back to,division three of this district stated courts of this country have long recognized immunity to protect arbitrators from civil liability for actions taken in the arbitrator capacity arbitral immunity,like judicial immunity,promotes fearless and independent decision making to this end,the courts have refused to hold judges and arbitrators liable for their judicial actions if the arbitrators decisions can thereafter be questioned in suits brought against them by either party,there is a real possibility that their decisions will be governed more by the fear of such suits than by their own unfettered judgment as to the merits of the matter they must decide.baar tigerman d,citations and italics omitted accord,coopers lybrand superior court d.
a decade later,division seven of this district observed arbitration has evolved into a favored method for the resolution of disputes the california legislature has found arbitration to be an efficient method of relieving the burden on the congested court system california courts have similarly viewed arbitration with favor 
this strong policy has created the need for independent judgments which are free from fear of legal action arbitral immunity furthers this need t he independence necessary for principled and fearless is best achieved by shielding persons involved in the arbitral process from intimidation caused by the fear of a lawsuit arising out of the exercise of arbitral functions 
the existence of arbitral immunity is also in part due to the resemblance of arbitration proceedings to judicial proceedings a lthough arbitration is a proceeding different from a court proceeding and the functions performed by the arbitrator are somewhat different from those of the judge,arbitration is as much an adjudicatory process as the judicial process.this comparability in functions creates a similar necessity for independence in decisionmaking thus,it is reasonable to use arbitral immunity just as judicial immunity does in the judicial arena,to protect the decisionmaking process from reprisals by dissatisfied litigants.thiele rml realty partners th,d thiele,citations omitted.
the application of arbitral immunity does not turn on whether the act at issue is discretionary instead of ministerial or administrative s emantically categorizing the challenged act as ministerial or administrative,as opposed to discretionary,in large part misses the mark,since the scope of arbitral immunity is defined by the functions it protects and serves.thiele,supra,th at,d,italics in original.arbitral immunity shields all functions which are integrally related to the arbitral process.a rbitrators are exempt from civil liability for failure to exercise care or skill in the performance of their arbitral functions,citations and italics omitted.
federal cases are in agreement.the functional comparability of the arbitrators process and judgments to those of judges generates the same need for independent judgment,free from the threat of lawsuits.immunity furthers this need.as with judicial and immunity,arbitral immunity is essential to protect the from undue influence the extension of immunity to arbitrators where arbitration is pursuant to a private agreement between the parties is especially compelling because arbitration is the means selected by the parties themselves for disposing of controversies between them.by immunizing arbitrators and their decisions from collateral attacks,arbitration as the contractual choice of the parties is respected yet the arbitrators are protected.arbitrators have no interest in the outcome of the dispute and should not be compelled to become parties to that dispute i ndividuals can not be expected to serve as arbitrators if they can be caught up in the struggle between the litigants and saddled with the burdens of defending a lawsuit.corey new york stock exchange cir,citations omitted accord,austern chicago bd.options exchange,cir,wasyl,first boston cir.

common law immunity for organizations sponsoring arbitrations 
california courts have extended arbitral immunity to organizations that sponsor arbitrations,like the aaa.as we stated in american arbitration superior court th,d a refusal to extend immunity to the sponsoring organization would make the arbitrator immunity illusory.stated otherwise,it would shift liability rather than extinguish it as a practical matter,a grant of immunity to the arbitrator must be accompanied by a grant of the same immunity to the aaa,an entity as indispensable to the arbitrator job of arbitrating as are the courts to the judge job of judging.id.at,d,citations omitted.extension of arbitral immunity to encompass boards which sponsor arbitration is a natural and necessary product of the policies underlying arbitral immunity olney sacramento county bar d.c ourts have on the whole extended arbitral immunity to sponsoring organizations.thiele,supra,th at,d.
federal courts have reached the same conclusion.as the sixth circuit court of appeals stated our decision to extend immunity to the boards which sponsor arbitration finds support in the case law,the policies behind the doctrines of judicial and immunity and policies unique to contractually agreed upon arbitration proceedings.corey new york stock exchange,supra,at.according to the first circuit,i n proper circumstances,organizations that sponsor arbitrations,as well as arbitrators themselves,enjoy immunity from civil liability.new england cleaning american arbitration ass n,supra,at.and another federal court has commented a rbitral immunity is not limited to the individual arbitrators.it has been uniformly accepted that such immunity extends to arbitration associations such as the aaa as well.cort american arbitration ass n,supra.at see city of hayward cir,arbitral immunity afforded sponsoring organizations does not apply to municipality that,by ordinance,requires property owners to arbitrate rent control issues before arbitrators chosen by municipality.
under federal law,a sponsoring organization is immune from liability in situations where the arbitrator is or would be immune and also where the organization has engaged in tasks such as selecting an arbitrator,scheduling a hearing,giving notice of a hearing,and billing for services.see corey new york stock exchange,supra,at new england cleaning american arbitration ass n,supra,at.this is so even if the sponsoring organization has violated its own internal rules.see olson national ass of security dealers,supra,at.
california statutory law 
in california,state law on the subject of arbitral immunity was governed,at least in part,by statute from to.enacted in and effective january,section read an arbitrator has the immunity of a judicial officer from civil liability when acting in the capacity of arbitrator under any statute or contract.stats,ch.by its own terms,section was to remain in effect only until january,and as of that date is repealed,unless a later enacted statute,which is enacted before january,deletes or extends that date.ibid.
in,the legislature amended section by adding an additional paragraph,as follows the immunity afforded by this section shall supplement,and not supplant,any otherwise applicable common law or statutory immunity.stats,ch.at the same time,the legislature extended section date of repeal to january.ibid.in,the legislature extended the life of the statute for another year,to january.stats,ch.no further extensions were approved.section was therefore repealed by operation of law on january,than three years before the arbitration began 
to understand the effect of section on this case,we look to the purpose of the statute.see pacific gas electric county of stanislaus cal th,d,trafficschoolonline,clarke th,d.section was enacted to overrule the decision in baar,supra,d baar,where the court held that an arbitrator and a sponsoring organization the aaa were not entitled to the same immunity as a judge and could be found liable for breach of contract where the arbitrator failed to make a timely award.in baar wake,the legislature enacted section to expand arbitral immunity to conform to judicial immunity.see moore conliffe,supra,cal th at,d,american arbitration superior court,supra,th at,d coopers lybrand superior court,supra,d at.
in baar,the parties agreement mandated that they arbitrate disputes pursuant to the rules of the aaa,which required that an arbitration award be made no later than days after the close of the hearings unless otherwise agreed by the parties or specified by law.see baar,supra,d at.fns.an arbitration was demanded and a hearing conducted.the aaa requested and received an extension of three and months within which to issue the award.but the arbitrator never issued one.seven months after the case was submitted,the arbitrator lost jurisdiction over the matter.baar,supra,d at.fn.
the parties to the arbitration filed a civil action against the arbitrator and the aaa,alleging breach of contract and other causes of action.the trial court dismissed the action on demurrer,concluding that arbitral immunity barred the suit.the court of appeal reversed,explaining cases in which courts have clothed arbitrators with immunity have involved disgruntled litigants who sought to hold an arbitrator liable for alleged misconduct in arriving at a decision.by contrast,the present case involves the arbitrator failure to make an award without any allegation of misconduct defendants contention that this court should extend immunity to an arbitrator who never renders an award fails to appreciate the nature of the relationship and misperceives the policy underlying arbitral immunity.baar,supra,d at,italics in original.
the baar court noted that arbitrations and judicial proceedings differ in many respects,giving as examples a judge receives power from the constitution an independent judiciary is essential to the preservation of democracy trials are public in nature judges must follow the law arbitration decisions carry little,if any,precedential value and arbitrations determine only the rights and obligations of the parties to the arbitration and do not decide any questions not presented by the parties submission.baar,supra,d at.
based on this analysis,the court concluded that,while a judge is immune from liability for failing to render a decision see baar,supra,d at,discussing wyatt arnot,an arbitrator should not be immune for failing to issue an award see id.at.as the court put it,arbitration is contractual in nature and the breach of an arbitration contract will result in a cause of action to the damaged party.id.at.indeed,the court went so far as to suggest that corruption on the part of an arbitrator might give rise to liability for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing inherent in the contract between the arbitrator and the parties.ibid.according to the court,w hile we must protect an arbitrator acting in a capacity,we must also uphold the contractual obligations of an arbitrator to the parties involved,italics omitted.
finally,the court in baar reasoned that,because the arbitrator was not immune from suit,the aaa did not derive any immunity from him.baar,supra,d at.in addition,the court stated that the liability of the aaa was justifiable because it was based on the association improper administration of the arbitration proceedings,as opposed to the aaa performance of a discretionary act or its involvement in the process,for example,in deciding whether the arbitrator had a conflict of interest or should be disqualified.id.at.
against this backdrop,the legislature enacted section to ensure that arbitrators enjoyed the same immunity as judges and could not be held liable for breach of an arbitration provision.as stated,section was repealed before the arbitration commenced,leaving arbitral immunity to be determined under california common law.see.discussing common law immunity of arbitrators.
contractual liability for breach of an arbitration provision 
here,the arbitration provision required the appointment of a single neutral arbitrator.italics added.stasz contends that,under baar,she can maintain an action against the aaa for allegedly failing to provide an unbiased.see arbitral immunity,supra,indus.rel.at discussing neutral and partisan arbitrators knight et,cal.practice guide alternative dispute resolution the rutter group,the effect of repeal of section on the common law is presently unclear.we conclude that an arbitrator and a sponsoring organization are immune from liability for bias.another remedy exists for that type of wrong.
as reflected in the amendment,section did not purport to affect arbitral immunity under the common law.quite the opposite,the statute expressly stated that it was intended to supplement,not supplant,common law rules.and the common law is not static.flournoy state d.see otsuka hite cal d,fn.thus,section did not preclude changes in the common law.the inherent capacity of the common law for growth and change is its most significant feature.its development has been determined by the social needs of the community which it serves.it is constantly expanding and developing rodriguez bethlehem steel cal d.i n the common law system the primary instruments of this evolution are the courts,adjudicating on a regular basis the rich variety of individual cases brought before them.ibid.
as one commentator has explained t he court in baar appeared to say that,unlike a judge,an arbitrator has entered into a contractual relationship with the parties to a dispute.therefore,even though the arbitrator is immune from liability for acts,she nonetheless has contractual duties that may form the basis for a valid cause of action.this reasoning is logically coherent.nevertheless,virtually any claim of misconduct in arriving at a decision can be stated as a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.arbitral immunity could thus be effectively circumvented in most,if not all,cases by labeling the wrong as a contract breach.this is contrary,however,to the court recognition of the importance arbitral immunity plays in protecting the arbitrator fearless and independent decision making.arbitrators need to be protected against vexatious suits brought without merit.note,redefining arbitral immunity a proposed qualified immunity statute for arbitrators hastings,hereafter note,fn.omitted.
according to commentators,baar is best understood to mean that a n arbitrator should not expect to be immune from liability for failure to perform immunity should extend to arbitrators who are merely tardy in issuing an award as well as to those who are otherwise negligent it should not protect the arbitrator who completely fails to do his job.arbitral immunity,supra,indus.rel.at see id.at.under baar,arbitrators may be held liable for complete nonperformance of their contract with the parties.anything short of complete nonperformance would be protected by arbitral immunity.note,supra,hastings at see caudle american arbitration ass cir,aaa might be subject to liability if parties pay arbitration fee,and aaa does not arbitrate their dispute ernst,manhattan const.of texas cir,opn.mod.depending on circumstances,arbitrator may lose immunity where he or she fails to issue an award.
and baar distinction between a sponsoring organization discretionary which immunity its administrative which immunity purportedly does not at odds with subsequent case law.see thiele,supra,th at,d new england cleaning american arbitration ass n,supra,at austern chicago bd.options exchange,supra,at.
the remedy for bias 
in this case,we do not deal with the failure to issue an arbitration award but with an accusation that the arbitrator and the sponsoring organization were biased.in discussing judicial immunity over a century ago,the united states supreme court explained nor can the exemption of the judges from civil liability be affected by the motives with which their judicial acts are performed.the purity of their motives can not be the subject of judicial inquiry 
the truth of this latter observation is manifest to all persons having much experience with judicial proceedings in the superior courts.controversies involving not merely great pecuniary interests,but the liberty and character of the parties,and consequently exciting the deepest feelings,are being constantly determined in those courts,in which there is great conflict in the evidence and great doubt as to the law which should govern their decision.it is this class of cases which impose s upon the judge the severest labor,and often create s in his mind a painful sense of responsibility.yet it is precisely in this class of cases that the losing party feels most keenly the decision against him,and most readily accepts anything but the soundness of the decision in explanation of the action of the judge if civil actions could be maintained in such cases against the judge,because the losing party should see fit to allege in his complaint that the acts of the judge were done with partiality,or maliciously,or corruptly,the protection essential to judicial independence would be entirely swept away.bradley fisher wall.this analysis is of equal importance in the context of arbitrations and arbitral immunity.
as federal courts have held,an arbitrator is immune from liability for partiality,or bias.see intern,united auto.wkrs.greyhound lines,supra,at montero travis,supra,at saavedra city of albuquerque,supra.at.but that is not to say that an aggrieved party is without recourse.by statute,federal law mandates that an arbitration award be vacated in the event of bias.see a.
thus,a party alleging a due process violation in the conduct of the arbitration proceedings,fraud,misconduct,a violation of public policy,by arbitrators should pursue remedies against the real adversary through the process of challenging the arbitration award.to allow a collateral attack against arbitrators and their judgments would also emasculate the provisions of the federal arbitration act.corey new york stock exchange,supra,at.the remedy for arbitrator bias or misconduct is a civil action seeking to vacate the arbitration award.see olson national ass of security dealers,supra,at honn national ass of securities dealers,cir,in re robins,affd.mem.cir brandon,jones,sandall medpartners,affd.in part,app.dism.in part cir a.
commentators are in accord with federal law once the arbitrator renders an award,his role is finished.the proper challenge to an award is an action to vacate it brought against the other party,the real adversary,not against the arbitrator t he arbitrator is not a proper party in a suit over the award and has no interest in the dispute once the award is rendered.given this lack of interest,judicial economy requires dismissal of the unnecessary party.dragging arbitrators into subsequent litigation would drastically interfere with their recruitment and independence.arbitral immunity,supra,indus.rel.at,fns.omitted.
california courts often look to federal law in deciding arbitration issues under state law.see,armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,pour le bebe,guess th,d alan superior court th,d.like federal law,california law provides that arbitrator bias is grounds for vacating an arbitration award.see,subd.a,formerly subds.a c reed mutual service th,d betz pankow th,d michael aetna life casualty ins.th,d ray wilson anaheim memorial hospital d,fn,disapproved on another point in moncharsh heily blase cal th,d.
a suit against an arbitrator or a sponsoring organization is nothing more than a collateral attack on the arbitration award.see corey new york stock exchange,supra,at.and,under state law,the exclusive means of attacking an award is by way of a petition to vacate the award,as provided in the california arbitration act.see classic construction,development th,d.
finally,under baar,supra,d,any bias on the part of an arbitrator or sponsoring organization is akin to misconduct in arriving at a decision id.at,italics omitted misconduct for which,as baar recognized,courts have clothed arbitrators with immunity ibid.b y its own terms baar does not apply to the facts of this case,where the allegation is of error in reaching a result,not in the total failure to reach a decision.olney sacramento county bar,supra,d at.
accordingly,we hold that bias in the arbitration process should be remedied by challenging the arbitration award,not by seeking to impose liability on the arbitrator or the sponsoring organization.
other state courts have come to the same conclusion.in l h airco,rapistan,the minnesota supreme court stated failure to disclose possible conflicts of interest creates at the least an impression of bias.an impression of bias contaminates the decision making process when neutrality is essential and is not condoned by this court.nevertheless,we decline to permit a civil suit against the arbitrator for failure to disclose prior business or social contacts because of our policy of encouraging arbitration and of protecting the independence of the.permitting civil suit for a lapse in disclosure would chill the willingness of arbitrators to serve because of the difficulty of remembering all contacts,however remote,with parties to the arbitration.
this extension of the grant of immunity does not mean that we are not dismayed by the arbitrator failure to disclose the possibility of a conflict of interest.it should have been a simp
