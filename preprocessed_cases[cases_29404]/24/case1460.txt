an arbitrator can not amend an award after the trial court has confirmed it.we articulated that reasonable,test in delaney dahl th,d delaney,and will not redraw it here.
the judgment below passes the delaney test.
here,an arbitrator in a trust dispute issued a first award that effectively decided the most important dispute between the parties,involving whether a corporate note was separate or community property.while the arbitrator referred to the distribution values in a trial exhibit exhibit,he did not make the exhibit a part of the award.instead,he expressly left open his options to work with the trustee to make a different distribution if in light of new developments a somewhat different distribution of assets would benefit the estate.
appellant never sought to modify or amend the first award.to the contrary,it was appellant who sought to confirm it in its original form,and to secure an affirmance on appeal.in this specific factual context,the arbitrator was free to conduct an incremental or multistep process as part of his choice of a remedy,and to issue a second award.
by seeking to confirm and affirm an award,appellant effectively consented to further arbitration on the issues.as we were aptly reminded by counsel at oral argument quoting baseball great yogi berra,it ai over till it over.
we affirm the trial court judgment confirming the second award.the arbitrator did not revisit previously determined matters.instead,both the arbitrator and the trial court respected the decisions reached in the first award.
if anything is confirmed by the instant appeal,it is the significance of the process of confirming an arbitration award.the time to make sure that the i are dotted,t are crossed,and that the award decides all necessary issues in a single,final and award is before the award is confirmed,not after.that is the best way to ensure that an arbitrator decision is truly the end,not the beginning,of the dispute.moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,moncharsh.
the roehl family trust trust was created by ernest roehl husband and diana roehl wife,who were married for some eighteen years.wife,who had multiple sclerosis and was in poor health,died two years after husband.
appellant mariana ritchie niece is wife niece,and beneficiary,and the executor of her estate.respondents jeffrey roehl and william roehl sons are husband sons from a previous marriage.niece and sons dispute the distribution of the trust assets.
this litigation antedates wife death and involves two separate arbitration awards,each of which has been confirmed by the superior court.niece successfully moved to confirm the first arbitration award,which sons appealed,and which judgment we affirmed in an unpublished opinion.sons successfully moved to confirm the second arbitration award,which niece now appeals.niece contends that the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to make the second award after the trial court confirmed the first.
a detailed chronology follows 
a.the first arbitration award march.
husband died in march.the family estate plan called for the trust assets to be distributed into three separate subtrusts.wife was the sole beneficiary of the survivor trust,while sons were the beneficiaries of the two other subtrusts,the qualified income trust and decedent trust.
relations among the beneficiaries became intensely antagonistic,resulting in disputes about trust administration,and ultimately litigation.the trial court ordered the matter submitted to binding arbitration pursuant to the trust agreement,which contained an arbitration clause 
in january,retired judge james jackman was appointed as the arbitrator a arbitration hearing was held in january.respondent kenneth cummins,recently appointed as the trustee,did not participate.
on march,the arbitrator issued his award.the arbitrator resolved the biggest dispute characterization of the note in wife favor.having determined that the stock was community property at date of death,the single biggest issue before the arbitrator is resolved.
the arbitrator proceeded to consider several subordinate issues still to be decided.he denied the attorney fees request by sons counsel.he determined that the family home in huntington harbour should be split as wife separate property and husband separate property.he also decided that it should be apportioned to the survivor trust because wife continues to occupy that residence as her home.
the arbitration award referred to exhibit,an arbitration exhibit prepared by roger cannon,a certified public accountant,detailing the trust assets,and entered into evidence by wife.the arbitrator specifically approved the allocation in exhibit at least to the extent of its distribution of the asset.
the arbitrator equivocated whether the other trust assets such as the family home should be distributed in the manner suggested in exhibit or whether there should be a somewhat different distribution of assets the arbitrator stated 
it may be in light of developments since november,the valuation date of the assets listed in exhibit that some of the other assets should be apportioned differently than shown here.if in light of new developments since then,a somewhat different distribution of assets would benefit the estate,the trustee may modify said distribution.italics added.
the arbitrator expressed his willingness to work with the trustee to review any remaining questions he may have concerning the orders and findings made by the arbitrator.the arbitrator concluded that exhibit is to become the distribution of trust assets t o the extent that changes are not needed,in the opinion of the trustee,exhibit was not attached to the award.
on march,within a week of the award,wife died.niece succeeded to wife interests and continued to be represented by wife counsel.
in the succeeding months,sons wrote to the arbitrator to request that he reconsider before issuing a final decision on the trust administration disputes.sons challenged the decision on the note,and any use of the asset allocation tables in exhibit.sons urged the arbitrator to reconsider his denial of their attorney fees request.
the arbitrator responded on may.as to the family home,the arbitrator stated,i do not feel that i have sufficient evidence to rule on that at this time other than to the extent that i tentatively accepted the distribution introduced in exhibit which showed how a possible appropriate distribution could be made in light of a finding of as community.i had no other such proposed allocation before me and it is clear from my holding that i was willing to reexamine that if appropriate.
on june,sons filed a petition with the superior court to preserve their rights to have the award vacated.they argued that the arbitrator exceeded his powers by acting contrary to the trust provisions.
on june,the arbitrator wrote a short letter to the parties,stating,after thinking of the various issues,i believe that the appropriate approach at this time is to leave the distribution as originally done.my reasoning,for whatever it worth,is based on the notion that it was the best decision that could be made in light of the evidence that was introduced at the time of trial.
on june,niece filed her opposition and separately moved to confirm the march award.niece never asked the arbitrator to amend,correct or modify the award,or to issue a final award that formally incorporated exhibit.her motion to confirm did not mention the arbitrator june letter,or seek to have it considered as an amendment or correction of the award.
on july,the trial court judge marjorie laird carter denied the petition,and issued a judgment confirming the march award.the court found no evidence that the arbitrator exceeded his authority.
b.the first appeal september.
in september,sons appealed from the judgment confirming the first arbitration award.they filed their appellants opening brief seven months later 
the appeal made a hodgepodge of challenges to the award,including efforts to argue that the arbitrator exceeded his powers and failed to follow procedures.sons relied upon numerous documents which postdated their notice of appeal.
niece brief pointed out that such evidence was outside the appellate record and should be ignored put simply,the events upon which appellants exclusively rely in their appeal are irrelevant to and can not be considered in this court de novo review of the trial court july judgment.
we agreed with niece in an unpublished opinion.roehl ritchie,wl nonpub.opn.we stressed its narrow basis appellants seek to reverse a judgment confirming an arbitration award based solely on unauthenticated postjudgment evidence that is outside the record on appeal and that was never considered by the trial court.this we can not do.appellants have made no other attempt to establish any viable grounds for vacating the arbitration award under code of civil procedure section.italics added.we refused to scour the record for other error it is up to appellants to frame the issues on appeal and to furnish an appropriate record for appellate review of trial court error.this court is not inclined to act as counsel for any appellant and furnish a legal argument as to how the trial court rulings in this regard constituted an abuse of discretion.
c.the second arbitration award october.
on november,during the pendency of the appeal,the trustee submitted his first of two petitions for instruction to the arbitrator.the trustee stated that he did not seek to reconsider the important issues decided in the first arbitration award,but instead raised other open issues which need to be resolved prior to distribution of the trust assets.the trustee specifically petitioned for instructions on a number of undecided issues,including the date on which the huntington harbour house was to be valued.as the trustee put it,
it is a given that the the huntington harbour house is to be allocated to the survivor trust.is it to be allocated at the value of,as exhibit refers to a schedule of distribution of assets as of,which is arguably a deemed distribution,or is it to be valued as of the date of actual distribution if it is to be valued as of the date of actual distribution,the trustee needs that date and authority to employ at trust expense a certified real estate appraiser or a mai appraiser to appraise the same.
niece objected to any effort by the arbitrator to change the valuation of the huntington harbour house from that stated in exhibit.t he arbitrator should simply instruct the trustee that the matter already has been decided and should instruct the trustee to allocate and distribute the assets in accordance with exhibit.niece,however,did ask the arbitrator to order a new accounting because of ongoing transactions and expenses,and to instruct the trustee how he should charge any cash shortfall.
in january,the trustee submitted a second petition for instructions to the arbitrator.the second petition for instructions concerned claims that had been filed by various entities and persons against the trust.these included claims by niece and her husband for reimbursement for money paid to wife caregivers.the trustee asked the arbitrator to determine whether these claims should be allowed,and if so,in what amounts and how they should be allocated among the subtrusts.
on october,the arbitrator issued the second arbitration award.the arbitrator accepted the new appraisal of the huntington harbour house,determined its fair market value as of wife death to be,and assigned it to the survivor trust the award included a table allocating trust assets among the various subtrusts,and assigned an equalization value of for husband percent separate property interest.the arbitrator approved niece claims for reimbursement.
unlike the first arbitration award,the second arbitration award specifically lists the allocation of assets among the various subtrusts.the arbitrator reserved jurisdiction to rule on the reasonableness of the trustee fees,and issues relating to his accountings.
on november,niece filed a motion to vacate the second arbitration award on the ground that the arbitrator no longer had jurisdiction under code of civil procedure section to modify or amend it.niece requested that the trial court order the trustee to distribute the assets of the survivor trust in accordance with the first award and arbitration exhibit referred to in the award.niece contended that the second arbitration award reduced the value of the survivor trusts from the exhibit distribution values by at least.
sons opposed niece motion,and petitioned to confirm the second arbitration award.
the trial court judge johnston held a hearing on february.on april,the court denied the motion to vacate and confirmed the second arbitration award.
it is important at the outset to make clear the judgment we are reviewing.this appeal arises from the judgment confirming the second arbitration award of october.we are not reviewing the judgment confirming the first arbitration award of march.that task was accomplished when we issued our unpublished decision in the first appeal.we do not revisit the propriety of the first arbitration award,but construe it only insofar as it affects our review of the second arbitration award.see,patchett bergamot station,th,fn,d,patchett.
the second arbitration award is a final arbitration award that was confirmed by the superior court.under code of civil procedure section,we may vacate this final award only under very limited circumstances.delaney,supra,th at,d.we do not review the merits of the dispute,the sufficiency of the evidence,or the arbitrator reasoning,nor may we correct or review an award because of an arbitrator legal or factual error,even if it appears on the award face.instead,we restrict our review to whether the award should be vacated under the grounds listed in section.advanced micro devices,intel cal th,d,intel moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.this means that we do not review the arbitrator findings in the second award,but take them as correct.intel,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
niece urges that we vacate the award on the grounds the arbitrator exceeded his powers when he drastically modified a previous arbitration award long after his powers as arbitrator had expired.niece contends that the second award changed virtually every other ruling in the first award.
in determining whether the arbitrator exceeded his powers in making the second arbitration award,we review the superior court decision de novo,but we pay substantial deference to an arbitrator determination of his own authority.delaney,supra,th at,d.any doubts about the arbitrator power to decide these issues must be resolved in his favor.intel,supra,cal th at,d.as the supreme court has explained,arbitrators do not exceed their powers within the meaning of section,subdivision d and section,subdivision b merely by rendering an erroneous decision on a legal or factual issue,so long as the issue was within the scope of the controversy submitted to the arbitrators.moshonov walsh cal th,d.
these statutory and common law limitations on our ability to vacate an arbitrator decision further california strong public policy of arbitral finality,with minimal judicial intervention.delaney,supra,th at,d.
does the second arbitration award conflict with the first arbitration award 
niece tells us that the second arbitration award must be vacated under the test in delaney because it modified the first arbitration award,which already had been affirmed by judge carter,and affirmed by this court.according to niece,the law,facts,and strong public policy all dictate that the first arbitration award was final and that the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to rewrite the entire award months after the trial court confirmed the award.in her reply brief,niece distilled the appeal to a single query,at bottom,this appeal asks a simple question can an arbitrator change his award after the trial court has confirmed the award.
in delaney,we affirmed an arbitrator power to amend the disposition section of an award shortly before confirmation to add the name of a corporate officer.although the statutory time to correct the award had long passed,we affirmed the judgment confirming the amended award.we held the amended award was timely since it was made before confirmation.we stated,the temporal requirement that the amendment must be made before judicial confirmation of the a reasonable,test.to permit amendment until the trial court confirms the award furthers the policies set forth in moncharsh and its progeny of ensuring finality of,and limiting judicial intervention in,the arbitration process.delaney,supra,th at,d,italics added.
the court of appeal recently rejected a challenge to a second arbitration award on the grounds that it vitiated a first award previously made by the same arbitrator,which first award was confirmed by the trial court.in patchett,supra,th,d,the arbitrator in a commercial property dispute determined that a tenant failed to meet his burden of proving that the common area maintenance charges imposed by the landlord were disproportionate to the charges paid by other tenants.but the arbitrator denied the request without prejudice,and left the matter open for another day.id.at,d.after confirmation,the arbitrator issued a second award where he found that the landlord increase in maintenance charges was not justified.on appeal,the patchett court found that the second award did not impermissibly alter or amend the first.id.at,fn,d.
exercising our de novo review of the judgment confirming the second arbitration award,but giving appropriate deference to the arbitrator factual and legal findings,we have carefully scrutinized both the first arbitration award of march,and the second arbitration award of october.we can not say that the latter modified the provisions of the former,and therefore was in excess of the arbitrator powers 
there can be no dispute about some key issues decided in the first arbitration award.most notably,the arbitrator ruled in wife now niece favor on the most important owned the note.in like fashion,the arbitrator ruled that wife now niece would keep the huntington harbour house,and the arbitrator recognized that husband now sons only had a separate property interest.the arbitrator determined that sons counsel could not recover his attorney fees from the trust.
but there is nothing in the text of the first award that leads us to believe that it determined the value of all assets for purpose of distribution.the arbitrator recognized that other assets may be apportioned differently than as stated in exhibit in light of new developments since november.the first award specifically left the door open for the trustee who says he was unaware of the arbitration to suggest modifications to the distribution in light of new developments that would benefit the estate,and for the arbitrator to work with the trustee to review any remaining questions he may have concerning the orders and findings made by the arbitrator.as judge johnston stated at the hearing i looked at the arbitrator award of march the wherein i think that the language can reasonably be construed as judge jackman saying i understand that there are additional issues that may come up.and i would like to reserve jurisdiction to deal with those as they come up.
we think that it is significant that the arbitrator did not incorporate the values expressed in exhibit in his award.nor did he attach exhibit as an exhibit to the award,and incorporate it by reference in his decision.plainly,the arbitrator left the matter up for future consideration.that is why he used the future is to become the method for trust allocation unless the trustee determines that changes will be needed.
this is precisely what happened.the trustee filed two separate petitions for instructions regarding issues left open by the first arbitration award,and he brought up some new developments that had occurred since november.and the trustee appropriately enforced the provisions of the first arbitration award in his successful summary judgment against sons counsel action for attorney fees.
niece stresses that there is no evidence in the record regarding any,changes.not so.anybody who lived in california during that period knows of the phenomenal boom in california residential real estate prices.this is particularly true for homes located near the coast,like the family home in huntington harbour.
the record bears this out.according to niece,roger cannon apparently valued the huntington harbour house at as of november,attributing an equalizing value of for sons percent interest.yet a neutral appraisal some six months later by the same appraiser who previously had valued the house showed that the house was worth more than million.the new development created by california escalating real estate values increased sons equalizing interest to.
niece has not provided us compelling reasons why we should restrict the arbitrator power to make such factual determinations in the second arbitration award.the fact that the first award was judicially confirmed by the trial court only puts a judicial gloss on the first award it does not add to or vary it.to borrow a bit of folk wisdom,a pig with lipstick is still a pig.
under these circumstances,we defer to the arbitrator powers to determine the scope of his contractual authority,and resolve any doubts in favor of upholding the second arbitration award.intel,supra,cal th at,d,patchett,supra,th at,d.perhaps another yogi berra quote best sums it up the umpire ai ruled until he ruled.city of stanton cox d.
b.did the first arbitration award,as confirmed by the trial court,allow the arbitrator to issue incremental or multistep awards 
niece challenges the arbitrator power in the first arbitration to reserve jurisdiction to make incremental decisions.according to niece,the arbitrator can not intentionally leave any issues unresolved lest the first arbitration award be void under section,which requires any arbitration award to include a determination of all questions submitted to the arbitrators the decision of which is necessary in order to determine the controversy.niece says that california law permits arbitrators to reserve jurisdiction over post confirmation disputes only in very narrow circumstances not applicable here.
we disagree.in hightower superior court th,d hightower,the court of appeal rejected a very similar contention that section required a single final award that resolves all issues placed in dispute by the parties.hightower relied heavily on the supreme court decision in intel and its deference to the arbitrator choice of remedies.hightower specifically affirmed an arbitrator ability to use a multiple incremental or successive award process as a means,in an appropriate case,of finally deciding all submitted issues.id.at,d.
we recognize,as did hightower,that there are limitations to such incremental awards,and that an arbitrator has no power to use the incremental award process to correct or modify the terms of an original award.hightower,supra,th at,fn,d,distinguishing elliott ten eyck partnership city of long beach th,d.as we discussed above,the arbitrator reservation of jurisdiction to issue a second arbitration award did not result in a correction or modification of the terms and provisions of the first arbitration award.
niece questions why the arbitrator could not have resolved all the issues initially submitted to him in the first arbitration award.niece claims that in trust be compelled to decide all issues submitted that are capable of resolution without an interim award.otherwise,niece urges,arbitrators would have carte blanche to decide submitted issues piecemeal and to exercise continuing jurisdiction over any current and future disputes,
the time to make that challenge was in the first appeal,where the first arbitration award was directly before us.far from doing so,niece herself was the moving party in seeking to confirm the first arbitration award.as niece persuasively argues in her opening brief,res judicata bars relitigation of the issues that could have been determined in the first appeal.see also patchett,supra,th at,fn,d,the first award was confirmed and is no longer subject to review.
at oral argument,niece claimed that the second arbitration award violated a dispute resolution provision in the trust agreement,which niece says required mediation as a prerequisite to further arbitration.see frei davey th,d mediation using a neutral professional is often an effec
