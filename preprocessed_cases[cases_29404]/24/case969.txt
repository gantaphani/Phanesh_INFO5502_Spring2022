plaintiff jacqueline davis davis appeals the district court order dismissing her action and compelling arbitration under based upon an arbitration agreement with her former employer,defendant myers.on appeal,davis challenges the enforceability of the arbitration agreement,contending that it is unconscionable under california law.the merits of the underlying claims in her complaint are not at issue here.because the arbitration agreement is unconscionable under california law,we reverse and remand.
background 
on august,adopted and distributed to its employees a new dispute resolution program drp that culminated in final and binding arbitration of most claims by and against its employees distributed the drp via interoffice mail and posted it on an office intranet site.a cover memorandum stated please read the attached and direct any questions you may have to a member of the human resources department,the legal personnel department,the associate advisory committee or the office of the chair.davis,who had worked as a paralegal at a los angeles,california,office of since june,received the drp but apparently did nothing official to question the policy.
by its terms,the drp became effective three months later,on november.it provides in bold,uppercase print this dispute resolution program the program applies to and is binding on all employees including associates hired who continue to work firm on or after november.davis worked at until july.
on february,davis filed this lawsuit under the federal fair labor standards act flsa and various other state and federal labor statutes,alleging failure to pay overtime for work during lunch time and rest periods and for other work exceeding eight hours a day and hours a week,as well as denial of rest and meal periods.in addition to claims under the flsa,her complaint included claims for violations of california labor code,and,and for declaratory relief seeking a declaration that the drp is unconscionable and that enforcement of its provisions and other allegedly illegal behavior constituted unfair business practices under california unfair business practices act.the complaint sought damages and injunctive relief on an individual basis and for all others similarly harmed.
the drp covers most claims,as follows 
except as otherwise provided in this program,effective november,you and the firm hereby consent to the resolution by private arbitration of all claims or controversies,past,present or future in any way arising out of,relating to,or associated with your employment with the firm or the termination of your employment that the firm may have against you or that you may have against the firm the claims covered by this program include,but are not limited to,claims for wages or other compensation due and claims for violation of any federal,state or other governmental constitution,law,statute,ordinance,regulation or public policy 
except as otherwise provided in the program,neither you nor the firm will initiate or pursue any lawsuit or administrative action other than filing an administrative charge of discrimination with the equal employment opportunity commission,the california department of fair employment and housing,the new york human rights commission or any similar fair employment practices agency in any way related to or arising from any claim covered by this program.
in addition to administrative charges of discrimination as set forth above,the drp also excluded certain other types of claims from mandatory arbitration as follows 
this program does not apply to or cover claims for workers compensation benefits claims for unemployment compensation benefits claims by the firm for injunctive relief other equitable relief for violations of the privilege or work product doctrine or the disclosure of other confidential information or claims based upon an employee pension or benefit plan,the terms of which contain an arbitration or other nonjudicial dispute resolution procedure,in which case the provisions of that plan shall apply.
it is undisputed that davis flsa and related claims regarding overtime arise out of,or relate to,her employment for purposes of the scope of the drp.the question here is whether the drp is enforceable,in whole or in part.
two other specific provisions of the drp are also at issue in this appeal a notice provision requiring notice and a demand for mediation within one year from when the basis of the claim is known or should have been known and a confidentiality clause.
the notice provision provides as follows 
an employee must give written notice of any claim to the firm along with a demand for mediation.this notice must be given within one calendar year from the time the condition or situation providing the basis for the claim is known to the employee or with reasonable effort on the employee part should have been known to him or her.the same rule applies to any claim the firm has against an employee failure to give timely notice of a claim along with a demand for mediation will waive the claim and it will be lost forever.bold and underscore in original.
the confidentiality clause provides as follows 
except as may be necessary to enter judgment upon the award or to the extent required by applicable law,all claims,defenses and proceedings including,without limiting the generality of the foregoing,the existence of a controversy and the fact that there is a mediation or an arbitration proceeding shall be treated in a confidential manner by the mediator,the arbitrator,the parties and their counsel,each of their agents,and employees and all others acting on behalf of or in concert with them.without limiting the generality of the foregoing,no one shall divulge to any third party or person not directly involved in the mediation or arbitration the content of the pleadings,papers,orders,hearings,trials,or awards in the arbitration,except as may be necessary to enter judgment upon the arbitrator award as required by applicable law.
after davis filed suit,moved to dismiss the action and to compel arbitration.the district court upheld the drp and granted motion.davis filed a timely appeal.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the court has jurisdiction over this appeal under a.a district court order compelling arbitration is reviewed de novo.circuit city stores,mantor,cir mantor ii citation omitted.
neither party questioned whether a opposed to an decide whether the drp is unconscionable.the ninth circuit,sitting en banc and applying buckeye check cashing,cardegna,d,recently addressed whether challenges to an arbitration clause or agreement should be decided by a court or an arbitrator.see nagrampa mailcoups,cir en banc.when the crux of the complaint is not the invalidity of the contract as a whole,but rather the arbitration provision itself,then the federal courts as opposed to the arbitrator must decide whether the arbitration provision is invalid and unenforceable under.id.at.the arbitration agreement challenged in this case is only part of the many conditions and terms of davis employment relationship with.striking or upholding the arbitration agreement or severing any of its terms would not otherwise affect the legality of other conditions of her employment.under nagrampa,then,the question whether arbitration agreement is unconscionable is for a court to decide.see alexander anthony int l,cir exemplifying that a court addresses the unconscionability of an arbitration provision in a suit regarding employment disputes,cited with approval in nagrampa,at.
discussion 
under the federal arbitration act faa,arbitration agreements shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.federal policy favors arbitration.gilmer lane,d reasoning that the faa manifest s a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.quoting moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.generally,arbitration affects only the choice of forum,not substantive rights.eeoc luce,forward,hamilton scripps,cir en banc.of course,arbitration agreements are not always valid.rather,in assessing whether an arbitration agreement or clause is enforceable,the court should apply ordinary principles that govern the formation of contracts.circuit city stores,adams,cir quoting first options of,kaplan,d.
under california law,a contractual clause is unenforceable if it is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.see armendariz found.health psychcare,cal th,d,nagrampa,at.courts apply a sliding scale the more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.armendariz,d,at.still,both must be present in order for a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability.id.quoting stirlen supercuts,th,d.we address each prong in turn.
procedural unconscionability 
in assessing procedural unconscionability,the court focuses on whether the contract was one of adhesion.was it imposed on employees as a condition of employment was there an opportunity to negotiate the test focuses on factors of oppression and surprise.soltani life ins,cir citations omitted.
the drp was written by a sophisticated national and international law firm,no there are no factors of adhesion such as surprise or concealment.the drp was not hidden the terms were not concealed in an employee handbook.the binding nature of it was in bold and uppercase text.terms were not buried in fine print.not only gave ample notice of the program and its terms,but also made efforts to have employment lawyers and personnel available to answer questions.there is no evidence although the case did not progress very far of undue pressure put on employees.
nevertheless,in a very real sense the drp was take it or leave it.the drp terms took effect three months after they were announced regardless of whether an employee liked them or not.an employee option was to leave and work somewhere else.true,for current employees like davis,three months might have been sufficient time to consider whether the drp was reason to leave.in that sense,there could have been a meaningful opportunity to opt out although to opt out of the entire employment relationship,not to retain the relationship but preserve a judicial forum.
in adams,the ninth circuit,applying armendariz the controlling california supreme court case,found an arbitration agreement procedurally unconscionable because it was a take it or leave it proposition.at.adams reasoned that t he agreement is a prerequisite to employment,and job applicants are not permitted to modify the agreement must take the contract or leave it.id.the ninth circuit found an agreement in ferguson countrywide credit industries,cir,procedurally unconscionable for the same reason.california courts continue to apply the rationale from armendariz to find such arbitration contracts procedurally unconscionable.see,martinez master prot,th,d,an arbitration agreement that is an essential part of a take it or leave it employment condition,without more,is procedurally unconscionable.citations omitted.
conversely,if an employee has a meaningful opportunity to opt out of the arbitration provision when signing the agreement and still preserve his or her job,then it is not procedurally unconscionable.see,circuit city stores,najd,cir upholding agreement circuit city stores,ahmed,cir same.compare mantor i,at finding procedural unconscionability even if employee had been given an opt out form,because of undue pressure not to sign the opt out form,rendering the opportunity not meaningful.
concedes that its employees were not given an option to opt out and preserve a judicial forum.it does note that employees were invited to ask questions about the drp,but there is nothing to indicate that the terms were negotiable for employees such as davis.but,the district court the three months of notice nevertheless satisfies the concern of oppression behind this factor.it relies on a marketplace alternatives theory used in cases outside the employment context.see dean witter reynolds,superior court,d.in this regard,dean witter stated 
any claim of oppression may be defeated if the complaining party had reasonably available alternative sources of supply from which to obtain the desired goods or services free of the terms claimed to be unconscionable.if oppression refers to the absence of meaningful choice,then the existence of a meaningful choice to do business elsewhere must tend to defeat any claim of oppression.
dean witter addressed mandatory arbitration in a financial services contract.the court reasoned that if the consumer did not like the mandatory arbitration provision in an investment account contract,the consumer could get an account at another company.id.at.the district court here accepted argument extending dean witter by analogy to the employment context.the rationale is that if davis did not want to work at which was free to change most of the terms of her employment with reasonable notice she had a meaningful choice as in dean do business elsewhere by working somewhere else.
it is impossible,however,to square such reasoning with explicit language from ingle circuit city stores,cir ingle i and ferguson,at,specifically rejecting the argument that a take it or leave it arbitration provision was procedurally saved by providing employees time to consider the change.in ingle i,the ninth circuit struck a circuit city arbitration agreement as both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.at.as with drp,the employee ingle did not have an opportunity to opt out by preserving a judicial forum.id.at.circuit city argued that the agreement was enforceable because ingle had time to consider the arbitration terms,but chose to accept the employment anyway.the ingle i court rejected circuit city argument.
attempts to distinguish ingle i in this regard because davis had three three consider the arbitration agreement.the distinction,however,is not helpful because even if the opportunity to walk away was meaningful,the drp was still a take it or leave it proposition.more importantly,ingle i reasoned that t he amount of time the employee had to consider the contract is irrelevant.id.emphasis added.ingle i addressed the availability of alternative employment by follow ing the reasoning in szetela discover bank,th,d,in which the california court of appeal held that the availability of other options does not bear on whether a contract is procedurally unconscionable.ingle i,at citing szetela,d at emphasis added see also ferguson,at w hether the plaintiff had an opportunity to decline the defendant contract and instead enter into a contract with another party that does not include the offending terms is not the relevant test for procedural unconscionability.emphasis added citing szetela,d at fitz ncr,th,d,finding arbitration contract procedurally unconscionable because employee did not have a meaningful choice to reject a new arbitration agreement imposed with one month notice few employees are in a position to forfeit a job and the benefits they have accrued for more than a decade solely to avoid the arbitration terms that are forced upon them by their employer.
in nagrampa,the ninth circuit reiterated these principles of california law and specifically rejected the argument that the availability of other employment can defeat a claim of procedural unconscionability when an employee is faced with a take it or leave it condition of employment.nagrampa,at the california court of appeal has rejected the notion that the availability in the marketplace of substitute employment,goods,or services alone can defeat a claim of procedural unconscionability.emphasis in original citations omitted.nagrampa also distinguished dean witter by reasoning that the investor in that case was a sophisticated with specialized knowledge of financial institutions and financial service contracts.id.in contrast,is the case with davis as a paralegal in an international law employee is facing an employer with overwhelming bargaining power that drafted the contract,and presented it to davis on a basis,the clause is procedurally unconscionable.id.at see also morris redwood empire bancorp,th,d,distinguishing dean witter and reasoning that not every opportunity to seek an alternative source of supply is realistic.courts have recognized a variety of situations where adhesion contracts are oppressive,despite the availability of alternatives.for example,few employees are in a position to refuse a job because of an arbitration agreement in an employment contract.citations and internal quotation marks omitted jones humanscale,th,d,defendant prepared and submitted the agreement containing the arbitration clause to plaintiff and required him to sign it as a condition of his continued employment,thus rendering the agreement a contract of adhesion.citations omitted.
in short,the drp is procedurally unconscionable.
substantive unconscionability 
even if the drp is procedurally unconscionable,we must also address whether the agreement is or specific provisions of it are substantively unconscionable before rendering it or any of its terms unenforceable.armendariz,d,at nagrampa,at reiterating that procedural unconscionability is to be analyzed in proportion to evidence of substantive unconscionability.
substantive unconscionability relates to the effect of the contract or provision.a lack of mutuality is relevant in analyzing this prong.the term focuses on the terms of the agreement and whether those terms are so as to shock the conscience.soltani,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted emphasis in original.a determination of substantive unconscionability involves whether the terms of the contract are unduly harsh or oppressive.adams,at citation omitted.we proceed to examine individually the four provisions of the drp that davis challenges as substantively unconscionable or otherwise void.we then consider whether the provisions we conclude are void may be severed from the rest of the drp or whether,instead,the drp is unenforceable in its entirety.
a.the notice provision.
davis challenges the drp notice provision.it allows one year within which to give notice from when any claim is known to the employee or with reasonable effort should have been known to him or her.davis contends that this notice provision is a shortened statute of limitations and that it deprives her of potential application of a continuing violation theory.
the challenged provision covers more than merely notice it also requires a demand for mediation within a year failure to give timely notice of a claim along with a demand for mediation will waive the claim and it will be lost forever bold and underscore in original.under the drp,then,mediation is a mandatory prerequisite to arbitration the notice provision thus functions as a statute of limitations.because mediation precedes the arbitration,the notice provision requires the whole claim to be filed within a year.one can not,for example,give written notice within a year,but otherwise file a claim later under a longer statute of limitations in short,if the claim is not filed within a year of when it should have been discovered,it is lost.
we have previously held that forcing employees to comply with a strict limitation period for statutory claims is oppressive in a mandatory arbitration context.notice provision is similar to the limitations provision in ingle i,which read 
a claim shall be submitted not later than one year after the date on which the employee knew,or through reasonable diligence should have known,of the facts giving rise to the employee claim s.the failure of an employee to initiate an arbitration within the time limit shall constitute a waiver with respect to that dispute relative to that employee.
at.we struck down that provision as substantively unconscionable.see also mantor i,at adopting ingle i holding.likewise,in adams we invalidated a strict one year statute of limitation against bringing statutory claims as substantively unconscionable.at.california courts have also struck arbitration provisions because of a shortened limitations period.see martinez,d at finding an arbitration agreement with a limitation period substantively unconscionable because the shortened period is insufficient to protect its employees right to vindicate their statutory rights.the fact that is also bound to litigate statutory claims within the period is of no consequence,as these are types of claims likely only to be brought by employees.see ingle i,at the only claims realistically affected by an arbitration agreement between an employer and an employee are those claims employees bring against their employer.martinez,d at.
in holding substantively unconscionable provisions shortening the time to bring statutory claims,we have been particularly concerned about barring a continuing violations theory by employees.such a theory can be used,for example,when an employer has a systematic policy of discrimination consisting of related acts that began prior to period within the statute of limitations.see,richards hill,cal th,d,discussing various continuing violation theories.on this point,ingle i reasoned 
a strict one year statute of limitations on arbitrating claims would deprive employees of the benefit of the continuing violation doctrine available in feha suits.while the employer insulates itself from potential damages,an employee foregoes the possibility of relief under the continuing violations doctrine.therefore,because the benefit of this provision flows only to the employer,we conclude that the statute of limitations provision is substantively unconscionable.
at quoting adams,at citation omitted.likewise,the provision imposed by functions to bar a continuing violations theory because it specifically bars any claims not brought within a year of when they were first known or should have been known.absent equitable tolling and it is uncertain whether an arbitrator would allow tolling,such continuing violations would be barred by the drp,because neither notice nor a demand for mediation would have been filed within a year of the time the condition or situation providing the basis for the claim is known to the employee or with reasonable effort on the employee part should have been known to him or her.
relies on soltani,in which the ninth circuit expressly found a shortened limitation provision not substantively unconscionable under california law.at.soltani cited a host of california cases and authority from other jurisdictions finding that,as a general matter,a shortened limitation period is not unreasonable.argues that if is reasonable,then the year given in the drp must also be reasonable and thus not substantively unconscionable.soltani,however,is distinguishable.
soltani addressed a different type of limitations provision.there,the employment contract required any suit relating to employment to be filed within after the employee left the employer.id.at.the time to file did not depend upon when the employee knew of the claim,or otherwise when it arose.a claim could still be filed,as long as it was also filed within from when the employee stopped working and as long as it was not otherwise barred by the relevant statute of limitations.this type of provision does not raise the concerns about nullifying the continuing violations theory,as the employee would during that period still be able to take full advantage of the ability to reach back to the start of the violation.
under ingle i,adams,and mantor i and the subsequent california appeals court decision in martinez,the drp universal limitation period is substantively unconscionable when it forces an employee to arbitrate statutory claims.
confidentiality provision.
next,davis challenges the confidentiality provision.she argues that it is overly broad and therefore substantively unconscionable under ting,cir.
in ting,the ninth circuit found a confidentiality clause in an arbitration agreement substantively unconscionable,reasoning as follows.
c onfidentiality provisions usually favor companies over individuals.in cole burns int l sec.servs,the circuit recognized that because companies continually arbitrate the same claims,the arbitration process tends to favor the company.id.at.yet because of plaintiffs lawyers and arbitration appointing agencies like the american arbitration association,who can scrutinize arbitration awards and accumulate a body of knowledge on a particular company,the court discounted the likelihood of any harm occurring from the repeat player effect.we conclude,however,that if the company succeeds in imposing a gag order,plaintiffs are unable to mitigate the advantages inherent in being a repeat player.this is particularly harmful here,because the contract at issue affects seven million californians.
true,davis suit does not allege the kind of repeatable claim that could be made by millions of potential claimants as in ting,but does have hundreds if not thousands of employees who conceivably could bring claims.in any event,ting concern was not limited strictly to potential claims by millions of repeat players.rather,the logic of ting in this regard is that even facially mutual confidentiality provisions can effectively lack mutuality and therefore be unconscionable.the opinion goes on to reason 
thus,the employer has placed itself in a far superior legal posture by ensuring that none of its potential opponents have access to precedent while,at the same time,the employer accumulates a wealth of knowledge on how to negotiate the terms of its own unilaterally crafted contract.further,the unavailability of arbitral decisions may prevent potential plaintiffs from obtaining the information needed to build a case of intentional misconduct or unlawful discrimination against the employer.
here,the drp confidentiality clause as written unconscionably favors.the clause precludes even mention to anyone not directly involved in the mediation or arbitration of the content of the pleadings,papers,orders,hearings,trials,or awards in the arbitration or even the existence of a controversy and the fact that there is a mediation or an arbitration proceeding.such restrictions would prevent an employee from contacting other employees to assist in litigating or arbitrating an employee case.an inability to mention even the existence of a claim to current or former employees would handicap if not stifle an employee ability to investigate and engage in discovery.the restrictions would also place in a far superior legal posture by preventing plaintiffs from accessing precedent while allowing to learn how to negotiate and litigate its contracts in the future.id.strict confidentiality of all pleadings,papers,orders,hearings,trials,or awards in the arbitration could also prevent others from building cases.see id.the unavailability of arbitral decisions may prevent potential plaintiffs from obtaining the information needed to build a case of intentional misconduct or unlawful discrimination.it might even chill enforcement of cal.labor code,which forbids employers from keeping employees from disclosing certain working conditions and from retaliating against employees who do so 
responds by arguing that the drp allows parties to divulge information to those directly involved and would therefore allow fact investigation.also indicates that,despite the language,the confidentiality clause would not otherwise bar depositions and discovery in a confidential setting.it also relies upon a savings clause at the beginning of the provision except as may be necessary to enter judgment upon the award or to the extent required by applicable law as indicating that if there something wrong with any of the confidentiality clause terms,then the improper provision would be subordinated to the extent required by applicable law,ignored.
but such concessions depend upon overly generous readings of the confidentiality clause.we must deal with the terms as written.see armendariz,d,at an employer concession does not change the fact that the arbitration agreement as written is unconscionable and contrary to public policy no existing rule of contract law permits a party to resuscitate a legally defective contract merely by offering to change it.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.as written,the terms are too broad and implicate ting concerns.
this does not mean that confidentiality provisions in an arbitration agreement are per se unconscionable under california law.see mercuro superior court,th,d,while the california supreme court has taken notice of the repeat player effect,the court has never declared this factor renders the arbitration agreement unconscionable per se.citations omitted.the concern is not with confidentiality itself but,rather,with the scope of the language of the drp.zuver airtouch commc ns,en banc a lthough courts have accepted confidentiality provisions in many agreements,it does not necessarily follow that this confidentiality provision is conscionable.emphasis in original the parties to any particular arbitration,especially in an employment dispute,can always agree to limit availability of sensitive employee information,social security numbers or other personal identifier information or other matters,if necessary.confidentiality by itself is not substantively unconscionable the drp confidentiality clause,however,is written too broadly.
exemption for privilege disputes.
davis also challenges the drp provision exempting from arbitration for claims by the firm for injunctive other equitable relief for violations of the privilege or work product doctrine or the disclosure of other confidential information.
california law allows an employer to preserve a judicial remedy for itself if justified based upon a legitimate commercial need or business reality.armendariz,d,at a contract can provide a margin of safety that provides the party with superior bargaining strength a type of extra protection for which it has a legitimate commercial need without being unconscionable quoting stirlen,d at see also fitz,d at a contracting party with superior bargaining strength may provide extra protection for itself within the terms of the arbitration agreement if business realities create a special need for the advantage.the business realities creating the special need,must be explained in the terms of the contract or factually established.citing armendariz,d at,at.
justifies this clause by pointing out that it has not only contractual but ethical obligations to clients to protect against violations of the privilege and doctrine and otherwise to protect confidential client information.see,cal.bus.e it is the duty of an attorney to maintain inviolate the confidence,and at every peril to himself or herself to preserve the secrets,or his or her client.in re jordan,cal d.situations are foreseeable where might need a quick court order or injunction to prohibit a current or former employee from releasing privileged information.where many employees of a law firm might have access to privileged information,a narrow exception to arbitration for injunctive relief to protect against violations of the privilege or work product doctrine or the disclosure of other such confidential information could constitute a legitimate business reality.
initially,california law provides that certain public injunctions are incompatible with arbitration and that such a holding is consistent with the faa.actions seeking such injunctions can not be subject to arbitration even under a valid arbitration clause.see broughton cigna healthplans of,cal th,d,holding that a claim for public injunctive relief under the clra is not arbitrable,although damage claims under the clra are arbitrable cruz pacificare health,cal th,d,extending broughton to claims for public injunctive relief under california unfair competition law,business and professions code et zavala scott brothers dairy,th,d,certainly,plaintiffs injunctive relief claim under the unfair business practices act bus,is not arbitrable.
protections against violations of the attorney client privilege and doctrine are primarily for the benefit of clients,and in that sense are in the public interest.see upjohn united states,d observing that the purpose of the privilege is to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice see also in re jordan,at p rotection of client confidences and secrets is no
