the issues presented are the effect of home failure to initial the arbitration clause in the sales agreements as to certain buyers as to those arbitration agreements which were bilaterally executed,the enforceability of said agreements in view of section,which permits a purchaser to sue for construction defects despite having signed an agreement containing an arbitration clause and whether section is preempted herein by the federal arbitration act faa.
we conclude section is preempted by the faa because the undisputed facts indicate the instant agreements involve interstate commerce.therefore,the plaintiffs can not invoke section to avoid the arbitration agreements.
with respect to the plaintiffs as to whom home did not initial the arbitration clauses,the trial court is directed to conduct a factual inquiry on remand to determine whether home intended to be bound by arbitration,notwithstanding its failure to initial all the arbitration clauses.
