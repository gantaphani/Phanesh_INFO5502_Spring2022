brennan appeals from the district court order dismissing his action in favor of arbitration.opus bank cross appeals from the district court implicit denial of its motion to seal brennan complaint,and the district court denial of its motion for reconsideration as moot.we have jurisdiction of both appeals pursuant to.we affirm the district court dismissal in favor of arbitration,but we reverse the district court denial of opus bank motion for reconsideration as moot.because the district court has inherent supervisory authority over its own records even after final judgment and the filing of a notice of appeal,we remand for the district court to decide opus bank motion to seal in the first instance.
brennan became the executive vice president and director for strategy and corporate development for opus bank in december,when he signed an employment agreement with opus bank.the employment agreement described brennan duties in section as those customary,appropriate and reasonable executive duties normally assigned to a person with such position at other similarly situated banks,including such duties as are delegated to him from time to time by the chief executive officer,stephen gordon,to whom he was to report directly.
for the first several months of his employment,brennan performed duties that he considered consistent with his position as executive vice president.but by late,brennan said that he was beginning to be excluded from many of the activities he had been hired to perform,and that his involvement in important business transactions had steadily diminished.brennan also alleged that although it was his responsibility to formulate opus bank strategic and financial objectives,gordon began dismissing or rejecting brennan analyses of the bank financial condition,and frequently relegate d mundane tasks to brennan that were not customary,appropriate,and reasonable executive duties normally assigned to a person with such position at other similarly situated banks.
the employment agreement contained a provision granting brennan the right to terminate his employment for good reason,whereupon he would be entitled to a generous severance payment.good reason was defined in the employment agreement to include a material change in brennan function,duties,or responsibilities with the bank,that would cause brennan position to become one of substantially lesser responsibility or scope from the position and attributes described in s ection above,unless consented to by brennan.believing that such a material change had occurred with respect to his work responsibilities,brennan sent opus bank a notice of termination with good reason on march.
opus bank subsequently placed brennan on administrative investigatory suspension while it retained an independent attorney to investigate whether brennan termination was in fact for good reason,and whether,based upon brennan failure to attend certain mandatory meetings,opus bank could terminate brennan for cause,as defined in the employment agreement.after receiving the attorney report,opus bank wrote a letter to brennan on april,notifying him that it was adopting the attorney conclusions that brennan did not have good reason to terminate his employment,but that opus bank also lacked cause to terminate brennan.nonetheless,opus bank told brennan it was construing his march notice of termination as a voluntary resignation,and that brennan therefore was not entitled to a severance payment or other termination benefits.
in january of the following year,brennan sued opus bank in federal district court under diversity jurisdiction.see.brennan complaint alleged that opus bank breached the employment agreement and wrongfully terminated him in violation of both california and washington state law.it also alleged that opus bank and gordon unlawfully withheld wages in violation of washington state law.
brennan complaint acknowledged that section of the employment agreement the arbitration clause,entitled dispute resolution procedures,was a mandatory arbitration provision which provided in relevant part except with respect to any claim for equitable relief any controversy or claim arising out of this employment agreement or brennan employment with the bank or the termination thereof shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the american arbitration association.nevertheless,brennan argued that his causes of action should be resolved by litigation,rather than arbitration,because the arbitration clause was both procedurally and substantively unconscionable,and therefore unenforceable.
opus bank responded to brennan complaint with a motion to seal and to strike brennan complaint,as well as a motion to compel arbitration under the arbitration clause and the federal arbitration act faa.in its motion to compel arbitration,opus bank argued that both the employment dispute and the question whether the arbitration clause was unconscionable had to be decided by the arbitrator instead of the court.opus bank argued that the unconscionability of the arbitration clause also had to be decided by the arbitrator because the employment agreement expressly incorporated the rules of the american arbitration association aaa,one of which states that the arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction,including any objections with respect to the validity of the arbitration agreement.incorporation of the aaa rules,opus bank contended,constituted clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties intended to have this unconscionability question decided by an arbitrator.the district court agreed with opus bank,and,applying federal arbitrability law,dismissed the action in favor of arbitration.
the district court dismissal order,however,did not address opus bank motion to seal brennan complaint.consequently,opus bank filed a motion for reconsideration of that issue,but the district court denied the motion as moot,given the district court earlier dismissal of the underlying action.
brennan timely appealed from the district court dismissal in favor of arbitration,and opus bank timely from the district court denial of opus bank motion for reconsideration regarding the request to seal brennan complaint.

brennan opening brief narrows his appeal to a single issue t he only issue before this court is who an arbitrator or a judge should decide whether the arbitration clause is unconscionable.the thrust of brennan appeal is that california law should apply,and that under california law the district court erred in concluding that the specific provision of the arbitration clause incorporating the aaa rules of arbitration delegation provision clearly and unmistakably delegated to an arbitrator the question whether the arbitration clause was unconscionable and therefore unenforceable.
we begin by addressing the applicable law.brennan argues that the district court erred in applying federal law rather than california law to decide this question.however,federal law governs the arbitrability question by default because the agreement is covered by the faa,mitsubishi motors soler chrysler plymouth,and the parties have not clearly and unmistakably designated that nonfederal arbitrability law applies,see cape flattery titan maritime,cir.
brennan concedes,as he must,that the faa governs the employment agreement because the faa applies to any contract,like the present one,evidencing a transaction involving commerce.for any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the faa,t he court is to make th e arbitrability determination by applying the federal substantive law of arbitrability,mitsubishi motors,at,absent clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties agreed to apply arbitrability law.cape flattery,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the employment agreement does not clearly and unmistakably indicate that california law of arbitrability should apply because it states only that any controversy of claim shall be settled by binding arbitration that in the event of arbitration the parties shall retain the rights of all discovery provided pursuant to the california code of civil procedure and that a ll rights,causes of action,remedies and defenses available under california law and equity as though in a court of law.while the employment agreement is clear that california procedural rules,rights,and remedies apply during arbitration,it says nothing about whether california law governs the question whether certain disputes are to be submitted to arbitration in the first place.
in cape flattery,we concluded that a similar arbitration provision which said a ny dispute arising under this agreement shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the english arbitration act,was ambiguous concerning whether english law also applies to determine whether a given dispute is arbitrable in the first place.at.the employment agreement at issue here is similarly ambiguous because it does not expressly state that california law governs the question of arbitrability.we therefore hold that federal arbitrability law applies in the present case.
brennan argument is not assisted by volt information sciences,board of trustees of leland stanford junior university.volt dealt with a dispute about whether the parties agreement to conduct arbitration in accordance with the procedural rules of the california arbitration act was enforceable even though the agreement fell within the scope of the faa.although the faa preempts state laws which require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration,id.at,quoting southland keating,the court held that the faa does not prevent the enforcement of agreements to arbitrate under different rules than those set forth in the faa itself,id.at emphasis added,because t here is no federal policy favoring arbitration under a certain set of procedural rules,id.at.however,the parties here do not dispute which procedural rules are applicable during arbitration.rather,they dispute which substantive law governs the arbitrability question.volt holding does not address this question and does not alter our conclusion that federal law of arbitrability applies.
brennan next contends that even if federal arbitrability law applies,the district court erred by concluding that incorporation of the aaa rules constitutes clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties intended to delegate the arbitrability question to an arbitrator.we disagree.
generally,in deciding whether to compel arbitration,a court must determine two gateway issues whether there is an agreement to arbitrate between the parties and whether the agreement covers the dispute.howsam dean witter reynolds,inc.however,these gateway issues can be expressly delegated to the arbitrator where the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise.at t,commc ns workers of,emphasis added see also first options of chicago,kaplan,u,courts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is clea r and unmistakabl e evidence that they did so.
the district court agreed with opus bank that under federal arbitrability law,the delegation provision clearly and unmistakably delegated to an arbitrator the question whether the arbitration clause was enforceable by expressly incorporating the aaa arbitration rules,one of which provides that the arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction,including any objections with respect to the validity of the arbitration agreement.
in oracle america,myriad group,cir we observed that v irtually every circuit to have considered the issue has determined that incorporation of the aaa arbitration rules constitutes clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability.id.at.we found this consensus persuasive in holding that incorporation of the uncitral rules which contain a jurisdictional provision almost identical to the one in the aaa rules constituted clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties agreed the arbitrator would decide arbitrability.id.at.now that the question regarding incorporation of the aaa rules is squarely before us,we hold that incorporation of the aaa rules constitutes clear and unmistakable evidence that contracting parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability.
the issue of the sophistication of the parties was raised at oral argument.our holding today should not be interpreted to require that the contracting parties be sophisticated or that the contract be commercial before a court may conclude that incorporation of the aaa rules constitutes clear and unmistakable evidence of the parties intent.thus,our holding does not foreclose the possibility that this rule could also apply to unsophisticated parties or to consumer contracts.indeed,the vast majority of the circuits that hold that incorporation of the aaa rules constitutes clear and unmistakable evidence of the parties intent do so without explicitly limiting that holding to sophisticated parties or to commercial contracts.see petrofac,dynmcdermott petroleum operations,cir republic of arg.bg grp.plc,fallo high tech,cir qualcomm nokia,terminix int l palmer ranch lp,cir contec remote solution,cir awuah coverall,cir.
nevertheless,as in oracle america,we limit our holding to the facts of the present case,which do involve an arbitration agreement between sophisticated parties.oracle america,at.indeed,it is undisputed that brennan was a sophisticated party,an experienced attorney and businessman a partner at jones day from to,and senior vice president,general counsel,and deputy chief legal officer of washington mutual from to,who executed an employment contract with opus bank,a sophisticated,regional financial institution.
of course,the contract at issue here is an employment contract,not a commercial contract like the one at issue in oracle america.circuit city stores,adams,holding that the faa covers not only commercial contracts but also employment contracts,implying that there is a difference between the two see also genmar holdings,cir stating that i t is beyond dispute that employment contracts differ significantly from commercial contracts,and that the differences between the two militate against implying a covenant of good faith and fair dealing to employment contracts.however,we conclude that the differences between the employment agreement at issue here and the commercial contract at issue in oracle america are irrelevant to our determination whether these parties incorporation of the aaa rules shows a clear and unmistakable intent to delegate arbitrability to an arbitrator.we therefore hold that the district court did not err in concluding that these parties incorporation of the aaa rules constituted clear and unmistakable evidence of their intent to submit the arbitrability dispute to arbitration.but we need not decide nor do we decide here the effect if any of incorporating aaa arbitration rules into consumer contracts or into contracts of any nature between unsophisticated parties.oracle america,at.
brennan contends that despite the delegation provision,the arbitration clause itself removes the unconscionability question from its scope because it carves out any claim for equitable relief and unconscionability is an equitable matter under california law.we disagree for two reasons.first,although courts have held that a defendant reliance on an arbitration clause to avoid litigation is an equitable defense,see,mediterranean,ssangyong,cir,it is not a claim for equitable relief.second,accepting brennan argument would directly contradict the fact that brennan and opus bank clearly and unmistakably delegated the unconscionability determination to the arbitrator in the delegation provision located in that very same arbitration clause.
because a court must enforce an agreement that,as here,clearly and unmistakably delegates arbi
