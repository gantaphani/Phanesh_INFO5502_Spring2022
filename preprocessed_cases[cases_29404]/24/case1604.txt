george bekov,william ellis,and the ellis eye and laser center of northern california appeal from an order denying their motion to compel arbitration,arguing that the terms of the arbitration agreement expressly apply to joinder of parties such as bekov,who are necessary for a complete settlement of the dispute.we reverse the order and direct the trial court to refer the issue of bekov joinder in the arbitration to the arbitrator.
background 
the facts of this case arise out of circumstances that are closely related to a previous appeal in chou ellis july,nonpub.opn.chou.in the previous case,plaintiffs chou and long hoang filed a class action complaint against william ellis for damages arising out of laser eye surgery allegedly performed by ellis with unapproved illegally imported ophthalmic lasers.in that case,we reversed the trial court denial of ellis request to arbitrate the dispute because the allegations of the complaint arose out of the furnishing of professional services within the broad scope of the agreement to arbitrate pursuant to broughton cigna healthplans cal th,d.
this complaint,also cast as a class action,was first filed while the appeal was pending in chou.there are several named plaintiffs including long hoang,who was also a plaintiff in chou.defendants are ellis,his laser eye center corporation,and george bekov,doing business as spectrum international,who was employed by ellis to service the ophthalmic lasers.as the following description will show,the two actions involve intertwined and related issues arising out of laser eye surgery performed by ellis.
the complaint in chou,filed by the same attorney who represents plaintiffs in the second case,named only ellis and his company as defendants.the plaintiff class identified in chou included all persons that ellis had performed refractive eye surgery on using certain excimer lasers.
the general allegations in the chou complaint stated that ellis advertised laser eye surgery procedures and performed those procedures on plaintiffs using specifically described ophthalmic lasers manufactured by summit technology and misrepresented that the lasers were approved medical devices.
the chou complaint alleged violations of the unfair competition law ucl bus,and the consumers legal remedies act clra,consisting of performing laser eye surgery on plaintiffs using ophthalmic lasers that were not approved by the federal food and drug administration,contrary to representations made to plaintiffs and which rendered the lasers adulterated device s within the provisions of federal law.the chou complaint requested damages as well as injunctive relief,disgorgement of profits,restitution,and punitive damages.
the first amended complaint in this action added bekov as a defendant in seven of the eight causes of action.like chou,the plaintiff class here is described as including all persons that ellis had performed refractive eye surgery on using certain excimer lasers.it added a class of ellis patients who had received refractive eye surgery using excimer lasers that bekov had maintained.it also alleged that ellis maintains offices in various cities where he advertised and performed laser eye surgery on plaintiffs using excimer lasers manufactured by summit technology.ellis employed bekov as an independent contractor to service,maintain,repair and calibrate excimer lasers used by defendant ellis to perform refractive eye surgery on plaintiffs and class members.bekov negligently serviced,maintained,repaired or calibrated the lasers in a manner that injured plaintiffs.bekov violated provisions of the business and professions code because he used the titles professional engineer,consulting engineer,electrical engineer or combinations of these words without having a license from the board for professional engineers.the complaint echoes the first cause of action in the chou complaint by alleging that defendants knowingly serviced,maintained,repaired,altered and calibrated the excimer lasers so that the excimer lasers were adulterated medical devices in violation of the federal food drug and cosmetics act 
the complaint also alleged that ellis and bekov committed violations of the uca and clra and other statutes by falsely representing that they were registered engineers.plaintiffs alleged that bekov participated in the fraud committed by ellis plaintiffs also accused bekov of aiding and abetting ellis in defrauding ellis eye surgery patients.the complaint requested injunctive relief damages.
plaintiffs in this case and in chou executed a arbitration agreement in accordance with the provisions of code of civil procedure section.the particular contract used in all cases provided,in relevant part,as follows it is understood that any dispute as to medical malpractice,that is as to whether any medical services rendered under this contract were unnecessary or unauthorized or were improperly,negligently or incompetently rendered,will be determined by submission to arbitration the agreement applied to any and all claims involving persons bound by this agreement whether those claims are brought in tort,contract or otherwise.the agreement specified that it applied to claims against the physician and any consenting substitute physician,as well as partnership,professional corporation,employees,partners,heirs,assigns or personal representatives.
most important to the resolution of this appeal is the statement i also hereby consent to the intervention or joinder in the arbitration proceeding of all parties relevant to a full and complete settlement of any dispute arbitrated under this agreement,as set forth in the medical arbitration rules rules for the arbitration of hospital and medical fee disputes.
after our decision reversing the denial of arbitration in chou,ellis and bekov filed a motion to compel arbitration and consolidate this action with chou.on november,the trial court denied the request for consolidation the court granted the motion to compel arbitration as to ellis alone.it denied arbitration of all issues relating to bekov and of all causes of action for injunctive relief on january,ellis and bekov appealed from the november order denying the motion to compel arbitration 
discussion 
ellis and bekov argue that the express terms of the arbitration agreement contemplated joinder of parties such as bekov,to ensure a complete settlement of disputes subject to the agreement.they also argue that the trial court erred in failing to clarify that the arbitrator should decide the substantive merits of the claims seeking injunctive relief and that the court improperly refused to consolidate the actions.
respondents challenge two of those contentions,reasoning that bekov was not a signatory to the arbitration agreements and therefore can not compel arbitration.respondents contend that appellants request that we order the arbitrator to determine the merits of the injunctive relief claims is premature and not raised in the proceedings below.respondents,however,join in appellants request for reversal of the order denying consolidation.
we agree with respondents that it is not appropriate to order arbitration of the merits of the dispute with bekov.but respondents,as parties to the arbitration agreement,can not prevent ellis,another party to the agreement,from obtaining arbitration of the issue of whether or not bekov presence is relevant to a full and complete settlement of any dispute within the subject matter of the arbitration agreement.the terms of the arbitration agreement reflect that the parties agreed that the arbitrator,not the court,shall determine issues of joinder and intervention.we will reverse the order denying the motion to compel arbitration and direct that the issues of joinder or intervention be referred to arbitration.we agree with respondents view of the issue regarding the substantive merits of the injunctive relief causes of action and will take no action on that request.we also reverse the order denying consolidation.
scope of arbitration depends on the agreement of the parties 
in our previous opinion in chou,we determined that the scope of the arbitration agreement between ellis and his
