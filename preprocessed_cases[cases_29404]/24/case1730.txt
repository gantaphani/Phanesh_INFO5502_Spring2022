in this appeal,we hold that contracting parties who provide for the arbitration of disputes in their agreements need submit to arbitration only those claims that touch on the legal rights created by their contract.the court of chancery dismissed fiduciary duty claims brought by minority stockholders of a delaware corporation on the ground that the transactions giving rise to the stockholders causes of action were also the factual basis for contract claims relating to the underwriting agreement through which they acquired their interests in the company.the vice chancellor reasoned that the arbitration clause the stockholders placed in their underwriting agreement required them to bring all of their claims relating to the transactions,including the fiduciary duty claims,before the arbitration tribunal.
we disagree with this holding because the fiduciary duty claims the minority stockholders asserted are not based on the rights and obligations created by the underlying agreement that required arbitration of claims arising out of or in connection with the agreement itself.when contracting parties provide for the arbitration of claims in their agreement,the arbitration provision,no matter how broadly drafted,can reach only the claims within the scope of the contract,and the fiduciary duty claims here are beyond that scope.
accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the court or chancery dismissing the minority stockholders claims and we remand the matter to the court of chancery for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
mirror image internet,is a delaware corporation involved in designing hardware to speed information retrieval and transmission across the internet.mirror image was formed in as a subsidiary of mirror ab,a swedish corporation.
as a struggling enterprise,mirror image required frequent infusions of capital to stay operational.mirror ab could not,on its own,meet the financing needs of its subsidiary.by,mirror ab had to seek outside investors who could provide enough funds so that mirror image could meet its obligations and stave off bankruptcy.
mirror image found two investors.in march of,mirror image entered into an agreement the underwriting agreement with a corporation that is currently known as xcelera,and plenteous.xcelera is a cayman islands holding company.plenteous is a panamanian corporation.the underwriting agreement provided mirror image million in capital,million of which would be contributed by xcelera and the balance provided by plenteous.once the agreement closed,xcelera became the controlling stockholder with a interest in mirror image.plenteous and two other stockholders,grandsen,and gillberg who were mirror ab stockholders,were given the right to participate in the offering.they provided the balance of the million and became minority stockholders in the corporation along with mirror ab.in addition to setting the price and quantity terms of the stock offering,the agreement granted xcelera and plenteous the right to appoint directors to the mirror image board.mirror ab retained the right to appoint one director.finally,the parties agreed that any dispute,controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with this agreement,or the breach,termination or invalidity thereof,shall be settled by arbitration in sweden 
the relationship among the parties deteriorated quickly after the stock offering closed.after gaining control of the corporation,xcelera initiated a series of transactions that it claims were designed to benefit mirror image.the minority stockholders believe xcelera has benefitted only itself.viewing these transactions as part of a scheme to dilute their minority interest,mirror ab formed a litigation construct,parfi holding ab,which proceeded,along with plenteous,grandsen,and gillberg,to challenge xcelera actions 
the first two undertakings that raised concern for parfi occurred in april and july of.the transactions involved subscriptions totaling over thousand shares of mirror image stock,ostensibly intended to raise million that mirror image required to continue operations.mirror image issued all of the stock to xcelera,boosting xcelera holdings from to of the corporation equity.parfi alleges that the subscriptions were unnecessary and designed solely to allow xcelera to strengthen its hold on mirror image by purchasing the stock at a price below fair market value.xcelera allegedly did not provide the minority stockholders sufficient time to decide whether to subscribe and ignored attempts by other stockholders who attempted to exercise their right to participate in the subscriptions.
in the third transaction,xcelera allegedly used its control of the mirror image board to arrange for a private placement of convertible preferred stock the convertible preferred stock offering or november offering.according to parfi,the offering was designed to permit xcelera to capitalize on the pending announcement that would enter into a strategic alliance with mirror image.the strategic alliance involved a million investment in the by the computer giant.parfi claims that the convertible preferred offering allowed xcelera to purchase mirror image stock at a bargain price before the market received the information and improved its stock price.
in the fourth transaction parfi contends that xcelera usurped a corporate opportunity that rightfully belonged to mirror image.in march of,exodus communications entered into an agreement to buy over million shares of mirror image stock the exodus transaction in exchange,mirror image would receive million in cash and over million shares of exodus stock.xcelera arranged for exodus to pay of the consideration directly to xcelera since it owned the vast majority of mirror image stock.xcelera has allegedly exchanged at an enormous profit its diluted stock for cash and exodus stock.
xcelera has profited greatly from its investment in mirror image.the price of xcelera stock rose from approximately per share in july of to per share by february of.believing xcelera has reaped this gain at the expense of its fellow mirror image investors,parfi has sought relief based on its dual legal relationship with xcelera.parfi has brought a contract claim against xcelera as a fellow investor who made certain assurances in the underwriting agreement.separately,parfi asserts that,as a controlling stockholder,xcelera has breached fiduciary duties owed to parfi under delaware corporation law.
arbitration proceedings in sweden 
abiding by the terms of the underwriting agreement,parfi submitted its breach of contract claims to arbitration in sweden.the contract claims parfi presented at arbitration did not involve a breach of any specific provision of the underwriting agreement.parfi sought to prove that xcelera led its fellow underwriters to rely on certain assumptions that induced them to enter into the contract.according to parfi,xcelera assured its fellow underwriters that the agreement provided only an interim solution to mirror image financing problem and that xcelera would,on behalf of the other investors,arrange for subsequent stock offerings at a much higher price.xcelera,parfi claimed,promised to use its controlling interest only to raise additional capital at a favorable rate of return and assured parfi that the controlling interest would not be used to dilute its investment.plenteous also submitted to the arbitrators an in which a xcelera board member promised that xcelera would seek plenteous consent before mirror image took any corporate action.parfi and plenteous argued that xcelera conduct amounted to a failure of these assumptions which invalidated the agreement and entitled the investors to damages for the resulting dilution of their investment.
parfi did not base any of its arbitration claims on its status as a stockholder of mirror image.the arbitrators decision specifically noted that 
v arious corporate actions in mirror image after the underwriting agreement,undertaken under the laws of the state of delaware,are presently subject to litigation before the courts of that state the claimants have not based their case in the present arbitration on or presented evidence regarding delaware law.also,they have not invoked the duties of xcelera as majority shareholder 
the arbitration tribunal issued its decision on september.parfi and plenteous could not convince the tribunal that xcelera entered into the underwriting agreement with an intent to dilute the interests of the other investors.the tribunal held that the agreement was meant to provide a investment in capital,and any plan to secure financing was not a basic assumption upon which the agreement was based the tribunal awarded damages to plenteous,however,because the arbitrators found that plenteous participation in the agreement was based on xcelera assurance that it would seek plenteous consent before engaging mirror image in any corporate action.the tribunal determined that the april and july subscriptions were corporate actions,and the tribunal awarded plenteous damages for any resulting dilution in their interest in mirror image 
proceedings in the court of chancery 
in november of,a few months after submitting its contract claims to arbitration,parfi filed an action in the court of chancery alleging that xcelera breached fiduciary duties it owed to mirror image stockholders.parfi alleged various claims of fraud,conspiracy,implied contract and misappropriation of a corporate opportunity against xcelera and the xcelera directors who sit on the mirror image board.
xcelera responded with motions to dismiss based on lack of personal jurisdiction and failure to submit the fiduciary duty claims to mandatory arbitration as provided in the underwriting agreement.the court of chancery granted xcelera motion for summary judgment and dismissed parfi claims,holding that the broad arbitration clause in the underwriting agreement required parfi to submit for arbitration all claims related to the series of transactions that were challenged in sweden with respect to the central issue,the court held that the fiduciary duty claims were in connection with the underwriting agreement and were,therefore,mandatorily arbitrable thereunder.
in the alternative,the vice chancellor dismissed xcelera motion to dismiss all counts against it for lack of personal jurisdiction denied mirror image motion to dismiss plaintiffs derivative claims granted defendants motions to dismiss the fraud claims as well as the claims against the director defendants for aiding and abetting fraud for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted required the complaint be amended to change the derivative constructive fraud claims into counts for breach of fiduciary duty granted defendants motions to dismiss the civil conspiracy claims and granted the defendants motions to dismiss plaintiffs breach of contract claim against xcelera,as well as their motion to dismiss plaintiffs tortious interference with contract claim against the director defendants 
issues on appeal 
parfi claims the court of chancery erred by dismissing its fiduciary duty claims as subject to arbitration because of the arising out of or in connection with language of the underwriting agreement by finding that two of the plaintiffs,grandsen and gillberg,were bound by the arbitration clause even though they did not sign the agreement and by finding that the individual director defendants could seek the benefit of the arbitration clause even though they did not sign the underwriting agreement accordingly,parfi asks this court to reverse the trial court judgment and permit plaintiffs to proceed with their claims in the court of chancery.we need to reach only the first issue on appeal to resolve the matter before us.
the underwriting agreement does not require parfi and plenteous to submit their fiduciary duty claims to arbitration 
this court reviews de novo the court of chancery interpretation of the underwriting agreement as well as the application of relevant law 
parfi argues that the fiduciary duty claims it filed in the court of chancery were not in connection with the underwriting agreement and,therefore,these claims fall outside the mandatory arbitration provided for in section of the contract.xcelera rests its on the vice chancellor interpretation of the arbitration clause as an obligation so broad in scope that it required parfi to assert its fiduciary duty claims along with its contract claims.
when the arbitrability of a claim is disputed,the court is faced with two issues.first,the court must determine whether the arbitration clause is broad or narrow in scope.second,the court must apply the relevant scope of the provision to the asserted legal claim to determine whether the claim falls within the scope of the contractual provisions that require arbitration.if the court is evaluating a narrow arbitration clause,it will ask if the cause of action pursued in court directly relates to a right in the contract.if the arbitration clause is broad in scope,the court will defer to arbitration on any issues that touch on contract rights or contract performance.this is a case of first impression in delaware 
the arbitration clause in the underwriting agreement establishes a broad scope 
the parties do not dispute that section of the underwriting agreement has a broad scope.by agreeing to submit to arbitration any dispute,controversy,or claim arising out of or in connection with the underwriting agreement,xcelera,mirror ab,and plenteous have signaled an intent to arbitrate all possible claims that touch on the rights set forth in their contract the issue is whether the arbitrable contract claims are connected to the fiduciary duty claims that are independently grounded on delaware corporation law.
the fiduciary duty claims are beyond the scope of the arbitration clause 
the vice chancellor applied the arbitration clause to the fiduciary duty claims because he read the contract term to require the resolution of claims related to a common set of underlying facts in a single forum.we disagree with this interpretation of what mirror ab,plenteous,and xcelera intended to provide for in their contract.the issue is whether the fiduciary duty claims implicate any of the rights and obligations provided for in the underwriting agreement.stated differently,do the fiduciary duty claims depend on the existence of the underwriting agreement 
when parties to an agreement decide that they will submit their claims to arbitration,delaware courts strive to honor the reasonable expectations of the parties and ordinarily resolve any doubt as to arbitrability in favor of arbitration nevertheless,arbitration is a mechanism of dispute resolution created by contract an arbitration clause,no matter how broadly construed,can extend only so far as the series of obligations set forth in the underlying agreement thus,arbitration clauses should be applied only to claims that bear on the duties and obligations under the agreement the policy that favors alternate dispute resolution mechanisms,such as arbitration,does not trump basic principles of contract interpretation.
when xcelera,mirror ab,and plenteous agreed to the arbitration provision in the underwriting agreement they did not commit to bring into arbitration every possible breach of duty that could occur between the parties the arbitration clause signals only an intent to arbitrate matters that touch on the rights and performance related to the contract the term arising out of or in connection with must be considered in that light.the court of chancery should have concentrated on the similarity of the separate rights pursued by plaintiffs under both the contract and the independent fiduciary duties rather than the similarity of the conduct that led to potential claims for both the contract and fiduciary breaches of duty 
parfi can maintain an action based on the alleged breaches of the independent set of fiduciary duties that xcelera owes mirror image stockholders even though the claims arise from some or all of the same facts that relate to the transactions that provided the basis for its contract claims xcelera fiduciary duties to mirror image consist of a set of rights and obligations that are independent of any contract and need be submitted to arbitration only if the claims based on fiduciary duties touch
