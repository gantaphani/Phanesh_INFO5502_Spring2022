introduction 
the issue presented by this appeal is the recoverability of costs available under code of civil procedure section following an american arbitration association aaa award that denied requests by both sides for damages,costs,and attorney fees 
attorney alan heimlich attorney filed this action seeking payment of unpaid fees from his client shiraz shivji client.client filed an answer and,one year later,asked for arbitration pursuant to his retainer agreement with attorney.the trial court compelled contractual arbitration that resulted in no recovery by either side.six days after the arbitration award,client asked the arbitrator to award him costs under section because attorney recovery was less favorable than a section offer that client made two months before demanding arbitration.when the arbitrator responded that he no longer had jurisdiction to take further action,client asked the trial court to confirm the arbitration award and to award him section costs as well.the court confirmed the arbitration award but,relying on maaso signer th maaso,determined that client failed to make a timely section claim to the arbitrator and denied client request for section costs.client has appealed from this order after judgment.
we reject attorney suggestion that client should have presented his section request for costs to an arbitrator before the arbitration award was rendered,because an offer which is not accepted can not be given in evidence upon the trial or arbitration,subd.b.further,we find that in the course of his request to confirm the arbitration award client established that the arbitrator had refused to hear any evidence of attorney rejection of client section offer.thus,we conclude that client timely presented his section claim to the arbitrator,the arbitrator should have reached the merits of that claim,and the arbitrator refusal to hear evidence of the section offer warranted partially vacating the arbitration award.
therefore,we will reverse the order confirming the arbitration award and direct that an order be entered partially vacating the arbitration award to allow a determination of the section request by the arbitrator or,if that avenue is not availing,by the court.
ii.evidence on motion 
a.the arbitration agreement 
in august,client retained attorney to protect client intellectual property.the retainer agreement included the following arbitration provision.
arbitration.the client and our firm agree that all disputes or claims of any nature whatsoever,including but not limited to those relating to our fees or the adequacy or appropriateness of our services,shall be resolved by private and final binding arbitration before either jams or the american arbitration association in san francisco,california in accordance with their rules the client may choose one of these two providers.the arbitrator must decide all disputes in accordance with california law and shall have power to decide all matters,including arbitrability.capitalization omitted.
commencement of this lawsuit 
for a number of years after being retained,attorney assisted client with filing patent applications and forming a corporation,giotti,to hold the patents.a dispute arose over attorney fees.notwithstanding the above arbitration provision,attorney filed a form complaint in the santa clara county superior court on september,seeking recovery for unpaid invoices the complaint alleged a breach of contract and a common count for services rendered and an open book account.attorney prayed for damages of,interest on the damages,and costs of suit,but not attorney fees.client filed a form answer to the complaint that alleged affirmative defenses.client prayed for costs of suit and reasonable attorney fees,despite the fact that the retainer agreement did not provide for the prevailing party in any dispute to recover attorney fees or costs 
on september,client sent attorney an offer to compromise the action by allowing a judgment providing that client pay the amount of thirty thousand and one dollars,including all taxable costs of suit to date of acceptance,with each party to bear its own attorney fees and costs.
on november,the trial court denied client motion for summary judgment.on november,the court denied attorney motion for judgment on the pleadings,except as to affirmative defenses through,and.the trial court also vacated a december trial date.on january,attorney filed a first amended complaint that added two causes of action for fraud and another for declaratory relief.
c.the arbitration proceedings 
one year after client filed his answer,on november,he demanded arbitration of the dispute on an aaa form entitled commercial arbitration rules.attorney objected to client demand.
on april,in response to attorney objection,an aaa arbitrator decided that it was up to the trial court to determine whether client had waived arbitration by participating in this action.on may,the trial court granted client motion to compel arbitration and stay this action pending arbitration.
in the arbitration proceedings,client filed a statement of claims.client alleged that attorney had achieved approval of only one of client patent claims.client paid attorney between september,and august.in september,client incorporated giotti and,between november,and may,giotti paid attorney for his services.client accused attorney of unauthorized flat fee billing,double billing,unilateral fee increases,delayed billing,and inflated billing.client alleged breaches of contract,fiduciary duty,and the duty of good faith and fair dealing,and also alleged unlawful business practices.client requested restitution for unjust enrichment,a refund of amounts paid,punitive damages,and all costs of suit incurred herein.there is no indication that client specifically claimed entitlement to costs under section either in his statement of claims or any other pleading preceding the arbitrator decision.
attorney filed an counterclaim in arbitration that restated the five causes of action in his amended civil complaint and added claims for indemnification and comparative fault.attorney sought to recover for unpaid invoices,attorney fees,costs of this arbitration and the lawsuit in santa clara county per civil code section,and attorney costs of the lawsuit and this arbitration per california code of civil procedure section.
after hearing six days of evidence,the aaa arbitrator issued an decision on march.the award was titled as from a commercial arbitration tribunal.the arbitrator determined that attorney helped client form a corporation,giotti,to which client transferred his interest in four patents.after late november,an relationship was created between attorney and giotti.attorney was awarded nothing on his counterclaims against client because t he legal services provided by attorney from late november,through may,were performed for the benefit of giotti,and the obligation to pay for those services rested with giotti,which attorney had not named as a party in his complaint or his counterclaim.
the arbitrator awarded client on his claims against attorney.as to arbitration expenses,t he administrative fees and expenses of the aaa totaling shall be borne as incurred and the arbitration compensation totaling shall be borne as incurred.each side will bear their own attorneys fees and costs.capitalization omitted.as to prearbitration expenses,the arbitrator ruled that,while attorney had breached the arbitration agreement by filing this lawsuit,client could have remedied the breach by raising the issue immediately.accordingly,both parties are at fault for any expenses incurred in that litigation.the award also stated,this award is intended to be a complete disposition of all claims and counterclaims submitted to this arbitration.all claims not expressly granted herein are hereby denied.
six days after the award,on march,client sent an to the arbitrator stating in part,there is one open matter that has to do with the award of costs pursuant to ccp and the procedure to follow regarding the same.our understanding is that the demand for an award for recovery of these costs should be submitted to the arbitrator rather than directly to the court.your confirmation of this procedure will be appreciated.
the arbitrator responded by the following day.counsel,once i issued m y final award i no longer have jurisdiction to take any further action in this matter.as discussed in the award,whatever may have been the costs,fees,associated with the santa clara litigation were to be borne by the parties 
motion seeking costs and confirmation of award 
on april,client filed a motion asking the court to resume jurisdiction in the case,confirm the arbitration award,and grant interest and costs pursuant to ccp.client motion explained that the arbitrator had rejected his request to award costs under section due to a lack of jurisdiction.client submitted a memorandum of costs totaling,which included witness fees of,aaa fees of,and deposition costs of attorney opposed this request and moved to strike or tax costs.client filed a reply.
by order dated may,the court confirmed the arbitration award,notwithstanding consideration of any motions pursuant to california code of civil procedure.
at a hearing on costs on june,the court tentative ruling was i came to the conclusion that the leading case cited by plaintiff was on point and the one that the court should follow,is the maaso vs signer case,th.basically,when the matter went to the arbitrator,it was i ncumbent upon the defendant to raise the ccp issue with the arbitrator on a timely basis.in the view of the arbitrator,it got raised late after the award.the court took the matter under submission and later the same day denied the remainder of client motion,granted attorney motion to tax costs,and ordered each party to bear their own costs and attorney fees as ordered by the arbitrator.
iii.awarding costs under section after arbitration 
applicable statutory schemes 
three statutory schemes,all in the code of civil procedure,are relevant to our analysis of the recoverability of costs in judicial proceedings to confirm,correct,or vacate arbitration awards.one is the general scheme authorizing recovery of costs of litigation beginning with section.another is california arbitration act caa which begins at section.the third is section.
chapter of title of part of the code of civil procedure governs the recovery of costs of litigation.section,subdivision b sets forth the general rule that the party prevailing in any action or proceeding is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs section,subdivision a identifies which party has prevailed in four sets of circumstances and otherwise leaves the determination of the prevailing party to the trial court discretion.desaulles community hosp.of monterey peninsula cal th.section was enacted in to codify in one place existing law concerning which costs are allowable.davis,cal th,disapproved on another ground by williams chino valley independent fire dist.cal th.it is worth noting that section,subdivision a currently includes as allowable costs attorney fees,when authorized by a contract.b statute.c law,as many published cases about arbitration costs involve attorney fees 
section is understood to be an exception to section.subdivision a of section states,the costs allowed under sections and shall be withheld or augmented as provided in this section.scott of california blount,cal th scott explained section modifies the general rule of section that only the prevailing party recovers its costs.scott,at.it is the very essence of section that,to encourage both the making and the acceptance of reasonable settlement offers,a losing defendant whose settlement offer exceeds the judgment is treated for purposes of postoffer costs as if it were the prevailing party.scott,at.the purpose of section is to encourage settlement by providing a strong financial disincentive to a party whether it be a plaintiff or a defendant who fails to achieve a better result than that party could have achieved by accepting his or her opponent settlement offer.this is the stick.the carrot is that by awarding costs to the putative settler the statute provides a financial incentive to make reasonable settlement offers.scott,at pilimai famers ins.exchange cal th,pilimai.
in,section was amended to authorize arbitrators as well as courts to impose costs on parties whose arbitration awards were no more favorable than settlement offers they had rejected these amendments superseded the holding in woodard southern cal.permanente medical group d woodard that section and civil code section do not apply to contractual arbitration.id.at.
section,part of the caa,specifically makes the cost award provisions of sections and applicable in judicial proceedings to compel contractual arbitration and to confirm,correct,or vacate contractual arbitration awards.section states,the court shall award costs upon any judicial proceeding under this title as provided in chapter commencing with section of title of part of this code.section has been the basis for awarding litigation costs to parties who succeeded in resisting motions to compel arbitration and also in obtaining confirmation and vacation of arbitration awards 
costs recoverable in judicial proceedings 
though parties who prevail in judicial proceedings to confirm an arbitration award are entitled to recover the costs for those proceedings,those parties have usually been denied recovery of their arbitration costs despite prevailing in the arbitration based on direct or indirect reliance on section of the caa,which states unless the arbitration agreement otherwise provides or the parties to the arbitration otherwise agree,each party to the arbitration shall pay his pro rata share of the expenses and fees of the neutral arbitrator,together with other expenses of the arbitration incurred or approved by the neutral arbitrator,not including counsel fees or witness fees or other expenses incurred by a party for his own benefit.we will review this precedent and explain how the california supreme court has established that section creates an exception to section.
in dickinson kaiser foundation hospitals d dickinson a patient who prevailed against a hospital in medical malpractice arbitration asked the court to confirm his award and also correct it to the extent the arbitrators denied him recovery of costs.the second district court of appeal div.five determined that an award of arbitration costs was precluded by section.dickinson,at.the court explained in arbitration matters,the legislature has carefully distinguished between costs incurred in the arbitration and costs incurred in superior court to enforce an arbitration award.compare,with,see mcrae superior court d,mcrae tipton systron donner d,tipton citation.dickinson,at.
in austin allstate ins.th austin,after an insured obtained a damage award in arbitration under uninsured motorist coverage,the insured sought arbitration costs after having the award confirmed.id.at.the second district court of appeal div.two relied on the comparison of sections and in dickinson and tipton in concluding,here,the insurance policy,in harmony with section,specified that costs,including attorney fees,are to be paid by the party incurring them.fn.omitted thus,appellant is not entitled to recover her costs of arbitration unless a different rule is mandated by the uninsured motorist statute.id.at.the court distinguished cases from other jurisdictions,stating in none of the cases cited were there statutes similar to sections and indicating a legislative policy requiring parties to bear their own costs in arbitration.austin,at.
section does contemplate that the parties may make a different agreement about costs and they did so in dimarco chaney th dimarco,on which attorney relies.there a real estate seller prevailed in arbitration against a buyer and asked the trial court to correct the arbitration award,as the arbitrator had denied attorney fees and costs to the party he had found to have prevailed,despite a contract provision that the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees id.at.the second district court of appeal div.three concluded that the arbitrator had exceeded his powers in denying the request for attorney fees contractually due after finding one party had prevailed.id.at.the opinion quoted dickinson in contrasting sections and in order to conclude that the noticed motion procedure in section does not apply in arbitration proceedings.i t would appear the requirement of a noticed motion under section applies to a request in the superior court for attorney fees incurred in proceedings to correct,vacate or confirm an arbitration award,not to a request for attorney fees incurred in the underlying arbitration.the determination of a claim for attorney fees incurred in prosecuting or defending the underlying arbitration proceeding is within the purview of the arbitrator,rendering the procedure of section inapplicable.dimarco,at.
dimarco created a bifurcated procedure for recovering the costs of arbitration and litigation.once the arbitrator makes a determination as to the amount of attorney fees and costs to which chaney is entitled for the arbitration proceeding,chaney may move in the superior court to confirm the award.at that juncture,chaney may bring a noticed motion pursuant to sections and to recover the reasonable amount of the attorney fees and costs which she incurred in judicial proceedings.dimarco,supra,th at.dimarco reversed a trial court award of attorney fees attributable to the arbitration,and remanded the matter to the trial court with directions to remand to the arbitrator for a determination of the amount of attorney fees and costs to which chaney is entitled for the arbitration proceedings id.at.
later decisions have followed these earlier decisions without expressly invoking section.in nicastro,supra,th,on which client relies,a client had successfully resisted a motion by his real estate broker to vacate an arbitration award that had denied a commission to the broker.consistent with its dimarco decision,the second district court of appeal div.three concluded that the trial court erred in denying the prevailing client reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in postarbitration judicial proceedings under section.nicastro,at.
among this precedent,only dickinson and austin denied judicial awards of arbitration costs based on section.in the later decision of pilimai,supra,cal th,on which client relies,the california supreme court has cast doubt on those decisions or at least identified section as an exception to section,as it is to section.the supreme court answered four questions whether the provisions of section apply to uninsured motorist arbitrations pursuant to insurance code section whether the award of such costs,together with the arbitration award,can exceed an insurer maximum liability under insurance code section,subdivision p whether prejudgment interest pursuant to civil code section is available for an uninsured motorist arbitration and whether,if costs are available under.section,those costs include deposition and exhibit preparation costs.pilimai,at.
our concern with pilimai is about the court discussion of the types of costs that are recoverable postarbitration.in that case,in uninsured motorist arbitration proceedings an insured obtained a policy limit award that was silent on the subject of costs.pilimai,supra,cal th at.the insured asked a court to confirm the award and to award arbitration costs based on section.the trial court determined that the insured had prevailed under section,but denied a cost award because it would exceed the policy limit authorized in insurance code section,subdivision p.pilimai,at.the supreme court first determined that uninsured motorist arbitration,though mandated by statute,is still contractual arbitration to which section applies.pilimai,at.the court next determined that the maximum liability provision in the insurance code was not intended to limit cost awards under section.pilimai,at.
as to the types of costs available,pilimai reasoned that the costs available under section include the costs enumerated under section.pilimai,supra,cal th at.the insurer relied on austin in arguing that section precludes awarding arbitration costs for exhibits and depositions,while conceding the availability of expert witness costs as provided by section,subdivision d.pilimai,at.the court responded austin is distinguishable from the present case inasmuch as it concerned an award of costs pursuant to section.here,we address costs awarded pursuant to section,which now authorizes the award of costs after an arbitration.pilimai,at.section,subdivision d specifically authorizes a discretionary award of the costs of expert witnesses.reading this section with section,subdivision a,it is apparent that the types of costs available to an arbitration plaintiff are those costs available under section,as enumerated in section.pilimai,at.
moreover,all that section says about the kinds of costs at issue here expenses incurred by a party for his own benefit is that such costs are not to be included in the costs that the parties are to share.pilimai,supra,cal th at.w hile it is true,as the austin court observed,that no provision of the caa authorizes the award of arbitration costs absent agreement,section itself provides the statutory authorization for such costs.pilimai,at.we conclude that arbitration plaintiffs such as pilimai are eligible for deposition and exhibit preparation costs pursuant to section,subdivision d.pilimai,at.the supreme court remanded with directions to the trial court to determine the proper cost award.id.at our emphasis.
we recognize,as attorney points out,there was no argument in pilimai that the insured should have asked the arbitrator,rather than the court,for an award of costs under section.of course an appellate opinion must be understood in light of the issues presented to the court and it does not serve as authority for issues not considered.kinsman unocal cal th,fairbanks superior court cal th.pilimai establishes,at the very least,that trial courts have the authority in arbitration confirmation proceedings to award costs of arbitration under section when such a request has not been submitted to or decided by an arbitrator.it also establishes that whatever the true scope of section,section is a statutory exception to any requirement that parties bear their own arbitration costs.
c.the procedure for recovering arbitration costs 
cases predating and postdating pilimai have concluded for policy reasons that any award of arbitration costs should be made by the arbitrator without focusing on the timing or procedure of making such a request of the arbitrator.
as noted,the decision in dimarco,supra,th,where a request for an award of attorney fees had been presented to the arbitrator,was premised on the arbitrator being responsible for awarding any attorney fees due for prevailing in an arbitration.an award of attorney fees for the arbitration itself is within the arbitrator purview.id.at.thus,the issue of the amount of attorney fees and costs to be awarded for the arbitration proceeding was properly a matter for the arbitrator.ibid.further,not only is the determination as to the amount properly within the purview of the arbitrator,but we observe it is the arbitrator,not the trial court,which is best situated to determine the amount of reasonable attorney fees and costs to be awarded for the conduct of the arbitration proceeding.id.at.
corona,supra,th,on which attorney relies,did not mention dimarco or section in answering no to what it called an issue of first impression in california where a party is required by contract to submit a dispute to binding arbitration,but does not request that the arbitrator decide his entitlement to attorney fees even though that issue was part of the submission,may a trial court nonetheless determine that issue and make an award of fees and costs incurred in the arbitration corona,at.corona instead articulated a more general policy basis for its conclusion.the caa,particularly section,limits judicial review of arbitration awards to confirming,correcting,or vacating them.corona,supra,at.under the statutory scheme,a party failure to request the arbitrator to determine a particular issue within the scope of the arbitration is not a basis for vacating or correcting an award.ibid.such an interpretation of the applicable statutes promotes the legislature determination that there is a strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution,quoting moncharsh heily blase cal th.
in maaso,supra,th,on which the trial court and attorney relied,the second district court of appeal div.two followed dimarco and corona when a party sought a judicial award of arbitration costs under section.that case involved two contractual arbitrations of a medical malpractice claim,because the trial court had vacated the original arbitration award due to improper conduct by one of the.maaso,at.during the course of the second arbitration proceedings maaso counsel advised the panel that maaso had previously made a section offer that was rejected by the defendant,without stating the amount of the offer.maaso did not request that the arbitrators rule on the issue of section costs or seek to present evidence on the issue.maaso,at.the arbitrators award provided that costs and fees were according to the arbitration agreement.maaso petitioned the court to confirm the award and to award section costs.maaso,at.the trial court granted the defendant motion to tax costs,determining that all costs associated with the arbitration,including section costs,were within the sole purview of the arbitrators and not the court.id.at.
maaso quoted with approval what we have quoted above from corona regarding the limited scope of judicial review of arbitration awards and the policy served by requiring presentation of all issues to the arbitrator.maaso,supra,th at.the court reasoned,although maaso styled his petition as one to confirm the award,he essentially sought correction of the award by asking the court to add costs and interest not awarded by the panel,and which were in fact inconsistent with the panel award.id.at.the court noted the limited grounds for correcting an arbitration award in section and also stated,where the entitlement to attorney fees is within the scope of the issues submitted to binding arbitration,arbitrators do not exceed their powers by denying a party request for attorney fees,even where such a denial order would be reversible legal error if made by a court in civil litigation.moore first bank of san luis obispo cal th,moore moshonov walsh cal th,moshonov.maaso,at.
maaso also quoted from dimarco regarding the arbitrator being best situated to determine the amounts of reasonable attorney fees and expert witness costs and quoted with approval the trial court statement that it would encourage forum shopping if section costs after arbitration could be sought from either the arbitrator or a court.id.at.
the court also stated,the cases on which maaso relies do not assist him.in pilimai farmers ins.exchange cal th,the court was not called upon to decide whether it was for the court or the arbitrator to make an award of section costs,but to address other issues,including whether the provisions of section and section applied to uninsured motorist arbitrations mandated by insurance code section.maaso,supra,th at.
we do not agree with this indication that pilimai is irrelevant,but we do agree with the policy that when a party has agreed to an alternative dispute resolution mechanism like arbitration and has broadly agreed to submit all issues to arbitration,then the party should submit all issues to arbitration,including a request for costs under section.such a requirement serves the principle of arbitral finality.moshonow,supra,cal th at.
but we do not see in maaso a discussion of practical and legal restrictions on presenting a request for costs under section.under the terms of the statute,an arbitrator can not compare the favorability of an arbitration award to a rejected offer of settlement until after the award is made.a section determination necessarily must postdate an arbitration award 
in addition,we reiterate that the statute states in part,if the offer is not accepted prior to trial or arbitration or within days after it is made,whichever occurs first,it shall be deemed withdrawn,and can not be given in evidence upon the trial or arbitration,subd.b our emphasis.as client points out,a literal application of subdivision b would prohibit a party from submitting a request for section costs as an issue in advance of an arbitration hearing or even asking the arbitrator to reserve jurisdiction to make such an award.at oral argument,attorney proposed that,to comply with section,a party should ask the arbitrator to make an interim award without answering the arbitrator expected questions about why.we do not regard this as a reasonable,workable proposal.the best practice to avoid violating section,subdivision b would be to present evidence of a rejected section offer after an arbitration award resolves the underlying dispute.
relying on maaso,the trial court tentative ruling was that it was i ncumbent upon the defendant to raise the ccp issue with the arbitrator on a timely basis.attorney contends,the fact that client counsel did not properly place the ccp offer before the arbitrator before his award was issued and his jurisdiction extinguished is not the arbitrator or court fault.there are well established procedures to make the arbitrator aware of a ccp offer before the arbitrator renders a final award.client merely needed to inform the arbitrator at the brief,the closing brief or the reply brief or during the multiple days of arbitration hearings that there was a ccp section offer applicable to this case and that the arbitrator should issue an interim or partial final award retaining jurisdiction to review any ccp section offer and briefing on that subject after an award on the merits is issued.we do not believe that such a request or alert would be consistent with the evidentiary restriction in section,subdivision b.
we requested supplemental briefing about whether maaso considered this evidentiary restriction.attorney correctly notes that maaso,supra,th did quote this subdivision.id.at.however,as client points out,maaso did not discuss how this evidentiary restriction should affect the presentation of a request for section costs to an arbitrator.instead,the court simply concluded,maaso was not entitled to these costs and interest because he never requested these enhancements from the arbitrators.while maaso put the panel on notice that a section offer had been made,it is undisputed that he did not state the amount or seek to present evidence on the issue.maaso,at.contrary to attorney oral argument,maaso did not attempt to prescribe how to present a section request to an arbitrator.
the conundrum created by maaso has been noted in knight et,cal.practice guide alternative dispute resolution the rutter group.paragraph notes that a rejected offer is inadmissible in evidence.id.at.paragraph states,based on maaso,that t he arbitrator must be informed,however,of the rejected ccp offer prior to making a final award in order to impose any applicable costs penalties ibid.the comment in paragraph observes the statute does not address how this is to be accomplished the offer can not be received in evidence.the issue is jurisdictional because once a final award is made,arbitrators have no power to make a supplemental award on matters not covered by the original award citation.therefore,arbitrators should determine before making a final award whether either party rejected a offer from the other without considering who made the offer or the amount.if such an offer was made,at the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing,the arbitrator should expressly reserve jurisdiction to augment or withhold costs pursuant to ccp,if applicable.id.at.this comment appears to contemplate that arbitrators in every case will need to make a section inquiry sua sponte,as the parties are precluded from introducing such evidence.
unlike the practice guide,we believe there are solutions to this conundrum other than requiring all arbitrators to make sua sponte section inquiries.in comparable circumstances,namely requests for contractual attorney fees and not section costs,courts have recognized an arbitrator authority to make supplemental awards,either by generally awarding attorney fees with the amount to be determined later in a supplemental award britz,food dairy th,or by awarding fees and reserving jurisdiction to calculate the amount evans centerstone development th.
some opinions have even concluded that arbitrators have implicit authority to correct their own oversights in failing to award requested fees.in century city medical plaza sperling,isaacs eisenberg th century city medical plaza,the arbitrator had failed to rule on the expressly submitted issues of the appellant claimed right to be awarded interest,costs and attorney fees as the successful party in the arbitration.id.at.relying on classic,development th classic,the court held that an arbitrator can correct his own error under the following circumstances an arbitrator may employ a supplemental award to correct a ruling on one or more submitted issues as to which the parties were entitled to a decision but which was omitted from the initial award through the arbitrator mistake,inadvertence or excusable neglect,provided such supplemental award is requested and acted upon within the time allowed for the correction of an award by either statute or any controlling rules applicable to the arbitration,is made prior to confirmation of the original award so that they both may be considered for confirmation together as would have been the case but for the inadvertent omission,is not inconsistent with other findings on the merits of the controversy and does not cause demonstrable prejudice to the legitimate interests of any party.century city medical plaza,supra,at fn.omitted.the time for an arbitrator correction of an award under section is not later than days after service of a signed copy of the award on the applicant.
while the above authority is limited to correcting an arbitrator oversight,which is not our situation,it is still worthwhile to determine what these decisions consider to be the source of an arbitrator authority to correct his or her own oversights.classic,supra,th noted that arbitrators have a limited authority to correct their awards under section of the caa classic,at.the second district court of appeal div.six observed that while section did not authorize correcting oversights,t he absence of a statutory provision authorizing amendment of an award does not deprive the arbitrator of jurisdiction to do so.the parties concede that the arbitrator had authority to decide the entire dispute classic,at.in our view,the arbitrator was simply finishing his assignment by making a complete and full award on the matters submitted to him for resolution.ibid.i t would be irrational to discard all the time and money spent by the parties where an arbitration award is inadvertently incomplete in one respect and where the oversight can be corrected without substantial prejudice to the legitimate interests of a party.id.at.classic thus predicated the authority to on the arbitrator original authority to decide the entire dispute.the court did not discuss any particular rules of arbitration as conveying this authority.
in century city medical plaza,supra,th,the second district div.three followed the lead of classic.the court first pointed out an arbitrator limited statutory authority to correct an award under section.century city medical plaza,at.t he power of an arbitrator to correct an award after it has been issued to the parties is limited to evident miscalculations of figures or descriptions of persons,things or property,subd.a and nonsubstantive matters of form that do not affect the merits of the controversy,subd.c.century city medical plaza,at.
the court then quoted the holding of classic century city medical plaza,at and adapted it as its own holding,adding the time restriction in section for.id.at.regarding the time restriction,the court noted this condition is not mentioned in classic,but we believe it is necessarily required.a judicially endorsed right to modify or amend an award upon proof of an inadvertent omission should not enjoy more generous temporal restrictions than those provided for expressly authorized corrections or modifications under section see fn,ante or applicable arbitration rules see,aaa rule see fn,ante in those cases where the parties have agreed to be bound by such rules.century city medical plaza,at,fn.this quotation illustrates that these decisions derived an arbitrator power of from the arbitrator original authority to decide and not from any special authority conferred by statute or the applicable arbitration rules.
here we are not confronted with an arbitrator who inadvertently omitted deciding a presented issue.cooper,supra,th at.therefore,we consider the arbitrator authority under the applicable aaa commercial arbitration rules and mediation procedures comm.arb.rules effective on october,after taking judicial notice of them as did the appellate court in century city medical,supra,th at.evid.code,subds.g h,subd.a,and,subd.c.
the parties agree that an aaa arbitrator has a limited authority to correct clerical,typographical,or computational errors in a final award.comm.arb.rules.however,the parties also recognize that the commercial arbitration rules empower an arbitrator to make interim,interlocutory,or partial awards i n addition to a final award in order to assess and apportion the fees,expenses,and compensation related to such award id.at,subd.b.we note that the rules authorize an award of attorneys fees if all parties have requested such an award or it is authorized by law or their arbitration agreement.id.at,subd.d ii.however the commercial arbitration rules have no specific provision for awarding costs authorized by section.any arbitral authority to award costs is presumably subsumed in the authority to award expenses.it is up to the arbitrator to interpret and apply these rules insofar as they relate to the arbitrator powers and duties.comm.arb.rules,supra.
we see no need to burden arbitrators with the obligation in every case to inquire whether a section offer had been made and rejected.rather,the burden should be placed on the party seeking the benefit of section to request an award of its costs.rather than requiring this party to violate section,subdivision b by prematurely disclosing the existence of a rejected offer in arbitration proceedings,we believe a party section request should be deferred until after the arbitration award is made.if and when a party makes a section request,an aaa arbitrator is empowered to recharacterize the existing award as interim,interlocutory,or partial and proceed to resolve the section request by a subsequent award 
in this case the arbitrator award described itself as intended to be a complete disposition of all claims and counterclaims submitted to this arbitration and it should be regarded as a complete disposition of submitted claims.however,it must be acknowledged that client was inhibited by statute from submitting his section claim until after an award resolving the underlying dispute the delayed submission resulted from a statutory restriction and not client mistake or inadvertence.when client properly tendered this separate issue after the arbitration award,the arbitrator should have exercised his authority to deem the existing award to be partial,interlocutory,or interim,rather than final,and should have addressed client section claim for expenses on the merits,as strongly encouraged by the judicial policy favoring arbitral finality.we see nothing in the commercial arbitration rules that prevented the arbitrator from reaching the merits of client section request as it was appropriately presented after the award.
remedies for an arbitrator refusal to hear or decide an issue 
there are several statutory grounds for judicially correcting or vacating awards by arbitrators.among the statutory grounds for vacating an arbitration award in section,subdivision a are the rights of the party were substantially prejudiced by the refusal of the arbitrators to hear evidence material to the controversy or by other conduct of the arbitrators contrary to the provisions of this title.
one basis for judicial intervention has been the failure to consider a submitted issue.as section requires an arbitral award to make a determination of all the questions submitted to the arbitrators the decision of which is necessary in order to determine the controversy,i t has been held that where the record shows that an issue has been submitted to an arbitrator and that he totally failed to consider it,such failure may constitute other conduct of the arbitrators contrary to the provisions of this title justifying vacation of the award rodrigues keller d,rodrigues.the appellate court in rodrigues rejected a claim that any issue was submitted to the arbitrator which he totally failed to consider.id.at.but the failure to consider a submitted issue is a different ground for vacating an award than refusal to hear material evidence.gonzales interinsurance exchange d made this distinction.first,we must determine whether alleging a failure to consider evidence is tantamount to alleging a refusal to hear evidence.fn.omitted we believe that it is not.id.at.it is obvious from the dictionary definitions that the two words are not synonymous.one can not consider what one has refused to hear.legally speaking the admission of evidence is to hear it,and the weighing of it is to give it consideration.ibid.in that case there was no allegation of a refusal to hear.
in burlage superior court th burlage,the appellate court affirmed the trial court vacation of an award because the arbitrator had excluded material evidence.in an arbitration by a property buyer seeking damages from the seller for failing to disclose the property boundaries,the arbitrator awarded the buyer damages for nondisclosure after excluding evidence that there had been an agreed lot line adjustment before the arbitration hearings were held.id.at.the appellate court asked,what could be more material than evidence that the problem was fixed and there are no damages id.at.the parties to an arbitration have bargained for a final and binding decision.moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at.but without the opportunity to present material evidence,spencer did not receive the benefit of that bargain.burlage,at.
the facts before us reveal that the arbitrator refused to hear evidence of client section settlement offer.this is not a case where client has sought to reopen the arbitration hearings to present new evidence on a submitted issue.compare cooper,supra,th at.the section issue had not been submitted before the award was made.nor is this a case where client submitted the issue to the arbitrator and presented evidence and now claims a legal error in the arbitrator decision.the caa does not allow courts to correct legal errors by arbitrators on submitted issues.an arbitrator powers are not necessarily exceeded simply because the award contains a legal error.moshonov,supra,cal th at moore,supra,cal th at.
the companion cases of moshonov and moore both distinguished dimarco rather than overruling it.moore noted that neither case presented dimarco issue whether an arbitrator refusal to award fees expressly mandated by the underlying contract may be judicially corrected under section.moore,supra,cal th at.
here,we not only have an arbitrator refusal to award mandatory section costs,but also a refusal even to hear evidence relevant to the section offer and the issue of mandatory and discretionary costs under section.we have concluded above that his inaction was unjustified by the parties submissions and the applicable arbitration rules.
as the arbitrator did not decide client section request,the trial court might correct the award under section,subdivision b without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted,but only after finding an arbitral excess of power.in supplemental briefing,client contends that the arbitrator exceeded his powers,but we need not reach that contention.
we recognize that a trial court is not authorized to vacate an award unless a party has filed a petition or response asking the court to either vacate or correct the award.just as maaso construed a petition to confirm an award as essentially a petition to vacate an award maaso,supra,th at,we construe client combined motions to confirm the arbitration award and to make the section award declined by the arbitrator as essentially a petition to correct or vacate the award.in supplemental briefing,attorney contends that client failed to present a basis for vacating or correcting the award.we disagree for the reasons stated above.we note that attorney summary of section,subdivision a omits the relevant language about a refusal to hear material evidence.
we have concluded that the arbitrator should have reached the merits of client section request by recharacterizing his final decision as an interim or partial final decision.we note that when a trial court vacates an arbitration award because the arbitrator refused to hear material evidence,the court power to remand the matter to the same arbitrator is limited.if the award is vacated on the grounds set forth in paragraph or of subdivision a of section,the court with the consent of the parties to the court proceeding may order a rehearing before the original arbitrators.this restriction should not preclude client from obtaining a decision on the merits of his section request.if the parties in this case do not consent to a rehearing by the original arbitrator,the trial court is required under pilimai to decide client section request.
iv.disposition 
the orders confirming the arbitration award and denying client request for section costs are reversed.the court is directed to enter an order partially vacating the award and,with the parties consent,to order a hearing on client request for section costs before the same arbitrator so that the arbitrator may make an additional award.if the parties do not consent or the arbitrator again refuses to reach the merits of the section request,the court shall hear and determine client request for section costs.client is entitled to costs on appeal.
unspecified section references are to the code of civil procedure.
attorney brief asserts that,before filing suit,he sent client a mandatory fee arbitration letter and client did not avail himself of this procedure.this assertion lacks support in the appellate appendices provided by the parties.attorney is presumably referring to the mandatory fee arbitration act set out at business and professions code section et,under which whereas a client can not be forced to arbitrate a dispute concerning legal fees,at the client election an unwilling attorney can be forced to do so.aguilar lerner cal th.
no appears in the appendices that constitute the record on appeal.
in requested supplemental briefs,the parties have essentially stipulated that their arbitration was conducted under the aaa commercial arbitration rules effective on october,and that this court can take judicial notice of those rules.
it appears that client request for costs was limited to costs through the arbitration proceedings,not including the subsequent court proceedings.
fees authorized by contract were added to the statute in.stats,ch.the same amendment also resolved confusion about how to recover such fees by specifying in section,subdivision b that contractual attorney fees shall be fixed either upon a noticed motion or upon entry of a default judgment,unless otherwise provided by stipulation of the parties.stats,ch.
amendments of section stats,ch,italicized below specifically authorized arbitrators to award costs under section,providing in pertinent part b not less than days prior to commencement of trial or arbitration as provided in section or of a dispute to be resolved by arbitration,any party may serve an offer in writing upon any other party to the action to allow judgment to be taken or an award to be entered in accordance with the terms and conditions stated at that time.the written offer shall include a statement of the offer,containing the terms and conditions of the judgment or award,and a provision that allows the accepting party to indicate acceptance of the offer by signing a statement that the offer is accepted.if the offer is accepted,the offer with proof of acceptanc
