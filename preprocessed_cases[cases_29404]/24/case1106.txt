this appeal requires us to determine the propriety of a district court order in light of prior appeals and the scope to be afforded to broad arbitration clauses.based on our previous rulings and existing precedent,the district court refused to compel arbitration of various claims asserted by and declined to stay litigation of nonarbitrable claims.because we previously affirmed the district court refusal to compel arbitration of rico conspiracy and aiding and abetting claims in a decision not disturbed by the united states supreme court,the law of the case doctrine compels us to affirm the district court order regarding these claims.with respect to the scope to be given to broad arbitration clauses,a matter not decided previously,we also affirm the district court ruling that broad arbitration clauses can not be extended to compel parties to arbitrate disputes they have not agreed to arbitrate.
background 
a group of physicians acting on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated physicians,sued,a collection of health maintenance organizations hmos,on various violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,breaches of various state prompt pay statutes,and claims for quantum meruit,breach of contract,and unjust enrichment.at bottom,the physicians alleged that the hmos,individually and collectively by conspiring and aiding and abetting each other,failed to properly reimburse physicians for services rendered.because the facts of this case have been detailed in prior opinions,see pacificare health,book,d in re humana.managed care,cir in re managed care,d,we recount here only those facts relevant to this appeal.
the physicians complaint alleged ten claims against hmos conspiracy to commit rico violations under d aiding and abetting rico violations under direct rico violations under a and c rico declaratory and injunctive relief under a breach of contract unjust enrichment violations of various state prompt pay statutes violations of the california business and professional code violations of the connecticut unfair trade act and violations of the new jersey consumer fraud act.in response,hmos moved to compel arbitration of these claims pursuant to arbitration agreements that had been signed between some of the physicians and some of the hmos.see in re humana.managed care,at s ome of the doctors had contracts with some of the hmos some of those contracts had arbitration clauses.in deciding which of physicians claims must be arbitrated,the district court made four rulings 
first,the court held that claims between plaintiffs and defendants who are both signatories to contracts containing enforceable arbitration clauses must be arbitrated.second,relying primarily on our opinion in paladino avnet computer technologies,cir,the court found that those arbitration clauses that exclude punitive damages are unenforceable in this suit because they preclude recovery of treble damages under rico therefore,an hmo may not compel arbitration of a rico suit under such an arbitration clause.third,the court determined that an hmo may not invoke its arbitration clause to compel arbitration of an charge regarding a doctor contractual rights with a different hmo.fourth,the court held that exceptions to the general rule that a to a contract may not invoke the we described in ms dealer serv.franklin,cir do not apply in the present case thus,an hmo that is not a signatory to a particular contract may not invoke that contract arbitration clause to compel arbitration.
in re humana.managed care,at footnotes omitted.on appeal,we affirm ed in its entirety the district court order for the reasons set forth in its comprehensive opinion found at d.id.at.
hmos then appealed to the united states supreme court with respect to the district court second finding,that hmos could not compel arbitration of rico claims if the arbitration clauses excluded punitive damages awards because such clauses were unenforceable the supreme court reversed our decision and held that whether punitive damages limitations in the arbitration clauses precluded an award of treble damages,and whether such a finding would render the arbitration agreements unenforceable,should be decided by an arbitrator in the first instance.pacificare health,at.as a result,we remanded this case to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with the supreme court decision.in re humana.managed care,cir.
while the issue of the arbitrability of rico claims in light of contractual punitive damages limitations was on appeal,the physicians amended their complaint to add two new defendants,twelve new,and six new medical association plaintiffs.they also amended their complaint to clarify the general allegations of conspiracy found in their prior amended complaint following our remand,hmos again moved to compel arbitration based on the supreme court pacificare opinion.the district court ruled that direct rico claims must be arbitrated pursuant to pacificare regardless of damages limitations in the arbitration agreements indirect rico claims remain nonarbitrable pursuant to prior decisions which had not been disturbed by pacificare nonparticipating provider claims claims are nonarbitrable if raised by physicians in the absence of either i a contract between the physician and the hmo regarding the services from which the claim arose or ii an assignment to a physician of the claim by a subscriber who had a contract with the hmo claims asserted by medical associations are arbitrable only to the extent that the claims of their members,on whose behalf the medical associations are raising the claims,are arbitrable the range of arbitrable claims is limited to those claims which arose during the effective dates of the arbitration contracts and litigation of nonarbitrable claims pending before the district court would not be stayed pending arbitration of claims deemed arbitrable.see in re managed care,wl.on appeal,hmos argue that the district court erred by not directing arbitration of all indirect rico claims,claims,medical association claims,and claims outside of the effective dates of relevant contracts containing arbitration clauses and by not granting a stay of litigation pending the resolution of arbitrable claims.
ii.discussion 
because the issue of the arbitrability of indirect rico claims was decided in our prior opinion,we will address it first under law of the case principles.second,we will address the district court refusal to compel arbitration of certain claims,medical association claims,and claims outside the effective dates of contracts.third,we will review the district court denial of a motion to stay of litigation of nonarbitrable claims.
indirect rico claims and law of the case 
the law of the case doctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law,that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.christianson colt indus.operating,d citation omitted.this doctrine is designed to further important goals vital to just and efficient judicial process,including the provision of an end to litigation,the discouragement of panel shopping,and the promotion of consistency in rulings between courts.burger king pilgrim pride,cir.the doctrine does not bar consideration of issues that could have been raised in a prior appeal but were not however,the doctrine does apply not only as to matters decided explicitly but also as to those decided by necessary implication.delong equip.washington mills electro minerals,cir.citations omitted,modified on other grounds,cir.the law of the case doctrine should guide a court in its discretion to hear subsequent appeals on a particular issue.see arizona california,d.the doctrine,however,does not limit the court power to revisit previously decided issues when new and substantially different evidence emerges at a subsequent trial controlling authority has been rendered that is contrary to the previous decision or the earlier ruling was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice if implemented.wheeler city of pleasant grove,cir per curiam.
with these standards in mind,we must determine whether our prior decision constitutes law of the case as to indirect rico claims and whether any of the wheeler exceptions apply.first,hmos argue that the district court and our court only decided that hmos could not compel arbitration based on the contractual rights of third parties.accordingly,they contend that we did not reach the issue of whether the indirect rico claims actually did relate solely to the contractual rights of third parties.hmos maintain that,rather than relating to third party contractual rights,the indirect rico claims touch matters within the parties arbitration agreements and therefore are arbitrable.second,hmos argue alternatively that even if the issue was previously reached,our prior opinion can not be controlling law of the case because the amendment of the complaint,the addition of new defendants,and the decision in pacificare mandate we review our prior decision.
hmos first our previous decision did not reach the issue of the arbitrability of indirect rico without merit.a review of our decision reveals that we affirmed two findings of the district court that bear on indirect rico claims that an hmo may not invoke its arbitration clause to compel arbitration of an charge regarding a doctor contractual rights with a different hmo and that an hmo that is not a signatory to a particular contract may not invoke that contract arbitration clause to compel arbitration.in re humana.managed care,at.after making this determination,we affirmed the district court refusal to compel arbitration of indirect rico claims.id.at.necessarily implicit in that ruling was a finding that indirect rico claims did relate solely to third party contractual rights.moreover,we directly applied our decisions to the parties in several examples which also implied this finding.see id.at nn.realizing that a prior decision is law of the case as to matters decided explicitly and by necessary implication,we find that our prior affirmation of the district court constitutes law of the case here and forecloses hmos argument that indirect rico claims must be arbitrated see burger king,at finding that prior decision allowing recovery of attorney fees was law of the case by necessary implication which foreclosed subsequent appeal that the case was not sufficiently exceptional to award attorney fees under lanham act terrell household goods carriers bureau,cir finding that law of case doctrine precluded review of causation issues where previous panel had affirmed liability which necessarily implied a finding on causation.
hmos alternative an exception to the law of the case doctrine equally without merit.first,despite hmos allegations to the contrary,the district court found,and we agree,that physicians amended complaint did not add anything new which would call into question our prior ruling regarding indirect rico claims.see supra.a review of the first and second amended complaints reveals that both contained the same basic allegations for the conspiracy and aiding and abetting claims moreover,hmos admit that the second amended complaint clarified physicians position rather than fundamentally altering their claims.see id.further,the addition of new parties did not substantially change the nature of the indirect rico allegations.accordingly,we reject hmos argument that the law of the case should be abandoned because new and substantially different evidence mandates a departure from the doctrine.see louisville nashville higdon.affirming refusal to allow subsequent appeal under the law of the case doctrine where an amended pleading was simply an elaboration of the pleading presented in an earlier appeal de tenorio lightsey,cir refusing to revisit prior findings because plaintiff has presented nothing new in her amended complaint second,contrary to hmos arguments,pacificare did not affect our previous ruling regarding indirect rico claims because the court only focused on whether remedial limitations in arbitration clauses prevented arbitration of direct rico claims the scope to be afforded arbitration agreements in the indirect rico context was not before the court.see supra.therefore,the exception that the law of the case doctrine is inapplicable when controlling authority controverts a prior decision does not apply here.see united states of florida,cir.because none of the three exceptions to the law of the case doctrine listed in wheeler apply,our prior decision regarding indirect rico claims is controlling in this appeal.
while not an inexorable command,the law of the case doctrine provides stability and finality in litigation,which are crucial cornerstone values for developing a just and efficient judicial process.litman massachusetts mut.life ins,cir.here,we previously decided,if not explicitly then by necessary implication,that hmos may not compel arbitration of physicians indirect rico claims.hmos failure to seek en banc review or certiorari with respect to these issues caused our previous ruling to become law of the case.see silverberg paine,webber,jackson curtis,cir per curiam.because hmos have failed to show that an exception mandates our departure from the law of the case doctrine,we can not reconsider our previous ruling accordingly,the district court properly held that the law of the case doctrine precludes reconsideration of our previous determination that hmos can not compel physicians to arbitrate their indirect rico claims.

with these general principles in mind,we turn to the district court ruling that claims are only arbitrable if the physician asserting the claim has a contract containing an arbitration clause with the target hmo that covers the rendering of services from which the claim arose or the physician was assigned a claim for reimbursement by a patient who has a contract with the target hmo.first,hmos argue that the broad arbitration signed by physicians are sufficient to cover any claims brought by physicians,even if the contract they signed does not cover the rendition of services from which the claim arose.second,hmos argue that all of physicians claims,even those the district court exempted from arbitration as claims held by the physicians in their own right are derivative of a contract and therefore arbitrable.we will address each argument in turn.
first,hmos attempt to expand the scope of various arbitration agreements to cover the rendition of services outside of the services contemplated by a particular contract is ineffectual.because arbitration can only be compelled when the subject of the dispute has been agreed to be se
