john bradford first filed for arbitration and later filed suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of north carolina against rockwell semiconductor systems alleging that rockwell discriminated against him on the basis of his age in discharging him from employment.the district court granted rockwell motion for summary judgment and enforced the mandatory arbitration provision in bradford employment agreement,notwithstanding a provision that required bradford to pay half of the arbitrator fees and costs.bradford argues on appeal that the provision renders the arbitration agreement unenforceable because the prohibitive costs of arbitration have prevented him from vindicating his statutory rights in the arbitral forum.because bradford has failed to show that the costs of arbitration were prohibitive or that he was deterred from pursuing his statutory rights,we affirm.
bradford was employed by the brooktree corporation,which was acquired by rockwell.rockwell offered him continued employment and sent him a mutual agreement to arbitrate claims.at.the agreement provided that 
except as otherwise provided in this agreement,the company and the employee hereby consent to the resolution by arbitration of the following claims or controversies for which a court otherwise would be authorized by law to grant relief the claims covered by this agreement include,but are not limited to,claims for wages or other compensation due claims for breach of any contract or covenant,express or implied,tort claims claims for discrimination,including but not limited to discrimination based on race,sex,religion,national origin,age,marital status,handicap,disability or medical condition,claims for benefits,and claims for violation of any federal,state or other governmental constitution,statute,ordinance or regulation.
at.the arbitration procedures,which were attached to and referenced by the arbitration provision,provided that 
to ensure that the arbitrator is not biased in any way in favor of one party because that party is paying all or most of the arbitration fees and costs,the parties shall share equally the fees and costs of the arbitrator.each party will deposit funds or post other appropriate security for its,his or her share of the arbitrator fee,in an amount and manner determined by the arbitrator,days before the first day of hearing.each party shall pay for its own costs and attorney fees,if any.however,if any party prevails on a statutory claim which entitles the prevailing party to attorney fees,or if there is a written agreement providing for fees,the arbitrator may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in accordance with such statute or agreement.
at emphasis added.bradford signed the agreement.on september,the day before the closing of the brooktree acquisition,rockwell informed bradford that it would not employ him.believing that his discharge was based upon age discrimination,bradford filed a charge with the eeoc.on august,bradford received a right to sue letter from the eeoc.
the procedural history of bradford claims follows two parallel routes because he pursued his claims both in arbitration and then in the district court.on february,bradford filed a demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association aaa,alleging that his termination violated the adea,breached his employment contract,and violated the public policy of north carolina.on may and,bradford presented witnesses at the arbitration hearing,and on october,the arbitrator ruled against bradford and dismissed his claims.
on september,while his arbitration was still pending,bradford filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of north carolina alleging the same claims as were brought before the arbitrator.on july,the district court granted rockwell motion for summary judgment,concluding that bradford had failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that the arbitration agreement was unenforceable against him because he had failed to offer any competent evidence that fee splitting would cause him financial hardship on august,bradford filed a notice of appeal.
bradford argues that provisions necessarily render arbitration agreements unenforceable as a matter of law because,by requiring employees to pay part or all of the arbitration costs,such provisions deter employees who have been victims of discrimination from pursuing their rights,thus undermining the remedial and deterrent purposes of the federal statutes although bradford concedes that he signed the arbitration agreement and that he initiated and received the full benefit of arbitration of his statutory claims,he asserts that we should adopt a per se rule that all arbitration agreements with provisions are unenforceable,irrespective of actual individual deterrence,based upon the overall deterrent effect of such provisions.bradford also argues that even if he was required to show individual financial hardship and actual deterrence,the district court erred in concluding that he failed to do so.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.austin glass container,cir.
congress passed the federal arbitration act faa,ch,stat.codified as amended at et,in order to reverse the longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration agreements that had existed at english common law and had been adopted by american courts,and to place arbitration agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.gilmer lane,d.the faa manifests a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d,and thus,w hen a valid agreement to arbitrate exists between the parties and covers the matter in dispute,the faa commands the federal courts to stay any ongoing judicial proceedings and to compel arbitration,hooters of america,phillips,cir internal citations omitted.the benefits of arbitration are.for example,we have previously noted that t he arbitration of disputes enables parties to avoid the costs associated with pursuing a judicial resolution of their grievances.by one estimate,litigating a typical employment dispute costs at least and takes two and years to resolve.id.at.accordingly,parties agree to arbitrate and trade the procedures and opportunity for review of the courtroom for the simplicity,informality,and expedition of arbitration.id.quoting gilmer,at.
federal statutory claims,such as claims under the adea,can be subjected to mandatory arbitration agreements.see gilmer,at.in gilmer,the supreme court reasoned that agreements requiring arbitration of adea claims are enforceable because arbitration provides an adequate alternative forum to litigation in court through which claimants can resolve their statutory claims.see id.at.thus,the court concluded that s o long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate his or her statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum,the statute will continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function.id.at.alterations omitted.
relying upon gilmer rationale that statutory claims can be resolved in arbitration because arbitration is an adequate alternative forum to litigation,some courts have concluded that provisions render arbitration agreements unenforceable because the cost of fee splitting deters or prevents employees from vindicating their statutory rights in arbitral forums.see paladino avnet computer technologies,cir citing gilmer and concluding that high costs of arbitration that may be imposed against an employee provide a legitimate basis for nullifying an arbitration agreement in part because the arbitrability of statutory claims rests on the assumption that the arbitration clause permits relief equivalent to court remedies.when an arbitration clause has provisions that defeat the remedial purpose,therefore,the arbitration clause is not enforceable.internal citations omitted cole burns int l sec,relying upon gilmer and stating that employers can not require as a condition of employment that employees waive access to a neutral forum in which to resolve their statutory claims and that arbitration is not a reasonable substitute for a judicial forum if the employee must pay for the arbitrator because they would never be required to pay for a judge in court.
other courts,however,have refused to conclude that fee splitting,by itself,necessarily renders an arbitration provision unenforceable.see williams cigna financial advisors,cir stating that i n our opinion,gilmer does not so clearly imply that no part of arbitral forum fees may ever be assessed against federal claimants,although it plainly indicates that an arbitral cost allocation scheme may not be used to prevent effective vindication of federal statutory claims,and upholding an arbitration agreement that required a title vii claimant to pay half of the costs,cert.denied,d may,rosenberg merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir refusing to invalidate arbitration scheme simply because of the possibility that the arbitrator would charge the plaintiffs a forum fee which may be as high as per day and tens of thousands of dollars per case,because,among other reasons,arbitration is often far more affordable to plaintiffs and defendants alike than is pursuing a claim in court koveleskie sbc capital markets,cir same,cert.denied,d,arakawa japan network group,d,same 
notably,although the courts and the parties differ on the extent to which fee splitting automatically renders an arbitration agreement unenforceable even absent any showing of individual hardship or deterrence,it is undisputed that fee splitting can render an arbitration agreement unenforceable where the arbitration fees and costs are so prohibitive as to effectively deny the employee access to the arbitral forum.see green tree financial randolph,d it may well be that the existence of large arbitration costs could preclude a litigant such as randolph from effectively vindicating her federal statutory rights in the arbitral forum.the question,therefore,is whether we should apply a basis inquiry in making this determination,or whether we should apply a broad per se rule against all irrespective of the circumstances surrounding each individual case.
bradford relies primarily upon the circuit decision in cole to argue that a per se rule should apply.in cole,the circuit applied a per se rule against fee splitting regardless of individual financial hardship and deterrence,reasoning that an employee can never be required,as a condition of employment,to pay an arbitrator compensation in order to secure the resolution of statutory claims under title vii any more than an employee can be made to pay a judge salary.if there is any risk that an arbitration agreement can be construed to require this result,this would surely deter the bringing of arbitration and constitute a de facto forfeiture of the employee statutory rights.cole,at footnote omitted.thus,the cole court concluded that t he only way that an arbitration agreement of the sort at issue here can be lawful is if the employer assumes responsibility for the payment of the arbitrator compensation.id.cole premised its objection to fee splitting on the assumption that employees,by agreeing to fee splitting,essentially agree as a condition of employment to waive access to a neutral forum in which statutory employment discrimination claims may be heard.id.at.the cole court position can be summarized as follows 
under gilmer,arbitration is supposed to be a reasonable substitute for a judicial forum.therefore,it would undermine congress intent to prevent employees who are seeking to vindicate statutory rights from gaining access to a judicial forum and then require them to pay for the services of an arbitrator when they would never be required to pay for a judge in court.
there is no doubt that parties appearing in federal court may be required to assume the cost of filing fees and other administrative expenses,so any reasonable costs of this sort that accompany arbitration are not problematic.however,if an employee like cole is required to pay arbitrators fees ranging from to per day or more,in addition to administrative and attorney fees,is it likely that he will be able to pursue his statutory claims we think not these fees would be prohibitively expensive for an employee like cole,especially after being fired from his job,and it is unacceptable to require cole to pay arbitrators fees,because such fees are unlike anything that he would have to pay to pursue his statutory claims in court.arbitration will occur in this case only because it has been mandated by the employer as a condition of employment.absent this requirement,the employee would be free to pursue his claims in court without having to pay for the services of a judge.in such a arbitration has been imposed by the employer and occurs only at the option of the fees should be borne solely by the employer.

bradford also points to the tenth circuit decision in shankle maintenance mgmt.of colorado,cir,which relied upon cole to hold an arbitration agreement unenforceable because of a mandatory provision.the shankle court stated that 
t he agreement placed shankle between the proverbial rock and a hard prohibited use of the judicial forum,where a litigant is not required to pay for a judge services,and the prohibitive cost substantially limited use of the arbitral forum.essentially,maintenance required shankle to agree to mandatory arbitration as a term of continued employment,yet failed to provide an accessible forum in which he could resolve his statutory rights.such a result clearly undermines the remedial and deterrent functions of the federal laws.
id.at internal citations omitted.notably,although shankle found that the provision rendered the arbitration agreement unenforceable,it framed its analysis in terms of the complaining party actual inability to afford the arbitration costs and fees.see id.at assuming shankle arbitration would have lasted an average length of time,he would have had to pay an arbitrator between and to resolve his claims.shankle could not afford such a fee,and it is unlikely other similarly situated employees could either.
the courts that have explicitly rejected cole per se rule in favor of a approach have reasoned that although gilmer plainly indicates that an arbitral cost allocation scheme may not be used to prevent effective vindication of federal statutory claims,it does not require the conclusion that no part of arbitral forum fees may ever be assessed against federal claimants.williams,at.accordingly,these courts view the pertinent question under gilmer as whether fee splitting prevents the claimant from effectively vindicating his statutory rights,not whether fee splitting can,in the abstract,deter some claimants from vindicating their rights regardless of the individual circumstances of each case.these courts read gilmer as making clear that 
a party agreeing to arbitrate a federal statutory claim does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute,and that claims under federal statutes are appropriate for arbitration so long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate his or her statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum,and the statute will continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function.gilmer,and the cases upon which it relies,make clear that whether a federal statutory claim can be subjected to compulsory arbitration depends upon whether the particular arbitral forum involved provides an adequate substitute for a judicial forum in protecting the particular statutory right at issue.
williams,at emphasis added and internal citations omitted.in other words,these courts focus upon whether the particular claimant has a full and fair opportunity to vindicate his statutory claims.see id.at.this inquiry necessarily turns in part upon whether the claimant is able to pay his share of the forum fees at issue or whether the forum fees in a particular case are so prohibitively expensive as to deter arbitration.see id.in the present case,williams has not demonstrated that the arbitrators order that he pay of the forum fees prevented him from having a full opportunity to vindicate his claims effectively or prevented the arbitration proceedings from affording him an adequate substitute for a federal j
