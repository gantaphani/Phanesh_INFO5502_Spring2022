this action to vacate an arbitration award was brought by the dexter axle company dexter,against the international association of machinists and aerospace workers,district,lodge union under the labor and management relations act of,section.a collective bargaining agreement cba between dexter and the union provided that dexter employees would receive incentive pay for completing assembly tasks more quickly than at a benchmark production rate called a standard.the cba also allowed dexter to periodically recalculate incentive standards in the event there was a significant change in method,tooling or other conditions and set forth procedures for challenging these recalculations.dexter having recalculated incentive standards in and having implemented new standards in,certain union members contested the standard for the axle station.after exhausting internal procedures,the dispute was submitted to arbitration,with the arbitrator finding the contested standard improper and awarding lost wages to affected employees.dexter then challenged the award in district court and,the parties having filed for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment for the union.on appeal,dexter now asserts that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in awarding lost wages and that compliance with the award would result in dexter violation of the cba.we affirm.
dexter is a manufacturer of trailer axles,and the union is the authorized bargaining representative for all production and maintenance workers at dexter elkhart,indiana manufacturing facility elkhart.dexter and the union were parties to a cba,whose term ran from july,to july.the cba consists of sixteen articles,with article xv providing for a basic hourly rate and outlining an incentive pay system for elkhart employees.the terms of the incentive pay system are set forth in the sixteen sections of the incentive pay system supplement supplement,which,inter alia,establish procedures for setting and challenging incentive standards.the supplement is a separate document from the sixteen articles of the cba but is made part of the cba by the express language of article xv.
in article vii,grievance procedures,and article viii,arbitration,the cba also establishes procedures for resolving disputes about its provisions.the supplement outlines in sections,and additional procedures for employees to contest incentive standards.sections and of the supplement specifically refer to articles vii and viii of the cba,respectively,with section,stating in its entirety 
section.if no agreement is reached at step three,the disputed standard may be submitted to arbitration under the provisions of article viii,except that the arbitrator selected shall be a competent engineer in the field of work measurement or one who is experienced in arbitrating incentive grievances.the arbitrator shall have no power to set a standard rate,or to establish methods or procedures.his authority shall be limited to reviewing whether the standard is proper and consistent with those established in the plant and has been properly applied.
in november of,dexter assigned an industrial engineer engineer to study and establish new incentive standards for elkhart axle assembly processes.the supplement provides details about how the engineer is expected to set standards on which to calculate incentive pay.the engineer concluded his study in january of,and dexter implemented the engineer newly established standards in september of.in november of,several elkhart employees filed complaints with dexter protesting the newly calculated rates in accordance with the procedures outlined in the supplement.the union and dexter could not resolve the matter so it was submitted to arbitration.the arbitrator issued an interim award in june of,and,before he issued his final award in september,permitted the engineer to respond to the interim award.after reviewing the engineer response,the arbitrator concluded in his final award that the line balancing method used by the engineer on the axle line resulted in an improper standard.the arbitrator expressly defined the limits of his authority in making this final award as stemming from article viii of the cba and section of the supplement.the arbitrator then awarded affected employees lost wages resulting from the implementation of the new,improper standard.
thereafter,pursuant to the labor and management relations act of,section,dexter filed a complaint in december of against the union and moved to vacate the arbitrator award.after the parties filed for summary judgment,the district court granted the union motion in november of.in its memorandum and order,the district court acknowledged that dexter had made a clever technical argument to undermine the award,but stated that this was not enough under a collective bargaining agreement to disturb an arbitrator award,citing united steelworkers of america enterprise wheel and car,d.dexter then initiated this appeal in december of.

dexter presents two arguments to support its contention that the arbitrator award should be vacated.dexter first alleges that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by awarding lost wages.second,dexter argues that compliance with the arbitrator award would force dexter to violate the cba.we address each of these arguments in turn.
whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority under the cba by awarding lost wages 
dexter asserts that the arbitrator had no authority to award lost wages since this remedy is not available in the arbitration of an incentive rate dispute.thus,the argument is that the arbitrator disregarded the plain language of section of the supplement,which limits the arbitrator authority to reviewing whether the standard is proper and consistent,without elaboration,and makes no mention of lost wages.dexter cites numerous cases holding that arbitrators are without authority to disregard the plain language of a contract.see polk,chi.truck drivers,helpers,warehouse workers union,cir district local lodge,int l of machinists aerospace workers teter tool die,durabond,united steelworkers of,
dexter also relies on indiana common law and the principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius to demonstrate that the parties intended that incentive pay arbitrations contemplate no lost wages remedy indiana common law provides that when a contract contains general and specific provisions relating to the same subject,the specific provision controls.see bowling poole,eskew cornett.thus,dexter contends that the dispute resolution procedures contained in cba articles vii grievance procedure and viii arbitration are superseded by the supplement.under indiana law,the supplement,which is specifically applicable to the incentive program,controls over the general provisions of the cba.dexter also argues that,under the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius expressly including some matters in a contract implies the exclusion of others,see coolsaet construction local,international union of operating engineers,cir,section of the supplement expressly references cba article viii arbitration detailing the submission of an incentive rate dispute,but does not expressly refer to its remedies,including lost wages,indicating that the parties did not intend article viii remedies to be available.dexter further argues that the parties knew how to provide for remedies such as lost wages since cba article viii specifically addresses remedies,and that the omission of such remedies from section of the supplement evidences a deliberate decision to omit authority for awarding lost wages.
the union,on the other hand,insists that lost wages are available as a remedy.the union contends that,since section of cba article vii is incorporated by reference in section of the supplement the parties specifically agreed that disputes over incentive rate standards contemplate remuneration as a possible remedy.the union then asserts that dexter interpretation of the last two sentences in section construed as limiting the arbitrator authority is an unnatural reading since it assumes that the second sentence constitutes a wholesale limitation on the arbitrator activities with respect to incentive rate standards.in contrast,the union suggests that the second sentence stating that the arbitrator authority shall be limited to reviewing whether the standard is proper and consistent merely modifies the prior sentence stating that the a rbitrator shall have no power to set a standard or to establish methods or procedures.according to the union,this also explains why section of the supplement states that s ettlement of any grievance shall be in accordance with section of cba article vii.this argument prompts dexter to respond that the union had to rewrite the last two sentences of section to support its argument,and again assert that section excludes a lost wage remedy.at this point,the union concludes that,in making his final award,the arbitrator confined himself to construing the cba.see,ethyl local,united steelworkers of,cir arbitrator award based on his or her interpretation of the contract draws its essence from the contract.in any event,the union asserts,section of cba article viii is broad enough to authorize the arbitrator to award lost wages.see sullivan lemoncello,cir upholding arbitration board assessment of fines and penalties as drawing its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.employees union of hillshire farm,hillshire farm,cir upholding arbitrator award because it was plausible to suppose that the remedy was within the contemplation of the parties and hence implicitly authorized by the agreement.finally,the union argues that without the remedy of lost wages grievances about standards would be exercises in futility.
it seems clear to us that dexter can not shoulder the heavy burden involved in setting aside the arbitrator final award.controlling precedent both from the supreme court and from this circuit establishes the criteria under which we review an arbitrator ruling.the supreme court has adopted the classic formulation that an arbitrator award is legitimate so long as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.united steelworkers of am.enter.wheel car,d.a court will vacate an award only when the arbitrator words manifest an infidelity to this obligation.id.this circuit has termed the enterprise wheel rule a test of whether the arbitrator had exceeded the powers delegated to him by the parties.ethyl,at see also.public serv,at courts are empowered to vacate an award only if the arbitrator exceeded his or her authority.
it is abundantly clear that it is the arbitrator who is behind the driver wheel of interpretation,not the court.great deference is paid to an arbitrator construction and interpretation of an agreement.it is elementary that the question of interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement is a question for the arbitrator.enter.wheel,at.it is the arbitrator construction which was bargained for and the courts have no business overruling him because their interpretation of the contract is different id.i t is only when the arbitrator must have based his award on some body of thought,or feeling,or policy,or law that is outside the contract and not incorporated in it by reference that the award can be said not to draw its essence from the cba.pub.serv,at internal quotation omitted.thus,we will vacate only if there is no possible interpretive route to the award.id.significantly,w e resolve any reasonable doubt about whether an award draws its essence from the cba in favor of enforcing the award.id.
here,the arbitrator developed his own interpretation of the cba.in his final award,the arbitrator stated,the provisions of section of the incentive pay system supplement and section of the agreement limit my authority.emphasis added.because this construction is the arbitrator own,it must be an acceptable construction under enterprise wheel.further,following enterprise wheel,both dexter and the union have bargained for the arbitrator interpretation,and section of article viii explicitly allows the arbitrator to award back pay.because the arbitrator ruled that section of the supplement and section of cba article viii limited his authority,he acted within the scope of his authority in awarding lost wages.
in addition,enterprise wheel emphasizes another point crucial to the resolution of this dispute an arbitrator needs flexibility when formulating remedies id.at.see also local,allied indus.workers of am.chrysler marine,cir quoting enter.wheel.a court must consider whether it is at all plausible to suppose that the remedy the arbitrator devised was within the contemplation of the parties and hence implicitly authorized by the agreement.chrysler marine,at quoting miller brewing brewery workers local union,cir.the arbitrator authority to interpret and find a breach of the agreement implies the authority to prescribe a remedy to cure the breach id.at.dexter does not dispute the merits of the arbitrator award it makes no argument that the incentive standards on the axle line were correct or that the arbitrator wrongly determined them to be incorrect.instead,it argues that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in formulating the remedy.following chrysler marine,we must consider whether the remedy was within the contemplation of the parties.the union asserts that the reference in section of the supplement to section of cba article vii shows that the parties agreed that grievances challenging incentive standards could properly propose remuneration as an available remedy.dexter,on the other hand,argues that section denies an arbitrator use of remedial powers even though presumably the grievance in arbitration had properly demanded a remedy.however,it seems to us contrary to the intent of the parties to allow remuneration to be considered as a remedy at the outset of the grievance process of an incentive rate dispute but not during the ultimate arbitration.the present dispute arose because the parties did not explicitly outline exactly which remedies would be available to an arbitrator in resolving an incentive dispute.if the parties had specifically negotiated this issue,the union would likely have insisted on remuneration as one possible arbitral remedy,and dexter would have agreed since there was express agreement that remuneration might be raised at the outset of the grievance process it would make no sense for the arbitrator to be helpless to provide redress for the company breach.chrysler marine,at.because dexter suggested construction provides no remedy for an the imposition of an improper standard,it is incorrect under chrysler marine and an erroneous interpretation of the cba.
in sum,dexter does not offer a valid argument for overturning the arbitrator award.it fails to demonstrate that the arbitrator based his award on anything outside the contract.indeed,the arbitrator based his award on section of cba article viii and section of the of which are part of the fully integrated cba according to the plain language of article xv.hence,this award was not based on some body of thought,or feeling,or policy,or law that is outside the contract.thus,the arbitrator award must stand even if it is the wrong interpretation of the cba so long as the award is based on the arbitrator though it may the contract,it draws its essence from the contract.ethyl,at.
whether compliance with the arbitrator award forces dexter to violate the cba 
dexter second argument for rejecting the arbitrator award is somewhat convoluted.it contends that the parties established a relationship between an employee base wage rate and his incentive pay which together comprise his total compensation,requiring that incentive rates be consistent throughout the plant or else skilled workers in one area could be paid less than unskilled workers in another.dexter argues that this is why the supplement requires the standards to be consistent throughout the facility,and that it was with these considerations in mind that the engineer
