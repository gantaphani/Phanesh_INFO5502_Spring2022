opinion of the court 
pricewaterhousecoopers pwc and,to an arbitration,seek to avoid compliance with an arbitration panel subpoena requiring them to turn over documents prior to the panel hearing.the district court enforced the subpoena.we reverse.
hay group hay is a management consulting firm.david hoffrichter left hay employment and joined pwc in september.in early,pwc sold the division employing hoffrichter to 
hoffrichter separation agreement from hay contained a clause that forbade him from soliciting any of hay employees or clients for one year.the agreement further provided for arbitration to resolve any dispute arising under the agreement.in february,hay commenced such an arbitration proceeding in philadelphia,pennsylvania,against hoffrichter,claiming that he had violated the clause.
in an attempt to obtain information for the arbitration,hay served subpoenas for documents on at its pittsburgh office and on pwc at its philadelphia office.hay sought to have the documents produced prior to the panel arbitration hearing.pwc and objected to these subpoenas,but the arbitration panel disagreed.when pwc and still refused to comply with the subpoenas,hay asked the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania to enforce the subpoenas.pwc and again objected,claiming,among other things,that the federal arbitration act faa did not authorize the panel to issue subpoenas to for document production and that the federal rules of civil procedure prohibited the district court from enforcing a subpoena on a for documents outside the court territorial jurisdiction.
in november,the district court issued a decision enforcing the subpoenas and ordering the parties to resolve any remaining differences.in doing so,the district court accepted the view of the eighth circuit and several district courts that the faa authorizes arbitration panels to issue subpoenas on for document production.the district court also held that even under the view of the fourth circuit,which permits such production only when there is a special need,the panel subpoenas would be valid.in addition,the district court held that it had the power to enforce subpoenas on for document production even if the documents were located outside the territory within which the court subpoenas could be served.
pwc and then filed the present appeal.the district court denied their motion to stay its order pending appeal,but our court granted their emergency motion for a stay.
on appeal,pwc and first argue that,under section of the faa,a witness may be compelled to bring documents to an arbitration proceeding but may not simply be subpoenaed to produce documents.we agree.
an arbitrator authority over parties that are not contractually bound by the arbitration agreement is strictly limited to that granted by the federal arbitration act.see,legion insurance company john hancock mutual life ins,wl at,dist.lexis at,it is clear,and undisputed,that the cited statute is the only source of the authority for the validity and enforceability of the arbitrators subpoena over a nonparty integrity ins,in liquidation,am.centennial ins,because the parties to a contract can not bind nonparties,they certainly can not grant such authority to an arbitrator.thus,an arbitrator power over nonparties derives solely from the faa.accordingly,we must look to the faa to determine whether an arbitrator may issue a subpoena requiring document production by a person or entity that is not bound by the arbitration agreement hereinafter a.
in interpreting a statute,we must,of course,begin with the text.the supreme court has repeatedly explained that recourse to legislative history or underlying legislative intent is unnecessary when a statute text is clear and does not lead to an absurd result.united states ex rel.mistick pbt housing authority of city of pittsburgh,cir.furthermore,a court policy preferences can not override the clear meaning of a statute text.see eaves county of cape may,cir we do not find the reasoning of the courts adopting the majority view persuasive,because they ignore a textual analysis of a and,instead,base their result on policies they find to underlie interest and attorney fee awards.
section of the faa provides as follows 
the arbitrators selected either as prescribed in this title et or otherwise,or a majority of them,may summon in writing any person to attend before them or any of them as a witness and in a proper case to bring with him or them any book,record,document or paper which may be deemed material as evidence in the case.the fees for such attendance shall be the same as the fees of witnesses before masters of the united states courts.said summons shall issue in the name of the arbitrator or arbitrators,or a majority of them,and shall be directed to the said person and shall be served in the same manner as subpoenas to appear and testify before the court if any person or persons so summoned to testify shall refuse or neglect to obey said summons,upon petition to the united states district court for the district in which such arbitrators,or a majority of them,are sitting may compel the attendance of such person or persons before said arbitrator or arbitrators,or punish said person or persons for contempt in the same manner as provided by law for securing the attendance of witnesses or their punishment for neglect or refusal to attend in the courts of the united states.
emphasis added.
this language speaks unambiguously to the issue before us.the only power conferred on arbitrators with respect to the production of documents by a is the power to summon a to attend before them or any of them as a witness and in a proper case to bring with him or them any book,record,document or paper which may be deemed material as evidence in the case.emphasis added.the power to require a to bring items with him clearly applies only to situations in which the accompanies the items to the arbitration proceeding,not to situations in which the items are simply sent or brought by a courier.in addition,the use of the word and makes it clear that a may be compelled to bring items with him only when the is summoned to attend before the arbitrator as a witness.thus,section language unambiguously restricts an arbitrator subpoena power to situations in which the has been called to appear in the physical presence of the arbitrator and to hand over the documents at that time 
this interpretation is supported by the interpretation of similar language in a previous version of federal rule of civil procedure.from its adoption in until its amendment in,rule did not allow federal courts to issue document subpoenas on.this restriction was based on a reading of the first two paragraphs of the rule,which provided as follows 
a for attendance of witnesses form issuance.every subpoena shall be issued by the clerk under the seal of the court,shall state the name of the court and the title of the action,and shall command each person to whom it is directed to attend and give testimony at a time and place therein specified.the clerk shall issue a subpoena,or a subpoena for the production of documentary evidence,signed and sealed but otherwise in blank,to a party requesting it,who shall fill it in before service.
b for production of documentary evidence.a subpoena may also command the person to whom it is directed to produce the books,papers,documents,or tangible things designated therein but the court,upon motion made promptly and in any event at or before the time specified in the subpoena for compliance therewith,may quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable and oppressive or condition denial of the motion upon the advancement by the person in whose behalf the subpoena is issued of the reasonable cost of producing the books,papers,documents,or tangible things.
fed.civ.proc.emphasis added.
under this version of rule a,a subpoena was required to command the person to whom it was directed to attend and give testimony.the court could then add a requirement that the subpoenaed witness bring documents with him.see fed.civ.proc.b.the accepted view was that nothing in rule gave the court the power to issue subpoenas to.see,committee notes,amendment subdivision a fourth,paragraph a authorizes the issuance of a subpoena to compel a nonparty to produce evidence independent of any deposition.this revision spares the necessity of a deposition of the custodian of evidentiary material required to be produced.turner parsons,certainly,this rule permits a to be subpoenaed for a deposition.additionally,this can be required to bring certain documents to a deposition.nowhere in the rule is it stated that documents can be subpoenaed alone,that is,without requesting their production in conjunction with a deposition or trial,under the new rule,a subpoena duces tecum seeking the production of documents or other materials from a nonparty may be used independently of the regular testimonial subpoena the two are no longer wedded,as they were under the prior version of rule.
some courts have argued that the language of section implies the power to issue such subpoenas.see in re security life insurance of america,cir we thus hold that implicit in an arbitration panel power to subpoena relevant documents for production at a hearing is the power to order the production of relevant documents for review by a party prior to the hearing.meadows indemnity,nutmeg insurance,the power of the panel to compel production of documents from for the purposes of a hearing implicitly authorizes the lesser power to compel such documents for arbitration purposes prior to a hearing.
we disagree with this analysis.by conferring the power to compel a witness to bring items to an arbitration proceeding while saying nothing about the power simply to compel the production of items without summoning the custodian to testify,the faa implicitly withholds the latter power.if the faa had been meant to confer the latter,broader power,we believe that the drafters would have said so,and they would have then had no need to spell out the more limited power to compel a witness to bring items with him to an arbitration proceeding.as mentioned above,until its amendment in,rule of the federal rules of civil procedure was framed in terms quite similar to section of the faa,but courts did not infer that,just because they could compel a witness to bring items with him,they could also require a simply to produce items without being subpoenaed to testify.
since the text of section of the faa is straightforward,we must see if the result is absurd.see united states ex rel.mistick pbt,at.we conclude that it is not.indeed,we believe that a reasonable argument can be made that a literal reading of section actually furthers arbitration goal of resolving disputes in a timely and cost efficient manner.painewebber hofmann,cir.first,as noted above,until the federal rules of civil procedure themselves did not permit a federal court to compel document production by.that the federal courts were left for decades to operate with this limitation of their subpoena power strongly suggests that the result produced by interpreting section of the faa as embodying a similar limitation is not absurd.second,it is not absurd to read the faa as circumscribing an arbitration panel power to affect those who did not agree to its jurisdiction.see legion ins,at,dist.lexis at the authority of arbitrators with respect to who have never agreed to be involved in arbitration is severely limited.the requirement that document production be made at an actual hearing may,in the long run,discourage the issuance of subpoenas upon.this is so because parties that consider obtaining such a subpoena will be forced to consider whether the documents are important enough to justify the time,money,and effort that the subpoenaing parties will be required to expend if an actual appearance before an arbitrator is needed.under a system of document production,by contrast,there is less incentive to limit the scope of discovery and more incentive to engage in fishing expeditions that undermine some of the advantages of the supposedly shorter and cheaper system of arbitration.see comsat science foundation,at,cir the rationale for constraining an arbitrator subpoena power is clear.parties to a private arbitration agreement forego certain procedural rights attendant to formal litigation in return for a more efficient and resolution of their dispute.a hallmark of a necessary precursor to its efficient a limited discovery process.thus,contrary to hay claim,heeding the clear language of section does not lead to absurd or even unreasonable results.
of course,one may well think that it would be preferable on policy grounds for arbitrators to be able to require to produce documents without also subpoenaing them to appear in person before the panel.but if it is desirable for arbitrators to possess that power,the way to give it to them is by amending section of the faa,just as rule of the federal rules of civil procedure was amended in to confer such a power on district courts.
the fourth circuit has interpreted section in a way that is largely consistent with our reading.in comsat science foundation,supra,the court held that the plain meaning of section did not empower an arbitrator to issue discovery subpoenas to nonparties 
nowhere does the faa grant an arbitrator the authority to order to appear at depositions,or the authority to demand that provide the litigating parties with documents during discovery.by its own terms,the faa subpoena authority is defined as the power of the arbitration panel to compel to appear before them that is,to compel testimony by at the arbitration hearing.
at.in dicta,however,the comsat court suggested that an arbitration panel might be able to subpoena a for discovery under unusual circumstances and upon a showing of special need or hardship.id.at.while we agree with comsat s holding,we can not agree with this dicta because there is simply no textual basis for allowing any special need exception.again,while such a power might be desirable,we have no authority to confer it.
we have carefully considered but must respectfully disagree with the eighth circuit holding in security life that section authorizes arbitrators to issue subpoenas on.in security life,the eighth circuit reasoned that the the interest in efficiency is furthered by permitting a party to review and digest relevant documentary evidence prior to the arbitration hearing.security life,at.in our view,however,this policy argument can not supersede the statutory text 
even if we were to look outside the statutory text to make our decision,any argument in favor of ignoring the literal meaning of the faa in the name of efficiency seems to cut against supreme court precedent regarding the role of efficiency considerations in interpreting the act.although efficiency is certainly an objective of parties who favor arbitration over litigation,see,alexander,d painewebber hofmann,cir,efficiency is not the principal goal of the faa.rather,the central purpose of the faa is to give effect to private agreements.see dean witter reynolds,byrd,d byrd the legislative history of the act establishes that the purpose behind its passage was to ensure judicial enforcement of privately made agreements to arbitrate.we therefore reject the suggestion that the overriding goal of the arbitration act was to promote the expeditious resolution of claims.
in byrd,the supreme court addressed the argument that considerations of efficiency should control the interpretation of the provisions of the faa relating to the enforcement of arbitration agreements.the complaint in that case asserted a federal claim that was not going to be arbitrated,as well as pendent state claims that were covered by a mandatory arbitration agreement.the supreme court was presented with the argument that the district court had the authority to refuse to compel arbitration of the pendent claims because this would have resulted in wasteful bifurcated proceedings and because the drafters of the faa had not explicitly considered the prospect of such proceedings.see at.
rejecting this argument,the supreme court noted that the terms of sections and of the faa,and,required the district court to compel arbitration of the pendent claims.see at.the cour
