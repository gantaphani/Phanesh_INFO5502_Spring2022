this appeal arises from an rail pricing dispute between the burlington northern and santa fe railway company bnsf and the public service company of oklahoma pso.the question we must consider is whether the district court erred in confirming an arbitration board decision despite bnsf claims that the board misconstrued the parties agreement and exceeded its authority by deciding a issue.
we affirm.the arbitration clause in the agreement was enforceable and the district court did not err in deferring to the board determinations regarding the scope of its authority and the proper construction of the agreement.we conclude moreover that pso is entitled to attorney fees under oklahoma law since it has prevailed in a civil action to recover payment for services rendered.
background 
a.the agreement 
in,bnsf and pso entered into a agreement to transport coal to a pso generating station.because the station was served exclusively by a rail line at that time,bnsf initially was to provide service,using its own lines and the.the agreement called for pso to construct a new rail line connecting the station to a bnsf line.once this line was completed,bnsf would begin providing service which the contract termed single line direct service.
the agreement had a number of provisions relevant to our discussion.the prices pso initially agreed to pay for service consisted of a base rate of per ton that was subject to annual,adjustments.the base rate,as adjusted by and of the agreement,produced effective rates,which were the rates pso would pay for service.doc.at.
section contained what the parties colloquially called a rate floor provision.it stated,e xcept as provided in section,the effective rate for single line direct service by bnsf will not be less than the base rate in effect on the date this agreement is filed with the icc.id.at.section granted either party the right to request renegotiation of the effective rate or renegotiation of the adjustment method.id.at.
section specified certain disputes would be submitted to an arbitration board,including renegotiation of the rate or escalation section.id.at.section also provided,t he arbitration board shall have the authority to amend the rate or adjustment method if necessary to reflect the intentions of the parties as set out in this section.id.at.disputes regarding other matters would be resolved in any state or federal court in oklahoma.
b.the arbitration award 
in,pso instituted price negotiations.because the parties could not come to an agreement,pso invoked the arbitration procedures.the matter was then arbitrated by a arbitration board in.
the meaning of the rate floor provision in was uncontested during the arbitration.both parties agreed that,prior to a section renegotiation,the effective rate could not be adjusted to rates less than the base rate except as provided in section.id.at.the parties also agreed the arbitration board could set renegotiated effective rates below per ton.
the arbitration board issued a decision in favor of pso.it directed,the agreement rates as of july,should and shall be per ton for service.doc.at.it also replaced the rate adjustment procedures with a new procedure that adjusted the new effective rates up or down based on changes in railroad costs,as measured by rail indices published by the interstate commerce commission.the arbitration award did not mention a rate floor.but the board retained jurisdiction to resolve any dispute that may arise between the parties over implementation of this decision and award.id.at.
the same day the board entered its award,bnsf filed a motion to vacate in texas state court.pso removed the state action to federal court,which then transferred the action to the northern district of oklahoma.after the district court confirmed the arbitration award,bnsf appealed to this court,contending the district court lacked jurisdiction and one of the arbitrators was biased.we rejected these contentions and affirmed.pub.serv.of burlington,wl cir.
c.the fourth agreement amendment 
after the initial round of litigation,pso and bnsf entered into an amendment to the agreement the parties agreed,as of october,the effective rate for single line direct service via bnsf is per net ton.doc.at.the amount of was reached by applying the adjustment procedures to the rate of.the parties also amended the rate adjustment procedure in so the effective rates would move upward or downward by the rate adjustment procedure.id.at.
during the negotiations of this amendment,pso suggested the parties remove the rate floor provision in because the arbitration board had set new effective rates below per ton.bnsf disagreed and insisted the provision remain in the agreement.in the end,the parties kept the provision in the agreement but agreed to disagree as to its meaning and effect.
d.the parties rate floor dispute 
in,the rate adjustment procedure prescribed by the board and set forth in the amended agreement produced an effective rate of per ton for service.bnsf invoiced pso at a rate of per ton,arguing this was the new rate floor under the agreement.pso disagreed and paid bnsf the adjusted effective rate of per ton.pso contended there was no rate floor after the award and both the award and the amended agreement require the use of the adjusted effective rate.
the parties rate dispute came to a head in,when pso exercised its right to buy out the last year of the agreement term.as provided in,the payment was calculated in reference to the effective rate at the date of termination.pso calculated the payment using the fourth quarter adjusted effective rate of per ton.bnsf claimed the payment should have been calculated using a rate of per ton.
e.the parties agreement to arbitrate the rate floor dispute 
after several years of wrangling,in the parties entered into a submission agreement concerning the terms under which they would arbitrate bnsf rate floor claim.in a joint motion to the district court for the northern district of oklahoma,they asked the court to issue an order with the following directions 
a the arbitration board shall adjudicate bnsf claim that,pursuant to the award and the agreement,the amount of the rate for bnsf service,as provided for in the award,can not be less than per ton bnsf claim.
b the arbitration board,in adjudicating bnsf claim,shall address all of pso defenses to bnsf claim,including pso defense that bnsf claim is,and all of bnsf responses to such defenses.
c the board shall not consider any claims by bnsf and pso other than the bnsf claim referenced in a above.
supplemental doc.at.the district court adopted this exact language in its subsequent order,and the parties proceeded to arbitration.
f.the arbitration award 
in,the arbitration board issued its final merits decision.it agreed with pso and held that neither the award nor the amended agreement set a rate floor of per ton.specifically,the board determined that the rate floor provision in existed only until the agreement was renegotiated under.because it concluded the award produced precisely the type of result that the renegotiation and arbitration procedures contemplated,the board denied bnsf request to modify the award to include a rate floor.doc.at.
one arbitrator dissented from the board decision,arguing the issue before the board is how to interpret the rate floor provision of the agreement and the board should have exercised its authority to reset the rate floor at.id.at.the board majority rejected this position,among other things,as contrary to the plain language of the agreement and award.id.at.
proceedings in the district court 
pso filed a motion to confirm the award in the district court,which granted the motion and entered judgment for pso.later,at bnsf request,the court vacated its judgment in order to consider bnsf claims that the board exceeded its power in determining the award and the amended agreement contained no rate floor of per ton,and the board incorrectly interpreted unambiguous agreement language.
on august,the district court denied bnsf motion to vacate and once again granted pso motion to confirm.burlington pub.serv.of,wl.with regard to bnsf first claim,the court determined the board finding was directly related to renegotiation of the rate or escalation in the renegotiation section as outlined in the arbitration section.id.at.the court also noted that,since bnsf submitted the precise issue for arbitration,it can not escape an unfavorable decision by claiming after the fact that the board was without authority to hear the dispute.id.at.with regard to bnsf claim that the board erroneously interpreted the agreement,the court found the contention to be without merit.id.
ii.discussion 
arbitrability and the scope of an arbitrator.standard of review 
in reviewing the confirmation of an arbitration award,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its legal determinations de novo.sheldon vermonty,cir.we are required nevertheless to give extreme deference to the determination of the arbitrator.brown coleman,cir.once an arbitration award is entered,the finality of arbitration weighs heavily in its favor and can not be upset except under exceptional circumstances.ormsbee dev.grace,cir.an arbitration award will only be vacated for the reasons enumerated in the federal arbitration act,or for a handful of judicially created reasons.sheldon,at observing that a district court may set aside an arbitration award based on a violation of public policy,manifest disregard of the law,or denial of a fundamentally fair hearing.
as an initial matter,we must clarify the distinction between arbitrability and the scope of an arbitrator authority,because different standards of review apply to each.an issue is arbitrable if it is subject to decision by arbitration or referable to an arbitrator or arbiter.webster third new int l dictionary,unabridged.here,the arbitrable issue is whether the rate for service can fall below per ton.in contrast,the scope of authority question is whether the board,in determining whether the rate can fall below per ton,had the authority to declare no rate floor provision existed.
so long as the parties have not specifically agreed to submit the question itself to arbitration,to arbitrate arbitrability,a court will decide independently whether the merits of the parties dispute is arbitrable.first options of chicago kaplan.thus,a party who has not agreed to arbitrate will normally have a right to a court decision about the merits of its dispute.id.at.
but once a court independently determines the parties agreed to arbitrate an issue,it should give extreme deference to an arbitrator decision regarding the scope of that issue.see sheldon,at.other circuits have expressly held the arbitrator interpretation of the scope of his powers is entitled to the same level of deference as his determination on the merits.see schoenduve lucent,cir major league umpires ass am.league of baseball clubs,cir.
bnsf attempts to garner a more favorable standard of review by masquerading its scope of authority claim as an arbitrability claim.it contends it did not submit the rate floor provision to arbitration and hence it is entitled to the district court independent review of its claims.the problem for bnsf is that the parties entered into a submission agreement in which they jointly agreed to arbitrate their,bnsf claim that the rate for service can not be less than per ton,the purported rate floor,and pso defenses to bnsf claim,including the defense that no rate floor existed.accordingly,the district court correctly applied a deferential standard of review to the board merits determinations after independently concluding bnsf agreed to arbitrate the precise issue that it now contends is outside the board scope of authority.burlington,wl at.
bnsf asks us to review de novo whether the board properly construed the submission agreement to permit it to rule in pso favor.but the board determination that it had the authority to declare no rate floor provision existed is entitled to the same extreme deference as its determinations on the merits.see sheldon,at schoenduve,at.bnsf can not escape this deference by characterizing its challenge to the board scope of authority as an arbitrability issue.the finality of any arbitration award would be meaningless if a losing party could its dispute in court by claiming an arbitrator exceeded his or her authority.see dominion video satellite,echostar satellite llc,cir.
bnsf presents two additional arguments to gain an independent review of its claims.first,it contends a less deferential standard of review applies to claims that arbitrators exceeded their powers than applies to claims of fraud,corruption,or misconduct.see aplt.br.at a court reviewing an arbitrator decision under faa a does not apply the same deference as required for challenges arising under faa a through a.we have held,however,that our highly deferential standard of review applies to claims the arbitrator exceeded his power in issuing the award.dma int l,qwest comm.int l,cir.
second,bnsf points to united paperworks int l union misco,a supreme court decision,for the proposition that a high level of deference applies only when the arbitrator is acting within the scope of his or her authority.this reliance is misguided.in fact,united paperworks holds,as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.at.thus,united paperworks mandates a deferential standard of review on scope of authority claims.
in sum,bnsf can not obtain an independent review of its scope of authority claim by characterizing it as an arbitrability claim.an arbitrability issue does not arise whenever the losing party to an arbitration avers the arbitrator exceeded his or her authority.after the district court independently concluded the parties rate dispute was arbitrable,it correctly applied a deferential standard of review to the board determination of the scope of its authority.
scope of authority 
to determine whether a particular dispute falls within the scope of an agreement arbitration clause,we follow the inquiry enunciated in cummings fedex 
first,recognizing there is some range in the breadth of arbitration clauses,a court should classify the particular clause as either broad or narrow.next,if reviewing a narrow clause,the court must determine whether the dispute is over an issue that is on its face within the purview of the clause,or over a collateral issue that is somehow connected to the main agreement that contains the arbitration clause.where the arbitration clause is narrow,a collateral matter will generally be ruled beyond its purview.where the arbitration clause is broad,there arises a presumption of arbitrability and arbitration of even a collateral matter will be ordered if the claim alleged implicates issues of contract construction or the parties rights and obligations under it.
cir quoting louis dreyfus negoce blystad shipping trading,cir emphasis,internal citations,and quotations omitted.
as an initial matter,we reiterate our finding that bnsf expressly agreed to allow the arbitration board to consider the rate floor issue.even if it had not,our case law provides no support for bnsf argument.bnsf first contends the arbitrator board exceeded the scope of its authority because a determination that the rate floor was temporal,not intended to apply after a renegotiation and therefore is a collateral matter beyond the purview of the agreement narrow arbitration clause.aplt.br.at.to support this argument,bnsf cites two and chelsea family pharmacy,pllc medco health solutions,cir.both these cases can be distinguished easily on the facts.
in cummings,the arbitration provision was limited to disputes regarding the termination of operating agreements essentially,employment contracts between fedex and package delivery contractors.at.but fedex sought to compel arbitration on claims of breach of implied contract and breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing arising out of an implied contract.id.at.because the plaintiffs did not actually or constructively terminate the operating agreements,which according to the unambiguous provision are the only disputes
