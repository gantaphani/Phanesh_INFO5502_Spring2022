delta mine holding company delta mine petitioned the district court to confirm,and afc coal properties,afc,petitioned the district court to vacate,two arbitration awards resolving disputes over delta mine right to terminate coal mining lease agreements.the district court vacated the awards because of the partiality and misconduct of the arbitrator chosen by delta mine.delta mine appeals,raising difficult issues concerning how the grounds for vacating an award under the federal arbitration act,a,should be applied to arbitrators.delta mine seeks confirmation of one award,and modification of the other to eliminate an offset provision favorable to afc.afc defends the district court decision and also urges us to affirm on any of several alternative grounds not reached by the district court.we conclude that the conduct of delta mine party arbitrator does not warrant vacating the awards.we further conclude that afc other arguments for vacating the awards,and delta mine argument that one award should be modified,are without merit.accordingly,we reverse and remand with directions to confirm both awards.
background 
in,the predecessors of delta mine and afc entered into leases for the mining of coal on afc lands in illinois.the parties refer to these agreements as the williamson county and the saline county leases complex provisions permitted delta mine to terminate each lease upon notice to afc that all economically recoverable coal had been mined.paragraph provided that disputes over this provision were subject to arbitration by a panel of three arbitrators,one selected by delta mine,one by afc,and a third selected by the other two arbitrators in accordance with the then applicable rules of the american arbitration association.paragraph provided that each of the arbitrators shall be a professional mining engineer,or firm of professional mining engineers,and that the third or neutral arbitrator may not be an officer,employee or shareholder of,attorney or auditor to,or otherwise interested in either party or the matter to be arbitrated.
in november,delta mine invoked the termination provision in each lease.afc objected,and these two arbitration proceedings followed.delta mine designated as its party arbitrator the consulting engineering firm of stagg engineering services and its principal,alan stagg.afc designated mining engineer paul jones.stagg and jones selected mining engineer john wilson as the neutral arbitrator for the williamson county arbitration and mining engineer eugene kitts as the neutral arbitrator for the saline county arbitration.
the two arbitration panels held a joint organizational meeting on november,attended by the four arbitrators,the parties,and their attorneys.at the suggestion of arbitrator jones,each arbitrator briefly described his background.stagg stated that he had maintained a client consulting relationship with delta mine predecessors since,that he had never worked with delta mine law firm,and that he had previously met the neutral arbitrators.there followed a discussion of when the hearings should be held.the neutral arbitrators overruled afc objection to joint proceedings,concluding that the two panels would hold a joint hearing on common issues,followed by separate hearings on issues unique to each arbitration.delta mine urged an expedited exchanges of documents and witness statements followed by hearings in late january.afc argued for a more lengthy process,including formal document discovery and depositions because they have all the information and they have all the witnesses.after the arbitrators conferred,neutral arbitrator kitts announced the discovery during december and january,depositions during february,and the hearings during the week of march.over afc strenuous objection,arbitrator kitts ruled that the two partial panel members stagg and jones should be in a position to ask the pertinent questions of the witnesses,rather than having it turn into a more formal judicial proceeding with and so forth.
not surprisingly,the ambitious discovery schedule was later extended.on march,after deposing delta mine witnesses,afc counsel wrote the arbitrators complaining that delta mine party arbitrator,alan stagg,had been present at delta mine witness preparation and strategy sessions and was acting as delta mine expert in preparing witnesses for depositions and the hearings.afc expressed concern whether an arbitrator who invests himself deeply in the preparation of a case,and then becomes the chief interrogator for his side at the hearing,can be reasonably expected to judge a case on its merits as called for by the code of ethics for arbitrators in commercial disputes.afc concluded by requesting a brief postponement of perhaps a few weeks,to a convenient date in may,to allow each side a reasonable opportunity to prepare.
on april,the two panels responded.in a letter ruling signed by each of the four,the arbitrators rescheduled the hearings to the first week in may.as a compromise between afc request for full attorney of witnesses and the arbitrators intent that this arbitration should not become a formal judicial exercise,the panels ruled that only the arbitrators would be permitted to question witnesses during the presentation of their testimony,but the panels would receive questions,comments,and requests for clarification from counsel following each witness presentation.as the hearings later progressed,afc counsel was permitted to delta mine witnesses.
the april letter ruling did not address afc concern over stagg role in assisting delta mine with the preparation of its case.however,on april,afc party arbitrator,paul jones,had sent afc attorneys a long memorandum describing a meeting of the arbitrators.jones reported 
role of party arbitrator at hearing it was the opinion or expectation of the two neutral arbitrators that each party arbitrator would serve to question witnesses to bring out issues which were not clear in the witness presentations.to do this,the neutrals expect the party arbitrator to be adequately briefed to know where the testimony is going and to be able to ask questions for clarification.they did not seem taken back by alan stagg attendance at the prep sessions.
jones comments gentlemen,i know you are not happy with the results of today meeting but i am certainly willing to do what i can to make the hearing effective for your position i would suggest if you could fed ex to me home delivery saturday as much material regarding the depositions,your expert witness concepts,as possible.i can then spend this weekend and early next week reviewing the material if the hearing is not delayed,we need to discuss asap when i might be briefed on your side of the issues so that i can do a decent job in raising questions at the hearings.
following the hearings,the two panels began their separate deliberations.in the district court,afc conducted thorough discovery of party arbitrator stagg,but neither party conducted discovery of party arbitrator jones or the neutral arbitrators.thus,the record provides a substantial but incomplete picture of the deliberations.we know that each neutral arbitrator discussed the issues with stagg and jones,prepared a draft award and circulated it to the party arbitrators for comment,and after further deliberations prepared the final award.neutral arbitrator wilson ruled that delta mine was entitled to terminate the williamson county lease under the economically recoverable coal provision but awarded afc an offset based upon amounts delta mine had received from its coal customer for future mining royalties.party arbitrator stagg concurred in the termination ruling but dissented from the offset award,while party arbitrator jones dissented from the termination ruling but concurred in the offset award.in the other arbitration,neutral arbitrator kitts ruled that delta mine was entitled to terminate the saline county lease.arbitrator stagg concurred in this award arbitrator jones dissented.
afc then petitioned the district court to vacate both awards.delta mine petitioned to confirm the saline county award and to modify the williamson county award.the district court vacated both awards
