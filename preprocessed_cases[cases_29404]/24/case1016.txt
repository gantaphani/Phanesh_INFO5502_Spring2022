latrell sprewell sprewell challenges the district court dismissal of his claims against the national basketball association nba and the golden state warriors the warriors pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b.b.sprewell attorneys dispute the district court imposition of sanctions under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure rule.sprewell raises numerous state and federal claims challenging the validity of the punishments meted out by the nba and the warriors in response to sprewell physical attack on the head coach of the warriors in.the district court dismissed sprewell federal claims as frivolous,and found sprewell state claims to be preempted by section of the labor management relations act section.we have jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand.
background 
sprewell joined the nba in as a guard for the golden state warriors.during sprewell tenure with the warriors,he played under four different head coaches,the last of whom was carlesimo.sprewell relationship with carlesimo,while amicable upon its inception in june of,quickly deteriorated over the ensuing six months to the point that both sprewell and the warriors openly entertained the possibility of trading sprewell to another team.
tensions between sprewell and carlesimo climaxed during a practice on december,during which carlesimo told sprewell to pass the ball to a teammate for a quick shot.despite sprewell contention that he passed the ball admirably,as one would expect of an,carlesimo rebuked sprewell for not putting more speed on his pass.when carlesimo subsequently repeated his criticism,sprewell slammed the ball down and directed several expletives at carlesimo.carlesimo responded with a similar showing of sophistication.sprewell immediately either walked or lunged at carlesimo and wrapped his hands around carlesimo neck.with his arms fully extended,sprewell moved carlesimo backwards,saying i will kill you.carlesimo offered no resistance.sprewell grasped carlesimo neck for approximately seven to ten time it took for other players and coaches to restrain sprewell.sprewell then left the practice floor,saying trade me,get me out of here,i will kill you,to which carlesimo countered,i am here.
after showering and changing,sprewell returned to the practice facility to again confront carlesimo.despite the efforts of two assistant coaches to restrain him,sprewell was able to approach carlesimo and throw an overhand punch that grazed carlesimo right cheek.sprewell landed a subsequent blow to carlesimo shoulder,but it is uncertain whether it was intentional or the product of sprewell attempt to free himself from those restraining him.as sprewell left the facility,he again told carlesimo,i will kill you.
that evening the warriors suspended sprewell for a minimum of ten games and expressly reserved its right to terminate sprewell contract.two days later,the warriors exercised that right and ended sprewell reign as a warrior.the nba subsequently issued its own suspension of sprewell after conducting an independent investigation of the matter.
on december,sprewell invoked the arbitration provisions of his collective bargaining agreement cba by filing a grievance challenging both his suspension by the nba and the warriors termination of his contract.the arbitrator held nine days of hearings,received testimony from witnesses,accepted over fifty exhibits,and was presented with over pages of pre and briefs.the arbitrator found that the dual punishments issued by the nba and the warriors were permissible under the cba,but found that the warriors termination of sprewell contract was not supported by just cause because after the warriors initial suspension of sprewell,any residual interest of the warriors was absorbed by the nba investigation of the matter and the nba suspension should be limited to the season.
on may,sprewell filed the instant suit.the district court dismissed sprewell complaint without prejudice pursuant to.b,and instructed sprewell counsel to sign any subsequently filed amended complaint in accordance with rule.failing to heed the admonitions of the district court,sprewell filed an amended complaint that paralleled the original.the district court found the amended complaint to consist of the same baseless claims previously dismissed by the court and ordered sprewell attorneys to pay the nba and the warriors attorneys fees pursuant to rule.sprewell asks that we reverse the ruling of the district court.
in his complaint,sprewell leveled a multitude of claims against the nba and the warriors,including a request for vacatur of the arbitrator opinion pursuant to section of the labor management relations act intentional interference with freedom to make and enforce contracts pursuant to conspiracy to violate freedom to make and enforce contracts pursuant to conspiracy to interfere with the arbitral process by producing false evidence violation of common law right to fair procedure interference with prospective economic advantage interference with contractual relations violation of california unruh act civil conspiracy and unfair business practices pursuant to california business and professional code and.the nba and the warriors maintain that their actions were justified under the cba and that sprewell state law claims fall within the preemptive penumbra of section.
count vacating the arbitration award 
sprewell seeks to vacate the arbitration award pursuant to section of the labor management relations act,et section.section empowers this court to review an arbitration conducted under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.see united steelworkers of am.enterprise wheel car,d.
judicial scrutiny of an arbitrator decision in a labor dispute is extremely limited.sheet metal workers int l ass n,local arizona mechanical stainless,cir.the supreme court has instructed that as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.united paperworkers int l union misco,d.we have followed suit in holding that so far as the arbitrator decision concerns construction of the contract,the courts have no business overruling him,because their interpretation of the contract is different than his.san newspaper guild tribune pub,cir per curiam.
notwithstanding the foregoing,we have identified four instances in which the vacatur of an arbitration award under section is warranted when the award does not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement when the arbitrator exceeds the scope of the issues submitted when the award runs counter to public policy and when the award is procured by fraud.see sfic properties,international ass of machinists aerospace workers,dist.lodge,cir internal quotations omitted chiron ortho diagnostic,cir.sprewell seeks refuge under each of the four exceptions.
the arbitration award draws its essence from the cba 
sprewell contends that the arbitrator approval of sprewell multiple punishments the disciplinary actions taken by both the nba and the warriors in response to sprewell not draw its essence from the cba.the thrust of sprewell argument is that the arbitrator improperly ascribed a conjunctive meaning to the word or in the cba provision that subjects players to disciplinary action for just cause by his team or by the commissioner.sprewell alleges that by failing to read the word or in the disjunctive,the arbitrator not only discarded the plain and unambiguous language of the cba,but actually rewrote it.sprewell additionally argues that the arbitrator award does not draw its essence from the cba because the arbitrator relied upon the national football league collective bargaining agreement,which uses different language,the word and instead of or.sprewell claims are legally untenable.
we have held that an arbitration award will only be set aside for failing to draw its essence from the contract in those egregious cases in which a court determines that the arbitrator award ignored the plain language of the contract.stead motors of walnut creek automotive machinists lodge,cir.this is not such a case.in the arbitration award,the arbitrator explained in detail the logic underlying his conclusion,including why he read the word or in the conjunctive rather than the disjunctive.specifically,the arbitrator found that the cba provision upon which sprewell relies was not intended to deal with the issue of multiple disciplines,but rather was designed to emphasize the imperative of just cause in reviewing the matters of discipline thus illustrating that the word or was likely chosen without careful consideration of its implications the cba does not include the word either,which would have supported the conclusion that the penalties were intended to be mutually exclusive and as demonstrated by the nfl cba,h ad the parties here intended by contract to limit discipline with respect to the same matter to a team or the commissioner,but not both,one would have expected some expression in the cba as to which has primacy.regardless of whether we would reach the same conclusion advanced by the arbitrator,we must defer to the arbitrator decision on the grounds that he was,at the very least,arguably construing or applying the contract.misco,at.
the arbitrator did not exceed the scope of his authority 
sprewell argues that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority because he was required either to uphold or to reject the suspension in its entirety.sprewell does not,however,attempt to cite is there the cba supporting this conclusion.the supreme court has held that an arbitrator should be given substantial latitude in fashioning a remedy under a cba.see enterprise wheel,at.sprewell has failed to demonstrate why the above rule should not be applied with full vigor in the instant case.accordingly,we reject sprewell contention that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority by fashioning an originative remedy.
the award does not run counter to public policy 
sprewell alleges that the arbitration award should be vacated on the ground that it contravenes california public policy against.the crux of sprewell argument is that by upholding the dual punishments issued by the nba and the warriors,the arbitrator simultaneously spread the virus of racial animus plaguing those penalties.to vacate an arbitration award on public policy grounds,we must find that an explicit,well defined and dominant policy exists here and that the policy is one that specifically militates against the relief ordered by the arbitrator.united food commercial workers int l union,local foster poultry farms,cir citation omitted.the latter element is dispositive of sprewell claim.the arbitrator held that sprewell punishments were wholly justified by the language of the cba and by virtue of the uniquely egregious nature of sprewell misconduct.therefore,sprewell has failed to demonstrate that the public policy of california militates against the enforcement of the arbitration award.
the arbitration award was not procured by fraud 
finally,sprewell claims that the nba and the warriors tainted the arbitral process by introducing false statements and doctored pictures of carlesimo injuries,thus requiring that the award be vacated on account of fraud.this claim can be summarily dismissed under the rule that where the fraud or undue means is not only discoverable,but discovered and brought to the attention of the arbitrators,a disappointed party will not be given a second bite at the apple.edwards sons,mccollough,cir.sprewell fraud claim was presented in its entirely to,and ruled upon by,the arbitrator.thus,we do not find it necessary to revisit this issue.
sprewell fails to plead facts sufficient to sustain his federal claims for racial discrimination

section provides,a ll persons shall have the same right in every state and territory to make and enforce contracts as is enjoyed by white citizens.sprewell contends that he has adequately pleaded that his punishments by the nba and the warriors were the product of his race in violation of.in his complaint he alleged that black nba players are punished more frequently and severely than white players,and have less favorable termination and compensation clauses in their player contracts.however,the pleading problem in this case arises not from the substance of his averments,but from the rest of his complaint.
in dismissing sprewell section claim,the district court noted that the arbitration award was attached to sprewell complaint and that it contained extensive factual allegations that fatally undermined sprewell section claim.our examination of the pleadings confirms that sprewell attachment of the arbitration award to his complaint justified both the district court consideration in connection with a rule b motion of the factual findings contained therein as well as the conclusion the court drew from it.see branch tunnell,cir w e hold that documents whose contents are alleged in a complaint and whose authenticity no party questions may be considered in ruling on a rule b motion to dismiss.we have held that a plaintiff sprewell has done himself out of a claim by including unnecessary details contrary to his claims.see steckman hart brewing,cir w e are not required to accept as true conclusory allegations which are contradicted by documents referred to in the complaint.soo line louis southwestern,cir a plaintiff can plead himself out of court by alleging facts which show that he has no claim,even though he was not required to allege those facts.
the arbitration award annexed to sprewell complaint contains the arbitrator findings that sprewell punishment was justified by virtue of both the singularity of his misconduct and the fact that sprewell attacked his head coach,which the arbitrator found to strike at the very core of a structure that provides stability for a team and an organized sport.the arbitration award effectively and persuasively fleshes out the fact that the actions taken by the nba and the warriors were motivated solely by sprewell misconduct and were not,as sprewell states,the product of america fear of the black man physicality and rage,and the fear and resentment of the black man success,along with the corresponding anger that the black man is not grateful for what he has been given.
sprewell contends that the district court reliance on the arbitration award was erroneous because the court gave preclusive effect to the arbitration award in violation of the supreme court mandate that race discrimination claims not be foreclosed by way of a previous arbitration.see alexander,d see also,bowers campbell,cir.sprewell reliance on alexander and its progeny is misplaced.because the attachments to sprewell complaint prove fatal to his claims,we affirm the district court disposition of sprewell section cause of action.
