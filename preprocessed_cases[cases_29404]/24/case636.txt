water company iawc terminated glenn williams after he failed to abide by the terms of a last chance agreement lca.at the time of williams dismissal,united food and commercial workers,local,the labor organization that represents many of iawc employees,was challenging the validity of the lca.the union grieved william termination as well,and both grievances proceeded to arbitration,where an arbitrator found in the union favor the arbitrator reinstated williams after concluding that the lca did not contemplate his termination while the union grievance was pending.the district court confirmed the arbitrator award,and iawc appeals.we now affirm.
background 
glenn williams worked in various capacities for iawc and its predecessors from until his termination on march.for the last twenty years of his employment,williams served as an operator,which involved the operation and maintenance of plant equipment used for treating wastewater.
operators must be licensed by the illinois environmental protection agency iepa,which issues four levels of license class a,b,c,or individuals with a class d license are considered.operator licenses must be renewed every three years.according to iawc,an operator wage depends on the level of his or her license,with class a operators receiving the highest pay and class d the lowest prior to his termination,williams last active license was class a,which he had earned in.
in october,the iepa informed williams that his class a license had expired in,nine years earlier,because he had failed to renew it.williams passed this information along to his superiors at iawc,and the company immediately reduced his compensation level to that of a class d.
iawc claimed that operating without a license fell under offense of its employees guide for conduct,which addressed the neglect of assigned duties.williams had been suspended under this provision of the guide the preceding august,which meant that operating without a license was his second violation of offense in three months.the guide specified that a second such offense was punishable by termination.
in lieu of terminating williams,iawc offered him an opportunity to remain with the company pursuant to the terms of a last chance agreement.the lca placed several conditions on williams continued employment.first,iawc suspended williams for thirty days without pay.second,iawc demanded that williams obtain at least a class b operator license within six months of executing the lca.and third,because williams had been paid as a class a operator when he was not licensed as such,he was required to repay iawc excess compensation that he received from january,until iawc began paying him at the class d rate.the lca stipulated that williams would arrange a repayment schedule with iawc within two weeks of signing the agreement.
the lca contained several other provisions,two of which are relevant to our discussion.the first provision contained the following language 
failure to comply with any of these conditions will result in immediate termination the union and the employee expressly waive any right to file a grievance or other claim regarding employee discharge under this agreement,except to contest the fact of what occurred.if the conduct occurred,an arbitrator will not have any authority to modify the discharge to a lesser penalty.
the second relevant provision stated that a ny disputes regarding the meaning of this agreement will be resolved solely through the parties collective bargaining agreement procedure.
on november,williams and iawc signed the lca.also signing as a party to the agreement was the union,which represents all operators and various other service people employed by iawc.the union filed a grievance contesting the lca validity on november,three days after signing.
the present dispute arose when williams failed to make arrangements for the repayment of his excess wages as required by the lca.on march,several months after williams completed his unpaid suspension,iawc representatives gave williams the opportunity to sign a proposed repayment plan,which union representatives advised williams not to sign.according to williams,the proposed plan would have left with him with only a week on which to live.faced with such a dire economic decision,williams followed the union advice and refused to sign the plan.iawc terminated him that same day.the union then filed a second grievance,this time protesting williams dismissal.
both of the union first contesting the last chance agreement,the second contesting williams consolidated and brought before an arbitrator,who held a hearing on november.in a written opinion issued february,the arbitrator sustained in part and denied in part the union grievances.dealing first with the threshold question of the lca validity,the arbitrator found the agreement to be enforceable and binding upon iawc,williams,and the union.because the valid lca contemplated williams suspension,obligation to repay excess compensation,and reduction in wage rate pending renewal of his license,the arbitrator denied the union challenges in those respects.
turning to williams dismissal,the arbitrator discussed williams failure to enter into a repayment plan for excess wages within the time frame established in the lca.the arbitrator then identified the agreement pivotal provision,which stated that f ailure to comply with any of these conditions will result in immediate termination.the arbitrator framed the issue as whether this provision of the last chance agreement justified discharge for failure to enter a repayment plan while a challenge to the validity of the agreement was unresolved.the arbitrator answered this question in the negative,concluding that the lca did not provide for williams termination while a good faith challenge to the validity of the entire agreement was pending.the arbitrator ordered iawc to reinstate williams to his operator position and make him whole for lost wages.
in reaching his decision,the arbitrator discussed several issues.first,he stated that the union challenges to the lca validity,although unsuccessful,were undertaken in good faith and were far from frivolous.next,he noted that iawc unilaterally drafted the lca,requiring that any ambiguities be construed against the company.third,he characterized the challenge to the lca as an act of concerted activity under the national labor relations act and endeavored to interpret the lca in a manner consistent with the act.and fourth,he found it grossly unreasonable to interpret the lca in a manner that allowed for williams discharge while he was challenging its overall validity.
following the arbitrator decision,both iawc and the union sought review in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois pursuant to.iawc sought to vacate the arbitrator decision,while the union requested that it be confirmed.acting on for summary judgment,the district court,in an order on july,found in the union favor and confirmed the arbitration award reinstating williams.this appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,iawc seeks relief under the federal arbitration act,a,which states that a court may vacate an arbitrator award where the arbitrator exceeded his powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.iawc claims that the arbitrator exceeded his power in two ways by ignoring unambiguous language in the lca and looking beyond the four corners of the document and by infusing his own notions of reasonableness into his interpretation of the contract.
