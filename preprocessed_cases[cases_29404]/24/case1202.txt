this case presents several questions regarding whether a party to an uninsured motorist arbitration pursuant to insurance code section is eligible to recover costs and prejudgment interest.specifically,we are asked to decide whether the provisions of code of civil procedure section apply to such arbitrations whether the award of such costs,together with the arbitration award,can exceed an insurer maximum liability under insurance code section,subdivision p,which shall not exceed the insured underinsured motorist coverage limits whether prejudgment interest pursuant to civil code section is available for an uninsured motorist arbitration and whether,if costs are available under code of civil procedure section,those costs include deposition and exhibit preparation costs.
we conclude that the provisions of code of civil procedure section do apply to arbitration conducted pursuant to insurance code section the maximum liability provision of insurance code section,subdivision p does not preclude recovery of costs under code of civil procedure section that,added to the arbitration award,exceed the coverage limits prejudgment interest is not available in the present action because it is not an action for personal injury within the meaning of civil code section and such costs may include deposition and exhibit preparation expenses.we therefore affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the court of appeal.
statement of facts 
the facts of this case are not in dispute.on february,isofea pilimai was injured in an automobile accident with an uninsured driver.pilimai filed a petition to compel arbitration with farmers insurance exchange company farmers,his insurance carrier,under the uninsured motorist provisions of his insurance policy.the policy limit for uninsured motorist coverage in pilimai policy was.
on march,prior to the arbitration,pilimai served a settlement demand pursuant to code of civil procedure section on farmers,offering to settle the case for,which was refused.
after conducting an arbitration,the arbitrator found pilimai was entitled to recover damages in the amount of.the arbitrator entered an award in that amount less the credit that farmers is entitled to,or the amount of the uninsured motorist policy limits which will have to be proven by declaration of the court upon a petition to confirm this arbitration award.the arbitration award was silent on the subject of costs and prejudgment interest.
both pilimai and farmers timely filed petitions to confirm the award as a judgment in the trial court.only farmers,however,set its petition for a hearing.in farmers petition,it sought to reduce the judgment to the policy limit,less the credit to which it was entitled under the policy.
in pilimai petition and in his opposition to farmers petition,he sought a judgment in the same amount,plus costs and prejudgment interest.pilimai claimed he was entitled to recover his costs of suit and prejudgment interest based on code of civil procedure section and civil code section.his memorandum of costs sought in filing fees,in deposition costs,in exhibit costs and in expert witness fees.pilimai also requested in prejudgment interest pursuant to civil code section.
the trial court entered judgment in the amount of.the trial court concluded that pilimai had met the requirements of eligibility for costs and prejudgment interest under code of civil procedure section and civil code section,because plaintiff had recovered more than the settlement offer refused by defendant,and because the two statutes applied to arbitration.nonetheless,the court concluded that the insurance policy limited recovery to the,and an award of costs and prejudgment interest that,together with the arbitration award,would exceed that limit was disallowed.
the court of appeal reversed the trial court judgment with respect to costs and prejudgment interest.it reasoned that code of civil procedure section,and by implication civil code section,allowed recovery of such costs pursuant to arbitration,and that any insurance agreement purporting to limit recovery to the amount of policy coverage must be read in light of such statutory authorization.as a general rule of construction,the parties are presumed to know and to have had in mind all applicable laws extant when an agreement is made.these existing laws are considered part of the contract just as if they were expressly referred to and incorporated.citation.as a result of this general rule that applicable statutes are considered part of the contract,we conclude the parties had section and civil code section their respective mind when they entered into this contract.consequently,those two statutory provisions must therefore constitute part of this contract unless the contract expressly excluded them.the court of appeal further concluded that n othing in the insurance policy explicitly waives the protections of section and civil code section.
the court of appeal also rejected farmers argument that its position is supported by insurance code section,subdivision p,which declares that maximum liability of the insurer providing the underinsured motorist coverage shall not exceed the insured underinsured motorist coverage limits,less the amount paid to the insured by or for any person or organization that may be held legally liable for the injury.the court of appeal interpreted the maximum liability provision to refer to compensatory damages recoverable by pilimai,not the costs of the proceedings or prejudgment interest that arise directly from farmers status as a litigant in the arbitration and subsequent court proceedings.in its dispositional paragraph,the court of appeal directed the trial court to enter a new judgment in favor of pilimai and against farmers in the principal sum of plus a award prejudgment interest pursuant to civil code section and b award pilimai costs including the arbitration costs incurred after his section demand we granted review.
ii.discussion 
do the provisions of code of civil procedure section apply to uninsured motorist arbitrations conducted pursuant to insurance code section 
in addressing whether code of civil procedure section applies to insurance code section arbitrations,we first consider the meaning and purpose of these statutes.
code of civil procedure section provided,at the relevant time a the costs allowed under sections and shall be withheld or augmented as provided in this section.b not less than days prior to commencement of trial or arbitration as provided in section or of a dispute to be resolved by arbitration,any party may serve an offer in writing upon any other party to the action to allow judgment to be taken or an award to be entered in accordance with the terms and conditions stated at that time d if an offer made by a plaintiff is not accepted and the defendant fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award in any action or proceeding other than an eminent domain action,the court or arbitrator,in its discretion,may require the defendant to pay a reasonable sum to cover costs of the services of expert witnesses,who are not regular employees of any party,actually incurred and reasonably necessary in either,or both,preparation for trial or arbitration,or during trial or arbitration,of the case by the plaintiff,in addition to plaintiff costs.italics added.the above reference to arbitration was added to code of civil procedure section in.stats,ch.
the purpose of code of civil procedure section is to encourage settlement by providing a strong financial disincentive to a it be a plaintiff or a fails to achieve a better result than that party could have achieved by accepting his or her opponent settlement offer.this is the stick.the carrot is that by awarding costs to the putative settler the statute provides a financial incentive to make reasonable settlement offers.scott blount,cal th,d.
insurance code section governs the provision of uninsured and underinsured motorist arbitration.as we explained in mercury ins.group superior court cal th,d,mercury insurance at its core,in insurance code section,the law states that,generally,an automobile liability insurance policy that an insurer issues or delivers to an insured owner or operator covering damages that a third party shall be legally entitled to recover for bodily injury from the insured owner or operator shall also cover damages that the insured owner or operator shall be legally entitled to recover for bodily injury from an un insured owner or operator,subd.a.in this aspect,its purpose is to require a type of on the part of insured owners or operators.citations.
in addition,in insurance code section,the law states that such an automobile liability insurance policy shall also provide that the determination as to whether the insured shall be legally entitled to recover damages,and if so entitled,the amount thereof,shall be made by agreement between the insured and the insurer or,in the event of disagreement,by arbitration meaning contractual arbitration,subd.f.in this aspect,its purpose is to offer a means of resolving disputes that is more expeditious and less expensive than litigation.citations.its beneficiaries include the insurer and the insured,who are each thereby given a right against litigating these issues.citation.but they also include the courts themselves,which are thereby freed from entertaining such litigation.mercury insurance,supra,cal th at,d.
farmers argues that an uninsured motorist arbitration pursuant to insurance code section is not an arbitration within the meaning of code of civil procedure section,subdivision b.in particular,it relies on the language of code of civil procedure section,subdivision b that arbitration subject to that statute provisions be as provided in section.code of civil procedure section,which defines the scope of the california arbitration act caa,provides a written agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy thereafter arising is valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.farmers focuses on the word agreement and postulates that the legislature,in referring to arbitration as provided in section must have intended to refer only to arbitrations subject to written agreements.an uninsured motorist arbitration pursuant to insurance code section,farmers argues,is mandated by statute rather than the result of a voluntary agreement,and therefore does not fall within the scope of arbitration subject to the provisions of code of civil procedure section.
this argument is without merit.in mercury insurance,supra,cal th,d,we considered the applicability of code of civil procedure section,like,is part of the an uninsured motorist arbitration pursuant to insurance code section.at issue in that case was the question whether a trial court has the authority to consolidate a contractual arbitration proceeding between an insurer and an insured as to uninsured motorist coverage in the insured pending action against third speaking,does it have authority to join the insurer as a defendant as to uninsured motorist coverage all purposes,including trial,in order to avoid conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact mercury insurance,supra,cal th at,d.
in answer to that question,we first affirmed that arbitration pursuant to insurance code section is a form of contractual arbitration governed by the caa.this law is implicated because the uninsured motorist coverage law requires an automobile liability insurance policy,which is a contract citation,to provide for arbitration.mercury insurance,supra,cal th at,d,italics omitted.
we next considered the scope of code of civil procedure section,subdivision c,which authorizes a trial court to order intervention or joinder of all parties in a single action or special proceeding as to all or only certain issues.we concluded that this joinder was authorized for all purposes,including trial.mercury insurance,supra,cal th at,d,italics omitted.applying code of civil procedure section,subdivision c to the case at hand,we concluded that because a contractual arbitration proceeding could be consolidated with a pending civil case involving a third party,so too could an uninsured motorist arbitration.as we stated in a word,under the contractual arbitration law as it appears in code of civil procedure section,the general right to contractual arbitration of uninsured motorist coverage may have to yield if there is an issue of law or fact common to the arbitration and a pending action or proceeding with a third party and there is a possibility of conflicting rulings thereon.mercury insurance,supra,cal th at,d.
as is therefore clear from mercury insurance,an uninsured motorist arbitration,although mandated by statute,nonetheless is a contractual arbitration subject to the provisions of the caa,including code of civil procedure section.nor is there anything in the language of code of civil procedure section that suggests a contractual arbitration provision in an insurance policy that is statutorily mandated is outside the scope of the caa.indeed,farmers argues elsewhere in its brief that the provisions of the caa,found in code of civil procedure section,should apply to the present arbitration.
moreover,nothing in insurance code section suggests that the arbitration mandated therein is not subject to the caa.that statute,unlike,for example,the mandatory fee arbitration law for fee disputes,does not constitute a separate and distinct arbitration scheme,with a set of procedures different from the caa.aguilar lerner cal th,d.we therefore presume the legislature intended to include such arbitrations within the ambit of the caa.
we therefore conclude that an uninsured motorist arbitration pursuant to insurance code section is an arbitration within the meaning of code of civil procedure section and subject to the latter statute provisions 
does the maximum liability provision of insurance code section,subdivision p limit a cost award pursuant to code of civil procedure section 
insurance code section,subdivision p hereinafter insurance code,section p provides that w hen bodily injury is caused by one or more motor vehicles,whether insured,underinsured,or uninsured,the maximum liability of the insurer providing the underinsured motorist coverage shall not exceed the insured underinsured motorist coverage limits,less the amount paid to the insured by or for any person or organization that may be held legally liable for the injury.farmers argues that this maximum liability provision precludes costs to an insured when,as in the present case,the costs plus the damages awarded the insured would exceed the coverage limit.we agree with the court of appeal that this argument should be rejected.
in murillo fleetwood enterprises,cal th,d,murillo,we considered whether the provisions of civil procedure sections could be impliedly overridden by a contrary statute.we recognized that code of civil procedure section,which authorizes costs to prevailing parties,provides in subdivision b,that e xcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute,a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.murillo,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.turning to code of civil procedure section,we stated section explicitly states that it augment s section b.thus,the requirements for recovery of costs and fees under section must be read in conjunction with section b,including the requirement that section costs and fees are available to the prevailing party e xcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute.b,italics added.murillo,supra,cal th at,d.
we then determined that the statute in question,civil code section,subdivision d,hereafter civil code section d,did not expressly provide an exception to code of civil procedure sections and.civil code section d,part of the act,states if the buyer prevails in an action under this section,the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses,including attorney fees based on actual time expended,determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.the act has no comparable provision for prevailing sellers.we concluded although civil code section d gives a prevailing buyer the right to recover costs and expenses,including attorney fees,the statute makes no mention of prevailing sellers.in other words,it does not expressly disallow recovery of costs by prevailing sellers any suggestion that prevailing sellers are prohibited from recovering their costs is at most implied.accordingly,based on the plain meaning of the words of the statutes in question,we conclude civil code section d does not provide an express exception to the general rule permitting a seller,as a prevailing party,to recover its costs under section b.murillo,supra,cal th at,d.we came to the same conclusion with respect to code of civil procedure section.murillo,supra,cal th at,d.
we also rejected the plaintiff argument that the legal dictionary definition of expressly supported his position.the word expressly has been defined as i n an express manner in direct or unmistakable terms explicitly definitely directly the opposite of impliedly.black law dict.ed.this definition is actually contrary to buyer position,for civil code section d silence with regard to prevailing sellers does not explicitly or directly disable sellers from recovering their costs pursuant to section.murillo,supra,cal th at,d.
the murillo court also rejected the argument that its interpretation of civil code section d defeated the purpose of the statute we could not,of course,ignore the actual words of the statute in an attempt to vindicate our perception of the legislature purpose in enacting the law.this court has no power to rewrite the statute so as to make it conform to a presumed intention which is not expressed.murillo,supra,cal th at,d.the court also held that the provision for attorney fees to prevailing buyers but not sellers sufficiently preserved the statute proconsumer objectives.ibid.
in murillo,the court found no express override of code of civil procedure section when there was a reference to plaintiff costs but not defendant.insurance code section,at issue in the present case,makes no mention of costs whatever.its main focus is on defining rules for uninsured or underinsured motorist insurance policies involving bodily injury liability insurance covering liability arising out of the ownership,maintenance,or use of any motor vehicle,subd.a.insurance code section p maximum liability provision clearly means to limit liability of the insurer arising out of the ownership,maintenance,or use of any motor vehicle.but it is not at all clear that the statute intends to exempt the insurer from the general cost rules found in code of civil procedure section,from the obligation to pay costs arising out of its behavior as a litigant.in other terms,insurance code section p reference to maximum liability does not explicitly or directly disable an insured from recovering costs above such liability when the conditions of code of civil procedure section are met.murillo,supra,cal th at,d.
this conclusion finds additional support in another case relied on by pilimai,and by the court of appeal below,harris northwestern national ins.th,d harris.in that case,involving the breach of a bond,the defendant argued that it could not be assessed costs pursuant to code of civil procedure section,based on the bond and undertaking law code civ,et.it argued that a provision of that law,code of civil procedure section,subdivision a which provides,n otwithstanding any other statute,the aggregate liability of a surety to all persons for all breaches of the condition of a bond is limited to the amount of the bond,precluded cost awards that,combined with damages,exceed the amount of the bond.the harris court,rejecting this argument,stated this language,however,refers only to liability for breaches of the condition of the bond.it does not limit liabilities of a surety which are imposed by statute rather than for breach of the condition of the bond.citation.this was made clear by the subsequent enactment of code of civil procedure section,which provides n othing in this chapter is intended to limit the liability of a surety pursuant to any other statute.harris,supra,th at,d.as the harris court concluded the obligation of appellant to pay costs is imposed by code of civil procedure section based upon appellant status as a party litigant,not for breach of the condition of the bond.here,although appellant admitted its execution of the bond,it denied liability and litigated whether its principal,the notary,breached the condition of the bond.as a losing party litigant,appellant is properly subjected to costs in addition to the amount of the bond.harris,supra,th at,d.
farmers correctly notes that harris is distinguishable from the present case inasmuch as it concerned a statute that explicitly provided that the limitation on liability applied only to breaches of the bond and was not intended to limit liability pursuant to any other statute.harris,supra,th at,d.but harris does call attention to the distinction between t he obligation of appellant to pay costs imposed by code of civil procedure section based upon appellant status as a party litigant and breach of the obligation set forth in the statute in question.ibid.as observed above,it is not clear that insurance code section p maximum liability provision applies to costs imposed on an insurance company through its behavior as a litigant,specifically its failure to settle,rather than damages assessed against it as a liability insurer.
nor are we persuaded otherwise by the fact that the arbitration provisions of insurance code section are intended to provide inexpensive resolution of disputes.orpustan state farm mut.auto.ins.cal d.such inferences,based on general legislative purpose,do not constitute express exceptions to code of civil procedure sections and.murillo,supra,cal th at,d.
we therefore conclude that the maximum liability provision of insurance code section p does not preclude an award of costs pursuant to code of civil procedure section,even if the costs,in addition to the damage award,would exceed the insurance policy maximum coverage.
is prejudgment interest pursuant to code of civil procedure section available in the present case 
farmers argues that even if pilimai may receive costs pursuant to code of civil procedure section,he may not receive prejudgment interest under a related statute,civil code section.that statute provides in pertinent part in any action brought to recover damages for personal injury sustained by any person resulting from or occasioned by the tort of any other person,corporation,association,or partnership,whether by negligence or by willful intent of the other person,corporation,association,or partnership,and whether the injury was fatal or otherwise,it is lawful for the plaintiff in the complaint to claim interest on the damages alleged as provided in this section.if the plaintiff makes an offer pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure which the defendant does not accept prior to trial or within days,whichever occurs first,and the plaintiff obtains a more favorable judgment,the judgment shall bear interest at the legal rate of percent per annum calculated from the date of the plaintiff first offer pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure which is exceeded by the judgment,and interest shall accrue until the satisfaction of judgment.ibid.
farmers argues,among other things,that the present case is not an action brought to recover damages for personal injury sustained by any person resulting from or occasioned by the tort of any other person although the plain language of the statute is consistent with farmers position,pilimai argues in effect that the language of the statute is consistent with his own interpretation he is bringing an action against farmers for the purpose of recovering damages for personal injury resulting from the tort of another,an uninsured motorist.in other words,under pilimai reading,an action brought to recover damages for personal injury does not itself have to be a personal injury may be a contractual action against one own insurance company to recover compensation for a personal injury.
pilimai argument fails for sever
