our supreme court has upheld employment agreements that require the employee to arbitrate disputes,so long as the arbitration clause does not impair the employee statutory rights and is not unconscionable.see armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,armendariz.we are called upon here to examine whether a mandatory employment arbitration by the employee in connection with the settlement of a previous dispute with the employer predecessor after advice from the employee unconscionable or otherwise unenforceable.
plaintiff fred nyulassy sued his employer,defendant lockheed martin corporation,alleging that defendant demoted him in retaliation for his protected workplace activity,complaints about treatment of employees and resistance to illegal activity.plaintiff asserted claims for breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,wrongful demotion in violation of public policy,and violation of section of the labor code.defendant moved to compel arbitration and stay all proceedings motion,based upon a mandatory arbitration clause in plaintiff employment agreement.the trial court denied the motion,and defendant appeals that decision.
defendant claims that the court erred in holding that the subject arbitration agreement was unconscionable,and that the court improperly extended the holding in armendariz to a postdispute arbitration agreement as defendant claims is presented here.for the reasons stated below,we conclude that the trial court correctly decided that the arbitration agreement was unconscionable.accordingly,we affirm the order denying the motion to compel arbitration.
prior dispute 
plaintiff was employed for approximately years by western development labs loral aerospace corporation,subsequently acquired by defendant collectively,defendant predecessor in december,defendant predecessor terminated plaintiff.
as a result of his termination,plaintiff brought an action in santa clara superior court,case no.cv prior case,asserting,inter alia,a claim for age discrimination.plaintiff was represented in that prior case by randall widmann,his attorney in the present action.the parties to the prior case settled their dispute in november and signed the agreements that are central to the issue of the arbitrability of the present dispute.the terms of the settlement included a payment to plaintiff and an agreement that defendant would hire plaintiff as an employee.
ii.settlement agreement 
in or about november,the parties to the prior and defendant into a written agreement settlement agreement entitled,confidential settlement agreement and release of claims.capitalization omitted.the settlement agreement was signed by plaintiff it was also signed by attorney widmann,as plaintiff counsel,below the block lettering,approved as to form.
paragraph of the settlement agreement provided in part the parties stipulate that any action involving the validity,interpretation or enforcement of the agreement,or for any claim for breach of this agreement shall be subject to the arbitration provision in exhibit the document referenced as exhibit c was the employment agreement discussed post,entered into by the parties at the time of the settlement.the settlement agreement contained a confidentiality provision,which referenced further the remedy of arbitration under the employment agreement.the settlement agreement also contained a general provision that the parties in the prior case had been represented by counsel it included a statement that the parties had carefully read and reviewed the terms of the agreement with their respective counsel and were freely and voluntarily entering into it.
iii.employment agreement 
at or about the time the settlement agreement was signed,plaintiff and defendant signed an employment agreement that agreement was a standard form document it was modified or supplemented,however,in several respects by the settlement agreement.one notable change made plaintiff employment relationship terminable only for good cause for a period of three years after the date of his employment,notwithstanding the provision in the form employment agreement.the settlement agreement also contained supplemental terms of plaintiff employment,including starting salary,the identity of plaintiff supervisor,and other specifics.
the employment agreement provided that all disputes or controversies that plaintiff had concerning his employment would be subject to binding arbitration conducted under the employment dispute resolution rules of the american arbitration association.under this arbitration agreement,plaintiff waived all rights to pursue any claims against defendant through judicial proceedings.a precondition to also required to attempt to resolve any employment disputes by engaging in discussions with various levels of management.the employment agreement provided further that plaintiff waived his arbitration remedy if he did not exercise it a within days of his employment termination if a termination claim,or,alternatively,b within days after such other dispute or controversy arose 
iv.declarations submitted in connection with motion 
plaintiff submitted two declarations in opposition to defendant motion to compel arbitration widmann and plaintiff own declaration.plaintiff declared that,as part of settling the prior case,he was required to sign the employment agreement and a proprietary information agreement,and that t here was no negotiation over any of the terms of these agreements,as lockheed will not negotiate the terms of its proprietary information agreement and employment agreement.he stated further that he had been out of work after being terminated by defendant predecessor,and that,if he wanted to settle his case,he would have to do what sic employees do and that is sign the employment agreement and proprietary information agreements concerning which no negotiations were tolerated by lockheed.
widmann declared that he had represented plaintiff in both the prior case and in the instant action.he summarized the allegations in the prior case and described it as hard fought litigation that lasted nearly three years.during settlement negotiations shortly before trial scheduled in september,defendant abruptly made an employment offer to plaintiff.widmann declared that,under the terms of the settlement reached in the prior case,in order to be hired,plaintiff was required to submit a resume,complete an employment application,sign a proprietary agreement and the standard employment agreement which lockheed was using at that time.these documents were not negotiated by the parties and,indeed,were.widmann twice repeated in his declaration that the terms of the employment agreement were nonnegotiable.he declared that,if plaintiff wanted to settle his case at all on any terms he had to sign the standard employment agreement thus,if nyulassy wanted to obtain the other benefits of the settlement aside from obtaining employment from lockheed he had to sign the standard agreements which were.underscoring in original.
defendant evidence in support of the motion consisted of a declaration from its counsel in the present case principally reciting the language contained in the settlement documents from the prior case.exhibits to that declaration included copies of the settlement agreement redacted,the employment agreement,and correspondence between counsel involving defendant request that plaintiff arbitrate his dispute pursuant to the arbitration clause in the employment agreement.defendant submitted no declarations in reply to the nyulassy and widmann declarations.
procedural history 
plaintiff filed his complaint on may.the complaint alleged four causes of action arising out of plaintiff employment relationship with defendant,namely,wrongful demotion in violation of public policy claimed under,inter alia,violation of statute,breach of employment contract and breach of implied good faith covenant.
the complaint alleged that,as of march,plaintiff managed defendant qa department in santa clara county,and at that time,he was given additional responsibility for the management of the qa department in the rsaiia project,located in santa maria.plaintiff alleged that he made complaints to management both about his employer abusive treatment of his subordinates in santa maria,and regarding its insistence that defendant deliver a product to the united states government that the company knew was defective.the complaint alleged further that,sometime after receiving extremely favorable reviews in january and june,plaintiff was abruptly given an u nsatisfactory interim performance review,removed from his management position,and was told that he should retire.he claimed that defendant took this adverse employment action as a result of his protected activities of complaining about the treatment of employees and his complaining about and resisting defendant efforts to sell defective products to the government.
defendant filed its motion on august,requesting that the court issue an order compelling arbitration and staying the action until the matter was resolved through binding arbitration.it asserted that the written employment contract and settlement agreement between the parties expressly mandated that the controversy alleged in the complaint be resolved through binding arbitration.
in his opposition to the motion,plaintiff contended,inter alia,that the mandatory employment arbitration agreement was unenforceable because it was unconscionable,and it was against public policy in that it failed to meet the minimum requirements enunciated in armendariz,supra,cal th,d.after a hearing on september,the court ordered supplemental briefing,which the parties filed thereafter.a second hearing on the motion took place on october.
in its order entered on october,the court denied the motion.the court stated after consideration of the papers on file and the arguments of counsel,the motion is denied.the agreement is unenforceable because it is unconscionable.the unconscionability can not be cured through severance or restriction.armendariz.
defendant filed timely its notice of appeal on november.the order denying defendant motion to compel arbitration is directly appealable.see code civ,aggrieved party may appeal from a an order dismissing or denying a petition to compel arbitration see also mercury ins.group superior court cal th,d.
discussion 
standard of review 
the determination of arbitrability is a legal question subject to de novo review.arista films,gilford securities,th,d.we will uphold the trial court resolution of disputed facts if supported by substantial evidence.engineers architects community development th,d.where,however,there is no disputed extrinsic evidence considered by the trial court,we will review its arbitrability decision de novo.abramson juniper networks,th,d abramson.
in this instance,the only extrinsic evidence concerning the subject arbitration agreement was that presented by plaintiff,namely,the nyulassy and widmann declarations to the effect that the employment agreement including its mandatory arbitration clause was nonnegotiable.defendant offered no conflicting evidence that was extrinsic to the settlement agreement and employment agreement themselves.accordingly,we review de novo the trial court denial of the motion.
ii.issues on appeal 
defendant contends that the trial court erred in concluding that the arbitration clause in the employment agreement was unconscionable.it asserts that the court ruling disregarded the public policy favoring arbitration.defendant claims that the court ignored the critical distinction between the postdispute circumstances surrounding the execution of the employment agreement here,and the typical predispute situation proscribed by armendariz in which a mandatory arbitration agreement is imposed upon the employee by the employer.defendant argues further that,because plaintiff executed the employment agreement as part of an overall settlement of a prior dispute with defendant and defendant predecessor,plaintiff claims that the arbitration clause is unconscionable and against public policy necessarily fail.
our analysis of defendant contentions requires a brief overview of general law concerning arbitration agreements,unconscionable contracts,and the supreme court holdings in armendariz,supra,cal th,d,and in little auto stiegler,cal th,d,little.
iii.applicable law 
arbitration agreements 
code of civil procedure section provides a written agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy thereafter arising is valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.the california statute corresponds with federal law,the federal arbitration act,which states that arbitration agreements are valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.
california courts have uniformly acknowledged that t here is a strong public policy in favor of arbitration agreements.blake ecker th,d see also engalla permanente medical group,cal th,d,moncharsh heily blase cal th,d.in light of this policy favoring arbitration,doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues are to be resolved in favor of arbitration.citations.ericksen,arbuthnot,mccarthy,kearney walsh,oak street cal d.
despite the strong policy favoring arbitration,there are circumstances in which california courts may invalidate or limit agreements to arbitrate.employing general contract law principles,courts will refuse to enforce arbitration provisions that are unconscionable or contrary to public policy.citation.abramson,supra,th at,d,quoting armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.
public policy considerations armendariz little 
four years ago,in armendariz,the supreme court considered a challenge to a mandatory arbitration clause contained in the employment agreements of two employees.armendariz,supra,cal th,d.the employees claimed that,as a matter of law,they could not be compelled to arbitrate their statutory discrimination claims under the fair employment and housing act,government code section et.feha.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.the court rejected the blanket view that such mandatory employment arbitration agreements are per se invalid with respect to the assertion of feha claims.id.at,d.instead,it conclude d that such claims are in fact arbitrable if the arbitration permits an employee to vindicate his or her statutory rights.id.at,d.
such vindication of statutory rights meant that the arbitration agreement perforce needed to meet certain minimum requirements.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.adopting the standards described by the district of columbia circuit in cole burns intern.security services cole,the court in armendariz held that s uch an arbitration agreement is lawful if it provides for neutral arbitrators,provides for more than minimal discovery,requires a written award,provides for all of the types of relief that would otherwise be available in court,and does not require employees to pay either unreasonable costs or any arbitrators fees or expenses as a condition of access to the arbitration forum.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,quoting cole,supra,at.
last year,the supreme court extended its holding in armendariz to certain employee claims other than feha discrimination claims.little,supra,cal th,d.the employee in little asserted that he was wrongfully demoted and then terminated in retaliation for his reporting of warranty fraud.id.at,d.he therefore alleged,inter alia,a tameny claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy.ibid.plaintiff urged that,as was the case with feha claims,a mandatory arbitration agreement relating to an employee claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy was subject to the same minimum requirements enunciated in armendariz.id.at,d.
the supreme court agreed.it held that a legitimate tameny claim is designed to protect a public interest and therefore can not be contravened by private agreement.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.in other words,an employment agreement that required employees to waive claims that they were terminated in violation of public policy would itself be contrary to public policy.accordingly,because an employer can not ask the employee to waive tameny claims,it also can not impose on the arbitration of these claims such burdens or procedural shortcomings as to preclude their vindication.thus,the armendariz requirements are as appropriate to the arbitration of tameny claims as to unwaivable statutory claims.little,supra,cal th at,d.the court reasoned that t he armendariz requirements are therefore applications of general state law contract principles regarding the unwaivability of public rights to the unique context of arbitration,and there is no reason under armendariz logic to distinguish between unwaivable statutory rights and unwaivable rights derived from common law.id.at,d.
as noted,plaintiff argues that the mandatory employment arbitration agreement is both unconscionable and fails to meet the five cole requirements as enunciated in armendariz.as we discuss post,we agree that the arbitration agreement is unconscionable thus,the trial court decision to deny the motion to compel arbitration on that basis was proper.therefore,we need not address whether the trial court could have also denied enforcement of the arbitration agreement because it violates public policy,in that it fails to meet the five minimum requirements for lawful arbitration agreements enunciated in armendariz,supra,cal th,d.see hiser bell helicopter textron,th,d appellate courts generally decline to decide questions not necessary to the decision.
unconscionable contracts 
an arbitration order to be enforceable,and irrespective of whether public or only private rights are also satisfy traditional contract standards of conscionability.as we have recently held i n addition to satisfying the armendariz requirements,an agreement to arbitrate public rights necessarily must be conscionable as well.that conclusion inevitably follows from the great deference accorded unwaivable public rights by both the legislature and the california supreme court.see,armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,little,supra,cal th at,d.if agreements to arbitrate claims arising from ordinary private rights must meet conscionability standards,then certainly those that affect revered public values warrant the same consideration.abramson,supra,th at,d.
unconscionability is a judicially created doctrine,which the legislature codified in,subd.a.citations.whether an agreement is unconscionable depends on circumstances at the time it was made,subd.a.abramson,supra,th at,d.
in little,the supreme court succinctly described the applicable law to briefly recapitulate the principles of unconscionability,the doctrine has both a procedural and a substantive element,the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,the latter on overly harsh or results.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.the procedural element of an unconscionable contract generally takes the form of a contract of adhesion,which,imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength,relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.citation.little,supra,cal th at,d,quoting armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.
substantive unconscionability focuses on the terms of the agreement and whether those terms are so as to shock the conscience.citations.kinney united healthcare services,th,d citation.a contractual provision that is substantively unconscionable may take various forms,but may generally be described as unfairly.little,supra,cal th at,d.t he paramount consideration in assessing substantive conscionability is mutuality.abramson,supra,th at,d.
we have recently identified on a nonexclusive basis certain types of provisions in mandatory employment arbitration contracts that have been held substantively unconscionable.see abramson,supra,th at,d.those cases include where the agreement unfairly favored the employer by allowing for appeal of arbitration awards in excess of little,supra,cal th at,d,where the employer imposed forum costs on the employee mcmanus cibc world markets th,d where the employee damage remedy was limited,the employee was required to pay all costs,and the required hearing location was oakland pinedo premium tobacco stores,th,d and where the contract provided that,pending the arbitration hearing,the employee lost his job,salary,and benefits.stirlen supercuts,th,d.
procedural unconscionability concerns the manner in which the contract was negotiated and the circumstances of the parties at that time.citation.it focuses on factors of oppression and surprise.citation.the oppression component arises from an inequality of bargaining power of the parties to the contract and an absence of real negotiation or a meaningful choice on the part of the weaker party.citations.kinney united healthcare services,supra,th at,d.the component of surprise arises when the challenged terms are hidden in a prolix printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce them.citation.kinney united healthcare services,supra,th at,d.where an adhesive contract is oppressive,surprise need not be shown.abramson,supra,th at,d.
in evaluating a claim of unconscionability,courts are mindful of the interplay between procedural and substantive unconscionability the prevailing view is that procedural and substantive unconscionability must both be present in order for a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability.stirlen supercuts,supra,th at d but they need not be present in the same degree.essentially a sliding scale is invoked which disregards the regularity of the procedural process of the contract formation,that creates the terms,in proportion to the greater harshness or unreasonableness of the substantive terms themselves.citations.in other words,the more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.
iv.the arbitration agreement is unconscionable 
we apply the above stated principles to our de novo review of the arbitration clause at issue in the employment agreement between plaintiff and defendant.we start with what is,in this instance,the easier issue the question of substantive unconscionability.
substantive unconscionability 
the employment agreement requires plaintiff only to arbitrate any and all of his employment claims.the arbitration clause plainly contains only a unilateral agreement to arbitrate any claims that defendant may have that arise out of plaintiff employment are not subject to the arbitration clause.defendant argument to the contrary notwithstanding,the parties agreement to arbitrate disputes concerning the validity,interpretation,or enforcement of the settlement agreement does not infuse an element of bilaterality into the employment agreement.it is true that the settlement agreement contains a bilateral agreement to arbitrate disputes that agreement,however,does not extend to all disputes arising after plaintiff and defendant predecessor settled the prior case and plaintiff commenced employment with defendant.a dispute arising out of plaintiff employment,occurring many years after the as the present not invoke the arbitration provision of the settlement agreement.
the employment addition to compelling plaintiff to arbitrate all of his disputes with him to submit to discussions with his supervisors in advance of,and as a condition precedent to,having his dispute resolved through binding arbitration.while on its face,this provision may present a laudable mechanism for resolving employment disputes informally,it connotes a less benign goal.given the unilateral nature of the arbitration agreement,requiring plaintiff to submit to an dispute resolution mechanism,one without a neutral mediator suggests that defendant would receive a free peek at plaintiff case,thereby obtaining an advantage if and when plaintiff were to later demand arbitration.
moreover,the unilateral arbitration clause places time limitations upon plaintiff assertion of any claims against defendant.in limiting the time to assert a claim to a maximum of days of the date of his employment termination or such other dispute or controversy first arose,plaintiff time for bringing a claim is shortened,in some instances,by a period of more than three and years of course,the employment agreement limits none of the employer rights against the employee including the statutory time for bringing suit against him.
we have little trouble concluding that,taken together,these three aspects of the mandatory employment arbitration agreement render it substantively unconscionable we now turn to the issue of procedural unconscionability.
procedural unconscionability 
the evidence is less dominant on the question of whether the mandatory arbitration clause in the employment agreement is procedurally unconscionable.we first summarily dispose of any claim that the employment agreement is procedurally unconscionable due to surprise.
plaintiff did not submit evidence that he was surprised by the arbitration clause.the subject agreement is less than two pages,and the arbitration clause is in all capital letters,thereby alerting the reader that it might contain matters of particular importance.further,plaintiff was represented by an attorney at the time he executed the settlement agreement and employment agreement.that same attorney representing plaintiff in the present explained the terms of the documents to his client.the mandatory employment arbitration agreement is not procedurally unconscionable due to surprise.we simply can not conclude that the challenged terms are hidden in a prolix printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce them.citations.kinney united healthcare services,supra,th at,d.
turning then to oppression,the employment agreement was a standard form utilized by defendant at the time for the hiring of its employees.it was undisputed that part of the process of being hired by defendant in connection with the settlement of the prior required to sign the employment agreement.likewise,the undisputed evidence was that the terms of the agreement other than the provision were nonnegotiable.
defendant attempts to distinguish this case from others in which courts have held mandatory employment arbitration agreements unconscionable here,the parties agreed to certain changes and additions to the employment agreement that were confirmed in the settlement agreement.of the greatest significance in this respect,the parties agreed that plaintiff could be terminated only for good cause for a period of three years after his employment commenced.defendant also urges that the arbitration agreement is not unconscionable because it was entered into as part of the settlement of a prior dispute.defendant characterizes the agreement as a postdispute arbitration agreement that is excepted from the requirements of armendariz.
we reject defendant a general the discussion of unconscionability contained in armendariz expressly excepted the circumstance where an employer and employee entered into a binding arbitration agreement after a dispute had arisen there,the supreme court emphasized that the five cole requirements for a mandatory employment arbitration agreement would generally not apply in situations in which an employer and an employee knowingly and voluntarily entered into an arbitration agreement after a dispute has arisen.in those cases,employees are free to determine what between arbitral efficiency and formal procedural protections best safeguard their statutory rights.armendariz,supra,cal th at,fn,d.this limitation plainly applies to the minimum requirements discussed in armendariz for lawful employment arbitration agreements implicating nonwaivable statutory rights.we do not read armendariz to hold that mandatory employment arbitration agreements are necessarily conscionable because they are entered into by the parties postdispute.
moreover,we do not agree that the mandatory employment arbitration agreement here is a postdispute agreement.we acknowledge that the parties settlement agreement including the arbitration provisions therein is a postdispute agreement any action to enforce or interpret that agreement,in our view,would relate back to the prior dispute between plaintiff and defendant predecessor.the employment agreement,however,contemplated that the parties were starting a new relationship with specific terms.unlike an action concerning the settlement agreement,a dispute arising out of the new employment relationship between the dispute might occur many years after the settlement of the prior not be one that related to the prior dispute.
further,we can not agree that the facts emphasized by defendant negate a finding of procedural unconscionability.plaintiff had been unemployed for nearly three years while the prior case was pending and he needed the job from defendant to support his family.the fact that plaintiff was able to negotiate a good cause provision in the employment agreement did not,of itself,place him on equal footing with defendant in the negotiation process.we abramson,a similar argument by the employer plaintiff ability to negotiate other aspects of his employment with his employer has no bearing on the question of whether he had power to negotiate the arbitration provision.abramson,supra,th at,d see also graham,supra,cal d at,unconscionability claim upheld,notwithstanding plaintiff status as an experienced promoter and producer of musical concerts stirlen supercuts,supra,th at,d contract determined to be adhesive,despite plaintiff being a successful and sophisticated corporate executive.
defendant urges that the agreement here was not unconscionable because plaintiff was represented by an attorney at the time it was executed.we agree that this fact has in the context of any claim that the agreement was procedurally unconscionable because of surprise.the uncontroverted evidence,however,from plaintiff and his counsel was that the mandatory arbitration provision in the employment agreement was nonnegotiable.thus,on the facts presented here,we are not prepared to say that the mere fact that plaintiff was represented by counsel in the negotiation and execution of the employment agreement prevents him from later asserting that the agreement is unconscionable 
admittedly,plaintiff negotiating position in this case is not at the far end of the spectrum customarily seen in cases where the employee has an absence of any bargaining power there was upon the evidence presented,including the absence of negotiation of the standard form arbitration clause and plaintiff need for degree of inequality of bargaining power of the parties to the contract and an absence of real negotiation or a meaningful choice on the part of the weaker party.kinney united healthcare services,supra,th at,d.
in short,we conclude that there is oppression presented in the parties mandatory employment arbitration agreement.the facts presented the significant degree of substantive unconscionability discussed above,and the absence of evidence that the arbitration clause was the subject of specific bargaining by the such a finding.we therefore conclude that the employment agreement is procedurally unconscionable.
interplay between procedural and substantive unconscionability 
having found that the mandatory employment arbitration agreement is both substantively and procedurally unconscionable,we next evaluate the interplay between these two findings upon the ultimate determination of whether the agreement is unconscionable.in doing so,we apply a sliding scale described in armendariz we compare the extent of regularity in the procedural process by which the contract was entered into with the degree of harshness or unreasonableness of the substantive terms of the contract.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.
as we have noted,the mandatory arbitration clause in the employment agreement has at least three features that make it substantively unconscionable.of the greatest overall significance is the fact that it imposes on the employee only a unilateral obligation to arbitrate in assessing substantive unconscionability,the paramount consideration is mutuality.abramson,supra,th at,d.given the high degree of substantive unconscionability therefore,we readily hold that this with the lower quantum of procedural unconscionability discussed the conclusion that t
