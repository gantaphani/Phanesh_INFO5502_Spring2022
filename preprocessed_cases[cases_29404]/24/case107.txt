this appeal concerns claims,complicated both factually and legally,arising from an household move.on june,ronald and liz rankin contracted with moving storage,rotms to transport their possessions from california to maine.rotms subcontracted with si trucking,si to handle most of the move.the rankins had homeowners insurance policies in force with allstate insurance company allstate and concord general mutual insurance company concord,one covering the origin residence and one the destination.
rotms employees picked up the rankins possessions in california in june and brought them to a warehouse.si employees then transferred them to an si truck for transportation and delivery.when si arrived at the rankins new home in maine on july,the rankins discovered that some of their possessions had been damaged and that many others were missing.upon delivery,the si movers could not account for the damaged or missing items and became abusive and threatening toward the rankins.
shortly thereafter,the rankins notified their insurer,allstate,which hired an adjuster to determine what goods were damaged and their value.in august,the rankins provided allstate with a detailed list of lost or damaged items,supplemented with more information in september.the task of appraisal was substantial as the list comprised a large array of objects,including household goods,electronics,artwork,and furniture.in september,their attorney sent allstate a demand letter.
the allstate policy covered theft and damage to property in transit but,on allstate reading,did not cover items that were merely misplaced by the carrier.allstate maintained in an october letter that the rankins missing goods were not covered by the policy because it was unclear whether they were stolen or merely misplaced in a carrier or warehouse.on december,the rankins filed a police report about the missing goods,convinced by now that their property had in fact been stolen.
on january,allstate sent a worksheet to the rankins giving its appraisal of the damaged items,but making no mention of the larger number of stolen items.in the rankins view at the time,the damage to the items that were delivered amounted to about which allstate share was half on february,allstate agreed to pay to satisfy what it claimed was its share of the losses stemming from the damaged goods.the next day the rankins gave allstate an itemized account of their losses,calculating the total loss damaged goods and stolen goods at a figure the rankins later raised to.
on march,the rankins brought suit against rotms and allstate in federal district court in maine.the original complaint alleged inter alia that rotms had violated the carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act,which imposes something close to strict liability upon originating and delivering carriers,and that allstate had breached its contract with the rankins by failing to provide the benefits due them under the insurance policy.
in june,the rankins added si as a defendant,claiming against it under the carmack amendment and separately for intentional infliction of emotional distress based on the behavior of the employees who delivered the load and abused the rankins.the same amendment added a claim against allstate under maine unfair claims settlement practices act ucspa,e,which imposes attorneys fees and interest for an insurer unreasonable failure to make timely settlement of insurance claims.
the magistrate judge empowered by consent to act as the district court,c,permitted the addition of the new claims and defendants but deferred discovery deadlines.the rankins and allstate made obligatory disclosures and conducted some discovery.when si failed to answer the amended complaint,the rankins in september sought and received entry of default against it.a.on september,the court set a new discovery deadline of december.
in october,all parties had an informal settlement conference.allstate thereafter requested a copy of the police report filed by the rankins in december,which the rankins then provided.allstate did not depose the had their recorded concord did take their deposition in december.allstate did depose rotms and also asked that its adjuster be allowed to contact the rankins directly.
shortly after the discovery deadline and not long before the scheduled trial date of february,allstate,on december,sent a letter invoking an arbitration provision in the policy for resolving disputes as to the amount of loss or damage the rankins rejected this demand as coming too late.allstate then,on december,sent the rankins a check for,as purported full payment for the theft the rankins had estimated as approximately.
allstate then sought summary judgment on the claims against it.the court granted the motion on march,as to certain claims not pressed on this appeal but denied the motion as to the rankins contract and ucspa claims with which we are now concerned.trial was rescheduled for august,and the parties were ordered to confer and provide further information to each other.in consequence,allstate paid the rankins two further sums totaling a little over on account of the theft claim in may and july.this brought the total payments for theft to about about short of the rankins final estimate.
on july,the court reconsidered sua sponte its denials of summary judgment,invited a new motion by allstate,and deferred the trial again.on september,the court granted the motion for summary judgment,resolving both the contract claim and the ucspa claim in favor of allstate.thereafter the court held a hearing on november,to determine si liability on the default and heard evidence from the rankins as to the amount of their property losses and as to their emotional distress claims.the next day it awarded on the latter grounds described recovery on the former.
in the course of the litigation,the rankins settled their disputes with rotms and concord out of court.the rankins have now appealed from the district court dismissal of their contract and ucspa claims against allstate and the refusal of the district court to award damages on their property loss claim against si.we consider the issues on appeal in the same order.on the grant of summary judgment,our review is de novo.roche john hancock mut.life ins,cir.as to the ruling on the default judgment determination,the standard of review depends upon the basis for the ruling.
contract claims.in a nutshell,the rankins say that allstate breached its insurance contract by failing to make timely payment for all covered losses that allstate share of the losses is still not completely further breach of contract and,finally,that allstate can not rely on the arbitration provision for two reasons that allstate itself breached the contract and that it failed to invoke the arbitration provision in a timely manner.
the magistrate judge concluded that the delays in payment were explainable in light of the changing nature of the rankins claims and various events and that no reasonable jury could find otherwise.as to the remaining gap between what allstate paid and the rankins larger estimate of losses,the magistrate judge stated that allstate is entitled to invoke the contract provision requiring arbitration of any remaining disputes regarding the value of items stolen or damaged.
whether allstate unreasonably delayed payment of what was due,whether it stills owes money,and whether it lost its right to invoke the arbitration provision are three different questions,albeit set against the same background facts and intertwined with each other and with the rankins separate statutory claim based on unreasonable delay.
we start with the question whether allstate unreasonably delayed making payment of what was or still is due to the rankins.more precisely,the question is whether summary judgment should have been granted by the magistrate judge on that issue.our conclusion is that the undue delay question presents a jury issue,assuming arguendo that there is a contractual obligation to act diligently.the reasons why the delay question could not be decided on summary judgment are more appropriately set forth in our later discussion of the statutory claim,where the answer clearly matters.
quite likely the answer does not matter in the case of the contract claim.whatever may still be due under the policy for direct losses that is,for direct damage to or loss of insured goods is due regardless of whether there has been delay.the rankins have suggested only two reasons why delay itself may be pertinent to their contract claim first,as a basis for consequential damages and second,as a basis for rejecting the arbitration demand.the first is doubtful and the second wrong.
there is only the barest hint that the rankins are seriously seeking consequential damages,that is,damages not for the direct loss but in consequence of it.in his deposition,ron rankin indicated quite tersely that because his new house was awash in damaged furnishings,he could not use it for some meeting or demonstration relating to his work.almost nothing about this is said in his appellate briefs and it strikes us as an improbable claim.
the rankins have not briefed the question whether the policy permits liability for consequential damages nor is it clear that such a claim would turn on undue delay nor is it especially plausible that either the damage to furnishings or the delay in reimbursement prevented rankin from conducting business from home.this has more the feel of a claim than anything likely to be pursued on the remand that is otherwise required because of the statutory consequences of any undue delay.
the other reason why the rankins say undue delay is relevant under the contract concerns the arbitration clause.describing the delay as a total breach of contract by allstate,as opposed to a partial breach,the rankins say that the total breach prevents allstate from taking advantage of any other provision of the contract,including the arbitration clause.undue delay or not,we think that on the facts of this case no one could reasonably conclude that the delay is the kind of breach that would defeat the arbitration clause,if timely invoked which is a different question.
arbitration clauses are often invoked precisely because one side claims,and the other denies,that a contract has been violated.some violations may be so broad and fundamental that they should prevent the wrongdoer from invoking the arbitration provision itself.but for obvious reasons of doctrine and policy,this requires something more than a claim by one side that the other paid some of what was due a bit too slowly and is insisting on arbitration as to the rest under a provision explicitly designed to resolve disputes about value.county of middlesex gevyn constr,cir,cert.denied,d corbin on contracts,at interim ed.
whether the arbitration is defeated by allstate delay in invoking the clause is a different issue commonly addressed under the heading waiver,here meaning forfeiture rather than intentional relinquishment.the rankins support their waiver argument by invoking a maine insurance law provision requiring timely reservation of defenses by the insurer,d but it is not clear whether this provision applies at all to an arbitration clause,and there is not much state law precedent as to the statute.
yet an arbitration provision has to be invoked in a timely manner or the option is lost.see,menorah ins,inx reinsurance,cir saga communications of new england voornas,me.under federal law,such a forfeiture is an issue for the judge,menorah,at,and,pertinent fact findings by the judge aside which would be reviewed for clear error,our review is plenary.id.where we are dealing with a forfeiture by inaction as opposed to an explicit waiver,the components of waiver of an arbitration clause are undue delay and a modicum of prejudice to the other side.id.at 
in this instance,by february the parties were in disagreement not only about whether the missing items were covered at an issue subject to also about the value of damaged items,value being the arbitrable issue.yet allstate neither invoked the arbitration clause at that time nor did it in its april answer to the complaint filed in march.nor did it assert its right to arbitrate value in june when the rankins final list of lost and damaged items and estimates was delivered and when the likelihood of theft was fairly obvious.
ordinarily,arbitration is provided for the dispute,not some limited aspect of it,so the precedents tend to insist that an arbitration clause be invoked at the earliest opportunity,cabinetree of,kraftmaid cabinetry,cir.if arbitration is invoked in response to a lawsuit,this must be done early on in the case so resources are not needlessly deployed,menorah,at.here,the situation is somewhat different the arbitration clause applies only to disputes about value and not to other questions,including in this case whether certain of the goods were stolen and so covered at all.
even so,it is still hard to see why arbitration was not demanded once the suit had been brought and the rankins estimated losses had been firmed up in june.admittedly some,perhaps most,of the disagreements as to value concerned items as to which coverage was still it is not easy to understand why theft was doubtful by june.still,discovery in the suit was open until december,the delays being no apparent fault of allstate and owing something to the rankins addition of new claims and defendants in june.
it is true that discovery could narrow the arbitrable issues or even produce a settlement,and sometimes arbitrating as to value might make no sense until after discovery or even after trial,if liability itself could only be determined at trial.yet our concern here is with when a timely demand for arbitration must be made,not when the arbitration itself occurs.and knowing early on,or at least after suit is brought what procedures are to be,whether arbitration is sought as to arbitrable a condition of efficient planning by the court and of protecting the opponent against prejudice.
we need not fashion some mechanical rule embracing all possible cases.it is sufficient here that by waiting until after discovery had closed and the trial date had almost arrived,allstate did unduly delay in invoking the arbitration clause in this case.certainly by june,allstate ought to have known that theft coverage was likely to apply and that it would dispute some of the theft claims as to value,the rankins having asserted these claims throughout and given their own dollar figures as early as february.
but was there any prejudice from the delay the rankins say that they told allstate in september,after allstate appraiser had a chance to examine the property,that they the rankins planned to dispose of broken or damaged items,which they then did.now,they say they have been prejudiced having been belatedly have nothing beyond photographs to show the experts who act as appraisers under the policy.allstate does not deny the allegation or otherwise respond to the waiver argument.
the absence of the damaged items themselves does not help the rankins very much.the rankins can not have supposed that allstate was conceding value and,seemingly,the now disposed of property would have been as useful or useless in a jury trial as in arbitration.a better argument,at least hinted at,is that there is prejudice inherent in wasted trial preparation when an arbitration demand is made,and effectively granted,after many months of delay and only six weeks before a trial.
in our view,this is enough in this case.the prejudice showing required is tame at best,menorah,at,and allstate failure to address the issue in its brief is itself a kind of waiver.brandt wand partners,cir.if there were no hint of prejudice,that would be a different matter.but as the case stands,we think that allstate has forfeited its right to arbitration and that value disputes should be tried in court,along with the statutory claim to which we now turn 
the statutory claim.this claim,understandably,is a major focus of allstate attention.the difference between allstate and the rankins in valuation of damaged and stolen property is fairly limited about.by contrast,if allstate violated its duty under the ucspa to make timely payment,it is liable for attorneys fees and prejudgment interest.to state our conclusion at the outset,w
