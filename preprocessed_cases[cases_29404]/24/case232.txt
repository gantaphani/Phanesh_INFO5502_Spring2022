respondent tatung appeals from a july judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york jed rakoff,confirming an arbitral award in favor of petitioners lucent technologies and lucent technologies,grl llc together,lucent and rejecting tatung arguments that the award should be vacated because of arbitrator bias.on appeal,tatung argues that the court judgment should be reversed and the award vacated because tatung never received the disclosure form submitted to the american arbitration association aaa by arbitrator david luening luening service as an expert witness for lucent in an unrelated matter constituted evident partiality requiring vacatur and luening and fellow arbitrator roger smith failed to disclose their joint ownership of an airplane between and.in the alternative,tatung argues,this court should remand the case to the district court for discovery concerning the relationships between luening,lucent and lucent attorneys and between luening and smith.for reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
in october,lucent initiated arbitration against tatung,a taiwanese corporation,because of tatung alleged failure to pay any of the royalties required by their patent licensing agreement with lucent.under the agreement,each party was to appoint one member of the arbitration panel.the two panel members would then choose a third neutral member.the agreement also specified that the arbitration was to be governed by the international rules of the american arbitration association aaa.pursuant to article,paragraph of those rules 
prior to accepting appointment,a prospective arbitrator shall disclose to the administrator any circumstance likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator impartiality or independence upon receipt of such information from an arbitrator or party,the administrator shall communicate it to the other parties and to the tribunal.
moreover,arbitrators are required to file a notice of appointment form disclosing any past or present relationship with the parties or their counsel,direct or indirect,whether financial,professional,social or of any other kind.the form explains that t he aaa will call the facts to the attention of the parties counsel.
on march,lucent named david luening as its choice for the panel of arbitrators.on his aaa disclosure form,luening checked the box marked i hereby disclose the following and wrote see attached memorandum.in the attached memorandum,luening explained that f rom april,to december,i was retained by lucent through their counsel,kirkland and ellis,as a litigation consultant and expert.that engagement has concluded and has no bearing on the subject arbitration.luening form was dated april.a fax line at the top of each page indicates that luening faxed his materials to the aaa on april,and a date stamp indicates that the aaa received those materials that same day.tatung alleges that it never received luening disclosure form from the aaa.
on march,tatung named ed fiorito as its arbitrator.on the disclosure form he filed with the aaa,fiorito checked the box indicating he had nothing to disclose.tatung apparently never received that form either.in may,luening suggested roger smith as the third,neutral arbitrator,and fiorito apparently agreed.on september,smith was appointed to the arbitration panel.smith disclosed to the aaa that he was of counsel to a firm that does work for lucent.tatung received smith disclosure form from the aaa.all three arbitrators were employees of ibm.tatung never asked about the missing disclosure forms and raised no objections concerning the arbitrators identities until after it received notice that it had lost the arbitration.
after granting a delay of the arbitration hearing to accommodate tatung substitution of lucent days of hearings were eventually held.in october,all three arbitrators found in favor of lucent and voted to award it damages.the three disagreed only as to the amount.luening and smith awarded fiorito would have awarded.pursuant to tatung request,the award was later lowered to plus interest.
thereafter,lucent petitioned in the southern district for confirmation of the award in response,tatung moved to vacate the award arguing,among other things,that luening and lucent had failed to disclose that luening had been a paid patent license expert for lucent in another case,lucent technologies,newbridge networks.the delaware case,that was not yet final at the time the arbitration began.tatung also complained that it was undisclosed that luening and smith had owned an airplane together from to.
tatung,which had apparently never asked the aaa about luening disclosure form,accused lucent and luening of intentionally hiding luening service as an expert witness for lucent in the delaware case.tatung pointed out that the same lawyers had represented lucent in that case and in the current arbitration.tatung argued that although judgment had been entered in the delaware case in november,luening testimony was implicated in a new trial motion that was not denied until september,more than six months after his appointment as an arbitrator in tatung controversy with lucent.further,an appeal was pending until as late as october.tatung argued that the failure of luening and lucent to disclose these facts constituted evident partiality under commonwealth coatings continental cas,d,requiring vacatur of the award.luening and smith failure to disclose their of an airplane,tatung added,also constituted evident partiality and required vacatur as well.
the district court rejected tatung arguments and confirmed the award.the court found that luening had in fact disclosed his relationship with lucent to the aaa and that his service as an expert witness had ended by november,months before being selected as an arbitrator in this matter.further,judge rakoff observed that tatung could have discovered that relationship at any time had it simply asked the aaa,luening or lucent about the disclosure form tatung must have known to have existed.this fact suggested to the court that tatung argument was a classic example of a losing party seizing upon a pretext for invalidating the arbitration award.lucent,tatung,d,internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
most important,the district court held that commonwealth coatings does not require vacatur where the arbitrator has disclosed potential conflicts of interest to the aaa but the aaa thereafter did not forward the information to a party.judge rakoff noted that requiring vacatur under such circumstances would serve no public purpose.id.further,the court held,luening relationship with lucent was not sufficiently suggestive of partiality to require vacatur under morelite construction new york city district council carpenters benefit funds,cir.the judge also held that luening and smith previous of an airplane was too insubstantial to warrant vacating an award,lucent,d at quoting commonwealth coatings,at.white,concurring.
this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
in this court,tatung argues that the district court erred in failing to find bias.tatung no longer claims that luening did not disclose the contested relationship to the aaa.however,tatung argues that commonwealth coatings requires vacatur whenever a party fails to receive notice of the disclosure,even if the fault lies with the aaa rather than with the arbitrator or a party.tatung argues that luening relationship with lucent and luening relationship with smith both require vacatur for nondisclosure.further,tatung claims that the relationship between luening and lucent so strongly suggested partiality that it requires vacatur of the arbitration award even though it had been disclosed by luening to the aaa.finally,tatung argues that if this court chooses not to vacate the award on these bases,we should at the very least remand to the district court for discovery regarding the contested relationships.we consider each of these arguments in turn.although we review the district court rulings on issues of law de novo,we review its factual findings in confirming the arbitration award for clear error.first optio
