defendant,which manufactures and sells ergonomic office products,is incorporated in new york and has sales and manufacturing facilities in new jersey.in late,plaintiff began working as a regional manager for a company affiliated with defendant.at that time he executed a written contract containing noncompetition and arbitration clauses and a provision applying new york law.
in february,the parties entered into a written agreement that appointed plaintiff as a sales consultant for defendant.the agreement declares it shall be construed in accordance with the law of the state of new jersey,and a ny dispute involving the performance,interpretation of sic breach of this agreement or the relationship created hereby,including disputes involving discrimination and other rights and protections afforded by law shall be submitted to binding arbitration in new jersey before the american arbitration association in accordance with the rules of that association.

defendant terminated plaintiff employment on july.several months later,defendant filed a formal demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association in new jersey,citing plaintiff alleged violation of the agreement noncompetition and nondisclosure of trade secrets provisions.
in april,plaintiff filed the present action in california,alleging causes of action for failure to timely pay wages,declaratory relief,and unfair competition.shortly thereafter,defendant filed suit in new jersey to enforce the arbitration clause contained in the agreement.in the california action,plaintiff moved to stay the arbitration,while defendant responded with a request to stay the action pending completion of the arbitration.after a new jersey court issued an order directing the parties to proceed with the arbitration,the california court granted defendant motion to stay.we summarily denied plaintiff petition challenging that order.
plaintiff then filed a motion with the arbitrator to dismiss the arbitration,in part asserting that under new jersey choice of law analysis,paragraph interpretation is governed by california law,which renders covenants not to compete void as a matter of public policy.the arbitrator denied the motion.while acknowledging california has adopted a fundamental policy protecting the freedom of employees to pursue their trade or profession,the arbitrator found e very state,including new jersey,is concerned about its employees,and california courts have enforced covenants that impose only incidental or partial restraints.citing the limited nature of defendant proposed injunction,which sought to bar plaintiff from solicit ing or sell ing competing products to those humanscale customers to who m he was assigned or had contact,the arbitrator concluded,california interest was not materially greater than that of new jersey.in a letter sent shortly before the hearing began,the arbitrator informed the parties that,a fter reading your various submissions and the supporting authority concerning the arbitrability of plaintiff wage claim,i have concluded that the claim is arbitrable and that the claim should be determined as part of the pending arbitration.

defendant filed a petition in this action to confirm the arbitrator award.plaintiff opposed the petition and alternately requested the court to vacate the award.he claimed the award was based on an illegal contract that violates california policy against covenants not to compete,improperly ruled on his wage claim,and violated california law by requiring him to pay part of the arbitration expenses.
the trial judge denied defendant petition and granted plaintiff request.he declared t he arbitrator award is not legal on its face,and it violates the public policy in california as expressed in business and professions code section as well as awards costs and fees against the employee in my review of the arbitrator award,it appears that the arbitrator applied new jersey law when it appears to the court that california law should apply under a choice of law analysis.
discussion 
introduction 
california public policy supports the use of private arbitration to resolve disputes.code civ,et moncharsh heily blase cal th,d.to promote this alternative means of dispute resolution,the law minimizes judicial intervention in the proceedings,in part,by the doctrine of arbitral finality.moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at,d.thus,the general rule is that an arbitrator decision can not be reviewed for errors of fact or law.citation.aguilar lerner cal th,d.b oth because it vindicates the intentions of the parties that the award be final,and because an arbitrator is not ordinarily constrained to decide according to the rule of law,it is the general rule that,the merits of the controversy between the parties are not subject to judicial review.citations.more specifically,courts will not review the validity of the arbitrator reasoning.citations.further,a court may not review the sufficiency of the evidence supporting an arbitrator award.citations.moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at,d.
there are limited grounds whereby a court may vacate or correct an arbitration award.code civ.the only statutory basis on which plaintiff relies is that t he arbitrator exceeded his powers and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted.code civ,subd,a.an appellate court reviews a determination of whether an arbitrator has exceeded his or her powers de novo,but displays substantial deference towards the arbitrator determination of his or her contractual authority.jordan department of motor vehicles th,d see also belgum th,d.all reasonable inferences must be drawn in support of the award.ajida technologies,roos instruments,th,d.
the trial court gave two reasons for vacating the arbitration award it enforced a covenant not to compete that violated california law,and it erroneously obligated plaintiff to pay part of the arbitration fees and expenses.on appeal,plaintiff relies on these and several additional grounds to affirm the order.
the enforceability of the covenant not to compete 
plaintiff argued,and the trial court agreed,that the arbitrator erred by both applying new jersey law to determine the enforceability of paragraph and upholding the covenant not to compete.in addition,plaintiff contends the arbitrator exceeded his powers by award ing humanscale monetary damages arising from an alleged violation of the covenant not to compete and by unlawfully reform ing the covenant to make it enforceable.
plaintiff relies on business and professions code section,which declares that every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession,trade,or business of any kind is to that extent void.cases recognize section represents a strong public policy of this state citations.citation.playhut,th,d.and in application group,hunter group,th,d,the court affirmed a declaratory relief judgment in favor of a california corporation which had challenged the validity of a covenant not to compete,in a maryland corporation agreement.it held,california has a materially greater interest than does maryland in the application of its law to the parties dispute,and california interests would be more seriously impaired if its policy were subordinated to the policy of maryland.id.at,d.
however,notwithstanding business and profession code section,none of the cases on which plaintiff relies,including application group,involved judicial review of an arbitrator findings as to the enforceability of a covenant not to compete in a contract containing a provision applying the law of another state.the agreement here authorized arbitration of a ny dispute involving the performance,interpretation of sic breach of this agreement or the relationship created hereby,including disputes involving discrimination and other rights and protections afforded by law paragraph also expressly authorized an arbitrator to modify any part of the noncompetition covenant found unenforceable.the language is broad enough to include both the question of what state law applied to paragraph and the validity of the noncompetition clause,both of which the arbitrator decided.
this is a classic case of the trial court declining to confirm an arbitration award because it disagrees with the merits of the decision.generally,when faced with a petition to confirm or vacate an arbitration award,a court may not review the merits of the parties controversy or claims that the arbitrator decision is either legally or factually erroneous.moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at,d.a rbitrators do not exceed their powers merely by assign ing an erroneous reason for their decision.citations.id.at,d.nor can an award be vacated because the arbitrator reached an erroneous decision.ibid.in this case,the trial court did exactly what the supreme court in moncharsh said it could not do review the merits of the arbitrator findings concerning the applicable law and the interpretation and enforceability of the contract noncompetition clause.obviously,the merits include all the contested issues of law and fact submitted to the arbitrator for decision.the arbitrator resolution of these issues is what the parties bargained for in the arbitration agreement.ibid.
plaintiff relies on an exception recognized in moncharsh for limited and exceptional circumstances justifying judicial review of an arbitrator decision,where a contract contains an illegal provision and granting finality to an arbitrator decision would be inconsistent with the protection of a party statutory rights.citation.moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at,d.in moncharsh,the supreme court declined to apply the exception to a provision in an attorney employment contract with his former law firm that the attorney claimed violated the rules of professional conduct.the court described the matter as essentially an ordinary fee dispute.id.at,d.and the cases have limited this exception to situations where private arbitration itself would impede a statutory right.
two supreme court decisions applied the exception in circumstances where the court concluded legislative enactments expressly or impliedly created an impediment to the resolution of an issue by private contractual arbitration.aguilar lerner,supra,cal th at,d,in dispute between attorney and former client,enforcement of retainer agreement private arbitration clause would violate client rights under mandatory fee arbitration act bus,et and thus exceed the arbitrator powers board of education round valley teachers cal th,d,ed.code section is an explicit legislative expression of public policy that issues involving the reelection of probationary teachers not be subject to arbitration,thereby barring arbitrator enforcement of collective bargaining agreement procedures that limited school district dismissal of probationary teachers.
intermediate appellate decisions have also applied the exception in similar limited circumstances.jordan department of motor vehicles,supra,th at,d exception applied to vacate million attorney fee award in statutorily authorized arbitration that limited award to maximum of million city of palo alto service employees internat.union th,d vacating arbitrator award reinstating employee because it violated court order issued under code civ,enjoining employee return to workplace alternative systems,carey th,d same as aguilar lerner,supra,cal th,d.
but the issue here is different.the agreement authorized the arbitrator to determine both the applicable law and the enforceability of the covenant not to compete.marsch williams th,d even where application of a particular law or body of law is required by the parties arbitration agreement,an arbitrator failure to apply such a law is not in excess of an arbitrator powers.as discussed more fully below,if a party challenges the validity of a contractual provision other than the arbitration clause itself,the issue of the clause legality is subject to arbitration.moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at,d.
furthermore,the arbitrator findings and decision on the enforceability of the covenant not to compete were not palpably erroneous under california law.contrary to plaintiff assertion,a former employee right to pursue his or her lawful occupation is not without limitation.gordon landau cal d,found valid and enforceable a defendant agreement not to use plaintiffs confidential lists to solicit customers for himself for a period of one year following termination of his employment.id.at,see also john matull associates,cloutier d.while business and professions code section invalidates agreements which penalize a former employee for obtaining employment with a competitor,it does not necessarily affect an agreement delimiting how that employee can compete loral moyes d.section does not invalidate an employee agreement not to disclose his former employer confidential customer lists or other trade secrets or not to solicit those customers.while a court lacks the power to save an invalid covenant not to compete by reforming the agreement except where the parties have made a mistake kolani gluska th,d,when interpreting the provision,it must construe it to be lawful if possible.loral moyes,supra,d at.
consequently,the trial court erred in vacating the award because it disagreed with the arbitrator findings on the applicable law and the enforceability of the noncompetition clause.
plaintiff obligation to pay a portion of the arbitration fees and expenses 
the arbitrator directed that the parties each pay of the arbitration fees.while this portion of the award violated california law,the court erred by vacating the entire award on this ground.
