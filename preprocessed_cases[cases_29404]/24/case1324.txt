a city employee was terminated for alleged sexual harassment of a subordinate.the employee denied harassment and challenged his termination as lacking just cause.the dispute was submitted to arbitration,as mandated by the terms of a collective bargaining agreement between the city and the employee union.the arbitrator ordered the employee reinstated upon concluding that the sexual harassment charge was because the collective bargaining agreement required any disciplinary action to be implemented within six months of the city learning of the alleged misconduct,and the city did not act in time.
the city petitioned the court to vacate the award on public policy grounds,and the court did so.code civ.the court held that the arbitrator violated public policy against sexual harassment in the workplace by relying upon the contractual limitation provision to award reinstatement on purely procedural grounds without a determination of whether the employee actually harassed his subordinate.

dean vigil was employed by respondent city of richmond city for years,from january until june,when he was terminated upon allegations of sexual harassment and dishonesty in denying the allegations.vigil was employed as a recreational project coordinator for the city recreation department and is a member of appellant service employees international union,local union.the union represented vigil during the internal grievance,arbitration,and trial court proceedings.the union continues that representation on appeal where it contests the trial court ruling vacating the arbitration ruling.
the claims of sexual harassment were formally investigated by the city in september,when the city retained an attorney to conduct a investigation concerning allegations of sexual harassment made by tamika cooper,a program recreation leader who reported to vigil.during the course of the investigation,allegations of sexual harassment by another one of vigil subordinates,jasmine harris,were included in the investigation.in april,the investigator concluded that vigil engaged in the behavior the two women alleged.later that same month,the city gave notice to vigil that it proposed to terminate his employment and gave him an opportunity to respond to the charges of misconduct contained in the notice of adverse action.skelly state personnel bd.cal d.
specifically,the city charged defendant with sexual harassment of harris and dishonesty in denying harassment of cooper when interviewed by the investigator.the charge of sexual harassment was stated in the notice to vigil as follows on or about december,a city employee you formerly supervised,jasmine harris,recreation leader,informed the city that you had sexually harassed her between june and august when you were her supervisor.specifically,you spoke to harris about her shape stating that she has a nice body.additionally,you commented on her nipples and told harris that you liked to please women and eat pussy.harris reported that you made these comments on several occasions.further,you invited harris to accompany you to japan and offered to take her and her daughter to marine world.your comments made harris uncomfortable and caused harris to request a transfer to another community center.an independent investigation was conducted into harris allegations and the investigator concluded that you did make the statements delineated above.
the charge of dishonesty was stated in the notice to vigil as follows on or about october,and march,you were interviewed by an investigator,karen kramer,retained by the city to investigate the allegations of sexual harassment brought forth by tamika cooper and jasmine harris.you were dishonest during the investigatory interviews.kramer concluded in her april,investigatory report that you were not honest with her when you denied sending text messages of a personal nature and that you made a blatant lie about the text messages.the investigator had credited cooper claim that vigil sent cooper text messages saying yep,u r da,a sexy to sic,yeah i want u,and other personal messages,and rejected vigil assertion that he sent cooper only text messages.
the city notice of adverse action stated that it was disciplining vigil for his dishonesty in denying sexual harassment of cooper,and not for the sexual harassment itself,because the memorandum of understanding mou between the city and union states that no disciplinary action can be taken more than six months after the alleged inappropriate behavior has come to the attention of a management representative.in contrast to cooper claims of sexual harassment,harris claims were supposedly not reported to the city until december,just four months before the april notice of proposed termination.the city thus proceeded on harris claim of sexual harassment,and relied upon cooper claims to show a pattern of harassing behavior and dishonesty in denying the behavior to the investigator.
at the union request,a hearing was held in may on the city proposed termination of vigil.at the hearing,vigil disputed the charges of sexual harassment and dishonesty.the city was not persuaded and,on june,formally notified vigil that he was terminated effective the following day.the union asked that the employment grievance be referred to arbitration,as provided in the mou,and the city agreed to arbitration.
the city states,without contradiction,that the arbitration hearing was held over the course of two days in june and july of.we do not have a transcript of the arbitration hearing,only the parties briefs and the arbitrator decision dated october.the partial record we have indicates that several city employees testified at the hearing,including vigil and harris.cooper did not testify.
the arbitrator concluded that the claim that vigil sexually harassed harris was because the city learned of the alleged misconduct in august not in december as it said yet took no disciplinary action until april,after the contractual limitation period expired.the arbitrator also concluded that the claim that vigil was dishonest in denying harassment of cooper was unsupported by the evidence because cooper never testified at the hearing and thus never established that there was any harassment.based upon these conclusions,the arbitrator determined that there was no just cause for termination and ordered vigil reinstated.
the city petitioned the trial court to vacate the arbitration award,and the union petitioned to confirm the award.code civ.the court vacated the award.the court found that the arbitrator violated public policy.the court noted that the arbitrator relied upon the contractual limitation provision requiring timely discipline to order reinstatement on purely procedural grounds,without a determination of whether vigil harassed his subordinates,and found that reinstatement without findings on what the employee did violates the strong public policy against sexual harassment in the workplace.the union,on behalf of vigil,appeals.
ii.discussion 
the sole question on appeal is whether the arbitration award violates public policy.the city does not challenge the arbitrator factual determinations that the city failed to discipline vigil within six months of learning of harris sexual harassment allegations and failed to support its claims of dishonesty concerning cooper allegations.the city focus is on the question of whether the arbitrator violated public policy by ordering vigil reinstated without first making an affirmative finding that vigil did not engage in sexual harassment.put another way,did the arbitrator violate public policy in reinstating an accused sexual harasser where the sexual harassment claim was and the truth or falsity of the claim was never adjudicated 
there is a strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution.moncharsh,supra,cal th at.typically,those who enter into arbitration agreements expect that their dispute will be resolved without necessity for any contact with the courts.ibid.because the decision to arbitrate grievances evinces the parties intent to bypass the judicial system and thus avoid potential delays at the trial and appellate levels,arbitral finality is a core component of the parties agreement to submit to arbitration.id.at.judicial review of arbitration awards is therefore extremely limited.a n arbitrator decision is not generally reviewable for errors of fact or law.id.at.
there are specified statutory grounds for vacating or correcting an arbitration award,none of which is applicable here.code civ.the city tries to fit this case into the statutory framework by arguing that an arbitrator exceeds his or her powers in issuing an award that violates public policy.code civ,subd.a.but excess of power and violation of public policy are more properly understood as distinct concepts.an arbitrator has exceeded his or her powers if the arbitrator strayed beyond the scope of the parties agreement by resolving issues the parties did not agree to arbitrate moncharsh,supra,cal th at,ordered an unauthorized remedy advanced micro devices,intel,supra,cal th at,or resolved issues board of education round valley teachers cal th.public policy,on the other hand,is an exception rooted in common law and stems from a court power to refuse enforcement of illegal contracts.united paperworkers international union,misco,moncharsh,supra,at.a court refusal to enforce an arbitrator award under a agreement because it is contrary to public policy is a specific application of the more general doctrine,rooted in the common law,that a court may refuse to enforce contracts that violate law or public policy.misco,supra,at.in any event,whether an arbitration award in violation of public policy may be properly categorized as an award in excess of the arbitrator power is largely a semantic matter that need not detain us.the key consideration for our purposes is that the public policy exception must be applied with care.
t he normal rule of limited judicial review may not be avoided by a claim that a provision of the contract,construed or applied by the arbitrator,is illegal,except in rare cases when according finality to the arbitrator decision would be incompatible with the protection of a statutory right.moncharsh,supra,cal th at.absent a clear expression of illegality or public policy undermining this strong presumption in favor of private arbitration,an arbitral award should ordinarily stand immune from judicial scrutiny.id.at.
we are also conscious of the fact that the arbitration award here was issued under a collective bargaining agreement.california has a strong public policy favoring collective bargaining agreements,or mou,in the public employment sector.social services union alameda county training employment bd.d.accordingly,i n reviewing arbitration awards in the field,courts are generally more restricted in their power to vacate than in other types of arbitration.id.at.
here,the city and union bargained for arbitration of disputes over employee disciplinary actions,and bargained for a limitation period providing that n o disciplinary action or reprimand may be implemented more than six months after the alleged inappropriate behavior has come to the attention of a management representative.the arbitrator found that the city did not implement disciplinary action on the sexual harassment claims in the time allotted by the mou,and the city does not challenge that factual determination.the city does challenge the arbitrator enforcement of the contractual limitation period.the city maintains that the arbitration award violates public policy against workplace sexual harassment by ordering reinstatement of an accused sexual harasser on procedural grounds,without an affirmative determination that vigil was innocent of sexual harassment.
the existence of a strong public policy against sexual harassment in the workplace is indisputable.the public policy on this point is well defined and clearly expressed in state and federal law,a,a.the relevant question,however,is not whether there is a public policy against sexual harassment generally but whether according finality to the arbitrator decision would be incompatible with that public policy.moncharsh,supra,cal th at.the city has not established that the public policy against sexual harassment precludes a labor arbitrator from ordering an accused harasser reinstated where the accusations are under a negotiated and reasonable limitation period.
an instructive case is city of palo alto service employees international union th.in that case,a city employee was fired for threatening to shoot a coworker,and the arbitrator ordered the fired employee reinstated.id.at.the trial court confirmed the arbitration award and the city appealed upon claims that reinstatement conflicted with an injunction preventing the fired employee from entering the workplace and violated public policy against workplace violence.id.at.the sixth district court of appeal found that the award should be vacated because it conflicted with the injunction but rejected the claim founded on public policy.id.at.the court acknowledged that there is an explicit public policy requiring employers to take reasonable steps to provide a safe and secure workplace but concluded that the city has not established that the public policy entails the obligation to automatically fire any employee who makes a threat of violence regardless of the employee intent in uttering it and the actual risk to workplace safety and regardless of the procedural guarantees secured by collective bargaining and set forth in a memorandum of understanding between a union and a city.while a city might be required to summarily place an employee on administrative leave to fulfill its duty of providing a safe workplace where the city has reasonable proof that an employee has made a credible threat of violence against a coworker,nothing permits a city to entirely ignore the grievance procedures to which it agreed when following them does not compromise workplace safety.id.at,italics added.
here,procedural guarantees secured by collective bargaining required the city to implement disciplinary action within six months of the alleged harassment coming to the attention of a management representative.the union argues that the limitation period is reasonable,and observes that it is the same length of time as the limitation period for an employee filing harassment claims with the united states equal employment opportunity commission.e.the city makes no effort on appeal to demonstrate that the limitation period is unreasonably short.nor did the city challenge the reasonableness of the limitation period during the administrative and arbitration proceedings.in fact,the city itself relied upon the limitation period in deciding to charge vigil with harassment of only one of two subordinates.
as noted above,the city notice of adverse action stated that it was disciplining vigil for sexual harassment of harris and dishonesty in denying sexual harassment of cooper.the city said it was charging vigil with dishonesty concerning cooper,and not for sexual harassment,because the mou between the city and union states that no disciplinary action can be taken more than six months after the alleged inappropriate behavior has come to the attention of a management representative.the city proceeded with harris claims of sexual harassment on the supposition that those claims had not been reported to the city until december,just four months before the april notice of proposed termination.but the arbitrator found that harris claim had actually been reported to the city in august,making the claim untimely.it is the impact of that factual determination by th
