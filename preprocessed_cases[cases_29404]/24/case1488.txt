six mine workers appeal from an order dismissing their complaint based on their employer failure to allow a second meal break for the shifts they were working.a statute requires that two meal breaks be allowed for shifts of that length.but an order of the industrial welfare commission iwc exempts employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement.the principal issue before us concerns the validity of that order.we find that the exemption contravenes the statute and is invalid.
we also reject the employer argument that the collective bargaining agreement between the employer and their employees union requires that the employees arbitrate these claims.the parties raise an issue as to the retroactive application of our decision invalidating the iwc order.as we shall explain,except for application of labor code section,that issue must be litigated on remand.we also determine that the iwc and plaintiffs union are not indispensable parties to this litigation.

plaintiffs are employees of borax,borax,at its open pit mine operations in boron,california.they allege that they are required to work consecutive hours for each shift,but were given only one meal break per shift.they sued borax for denial of rest periods and meal periods mandated by labor code sections and,subdivision a and by iwc order regulating wages,hours and working conditions for certain occupations in the construction,drilling,logging and mining industries.of,tit,hereafter the wage order or order.they also sued for failure to pay wages due upon termination and for unfair business practices in violation of business and professions code section.plaintiffs sought statutory penalties,unpaid wages,injunctive relief,and attorney fees and costs.
borax removed the case to the united states district court on the basis of federal preemption.that court adjudicated the first cause of action,which was for denial of rest periods,on the basis of preemption,and remanded the remainder of the causes of action to the los angeles superior court.on remand,borax demurred to the complaint.it argued that the meal period exception in the wage order relieves it of the obligation to provide a second meal break,that the order does not apply to plaintiffs because their employment is governed by a collective bargaining agreement,and alternatively,that under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement,plaintiffs claims must be arbitrated.borax also argued that the union representing plaintiffs is an indispensable party.
plaintiffs opposed the demurrer on the grounds that the iwc exceeded its authority in adopting the wage order provision exempting employees covered by collective bargaining agreements from the meal period requirements of section.wage order,e.they also argued that the meal period claims need not be arbitrated.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and entered final judgment in favor of borax.plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.service was made on the california attorney general pursuant to business and professions code section and california rules of court,rule a.
discussion 
we first consider whether the iwc exceeded its authority in adopting section e of the wage order,which exempts employees covered by qualifying collective bargaining agreements from meal period requirements.we begin with a brief review of the statutory scheme.
the iwc was a appointive board established by the legislature in,authorized to formulate wage orders governing employment in california collins overnite transportation th,d collins.in,in response to the iwc elimination of daily overtime rules in certain industries,the legislature passed and the governor signed assembly bill reg.sess,the restoration and workplace flexibility act of.stats,ch,the act.among other things,this legislation restored the workday and mandated that the iwc conduct public hearings and adopt consistent wage orders,subd.a,including orders pertaining to meal and rest periods.see national steel and shipbuilding superior court th,d national steel collins,supra,th at,d.the act established a new statutory scheme governing hours of labor and overtime compensation for all industries and occupations.collins,supra,th at,d.
the legislature enacted two provisions relating to meal periods.the first,section,was enacted in.stats,ch.assem.bill.in pertinent part,it provides a an employer may not employ an employee for a work period of more than five hours per day without providing the employee with a meal period of not less than minutes an employer may not employ an employee for a work period of more than hours per day without providing the employee with a second meal period of not less than minutes,except that if the total hours worked is no more than hours,the second meal period may be waived by mutual consent of the employer and the employee only if the first meal period was not waived.
later in the regular session,additional legislation was introduced to strengthen the enforcement of existing wage and hour standards contained in current statutes and wage orders.assem.com.on labor and employment,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced.section was enacted as part of that legislation effective on january.it states a no employer shall require any employee to work during any meal or rest period b if an employer fails to provide an employee a meal period or rest period,the employer shall pay the employee one additional hour of pay at the employee regular rate of compensation for each work day that the meal or rest period is not provided.
the iwc adopted wage order,effective january,governing employees in construction,drilling,logging,and mining.of,tit.section of the wage order governs meal periods.subdivisions a and b track the language of section,subdivision a a no employer shall employ any person for a work period of more than five hours without a meal period of not less than minutes,except that when a work period of not more than six hours will complete the day work the meal period may be waived by mutual consent of employer and employee.see labor code section.b an employer may not employ an employee for a work period of more than ten hours per day without providing the employee with a second meal period of not less than minutes,except that if the total hours worked is no more than hours,the second meal period may be waived by mutual consent of employer and employee only if the first meal period was not waived.see labor code section.
borax relies on section e of the wage order in arguing that its employees are exempt from the second meal period requirement collective bargaining agreements.subsections a,b,and d of section,meal periods,shall not apply to any employee covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement if the agreement expressly provides for the wages,hours of work,and working conditions of the employees,and if the agreement provides premium wage rates for all overtime hours worked and a regular hourly rate of pay for those employees of not less than percent more than the state minimum wage.
plaintiffs argue that the iwc exceeded its authority in enacting section e because it creates an additional exemption for employees governed by collective bargaining agreements,beyond the exemptions expressly included in section.section provides only two exceptions to the requirement that employees who work more than hours per shift be given two meal periods.neither applies here.one allows waiver of the second meal period by mutual consent of the employer and employee,subd.a.it is undisputed that plaintiffs worked hour shifts and did not consent to waive their second meal period.the other exempts workers in the wholesale baking industry,subd.c.there is now a third provision specifically applicable to employees in the motion picture and broadcasting industries.
s tatutes governing conditions of employment are construed broadly in favor of protecting employees.national steel,supra,th at,d lusardi construction aubry cal th,d.we construe wage orders,as regulations,in accordance with the standard rules of statutory interpretation.collins,supra,th,d.
the authority of an administrative agency to adopt regulations is limited by the enabling legislation.a n administrative regulation must be within the scope of authority conferred and in accordance with standards prescribed by other provisions of law.whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt regulations to implement,interpret,make specific or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute,no regulation adopted is valid or effective unless consistent and not in conflict with the statute and reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute.agnew state bd.of equalization cal th,d,agnew.
even apart from these statutory limits,it is well established that the rulemaking power of an administrative agency does not permit the agency to exceed the scope of authority conferred on the agency by the legislature.california emp.com.kovacevich cal d.a ministerial officer may not under the guise of a rule or regulation vary or enlarge the terms of a legislative enactment or compel that to be done which lies without the scope of the statute and which can not be said to be reasonably necessary or appropriate to subserving or promoting the interests and purposes of the statute.first industrial loan daugherty cal d.and,a regulation which impairs the scope of a statute must be declared void.association for retarded citizens department of developmental services cal d,morris williams cal d.agnew,supra,cal th at,d,colmenares braemar country club,cal th,d.

here we are asked to determine whether the iwc exceeded its authority in creating a meal period exemption not codified in section.as we have seen,the legislature expressly created two exemptions to the meal period requirement in enacting section.plaintiffs invoke the general rule that where exceptions to a general rule are specified by statute,other exceptions are not to be presumed unless a contrary legislative intent can be discerned.mountain lion foundation fish game com.cal th,d.under the maxim of statutory construction,expressio unius est exclusio alterius,if exemptions are specified in a statute,we may not imply additional exemptions unless there is a clear legislative intent to the contrary.wildlife alive chickering cal d.sierra club state bd.of forestry cal th,d.
borax argues that the legislative history of the statute supports the regulatory exception.we are not persuaded.
first,borax cites section in every prosecution for violation of any provision of this chapter,the standard conditions of labor fixed by the commission iwc shall be presumed to be reasonable and lawful.this raises a presumption.a presumption established to implement some public policy other than to facilitate the determination of the particular action in which the presumption is applied,such as the policy in favor of establishment of a parent and child relationship,the validity of marriage,the stability of titles to property,or the security of those who entrust themselves or their property to the administration of others shifts the burden of proof.evid.code.buzgheia leasco sierra grove th,d.
the presumption of section implements the public policy in favor of the validity of iwc work orders,and thus constitutes a presumption shifting the burden of proof.it places the burden of proof as to the nonexistence of the presumed fact on the party against whom the presumption operates.haycock hughes aircraft th,d.plaintiffs satisfied their burden by establishing that wage order section e conflicts with section by creating a new exception not authorized by the legislature.the presumption of section is overcome.
next,borax invokes the authority delegated by the legislature to the iwc to adopt standard conditions of labor through wage orders.specifically,borax cites statutes authorizing the adoption of meal period orders,beginning with section.borax cites the former version of section,before it was amended in,instead of the current version.the impact of the amendment is significant.the former version provided notwithstanding any other provision of law,the industrial welfare commission may adopt or amend working condition orders with respect to break periods,meal periods,and days of rest for any workers in california consistent with the health and welfare of those workers.italics added.
in,the legislature amended the introductory clause of section so that it now reads except as provided in section stats,ch,italics added.the senate third reading analysis for senate bill,the legislative vehicle for the amending statute,states this bill clarifies two provisions of the labor code enacted in chapter.labor code section codifies the duty of an employer to provide employees with meal periods.labor code section establishes the authority of iwc to adopt or amend working condition orders with respect to break periods,meal periods,and days of rest.this bill provides that iwc authority to adopt or amend orders under section must be consistent with the specific provisions of labor code section.italics added.senate bill reg.sess.was an urgency statute which took effect immediately in september.stats,ch.
as we have seen,section specifically excepts the requirements of section from this grant of authority to the iwc.plaintiffs argue that borax can not establish that a work order exempting employees from the second meal period requirement of wage order section a is consistent with the health and welfare of those workers as required by section.in response,borax asserts i n view of the fact that meal periods usually are not paid,arguments about whether mandatory meal periods truly promote the health and welfare of employees can go both ways.for instance,many employees would prefer to spend the additional time pursuing other interests.moreover,the iwc,by exempting union employees,is leaving the employees protection in the hands of the unions,which are much better suited than the iwc to determine what contractual provisions are in the best interests of the employees health and welfare.no support or authority is cited for these assertions.
we conclude that section,as amended in,does not authorize the iwc to enact wage orders inconsistent with the language of section.
borax also argues that section e of the wage order is authorized by section,subdivision b.section,subdivision a states the industrial welfare commission may establish exemptions from the requirement that an overtime rate of compensation be paid pursuant to section and for executive,administrative,and professional employees,provided that the employee is primarily engaged in the duties that meet the test of the exemption,c
