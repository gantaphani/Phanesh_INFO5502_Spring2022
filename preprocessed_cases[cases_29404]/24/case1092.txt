in this set of consolidated appeals,plaintiffs are former or current employees of the drummond company,the company and members of the united mine workers of america the union who were suspected of stealing goods from the company.they appeal the grant of summary judgment to the company and the union concerning alleged violations of the employee polygraph protection act eppa.we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
plaintiffs worked in the company coal mine in shoal creek,alabama until they were discharged by the company in.plaintiffs watson and owens were accused of stealing various items from the company and plaintiffs gaines,johnson,and tucker were accused of both selling controlled substances on the premises and paying another employee,terry clark,to steal items for them.the company discharged the plaintiffs based on the statements of clark,who earlier had been investigated by local police officers for thefts of company property.in exchange for a reduced sentence,clark agreed to cooperate with the company investigation.as a result of the company investigation,employees,including eighteen union members,either resigned or were discharged.
pursuant to the union agreement with the company,the company must have just cause for terminating the employment of union members.the procedure for discharging union employees takes four steps.at step,the company issues a notice of suspension with intent to discharge and the employee may challenge the discharge by speaking to his foreman.at step,if the discharge is maintained,a company representative and local union representatives meet to discuss the matter.at step,if the matter is not resolved,then it is discussed by a union district representative and a company representative,neither of whom participated in earlier discussions about the discharge.fourth and finally,if there is still disagreement about the discharge propriety,the matter will be referred to an arbitrator.the arbitrator decision is final.
the union and the company followed this procedure with the investigated union members.two of the eighteen discharges were resolved in step or step meetings.the remaining discharges were discussed in a set of meetings taking place in the first week of april,prior to the official step meeting.at the first meeting,the union offered to accept the company proposed drug policy in return for the reinstatement of the remaining sixteen employees.the company then allowed the reinstatement of some employees but not the plaintiffs.the union proposed that the plaintiffs,with the exception of johnson,be given the option to take polygraph tests if a plaintiff passed he would be reinstated with back pay and an apology.the company agreed.at some point,the company also said that terry clark would also take a polygraph test.if he failed the test with respect to a particular plaintiff,that plaintiff would be reinstated with back pay and an apology.
on april,the plaintiffs had individual step meetings.pursuant to the union proposal and the company agreement,watson,gaines,owens and tucker told that each could immediately be reinstated by taking a polygraph test or choose to have his case arbitrated.each plaintiff opted for arbitration.on april,terry clark took a polygraph test which indicated that his statements against the plaintiffs were truthful.
all of the plaintiffs had their cases arbitrated except tucker.his grievance was dropped by the union for two reasons.first,the union thought the evidence against him was too strong.second,he did not respond to the union representatives requests for a meeting so that the union could prepare for his arbitration.the arbitrations were held in june and july of.the evidence against each plaintiff consisted of the testimony of terry clark and the testimony of the company investigator.in addition,for all the remaining plaintiffs except johnson,clark polygraph examiner testified as to clark truthfulness.
the arbitrators upheld the dismissals of all the remaining plaintiffs except johnson.for each of the dismissed plaintiffs,the arbitrator based his decision both on the testimony of terry clark and the results of clark polygraph test 
in contrast to his fellow plaintiffs,johnson prevailed before his arbitrator.he was ordered reinstated without back pay.during the arbitration,johnson stated that he had not been given the opportunity to take a polygraph test.on,the company then offered him the chance to take a polygraph which he declined.
ii.standard of review 
in reviewing a district court grant of summary judgment on claims arising under the eppa,we review conclusions of law de novo and draw all factual inferences in favor of the party.polkey transtecs,cir.we affirm a grant of summary judgment only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.
iii.discussion 
this case raises three questions.first,did the company engage in an activity described in second,if so,was its conduct nonetheless permitted under the ongoing investigation exemption of d and finally,can the union be sued as an employer for the purposes of the eppa each is discussed in turn.
a.did the company engage in an activity described in 
as an employer that engages in interstate commerce,the company must comply with the eppa.stating that the act applies to employers engaged in or affecting commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.plaintiffs contend that they have raised genuine issues of material fact concerning the company alleged violations of,prohibiting employers from asking for lie detector tests,and a,prohibiting employers from punishing employees for failing to take lie detector tests.
with respect to plaintiffs watson,gaines,owens,and tucker,the company conduct did not fall within.
under,an employer may not directly or indirectly require,request,suggest,or cause any employee or prospective employee to take or submit to any lie detector test.with respect to these four plaintiffs,the request or suggestion that they take a polygraph test was made,not by the company,but by the plaintiffs own agent,the union.although the fact of such a request is a factual issue,in this case,there is no genuine issue of material fact with respect to the request,and by whom made.plaintiffs,in their brief on appeal,concede that the union proposed that the company give a polygraph test to plaintiffs in order to get their jobs back.the record supports the concession.the tests were proposed by the union as a means for the employees to prove their innocence.it is also clear that the tests were offered to watson,gaines,owens,and tucker pursuant to the union proposal.it was agreed that,if the results were favorable,plaintiffs would automatically be reinstated in their positions otherwise,each case would be arbitrated.there is no evidence that the company influenced the union to request the polygraph exams.under these circumstances,it is the union,not the employer,who is deemed to have requested the polygraph exam for purposes of the statute.
we also conclude that there is no genuine issue of material fact with respect to the union agency status it is clear that the union was acting in the interest of,and for the benefit of,its members,including these four plaintiffs.we conclude that when the polygraph exam was offered to an employee pursuant to a request therefor by the employee or his or her agent in order to benefit the employee by providing an opportunity to prove his or her innocence,then the employer has not violated.
johnson and.
because the factual issues surrounding the polygraph offer to johnson are less clear than with respect to the other four plaintiffs,and because those issues are inadequately briefed,we decline to address them.in light of our decision below with respect to the ongoing investigation exemption,those factual issues need not be resolved in this case.
did the company conduct fall within a 
for similar reasons,we decline to address plaintiffs claim that the company conduct fell within a,and instead turn directly to the company defense that its conduct is exempt pursuant to the ongoing investigation exemption 
does the company c
