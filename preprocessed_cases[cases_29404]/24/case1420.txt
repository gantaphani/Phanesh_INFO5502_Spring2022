facts and procedural background 
the complaint 
eastland is a professional medical corporation that operates as an independent practice association commonly referred to as an ipa consisting of approximately primary care and specialist physicians who provide health care in the san gabriel and pomona valleys and the inland empire in connection with discussions about the potential purchase of eastland by heritage,a corporation that contracts with health plans to provide care to health plan members,eastland and heritage executed a confidentiality agreement on november,prohibiting heritage from disclosing eastland confidential information to or for the benefit of any person or entity other than heritage.
after the acquisition negotiations foundered,a number of physicians terminated their contracts with eastland and entered new agreements with heritage.on december,eastland filed a complaint against heritage,two allegedly affiliated ipas,regal and covina and four physicians with whom eastland had contracted to provide medical services to prevent the destruction of its network of primary care physicians.in its first cause of action eastland alleged heritage had breached the confidentiality agreement by disclosing to regal and covina eastland confidential information,including the number and identity of eastland health plan members,the identities of eastland primary care physicians and the financial terms of eastland contracts with both its physicians and the health plans.
in the second cause of action,which it only asserted against the physicians,eastland alleged the physicians had each breached the primary care physician provider agreement pcp agreement they had entered into with eastland,which proscribes use or disclosure of eastland trade secrets for any purpose other than that which is medically necessary to provide services to eastland health plan members eastland alleged the physicians wrongfully disclosed to heritage,regal covina confidential information regarding eastland plan members as well as contract terms between the physicians and eastland,including the amount of capitation payments eastland paid them and the services that were excluded from the capitation agreement eastland further alleged the physicians had breached the pcp agreement by failing to provide sufficient notice of termination.finally,eastland alleged the pcp agreement prohibits the physicians from soliciting eastland health plan members and then,in the fifth and sixth causes of action,alleged heritage and regal induced the physicians to breach their contract by persuading them to do just that.even though eastland does not expressly allege in its breach of contract cause of action that the physicians wrongfully solicited eastland health plan members,in the proceedings before the trial court and in this writ proceeding,all parties have considered this one of the bases for the contract claim.for example,in its return by answer to the order to show cause,eastland states it has alleged two material breaches by the physicians solicitation and disclosure of confidential information.
based upon heritage use and disclosure of eastland confidential information allegedly obtained during the parties negotiations,eastland alleged claims against heritage,regal and covina for violation of the uniform trade secrets act,civil code section et third cause of action,intentional interference with contractual relations fourth cause of action,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage fifth cause of action and violation of business and professions code section sixth cause of action.an allegation common to these claims is that heritage,regal and covina induced the physicians to breach their pcp agreements by terminating them immediately,rather than upon notice,by disclosing eastland confidential information and,as discussed above,by soliciting eastland health plan members.
grant of the physicians petition to compel arbitration denial of the ipas motion to stay and the writ petition 
the physicians motion to compel arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provision in the pcp agreement was granted on june.arbitration was scheduled for december.
on july,the trial court denied heritage and regal motion to stay the remainder of the litigation pending the outcome of the arbitration the court stated,i not finding that there are no similar issues or no issues that are exactly the same.but i am finding that not all issues are the same,and in the balance of things there not enough similar issues to stay the civil litigation while the arbitration pending.disagreeing with heritage and regal contention one common issue was sufficient to mandate a stay,the court observed,if all it takes is one same issue then it should be an easy writ to get and i wo take offense if i wrong.
heritage and regal petitioned this court for a writ of mandate compelling the trial court to vacate its order denying their motion for a stay and to issue a new order granting the motion.heritage and regal also sought an immediate stay of the trial court proceedings.on october,we issued an order to show cause why the requested relief should not be granted and the following week stayed all trial court proceedings.
