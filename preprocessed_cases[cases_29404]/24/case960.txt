introduction 
this case arose from the response by aramark facility services aramark to a letter from the social security administration ssa,which indicated that aramark had reported information for of its employees at the staples center in downtown los angeles that did not match the ssa database.suspecting immigration violations,aramark told the listed employees they had three days to correct the mismatches by proving they had begun the process of applying for a new social security card.seven to ten days later,aramark fired the employees who did not timely comply.
local of the service employees international union seiu filed a grievance on behalf of the fired workers,contending the terminations were without just cause and thus in breach of the collective bargaining agreement cba between aramark and seiu.an arbitrator ruled for seiu and awarded the fired workers and reinstatement,finding there was no convincing information that any of the fired workers were undocumented.the district court vacated the award on the ground that it violated public policy.seiu timely appealed.
this case boils down to a single issue whether the ssa the fired employees aramark on constructive notice that it was employing undocumented workers.if so,the arbitrator award would force aramark to violate federal immigration law,and therefore was properly vacated as against public policy.if not,the award must stand.
as we explain below,aramark has not established constructive knowledge of any immigration violations.constructive knowledge is to be narrowly construed in the immigration context and requires positive information of a worker undocumented status.moreover,we are required to defer to the arbitrator factual findings even when evaluating an award for violation of public policy.accordingly,given the extremely short time that aramark gave its employees to return with further documents and the arbitrator finding that aramark had no convincing information of immigration violations,the employees failure to meet the deadline simply is not probative enough of their immigration status to indicate that public policy would be violated if they were reinstated and given backpay.therefore,the district court erred and the award must be confirmed.
ii.factual and procedural background 
a.the letter sent to aramark and aramark response 
aramark is a corporation that employs approximately people in the united states,and its facilities management division provides labor for the staples center,a sports and entertainment venue in downtown los angeles.in early,aramark received letters from the ssa notifying it that the social security numbers of some of its employees nationwide did not match those in the ssa database.aramark reacted to these letters by asking its regional managers to confirm that the information it provided ssa matched the information provided by employees and,if so,to require corrective steps from the employees they supervised.on april and,instructions were relayed to aramark employees working at the staples center,who were represented by seiu and employed pursuant to a cba between seiu and aramark.aramark instructions to the staples center employees read as follows 
please return to the ssa office to correct the discrepancy 
return to aramark facility services at staples center with one of two items.
a a new social security card,sic photo copies will not be accepted 
b verification form that shows a new card is being processed.
you have three working days from the date of this letter to bring either.you have days from the date of on your receipt to bring in your new card.
a new card or verification of renewal must be in the office no later then sic close of business on wednesday april.
if you fail to comply with this letter and you do not bring in the proper documents then unfortunately your employment with aramark will be terminated.
emphasis added.
no employee was aware of the policy before receiving the mismatch letter.believing the turnaround time was too onerous,seiu requested an extension,but aramark denied this request.
fifteen of the staples center employees obtained the requested documentation in time and continued to work.however,employees did not timely comply and were fired.the last day of work for virtually all of them was either april,or april.most were officially fired effective april,while a few were fired april.although the instruction letters from aramark stated that employees were expected to visit an ssa office and provide the initial documentation within three days,the employees were actually given seven to ten days to provide the required paperwork,though nothing in the record indicates that they knew they had this much time.the fired workers were told that they would be rehired if they supplied the required documentation nothing indicates when they received this information.
though it suspected immigration violations,aramark did not know for sure why the terminated employees did not provide additional documents and even argued to the arbitrator that they could have had valid work eligibility.each of the fired employees had,at the time they were hired,properly completed the federal employee eligibility verification form form and provided aramark with facially valid documents establishing their identity and eligibility to work in the united states.moreover,aramark was not notified by any federal agency that its workers were suspected of being undocumented.
arbitration 
after the terminations,seiu filed a grievance on behalf of the staples center employees,contending that aramark had violated the cba by firing them without just cause.pursuant to the cba,the matter was submitted to binding arbitration.over two days of hearings,the parties presented testimony concerning the letters,aramark obligation to comply with applicable tax and immigration laws,and the procedures by which the staples center employees were fired.
ultimately,the arbitrator concluded that there was no convincing information that any of the terminated workers were undocumented.he thus found that the firings were without just cause,ruled in favor of seiu,and awarded the workers and reinstatement.
district court proceedings 
after the arbitrator ruling,aramark filed a complaint in district court to vacate the arbitration award,and seiu to confirm it.the parties filed for summary judgment,and at a hearing held september,the district court ruled in favor of aramark.the court reasoned that because the fired employees failed to indicate that they were beginning the process of correcting the ssn mismatch,aramark had constructive notice that they were ineligible to work in the united states.therefore,the court held that the arbitrator award of reinstatement and violated public policy because it would require aramark to violate the immigration laws.seiu timely appealed.

we review vacation of arbitration awards like any other district court decision accepting findings of fact that are not clearly erroneous but deciding questions of law de novo.barnes logan,cir quoting first options of chicago,kaplan,d.here,the district court resolved the matter on the parties for summary judgment,which necessarily present questions of law.we must therefore decide de novo whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.see olsen idaho state bd.of,cir arakaki hawaii,cir stating standard for.
iv.discussion 
a.the legal standard for review of the arbitrator award 
the scope of review of an arbitrator decision in a labor dispute is extremely narrow.federated dep t stores united food commercial workers union,local,cir.arbitration awards are ordinarily upheld so long as they represent a plausible interpretation of the contract.phoenix newspapers,phoenix mailers union local,cir.however,one narrow exception to this generally deferential review is the rule that a court need not,in fact can not,enforce an award which violates public policy.stead motors automotive machinists lodge,cir en banc accord sfic properties,int l ass of machinists aerospace workers,cir.t he question of public policy is ultimately one for resolution by the courts.united food commercial workers int l union,local foster poultry farms,cir.the public policy exception is aramark sole basis for attacking the arbitration award in this case.
to vacate an arbitration award on public policy grounds,we must find that an explicit,well defined and dominant policy exists here and that the policy is one that specifically militates against the relief ordered by the arbitrator.id.at citations and quotation marks omitted accord grace local union,int l union of united rubber,cork,linoleum plastic workers of,d.in evaluating a public policy argument,we must focus on the award itself,not the behavior or conduct of the party in question.cal.gas utility workers union of,local,cir.we have stressed that courts should be reluctant to vacate arbitral awards on public policy grounds,because t he finality of arbitral awards must be preserved if arbitration is to remain a desirable alternative to courtroom litigation.arizona power,berkeley,cir.moreover,before the award will be vacated as against public policy,the policy violation must be clearly shown.stead motors,at quoting united paperworkers int l union,misco,d.
importantly,the public policy inquiry proceeds by taking the facts as found by the arbitrator.the parties did not bargain for the facts to be found by a court,but by an arbitrator chosen by them.nor does the fact that it is inquiring into a possible violation of public policy excuse a court for doing the arbitrator task.id.at quoting misco,at.accord,tanner,cir bd.of county comm rs of lawrence county,ohio robert kimball,cir see also int l of workers,local niagra mohawk power,cir i n reviewing an arbitral award for possible violations of public policy a court is not authorized to revisit or question the or the reasoning which produced the award.dupont de nemours grasselli employees indep.ass n,cir rejecting a public policy attack because it would require this court to facts found by the arbitrator,disapproved on other grounds by misco,at.accordingly,in evaluating whether the arbitrator award violated public policy here,we will not revisit the arbitrator factual findings,in particular the finding that there was no convincing information that any of the terminated workers were undocumented.
as we explain below,aramark has identified a sufficiently explicit,and dominant public with immigration,in the proper case,would be the basis for vacating an arbitration award.however,the policy in this case does not specifically militate against the arbitrator award of reinstatement and.
the asserted public policy 
the main public policy to which aramark points is expressed in the immigration reform and control act of irca,stat.specifically,aramark cites the laws that employers are subject to civil and criminal liability if they employ undocumented workers knowing of their undocumented status,and the term knowing includes constructive knowledge.see a,l.we agree that these policies are germane to the arbitrator reinstatement award because they would necessarily be violated if aramark knowingly reinstated undocumented workers.they are also germane to the award because the supreme court has held that immigration policy precludes such awards to undocumented workers.hoffman plastic compounds,nlrb,d.these policies are explicit,and dominant,expressed not by general considerations but by the irca,its implementing regulations,and supreme court case law interpreting it.they are therefore an adequate basis for aramark public policy attack.see cal.gas,at quoting misco,at.
whether the policy specifically militates against the award 
the more difficult question is whether these policies specifically militate against the arbitrator award is,whether the arbitrator award would have forced aramark to reinstate and provide to undocumented workers where aramark had constructive knowledge that they were undocumented.see a,l.
as defined in the relevant regulation,c onstructive knowledge is knowledge that may fairly be inferred through notice of certain facts and circumstances that would lead a person,through the exercise of reasonable care,to know about a certain condition.l.we have stressed that,for purposes of the irca,constructive knowledge is to be narrowly construed 
irca is delicately balanced to serve the goal of preventing unauthorized alien employment while avoiding discrimination against citizens and authorized aliens.the doctrine of constructive knowledge has great potential to upset that balance,and it should not be expansively applied.the statute prohibits the hiring of an alien knowing the alien is an unauthorized alien with respect to such employment.a a emphasis added.insofar as that prohibition refers to actual knowledge,as it appears to on its face,any employer can avoid the prohibited conduct with reasonable ease.when the scope of liability is expanded by the doctrine of constructive knowledge,the employer is subject to penalties for a range of undefined acts that may result in knowledge being imputed to him.to guard against unknowing violations,the employer may,again,avoid hiring anyone with an appearance of alienage.to preserve congress intent in passing the employer sanctions provisions of irca,then,the doctrine of constructive knowledge must be sparingly applied.
collins foods int l,ins,cir.in collins,we reversed an alj holding that the employer had constructive knowledge of an immigration violation because it had extended an offer of employment over the telephone and overlooked that the employee social security card was fraudulent.see id.at.we distinguished other cases finding constructive knowledge on the grounds that the employer there did not have positive information that the employee was undocumented.id.at.in those distinguishable cases,on which aramark relies heavily here,the ins specifically visited the employer and notified it that its employees were suspected unlawful aliens and should be terminated if inspection of their documents did not allay the concerns.see new el rey sausage ins,cir mester ins,cir 
here,aramark essentially argues that two facts gave it constructive notice of immigration violations the letters themselves and the employees responses or lack thereof.we address each contention in turn.
a.the letters themselves 
given the narrow scope of the constructive knowledge doctrine,the letters themselves could not have put aramark on constructive notice that any particular employee mentioned was undocumented.to understand why,some background on the purpose of the letters is helpful.the ssa routinely sends the letters when an employer records differ from the ssa database regarding an employee social security number ssn.when there is a discrepancy,the ssa can not post an employee social security earnings to his or her account,and instead must deposit the funds into a national earnings suspense fund,which is a very large fund containing more than million mismatched records and totaling more than billion.social security number issues hearing before the subcomms.on social security and oversight of the comm.on ways and means,cong,statement of patrick,ssa inspector general,available at formmode printfriendly id last visited june,the inspector general of the ssa believes that the chief cause of wage items being posted to the earnings suspense fund instead of an individual earnings record is unauthorized work by noncitizens.id.however,the main purpose of the letters is not,but rather is simply to indicate to workers that their earnings are not being properly credited.see id.statement of james lockhart,iii,deputy commissioner of social security,available at http waysandmeans.house.gov hearings.asp formmode printfriendly id last visited june.
in addition to misuse by undocumented workers,ssn mismatches could generate a letter for many reasons,including typographical errors,name changes,compound last names prevalent in immigrant communities,and inaccurate or incomplete employer records.by ssa own estimates,approximately million of the million entries in its database called numident contain errors,including about million entries that citizens as aliens.congressional response report accuracy of the social security administration numident file,available at.socialsecurity.gov oig adobepdf audittxt a.htm last visited june.
as a result,an ssn discrepancy does not automatically mean that an employee is undocumented or lacks proper work authorization.in fact,the ssa tells employers that the information it provides them does not make any statement about immigration status and is not a basis,in and of itself,to take any adverse action against the employee.social security number verification service handbook,available at last visited june.this information is included in the letters,and was added at the urging of advocacy groups such as amicus national immigration law center to combat abuses by employers who assumed that the workers mentioned in the letters were undocumented.
moreover,employers do not face any penalty from ssa,which lacks an enforcement arm,for ignoring a letter.the irs also imposes no sanctions stemming from the letters.it requires no additional solicitations of an employee ssn unless it sends a penalty notice to the employer indicating that the ssn is notice aramark does not contend it received.internal revenue service pub.reasonable cause regulations and requirements for missing and incorrect at,available at last visited june.the irs also does not require any reverification of a worker documents following receipt of a mismatch notice from the ssa.see id.at.
to the same effect are statements from the office of special counsel of practices,which is an agency of the department of justice authorized to investigate unfair employment practices.see c.the office of special counsel states that a no match does not mean that an individual is undocumented and that employers should not use the mismatch letter by itself as the reason for taking any adverse employment action against any employee.office of special counsel,frequently asked questions,available at.gov crt osc htm facts.htm verify last visited june.
as aramark notes,the department of homeland security dhs recently has taken steps to use the letters in its enforcement of the immigration laws.in june,dhs proposed to amend,which sets forth dhs interpretations of terms including knowing,to include receipt of letters in its discussion of constructive knowledge.procedures for employers who receive a letter,june.after some changes prompted by extensive public comment,see,the proposed amendment was adopted and the resulting regulation currently provides in relevant part 
the term knowing includes having actual or constructive knowledge.constructive knowledge is knowledge that may fairly be inferred through notice of certain facts and circumstances that would lead a person,through the exercise of reasonable care,to know about a certain condition.examples of situations where the employer may,depending on the totality of relevant circumstances,have constructive knowledge that an employee is an unauthorized alien include,but are not limited to,situations where the employer f ails to take reasonable steps after receiving information indicating that the employee may be an alien who is not employment authorized,such as w ritten notice to the employer from the social security administration reporting earnings on a form that employees names and corresponding social security account numbers fail to match social security administration records.
l emphases added.so,even the dhs regulations,which were adopted after aramark received the letter at issue here and are currently subject to a preliminary injunction would not treat the letter by itself as creating constructive knowledge of an immigration violation.instead,the regulations would look further to the totality of the circumstances and whether the employer took reasonable steps after receiving the letter.
in sum,the letters aramark received are not intended by the ssa to contain positive information of immigration status,and could be triggered by numerous reasons other than fraudulent documents,including various errors in the ssa numident database.indeed,the letters do not indicate that the government suspects the workers of using fraudulent documents.rather,they merely indicate that the worker earnings were not being properly credited,one explanation of which is fraudulent ssns.this falls short of the positive information from the government that was held to provide constructive notice in mester and new el rey and held lacking in collins.see collins,at.without more,the letters did not provide constructive notice of any immigration violations.
employees reactions 
aramark also maintains that constructive notice resulted from the fired workers reactions to the letters and aramark directive to return quickly with documents from the ssa.it argues that it provided the employees a reasonable time in which to correct their ssn discrepancies,and that their failure to do so is sufficiently probative of their immigration status to rise to the level of constructive notice that they were undocumented.
we disagree.though the question is a close one,two considerations weigh against a finding of constructive notice here the arbitrator findings,and the short turnaround time.moreover,contrary to the district court conclusion,the analysis is unaffected by aramark offer to rehire any terminated employees who later came forward with proper documentation.
the arbitrator findings 
first,as we indicated above,the entire inquiry must proceed in light of the arbitrator finding that there was no convincing information that any of the fired workers were undocumented.the arbitration came down to essentially the same question that the court must answer here whether it could be said that the fired workers were undocumented.the arbitrator weighed the same evidence that the parties point to,and concluded that none of it constituted convincing information of immigration violations.while it is true that it is ultimately for the court to determine whether the arbitrator award would violate public policy,foster poultry farms,at,his factual findings are not up for discussion,see,misco,at,and weigh strongly against aramark position.put simply,it is difficult to conclude that aramark had constructive notice meaning positive information of a fact when there was no convincing information of it 
the turnaround time 
second,and related,is the extremely short time period in which the workers were told they should respond before they would be fired.both parties spin the record to some says the workers had only three days to respond,while aramark stretches the period to days.in fact,workers were told they had three days from the postmark of a letter from aramark to return with further a new social security card,or a verification form from ssa that a new card was being processed.if the worker returned with the verification form,they would still have to provide a new card within days.
this adds up to an extremely demanding policy.the initial deadline was from the of the letter from aramark,so,given at least one day in the mail,it meant workers had at most two days to respond.and in these two days,the workers were expected to gather information that would prove to ssa that they were entitled to a social security number,perhaps obtain legal representation,and navigate their way to an ssa office during business hours while still attending to whatever work and family obligations they had.it seems entirely many of the staples center employees concluded they could not meet the initial deadline,and then simply stopped trying.nothing in the record indicates otherwise,and indeed nothing indicates that the workers understood beforehand that they would actually have seven to ten days before their terminations became effective 
notably,and contrary to aramark contention,its reverification policy was significantly more accelerated than the one envisioned by the federal safe harbor regulations which,as we mentioned above,were promulgated after the arbitrator ruling in this case and are currently subject to a preliminary injunction.as currently written,employers would qualify for the that is,not be subject to prosecution on a constructive knowledge theory so long as they asked the employees to provi
