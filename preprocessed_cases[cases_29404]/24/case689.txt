on april,advance cast stone company acs filed a complaint seeking to vacate an arbitration award issued against it and in favor of bridge,structural and reinforcing iron workers,local union iron workers local or the iron workers.see.on september,the district court entered a judgment affirming the arbitration award.on october,acs filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment.see.e.on july,the district court granted acs motion,reversed its earlier affirmance of the arbitration award and entered a judgment in favor of acs.the iron workers timely appealed.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.collective bargaining history 
acs engages in the manufacture,delivery and installation of architectural precast concrete and other products used in construction.acs has worked with two unions that are relevant to this appeal.the principal union that performs work for acs is the mason contractors association of greater chicago and illinois district council of the international union of bricklayers and allied craftsmen bricklayers.acs has been bound by a series of collective bargaining agreements with the bricklayers since the late.
acs also has had occasion to engage members of the iron workers local to work on its projects.iron workers local bargains with the associated steel erectors of chicago,illinois association for employees performing iron work in certain counties.the iron workers entered into a series of collective bargaining agreements with the association,commonly known as the principal agreement.acs is not a member of the association however,in,acs signed identical compliance agreements with the iron workers.according to the compliance agreements,acs agreed to be bound to the principal agreement.
on november,acs submitted to the iron workers written notice of termination,and,effective,the compliance agreements were terminated.after that time,acs was no longer bound to the terms of the principal agreement,nor did acs enter any other agreement with the iron workers.acs president,matt garni,testified that he preferred to use bricklayers because they are better able to handle the work and because the iron workers wage and benefits costs are higher than the bricklayers costs.
after the principal agreement was terminated in,acs began to do a number of projects in the chicago area,the iron workers territory.in july or august of,acs began working on the block project.originally,acs crew consisted only of bricklayers however,after some iron workers working for other subcontractors threatened to walk off the job,acs entered into a short form agreement with the iron workers.in this agreement,dated august,acs agreed,among other matters,to make certain payments to the iron workers trust funds.the short form agreement,unlike the previous compliance agreements,did not refer specifically to or incorporate the principal agreement.after the short form agreement was executed,acs completed the block project with a composite crew of bricklayers and iron workers.acs subsequently agreed to apply the short form agreement to two other projects cathedral place and rush garage in late and early.
between august and the end of,acs worked on ten additional projects within the iron workers territory in nine of the ten projects,a crew was used without protest from the iron workers.
the goodman theatre project and the joint arbitration board award 
in,acs worked on a number of other projects in the iron workers territory with crews the iron workers did not protest.in august or september of,however,acs began working on the goodman theatre project.it began the job with an crew,but the iron workers threatened to picket in protest.this action prompted acs to file an unfair labor practice charge with the national labor relations board nlrb.acs contended that the iron workers picketing threat violated b d of the national labor relations act nlra,b d,and it sought a hearing under k of the nlra,id.k however,the iron workers notified the nlrb that it was disclaiming interest in the work,and,accordingly,the nlrb dismissed the unfair labor practice charge.
despite disclaiming this work,on or about november,the iron workers submitted a grievance for arbitration with the joint arbitration board jab,an arbitration body created under the iron workers principal agreement to resolve disputes.the iron workers grievance alleged acs course of conduct bound it to the principal agreement and acs violated the principal agreement by refusing to employ members of iron workers local at the goodman theatre project.the course of conduct to which the grievance referred included actions taken by acs after signing the short form agreement that were consistent with the principal agreement but not specifically required by the short form agreement.for example,the iron workers alleged that,since the execution of the short form agreement,acs had provided certificates of insurance,did not cancel a wage and fringe benefit bond until february,and had complied with union audits.all these actions were in compliance with,and pursuant to,the terms of the principal agreement.
on january,the jab held a hearing.acs argued that the jab lacked jurisdiction over acs because acs was not a signatory to or otherwise bound by the principal agreement.the jab disagreed and concluded that,since august,when acs signed the short form agreement,acs had been bound by the iron workers principal agreement.accordingly,held the jab,it had jurisdiction over the dispute.the jab also found that acs had violated the principal agreement by refusing to hire iron workers at the goodman theatre site and other unspecified job sites.as a remedy,the jab ordered acs to submit to a payroll audit under the terms of the principal agreement and to pay wages and benefits due for any work that should have been assigned to iron workers since august.
on april,acs filed an action in district court that sought vacation of that award.acs again took the position that it was not bound by the principal agreement,and,accordingly,that the jab lacked jurisdiction.as will be described more fully below,the district court rendered its first decision on september,in which it confirmed the arbitration award.however,at the time it rendered that decision,the district court was unaware that the same parties were litigating the issue in a k proceeding before the nlrb,and,indeed,that the nlrb had handed down its k determination just days earlier.the action that prompted the proceeding,and the nlrb determination therein,are described below.
the deerfield project and the nlrb k determination 
around may of,acs began working on the nine parkway or deerfield project with a crew.the iron workers picketed.its members carried signs claiming breach of contract.on may,acs filed an unfair labor practice charge against iron workers local,alleging that it was violating b d of the nlra,b d,by engaging in proscribed activity with an object of forcing acs to assign the work at the deerfield project to it rather than to bricklayers.acs claim under b d triggered a k investigation and ultimately a k proceeding before the nlrb on september,just four days before the district court entered its decision affirming the jab award,the nlrb issued its k determination.the nlrb noted that,in order for it to be able to proceed with a determination of a dispute under k,it had to find,inter alia,that the parties ha d not agreed on a method for voluntary adjustment of the dispute,attachment at.on this issue,the nlrb held 
w e find there is no voluntary mechanism for resolving this dispute.thus,the employer is not a signatory to the iron workers principal agreement or to any agreement containing such a mechanism.the agreement the employer signed with respect to block the short form agreement makes no reference to the principal agreement and neither do the employer letters consenting to use of composite crews at the cathedral place and rush garage construction sites.the employer is not a signatory to any agreement between the iron workers international and the bricklayers international unions,and clearly not to an agreement that requires the use of composite bricklayer and iron worker crews for the work in issue or the submission of disputes to the joint boards.therefore,none of the agreements cited by the iron workers are binding on the employer.moreover,the agreements that the employer operated under in the face of picketing,threats to picket,or joint board decisions are devoid of reference to mechanisms for the resolution of jurisdictional disputes,and therefore,can not bind the employer to jcb or jab processes.
id.at citation omitted.in a footnote,the nlrb further noted 
the iron workers argues that the employer is bound by the principal agreement under the jab award.we find no merit in that contention.the award fails to state the basis for the jab finding that the employer is bound to the principal agreement even though it is not signatory to that agreement or to any other agreement implicating it.see,operating eng rs local kenneth foeste masonry,nlrb,declining to give weight to arbitrator decision lacking rationale.
on the merits of the k jurisdictional dispute,the nlrb concluded that the bricklayers were entitled to perform the work in dispute.the nlrb explained that,
a lthough various iron workers documents arguably cover work of the type in issue,the employer terminated its agreement with iron workers effective may.with the exception of the agreements discussed above,which do not obligate the employer at any other sites,the employer is not signatory to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement with the iron workers.
id.at emphasis added.finally,the nlrb noted that,although it usually limits the scope of its award to the matter that gave rise to the k controversy,because of the history of disputes between the parties and the likelihood of disputes in the future,it was appropriate to issue a blanket,prospective order.in this order,the nlrb held that the work at issue the deerfield dispute and all of acs work within the iron workers jurisdiction belonged to bricklayers.
district court proceedings 
september,decision 
after a bench trial,the district court issued its first opinion on september.the district court began by noting that t he central question in this case is whether advance cast stone was bound to the principal agreement at any time after august,the date the short form agreement was executed.at.if it was,then,under the principal agreement,the dispute regarding the goodman theatre project was properly before the jab,and the jab award would not be vacated the district court explained that,under this circuit case law,an employer may adopt a collective bargaining agreement by its actions or a course of conduct that demonstrates an intent to be bound,even if the employer has not signed that agreement.the court held that,although the evidence was close,acs did bind itself to the principal agreement and therefore rendered it susceptible to the jurisdiction of the jab on january.id.at.
july,decision 
on october,acs filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e.in its motion,acs argued that the nlrb ruling of september,undermined the decision of the jab and therefore required the district court to reconsider its decision affirming the jab award.the district court agreed,and,on july,it entered judgment in favor of acs.
in its july,decision,the court began with the settled proposition in this circuit that an nlrb decision issued pursuant to a k proceeding overrides a conflicting decision by an arbitrator.at.the court then explained that the jab award and the nlrb k determination conflicted.see id.at t he jab found that acs was bound to the principal agreement the nlrb found that it was not,and specifically noted that the jab had no jurisdiction over acs.although the jab did not directly address the deerfield project,the nlrb order makes clear that acs was not bound by the principal agreement to use iron workers at that site,either.because the court found the jab award in conflict with the nlrb k determination,and because the law compels that,in this situation,the nlrb determination takes precedence,the district court reversed its prior decision and held that the jab was without jurisdiction and its award must be vacated.
discussion 
when an arbitration award is in conflict with the decision of the nlrb in a k proceeding,the nlrb decision takes precedence.miron constr,int l union of operating eng rs,local,cir see also chauffeurs helpers local union mech.contractor,cir a board decision pursuant to a section k hearing takes precedence over an inconsistent arbitral decision.this principle flows from carey westinghouse electric,d should the board disagree with the arbiter the board ruling would,of course,take precedence and if the employer action had been in accord with that ruling,it would not be liable for damages under,and has been adopted by other circuits,see,white contracting local int l of workers,cir c ourts are not to enforce an arbitration award that conflicts with a k determination.
the iron workers do not dispute this settled principle but attempt to explain why it should not control the outcome of this case.the iron workers arguments are legal ones,and we therefore review them de novo.see slaney v.the int l amateur athletic fed n,cir explaining that,in reviewing a district court affirmation or vacation of an arbitrator award,this court reviews legal questions de novo and factual questions for abuse of discretion.after considering the iron workers submissions,we must agree with the district court that the principle controls the outcome of this case the k determination is in conflict with the arbitration award and,therefore,trumps that award.therefore,we affirm the district court july,decision vacating the arbitrator award.
first,the iron workers detail at great length that,both before and after the nlrb k decision,the district court had jurisdiction over the vacation action under of the labor management relations act lmra.this proposition is unquestionable,but it does not advance the iron workers cause.when a case involves both the interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement under section of the lmra and allegations of violations of the nlra,the federal district court and nlrb have concurrent jurisdiction.mkt.serv.ass produce,fresh frozen fruits,vegetables,fish,butter,eggs,cheese,poultry,florist,nursery landscape allied employees union,local.the district court had jurisdiction the statutory authority to determine whether acs was bound by the principal agreement and the implications that flow from that determination.what we must resolve is how,in exercising that jurisdiction,the court should have factored the conflicting k determination into its process 
the iron workers next argue that the jab determination is not in conflict with the nlrb k determination thus,the principle that courts are not to enforce an arbitration award that conflicts with a k determination is not triggered.white contracting,at.the iron workers note that the decisions technically involved different work.the jab was presented with the goodman theatre project and,by virtue of its damages award,addressed projects between august,when the short form agreement was signed,and january,when the jab issued its award.the nlrb order addressed the nine parkway or deerfield project,which took place in may,and,by virtue of its prospective order,future work.therefore,the iron workers local argues,there is no conflict and no reason why it should be precluded from seeking redress through its contractual remedy.
we believe that the district court was on solid ground in not taking such a limited view of the nlrb k determination.the nlrb k decision addressed the entire dispute,including the projects encompassed in the jab award.the nlrb discussed the history of the parties dispute,including the goodman theatre project,and,in the end,issued an order that acs was not bound to employ members of the iron workers.in issuing such a broad ruling,the nlrb explicitly departed from its normal path of considering only the particular controversy that gave rise to the k proceeding,attachment at.it took this unusual step because work of the kind in dispute has b
