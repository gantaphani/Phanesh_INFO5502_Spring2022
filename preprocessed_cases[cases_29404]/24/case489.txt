facts and prior proceedings 
the facts relevant to this appeal are as follows.continental hired mark johnson in as an aircraft mechanic.in august,johnson reported to work and was subjected to a random alcohol breath test as required by the department of transportation.the test established that johnson had a blood alcohol content bac of,which is above the legal limit for intoxication in texas.as a result,johnson was discharged.he subsequently filed a grievance contesting his discharge.to resolve the dispute,johnson,with the assistance of the international brotherhood of teamsters ibt,entered into a last chance agreement lca with continental.under the lca,johnson was permitted to return to work,provided he satisfied the terms of the agreement.the lca required that johnson 
submit to an evaluation by continental employee assistance program eap director 
complete a course of rehabilitation,if recommended by the eap director 
submit a letter of resignation to the eap director to be used to terminate his employment should he fail to satisfy the terms of the agreement or the recommended rehabilitation program 
agree he would be terminated if he subsequently failed any drug or alcohol test test positive for a bac of or greater 
agree to be subject to random testing for a set period of time 
complete a return to work alcohol test after release by the eap director.
pursuant to the terms of the lca,johnson met with the eap director for an evaluation,at which time he was diagnosed with alcohol dependency.he was thus required to complete an alcohol treatment program,which he did.prior to returning to work,johnson entered into an eap rehabilitation agreement eap agreement with continental,which set forth specific terms for his continued employment.the eap agreement included the following relevant provisions 
during the rehabilitation,commencing with the date of this agreement,any use of alcohol or illicit drugs will be considered a violation of this agreement.this includes mouthwash or other which may contain alcohol.if your doctor prescribes medication which contains drugs,you are required to inform the eap staff of such medication.
you are subject to testing during the rehabilitation period for not less than year or more than years.the test screens for drugs,plus alcohol.failure to report for a test will result in your termination 
you are responsible for maintaining contact with the eap manager on at least a monthly basis for the purpose of monitoring your progress 
at the time of the eap agreement,the eap director orally instructed johnson to avoid drugs and alcohol,including medications that may contain alcohol.
prior to returning to work,johnson was given,and passed,an alcohol test.
on march,johnson left the eap director a voicemail stating that he was taking cough medicine.although the eap director received the message,he never contacted johnson about it.on march,continental tested johnson for alcohol.johnson tested positive,apparently due to his ingestion of cough medicine.his bac was at his confirmation test,taken at,showed a bac of.
continental terminated johnson for consuming alcohol.johnson filed a grievance protesting his termination.the arbitrators,known as the system board the board,consisted of representatives of ibt and continental and a neutral chairperson.the board held an evidentiary hearing on johnson grievance.a majority of the board issued an opinion holding that the lca and the eap agreement were valid and binding,and that the board had jurisdiction to determine whether johnson violated the agreements the board concluded that johnson had not violated the lca or the eap agreement and ordered johnson reinstated.
on march,continental filed an action against ibt in the southern district of texas,seeking to vacate the board award.both parties moved for summary judgment.on january,the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order denying continental motion and granting ibt motion,and upholding the award.on february,the district court stayed the enforcement of the award,pending appeal.
continental appeals the district court ruling and seeks vacatur of the board award on the grounds that the district court applied the wrong standard of review under the rla the district court erred in upholding the award because the board exceeded its authority,by ignoring the plain language of the agreements and by substituting its judgment for that of the eap director and,even if the award were otherwise proper,the district court should have vacated it as violative of public policy.

standard of review 
this court must first determine whether the district court applied the appropriate standard of review in reviewing the board award.the rla governs disputes between airline carriers and their employees,with the stated purpose of avoiding interruptions to commerce that might result from such disputes.the rla establishes mandatory procedures for the resolution of both major and minor disputes.see consol.rail ry.labor exec.ass n,d.a major dispute involves the formation of collective bargaining agreements cbas agreements governing rates of pay,rules,or working conditions of employees,as a class.id.at.these disputes arise when it is alleged that a cba is not in place,or when a party seeks to change the terms of an existing agreement therefore,the issue is not whether an existing agreement controls the controversy.id.quoting elgin,burley.a minor dispute arises out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements covering rates of pay,rules,or working conditions.id.at.thus,a minor dispute arises out of the enforcement of an existing cba.id.under the rla,minor disputes must be resolved through binding arbitration before an adjustment board established by the union and the employer.id.continental and ibt agree that the underlying dispute is a minor dispute under the rla.
generally,arbitration awards arising from minor disputes are reviewable by a district court on narrow grounds.specifically,judicial review is limited to whether the board failed to comply with the rla whether the board failed to conform or confine itself to matters within the scope of its jurisdiction and whether the board decision was the result of fraud or corruption.q.normally,an award is deemed to be within the board jurisdiction when it is grounded in the cba.see delta queen steamboat dist.marine eng rs beneficial ass n,cir.absent one of these grounds,an award is binding upon the parties and the findings are conclusive.eastern air lines,transport workers union,cir.unless a court concludes that the board interpretation of the contract is wholly baseless and completely without reason,the board interpretation must stand.id.quoting gunther san diego.eastern ry,d.the supreme court has explained that in reviewing a board interpretation of a contract,
a court should not reject an award on the ground that the arbitrator misread the contract t he arbitrator award settling a dispute with respect to the interpretation or application of a labor agreement must draw its essence from the contract and can not simply reflect the arbitrator own notions of industrial justice.but as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.
