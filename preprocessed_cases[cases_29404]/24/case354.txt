opinion of the court 
in,after years of negotiation,a joint venture agreement the agreement was entered into between dupont china dpc,rhone poulenc fiber and resin intermediates rhodia fiber,and liaoyang petro chemical fiber company lypfc,a chinese entity.dpc and rhodia fiber are subsidiaries of dupont de nemours and company dupont and rhodia,sa rhodia respectively.the object of the year joint venture was to create sanlong nylon company limited sanlong to research,manufacture,and sell certain fibers.the joint venture ultimately failed and dupont,the parent of dpc,brought suit against rhodia fiber and its parent,rhodia,to recover,dupont says,not for breach of the agreement,to which it was not a party,but rather for breach of an oral agreement and fraudulent misrepresentations which occurred much later in time and as a result of which it was damaged.rhodia fiber and rhodia moved to dismiss the complaint on various grounds and to compel arbitration.the district court denied that motion in all respects,and an appeal was taken from the denial of the motion to compel arbitration and the denial of the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.we will affirm as to the former and dismiss the appeal as to the latter.
i.the joint venture agreement 
while dupont does not purport to have sued on the agreement itself,there is no dispute that the agreement was at the heart of the proceedings before the district court and is at the heart of this appeal.we begin,therefore,with the relevant provisions of the agreement and the background of how this litigation came to be.
each party to the,rhodia fiber and to contribute significant capital to the joint venture in relation to its interest in the venture.in,the parties agreed that 
a the company sanlong will be responsible for obtaining financing that is beyond or in addition to the company registered capital by borrowing funds from sources inside china or outside china.upon the unanimous affirmative vote of every director of the board,each party shall provide guaranties sic for such additional financing,in proportion to the party contribution to registered capital.a party may guarantee the company local currency or foreign currency borrowings,provided that the aggregate amount of all guaranties sic provided,by each party is in proportion to that party contribution to registered capital.if any party guaranty is not acceptable to the lender,that party shall,subject to any necessary approval of the relevant authorities,arrange a guaranty from a financial institution or other company acceptable to the lender.
b upon the unanimous affirmative vote of every director of the board in support of the company obtaining additional financing by way of borrowing from the parties,each party shall directly or indirectly provide loans for additional financing,in proportion to the party contribution to registered capital.the terms and duration of such loans shall be equitable among the parties and agreed upon by the board.
emphasis added.nothing in this paragraph obligated either parent or provide any guarantees or loans rather,guarantees loans were obligations of the subsidiaries.
even though the parent companies were not parties to the agreement,it was stated in the agreement that they would assist the company in the balancing of foreign exchange during the company initial years of operation by exporting tons and tons per year of nylon polymer flake respectively in accordance to the dupont polymer flake export sales agreement and rp polymer flake export sales agreement respectively.b.also,to ensure the success of the company,the agreement provided that the parties and their affiliates will not take action detrimental to the interest or of the company.a in conjunction with the agreement,dupont the parent entered into three related agreements with the joint venture company a supply agreement,a license contract and an export sales agreement.rhodia the parent also entered into a similar series of related agreements.
two provisions of the agreement are of particular relevance and,thus,particular importance here.first,the agreement contained an arbitration clause 
in the event any dispute or claim or difference of any kind whatsoever arises in connection with the interpretation or implementation of this contract a dispute,including any question regarding its existence,validity or termination,the parties shall attempt in the first instance to resolve the dispute through friendly consultations.if the dispute is not resolved in this manner within sixty days after one party has given both the other parties written notice of the existence of the dispute,then,the dispute shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in singapore in accordance with the arbitration rules of the singapore international arbitration centre saic for the time being in force.the tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators.the governing law of this arbitration shall be the substantive law of the prc and the language of arbitration shall be english.
emphasis added.second,the agreement provided that it was 
made for the benefit of lypfc,rhodia fiber,dch and their respective lawful successors and assignees and is legally binding on them.this contract may not be changed orally,but only by a written instrument signed by lypfc,rhodia fiber and dch and approved by the examination and approval authority.
after the joint venture failed,dupont filed a three count complaint against rhodia fiber and rhodia.in the first count,entitled third party beneficiary claims,dupont alleged that dupont,as the ultimate parent of dch and as the party required to provide loan guaranties sic on behalf of its subsidiary dch,was an intended party beneficiary of the joint venture contract,and that rhodia fiber materially breached the joint venture contract by,without limitation,failing to provide or secure the required loan guaranties sic.in the second count,entitled breach of agreement to secure and provide estoppel,dupont alleged that it was harmed by the breach by rhodia fiber and rhodia of a january oral agreement between dupont and the two defendants pursuant to which the defendants agreed to support the joint venture but did not thereafter provide or secure the requisite loan guarantees.in the third count,entitled fraudulent misrepresentation,dupont alleged that rhodia fiber and rhodia made false statements of fact to dupont with the intent to induce dupont subsidiary dch to commit substantial resources and investments to the business of the joint venture and to induce dupont to support the business of the joint venture by,inter alia,providing loan guaranties on behalf of the joint venture.
in response,the defendants moved to compel arbitration and to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction,insufficient service of process,failure to join an indispensable party,and forum non conveniens.dupont then filed a first amended complaint significantly altering its theory of liability.for starters,dupont dropped the first count of the complaint,which alleged a breach of the agreement to which it was an intended third party beneficiary.the first count of the amended complaint,entitled breach of agreement to secure and provide estoppel,instead mimicked the second count of the complaint,alleging that at a meeting on january,bruno desoyres on behalf of rhodia,the parent,and rhodia fiber,the subsidiary,entered into an oral agreement with dupont to further support the joint venture by securing and providing loan guarantees,and abide by the obligations contemplated by the agreement.according to the amended complaint,
during discussions regarding the epc contracts,representatives of rp expressed concerns regarding the joint venture which led dupont representatives to believe that the rp group was reluctant to perform obligations arising from the joint venture agreement.dch,as the party to the joint venture contract,and dupont as the ultimate parent of dch and the party providing the loan guaranties required to finance the epc contracts,desired to confirm the commitment of the rhodia group to the venture before executing of the epc contracts and incurring the further financial liabilities associated therewith.
at the request of the rhodia group desoy res,representatives of dch and dupont convened a meeting with desoyres in wilmington,delaware,on january.kenneth wall represented dupont and michael estep represented dch at this meeting.desoyres represented the interests of the rhodia group.
during the meeting,dupont and dch receive d assurance that the rhodia group would continue to support the joint venture and fully perform all the obligations contemplated by the joint venture contract as long as dupont and dch did.dch and dupont accepted and relied upon these assurances in proceeding with the joint venture,approving execution of the epc contracts and in agreeing to and ultimately providing loan guaranties pursuant to the joint venture contract.
dupont alleged that the rhodia group breached this oral agreement,and,thus,dupont named both the parent and the subsidiary in this count as well as the two remaining counts.the second count of the amended complaint mimicked the third count of the complaint,alleging that at the january meeting the rhodia group made false statements regarding its intent to support the joint venture and induced dupont by material misrepresentations to further support the joint venture.finally,the third count of the amended complaint alleged negligent misrepresentation based upon the same statements underlying the new second count.
as noted above,the district court denied defendants motion to dismiss the complaint and to compel arbitration,and they appealed.we turn to the issues we are called upon to decide.
should arbitration have been compelled as to a non signatory 
the thrust of this appeal is whether the district court erred in its refusal to compel arbitration there is no dispute that the agreement contained a valid and enforceable arbitration clause which required all disputes arising out of the agreement between the parties be submitted to binding arbitration in singapore.the only question is whether dupont,a to that agreement,is bound by that arbitration clause.similarly,there is no dispute that a can not be bound to arbitrate unless it is bound under traditional principles of contract and agency law to be akin to a signatory of the underlying agreement,chemrite pty,cir.appellants appeal from the district court conclusion that dupont was not bound to arbitrate because it was not a an intended third party beneficiary of the agreement,b the disclosed principal of its agent,dpc,a party to the agreement,or c equitably estopped from avoiding arbitration.we review the district court conclusions de novo.pritzker merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.
as we recently held 
the faa establishes a strong federal policy in favor of compelling arbitration over litigation.the act provides that if a party petitions to enforce an arbitration agreement,t he court shall hear the parties,and upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue,the court shall make an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement.the presumption in favor of arbitration carries special force when international commerce is involved,because the united states is also a signatory to the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards.the crefaa commits the courts of signatory states to refer parties to arbitration when the parties have agreed to arbitrate disputes.crefaa is enforced in the united states under chapter two of the faa.
sandvik ab advent international,cir internal citations omitted.the liberal policy favoring arbitration agreements is at bottom a policy guaranteeing the enforcement of private contractual arrangements,and under the faa,a court may only compel a party to arbitrate where that party has entered into a written agreement to arbitrate that covers the dispute,chemrite pty,cir arbitration is strictly a matter of contract.if a party has not agreed to arbitrate,the courts have no authority to mandate that he do so.
because arbitration is a creature of contract law,when asked to enforce an arbitration agreement against a to an arbitration clause,we ask whether he or she is bound by that agreement under traditional principles of contract and agency law.id.at.each of appellants theories for binding dupont to the arbitration clause,third party beneficiary,and equitable estoppel,is a recognized principle of contract or agency law applicable in the arbitration context.see,american arbitration ass n,cir listing ways in which have been bound to arbitration clauses see also dayhoff heinz,cir could not enforce arbitration clause against signatory where no exception applied,but successor to signatory could compel arbitration barrowclough kidder,peabody,cir compelling to arbitrate claims against and related,overruled on other grounds by pritzker merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.we consider them in turn.
was dupont a third party beneficiary 
appellants maintain that dupont was an intended third party beneficiary of the agreement and,thus,dupont is bound by the arbitration clause.the district court held that dupont was not a third party beneficiary and,even if it were,because the claims asserted by dupont do not arise from any third party beneficiary status under the agreement,dupont was not bound to arbitrate its claims as a third party beneficiary.the district court was correct.
in a series of cases,courts have allowed third party beneficiaries to compel arbitration against signatories of arbitration agreements.john hancock life ins.wilson,cir member of nasd which was bound by its membership to arbitrate disputes,was properly compelled to arbitrate by third party beneficiary of that agreement spear,leeds kellogg central life assurance,cir same with respect to nyse rules.in the reverse situation,we have also bound a third party beneficiary to a forum selection clause in the underlying contract.coastal steel tilghman wheelabrator,cir,overruled on other grounds by lauro lines chasser,d.thus,whether seeking to avoid or compel arbitration,a third party beneficiary has been bound by contract terms where its claim arises out of the underlying contract to which it was an intended third party beneficiary.
appellants rely heavily on coastal steel in attempting to show that dupont was as an intended third party beneficiary.in that case,a new jersey company,coastal steel,entered into a contract with farmer norton which contained an arbitration clause.to fulfill that contract,and at coastal suggestion,farmer norton contracted with tilghman for the purchase of a blast unit.the contract between farmer norton and tilghman contained a forum selection clause which named england as the forum.while in bankruptcy,coastal filed suit against,inter alia,farmer norton also bankrupt,tilghman,and its american parent alleging breach arising out of the farmer contract.the bankruptcy court and district court denied tilghman motion to dismiss in favor of the forum selection clause contained in the farmer contract.we reversed,and held that coastal,a to the farmer norton tilghman contract,was a third party beneficiary of that contract and,thus,was bound by the forum selection clause contained therein.coastal steel,at.we reasoned that carving out an exception to the enforcement of forum selection clauses against third party beneficiaries would be inconsistent with the law of contracts,which has long recognized that beneficiary status does not permit the avoidance of contractual provisions otherwise enforceable.id.at.by doing business with farmer norton knowing that farmer norton would,in turn,contract with tilghman in order to fulfill the underlying contract with coastal,coastal was an intended third party beneficiary of the farmer norton tilghman contract and could not avoid the forum selection clause when it sued for breach of that contract.id.
appellants argue that dupont,whose employees negotiated this contract,has admitted that it was obligated to make a loan guarantee on behalf of dupont china and that it was the intended beneficiary of the contract which allegedly required rhodia fiber to provide a similar guarantee.appellants br.at.this argument is flawed for at least two reasons.first,unlike the clear third party beneficiary relationship in coastal,there is no evidence that dupont was an intended third party beneficiary under the agreement.under delaware law,which is the law the parties discuss,to qualify as a third party beneficiary of a contract,a the contracting parties must have intended that the third party beneficiary benefit from the contract,b the benefit must have been intended as a gift or in satisfaction of a obligation to that person,and c the intent to benefit the third party must be a material part of the parties purpose in entering into the contract.guardian constr.tetra tech richardson,in order for beneficiary rights to be created,not only is it necessary that performance of the contract confer a benefit upon a third person that was intended,but the conferring of the beneficial effect on such,whether it be creditor or donee,should be a material part of the contract purpose.thus,if it was not the promisee intention to confer direct benefits upon a third party,but rather such third party happens to benefit from the performance of the promise either coincidentally or indirectly,then the third party will have no enforceable rights under the contract.appellants have not offered any evidence that dupont was anything more than an incidental third party beneficiary.
the parties to the agreement were only lypfc the chinese entity,rhodia fiber and dch moreover,the agreement provided that it was 
made for the benefit of lypfc,rhodia fiber,dch and their respective lawful successors and assignees and is legally binding on them.this contract may not be changed orally,but only by a written instrument signed by lypfc,rhodia fiber and dch and approved by the examination and approval authority.
the arbitration clause itself anticipated only three beneficiaries to the agreement,all of them parties.it stated that if disputes could not be resolved amicably and one party has given both of the other parties written notice of the existence of the dispute,then,the dispute shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in singapore in accordance with the arbitration rules of the singapore international arbitration centre saic for the time being in force.emphasis added.although dupont as the parent of dpc would certainly benefit from the success of dpc,dupont was not an intended third party beneficiary of the agreement any more than any parent who expects to benefit from the success of the business ventures of its subsidiary.
appellants argue,however,that dupont was a third party beneficiary because a dupont negotiated the agreement,b dupont claims mirror dupont china claims in arbitration,all of which stem from the joint venture contract,c dupont was positioned to derive more than shareholder benefits from the joint venture,and d dupont claimed in the initial complaint that it was a third party beneficiary of the agreement and that it was required to guarantee the joint venture company debt under the agreement.we disagree.
first,that dupont negotiated the agreement,without more,has nothing to do with whether it was a third party beneficiary.second,appellants err in their contention that dupont claims mirror dpc claims in arbitration.dpc is arbitrating the breach of the underlying agreement and seeking its lost profits and the recoupment of its investment whereas dupont is litigating its losses arising out of a oral agreement that was breached and misrepresentations made by appellants representative outside of the agreement third,appellants have offered nothing to support their bald assertion that dupont was positioned to derive more than shareholder benefits from the joint venture.while dupont related agreements at least potentially would have benefitted dupont,they do not render dupont an intended third party beneficiary of the agreement.fourth,although it was imprudent of dupont to have alleged in its initial complaint that it was a third party beneficiary of the agreement,the question of its status is ultimately for us to decide under applicable law.parenthetically,we note that it was also imprudent for dupont to allege,as it initially alleged,that it was required under the agreement to guarantee the joint venture debt.dupont now states,correctly,that under the agreement,dpc was required to provide a suitable guarantee and that,dupont,in turn,chose to provide that guarantee for dpc.
appellants third party beneficiary argument fails for yet another,perhaps more obvious,reason.appellants point out that t he court in coastal steel applied the forum selection clause to all claims that implicated the underlying contract to which coastal steel was beneficiary,including claims for negligent design,breach of implied warranty and misrepresentation.appellants br.at.coastal steel,its progeny and delaware law make clear that a third party beneficiary will only be bound by the terms of the underlying contract where the claims asserted by that beneficiary arise from its third party beneficiary status.industrial electronics ipower distribution group,cir third party beneficiary was not compelled to arbitrate claims because the claims did not arise out of the contract from which it derived its third party status spear,at.none of dupont amended claims,however,arise out of its alleged third party beneficiary status under the agreement rather,dupont claims arise from the misrepresentations allegedly made to it by appellants representative.those misrepresentations,while arguably related to the underlying agreement,do not relate to any third party beneficiary status created at the inception of the agreement 
next,appellants argue that dupont intimate involvement with the sanlong project renders it liable under traditional agency principles because dpc acted as dupont disclosed agent and,under principles of agency law,dupont is bound by dpc agreement.the district court correctly rejected this argument,a conclusion underscored by the fact that appellants have failed to cite either the relevant factors we should consider in determining whether dch acted as dupont agent or any case that would carry the day.
traditional principles of agency law may bind a to an arbitration agreement,american arbitration,cir.under delaware law 
one corporation whose shares are owned by a second corporation does not,by that fact alone,become the agent of the second company.however,one independent of a second assume the role of the second corporation agent in the course of one or more specific transactions.this restricted agency relationship may develop whether the two separate corporations are parent and subsidiary or are completely unrelated outside the limited agency setting.under this second theory,total domination or general alter ego criteria need not be proven.
when one corporation acts as the agent of a disclosed principal corporation,the latter corporation may be liable on contracts made by the agent.liability may attach to the principal corporation even though it is not a party named in the agreement.
unlike the alter the corporate veil theory,when customary agency is alleged the proponent must demonstrate a relationship between the corporation and the cause of action.not only must an arrangement exist between the two corporations so that one acts on behalf of the other and within usual agency principles,but the arrangement must be relevant to the plaintiff claim of wrongdoing.
phoenix canada oil texaco,cir citations omitted.to bind a principal by its agent acts,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the agent was acting on behalf of the principal and that the cause of action arises out of that relationship.id.
appellants rely principally on ryan sons,rhone poulenc textile,cir and phoenix canada in support of their agency argument.in phoenix canada,we did not apply agency principles but,instead,remanded for the district court to make this inquiry.moreover,we noted that the agency relationship must relate to the cause of action alleged in the complaint.it is far from clear that this case passes that test.appellants reliance on ryan sons is also misplaced.the fourth circuit never cited to agency principles and merely permitted a signatory to arbitrate its claims against a parent company where that parent company was willing to submit to arbitration.ryan sons,at.the court noted,however,held that a court may refer claims against a parent to arbitration when the claims against the parent and the subsidiary are based on the same facts and are inherently inseparable.id.at.no such claim can be made here.
appellants also invoke pritzker merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir,but pritzker is inapposite.in pritzker,we bound an agent to the principal arbitration agreement.here,appellants seek to hold a principal to an agent agreement and the rationale of pritzker does not apply with equal force.in pritzker,a trustee of a pension plan sued its broker,merrill lynch,and a related company to recover for violations of erisa.merrill lynch moved to compel arbitration and the district court denied that motion.we reversed,holding that a the trustees were bound to arbitrate their claims against merrill lynch as signatories to a binding arbitration agreement,and b over the trustees objection,the trustees were bound to arbitrate the dispute against the individual broker and the sister company,neither of which signed the aforementioned agreement.specifically,with respect to the broker,we found that where the principal is bound to arbitration and the complaints arise out of the agent conduct on behalf of that principal,the agent is bound by the principal agreement to arbitrate disputes.id.at.with respect to the sister company,we summarily found that company bound as an agent and possibly as an of merrill lynch.id.
in the case sub judice,unlike pritzker,appellants seek to hold dupont liable as a principal,not as an agent moreover,unlike pritzker,dupont could act on its own.
appellants attempt to bind dupont on agency principles fails.
equitable estoppel 
finally,appellants argue that dupont is equitably estopped from avoiding the arbitration clause in the agreement.we have never applied an equitable estoppel theory to bind a to an arbitration clause although there appears to be no reason why,in an appropriate case,we would refrain from doing so.
as the second circuit recently explained,there are two theories of equitable estoppel in this context.first,courts have held to an arbitration clause when the knowingly exploits the agreement containing the arbitration clause despite having never signed the agreement,american arbitration,cir.second,courts have bound a signatory to arbitrate with a at the nonsignatory insistence because of the close relationship between the entities involved,as well as the relationship of the alleged wrongs to the nonsignatory obligations and duties in the contract and the fact that the claims were intimately founded in and intertwined with the underlying contract obligations.id.at quoting sunkist soft drinks,sunkist growers,cir quoting mcbro planning dev.triangle const,cir internal quotation marks omitted.appellants reliance on the first of these two theories stands on somewhat stronger ground than their reliance on the second.
under the first theory,courts prevent a from embracing a contract,and then turning its back on the portions of the contract,such as an arbitration clause,that it finds distasteful.see,american bureau of shipping tencara shipyard,cir bound by contract under which it received the direct benefits of lower insurance and the ability to sail under the french flag,at finding only indirect benefit insufficient to invoke equitable estoppel against a.as the fourth circuit explained,in the arbitration context,the doctrine recognizes that a party may be estopped from asserting that the lack of his signature on a written contract precludes enforcement of the contract arbitration clause when he has consistently maintained that other provisions of the same contract should be enforced to benefit him.to allow a plaintiff to claim the benefit of the contract and simultaneously avoid its burdens would both disregard equity and contravene the purposes underlying enactment of the arbitration act.international paper schwabedissen maschinen anlagen gmbh,cir internal citation omitted.
generally,these cases involve who,during the life of the contract,have embraced the contract despite their status but then,during litigation,attempt to repudiate the arbitration clause in the contract.see,tencara shipyard,at derived benefit from contract and could not avoid the arbitration clause contained therein here,there is no evidence that dupont embraced the agreement itself during the lifetime of the agreement,or that it received any direct benefit under the agreement.thus,in a strict sense,these cases do not help appellants 
what gives us some pause,however,is that a close examination of the amended complaint reveals that,at bottom,dupont claims against the subsidiary,rhodia fiber,arise,at least in part,from the underlying agreement.parenthetically,it is difficult to decipher exactly what dupont claims each appellant has done giving rise to liability because in its amended complaint dupont lumps them together as the rhodia group,just as in the complaint,it lumped them together as rp.
the amended complaint does not allege only that rhodia,the parent,breached its oral agreement to provide loan guarantees to its subsidiary.if this were dupont only claim in this case,the amended complaint would have named one,and only one.instead,the amended complaint also named rhodia fiber,the subsidiary,as a defendant because,dupont alleges,rhodia fiber breached its oral promise to dupont that it would continue to abide by its obligations in the agreement,securing loan guarantees for the joint venture.to the extent that dupont presses a claim against rhodia fiber for breaching its oral commitment to perform under the agreement,dupont alleges a claim which can well be argued a embraces the underlying agreement and b requires proof that rhodia fiber ultimately breached the underlying agreement.the question,then,is whether having alleged that it entered into a separate oral agreement with rhodia fiber binding rhodia fiber to the very obligations it undertook in the agreement,dupont is now equitably estopped from avoiding another provision of the agreement,the arbitration clause.this is a close call.
on the one hand,we must be careful about disregarding the corporate form and treating a like a signatory.on the other hand,by alleging,albeit by virtue of a separate oral agreement,that rhodia fiber failed to secure loan guarantees,dupont claim against rhodia fiber implicates,at least in part,the very agreement which dupont repudiates to avoid arbitration.it is,however,that separate oral agreement that saves the day for dupont because,wholly apart from whether rhodia fiber breached the agreement,what is at the core of this case is the conduct and the statements of appellants representative in january of.
with reference to the second theory of equitable estoppel,appellants rely on a series of cases in which signatories were held to arbitrate related claims against parent companies who were not signatories to the arbitration clause.in each of these cases,a signatory was bound to arbitrate claims brought by a because of the close relationship between the entities involved,as well as the relationship of the alleged wrongs to the obligations and duties in the contract and the fact that the claims were intertwined with the underlying contractual obligations,at.in essence,a voluntarily pierces its own veil to arbitrate claims against a signatory that are derivative of its claims against the same signatory.grigson creative artists agency,cir able to compel signatory to arbitrate claims related to the contract which contained an arbitration clause ryan sons,at discussed above sunkist soft drinks,sunkist growers,cir compelling signatory to arbitrate claims against that were intertwined with claims arising from contract governed by arbitration clause hughes masonry,greater clark county sch,cir same mcbro planning and dev.triangle const,cir to contract containing arbitration clause was bound by signatory to arbitrate dispute where cl
