emphasis added.
also of relevance to the issues on appeal,the record contains an internal memorandum of the company in which a company negotiator contemporaneously summarized for management his understanding of the agreement which formally became addendum the internal memo.in relevant part,the internal memo provides as follows 
the parties agreed also to a change in the concept of jurisdiction in that the union stated the company must insert a minimum of complete sunday papers.in the exchanges on this subject it is important to remember what the understandings of the parties were on this completes.
this is the total liability of the company.
the union stated it did not care to when sic these completes were distributed.
the company can distribute the rest of its circulation in any manner and to whomever it chooses so long as it is not over three pieces.
it is clearly understood that management need not concern itself that these completes be distributed to single copy distributors.
the union stated what it was giving to management was bulk delivery as opposed to its current odd counts delivery.
the union stated management attorneys should write the language which would reflect this understanding.

emphasis added.
we now turn to the historical facts giving rise to the present dispute.for over thirty years,the sunday edition of the paul pioneer press was distributed to home delivery carriers in bundles of separate sections,such that the newspapers were not fully inserted when they left the mailroom.in early,the union learned that the sunday papers were being delivered to customers homes as single packages,despite continuing to leave the printing facility in separate bundles.the union brought this issue to the attention of the company,contending that any insertion work done by home delivery carriers contravened the cba.
the company responded that the delivery persons were independent contractors,as opposed to employees,who were
