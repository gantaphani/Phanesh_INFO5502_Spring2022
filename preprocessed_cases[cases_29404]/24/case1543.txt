introduction 
defendant and appellant charlotte laughon appeals from a trial court order confirming an arbitration award in favor of plaintiff and respondent international alliance of theatrical stage employees and moving picture operators of the united states and canada,local union local.laughon argues that the trial court was required to vacate the arbitration award because the arbitrator failed to disclose prior service as a neutral arbitrator in collective bargaining cases in which attorneys for local represented a party and prior service as a neutral arbitrator in a case in which attorneys for local represented a party.we conclude that,pursuant to code of civil procedure,section,subdivision a,the arbitrator was required to disclose his service as a neutral arbitrator in the matter.we also conclude this claim was not waived and,therefore,the arbitrator nondisclosure of this required matter was grounds for vacation under section,subdivision a a.for the parties guidance on remand,we find that the arbitrator was not required to disclose his service in collective bargaining arbitrations.we reverse the judgment.
ii.factual and procedural background 
several years before the arbitration that is the subject of this appeal took place,laughon sued local for sex discrimination.on february,she and local entered into a settlement agreement.they agreed that any dispute about the terms of the settlement agreement would be submitted to binding arbitration by one of four named arbitrators.among them was arbitrator john kagel.
a dispute arose and,in early,laughon agreed to submit it to arbitration before kagel.kagel was informed of his selection as arbitrator on april.
the arbitration began on november,and,after a continuance,was concluded on november.at no time before the arbitration hearing did kagel disclose any contact with the van bourg firm,which represented local.kagel had,in fact,recently served as the neutral arbitrator in a arbitration between an individual named hydorn and stationary engineers local.the van bourg firm represented local in that arbitration.in addition,kagel served as the neutral arbitrator in numerous collective bargaining cases in which the van bourg law firm served as counsel.
kagel service as neutral arbitrator in the hydorn matter came to light near the end of the first day of the arbitration hearing between laughon and local,on november,when local introduced as an exhibit kagel june,decision in the hydorn case.after this exhibit was introduced,kagel did not acknowledge he had failed to disclose his service as an arbitrator in the hydorn matter nor did he alert laughon counsel that his service as an arbitrator might be grounds for disqualification in the laughon arbitration.rather,he stated,as an aside,that he thought the opinion he had rendered in that matter has now been blessed by the court.he marked the opinion as an exhibit for identification and the parties moved on to other matters 
kagel issued an award,largely in favor of local,on march.on june,laughon filed a petition to vacate the award on the ground that kagel had failed to disclose certain matters that might serve as a basis for his disqualification,including his prior employment as an arbitrator in cases involving local,or its counsel,the van bourg law firm.
after hearing the matter in november,the trial court filed a statement of decision on january.the trial court made a number of factual findings.first,the court found that kagel did not disclose his contacts with the van bourg firm nor did he disclose a business contact presumably,his service as neutral arbitrator in a case involving an individual named hydorn and stationary engineers local.the trial court found that,after the hydorn case was mentioned during the laughon arbitration,no objection was made to kagel hearing the rest of laughon case or failing to disclose the hydorn case after the exhibit containing kagel opinion in the hydorn matter came to light.
the trial court also found,based on information submitted by the van bourg firm regarding the results of collective bargaining arbitrations conducted by kagel,that there is no bias in favor of the van bourg firm apparent from the results of such arbitration hearings.based on its examination of the transcripts of the laughon arbitration,the trial court found that there was no obvious bias or prejudice in the manner in which kagel conducted the hearings.
the trial court also reached a number of legal conclusions based on these factual findings.first,the trial court found that kagel had failed to disclose his involvement as the neutral arbitrator in the hydorn case,as mandated by section,subdivision a.the court found,however,that o nce the information regarding the hydorn case became known,there appears to have been a conscious decision not to raise the issue of disclosure and any disqualification as a tactical decision.there was ample opportunity to discuss the issue and,although much of the testimony had been taken,the hearing could have been rescheduled,particularly since siegel counsel for laughon had further testimony to present and requested a continued hearing date anyway.under the circumstances,this constituted a knowing,voluntary and intelligent waiver.
the court also held that e ven if the facts and circumstances are insufficient to constitute a waiver,the totality of the information which could have been disclosed,whether or not the collective bargaining agreement arbitrations are included does not reveal any disqualifying bias or prejudice.from the history of results of other arbitrations,there was reason to believe that if there was any bias,it would be against boone and his law firm,not against laughon.a reading of the transcript of the arbitration does not support the charges by laughon that the arbitrator was rude to her but friendly to local.
the trial court confirmed the arbitration award and this timely appeal followed.
iii.discussion 
failure to disclose service in hydorn arbitration 
local does not dispute that kagel served as neutral arbitrator in a case between an individual named hydorn and the international union of operating engineers,stationery engineers local local and that he did not disclose this service.
kagel disclosure obligations are set out in section.section,subdivision a,specifies that an arbitrator must disclose t he names of the parties to all prior or pending noncollective bargaining cases involving any party to the arbitration or lawyer for a party for which the proposed neutral arbitrator served or is serving as neutral arbitrator section,subdivision b,provides that a proposed neutral arbitrator shall disclose all matters required to be disclosed pursuant to this section to all parties in writing within calendar days of service of notice of the proposed nomination or appointment.thus,ten days after he was proposed as the neutral arbitrator in the laughon matter,kagel was required to disclose his service as neutral arbitrator in the hydorn matter.had kagel done so,laughon would have been entitled to disqualify him within days after the disclosure statement was served,subd.b.kagel did not make this required disclosure and laughon,understandably enough,did not move to disqualify him.
a party who does not move to disqualify an arbitrator prior to the commencement of arbitration may nevertheless seek vacation of an arbitration award on the ground that the arbitrator failed to disclose within the time required for disclosure a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator was then aware,subd.a a.this statute provides that,when such a failure occurs,the court shall vacate the award.italics added.the explicit language of the statute,therefore,supports laughon argument that the trial court was required to vacate the arbitration award once it was shown that kagel failed to make the required disclosure in a timely fashion.
for the first time in its petition for rehearing,local argues that a section of the statute amending section suggests that section,subdivision a a,does not require an arbitration award to be vacated solely on the ground of a failure to disclose there must be more,it argues,the undisclosed matter must be such that might cause a reasonable person to question the arbitrator impartiality.the language local relies upon reads it is the intent of the legislature that the grounds for vacatur added by subparagraph a paragraph of subdivision a of section,is declarative of existing case law which provides that an arbitration award may be vacated when a neutral arbitrator fails to disclose a matter that might cause a reasonable person to question the ability of the arbitrator to conduct the arbitration proceeding impartially.stats,ch.citing cases predating section,subdivision a a,principally commonwealth coatings continental casualty,d commonwealth and michael aetna life casualty ins.th,d michael,local argues that this expression of legislative intent undermines our conclusion that kagel failure to disclose the hydorn matter,as required under section,subdivision a,requires vacatur of the arbitration award under section,subdivision a a.
this argument,besides being untimely,is also incorrect.section,as amended in,mandates that a court shall vacate an arbitration award if,among other reasons,the arbitrator making the award failed to disclose a ground for disqualification of which the arbitrator was then aware,subd.a a.those grounds include,of course,those enumerated in the six subparagraphs of section,subdivision a.those subparagraphs are preceded by the following general description of the matters which must be disclosed a description also added in a ll matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed neutral arbitrator would be able to be impartial,including all of the following,subd.a,italics added.this language makes clear that,when it amended both sections and,subdivision a a in,the legislature intended that the failure to disclose the sort of prior relationship involved here necessarily satisfies the might cause a reasonable person to question standard mentioned in section of the statute.put another way,because section,subdivision a general description of the matters which must be disclosed was both enacted contemporaneously with section,subdivision a a,and worded substantially the same as the statutory explanation of the latter,it is obvious that the legislature did not intend the two sections to conflict in any way.
local,however,contends that,although kagel failed to make the disclosure required by statute,laughon waived any challenge to kagel service as neutral arbitrator.local bases this argument on,first of all,the fact that laughon made no objection to kagel service on the first day of the arbitration hearing when kagel opinion in the hydorn matter was marked for identification purposes and a copy provided to her counsel.in effect,local contends that kagel service as arbitrator in the hydorn matter was disclosed when the van bourg firm offered for identification a copy of kagel award in that arbitration and that laughon inaction after the award was introduced amounted to a waiver.second,relying on section,subdivision c local contends that laughon should have moved to disqualify kagel under section,subdivision a,and,because she failed to do so,she has waived any right to object to kagel service as an arbitrator of her case.we do not agree with either of these arguments.
we will review the trial court holding that laughon waived any objection to kagel service as a neutral arbitrator de novo,because that conclusion is one based on undisputed facts.those undisputed facts are that the opinion in the hydorn case was introduced into evidence on the first day of the hearing,the arbitrator mentioned that the opinion had been confirmed by the trial court,then turned to other matters,and laughon counsel did not raise any objection to kagel failure to disclose his involvement in the hydorn case.in such a circumstance,the issue of waiver is one of law and the reviewing court is not bound by the trial court ruling.agnes medical center pacificcare of california cal th,d,quoting platt pacific,andelson cal th,d.additionally,in this case the waiver issue involves the interpretation and application of the only waiver provision in the three relevant statutes,and,namely section,subdivision c.it is axiomatic that the interpretation and application of statutes is a matter of independent review.see,people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d,and cases cited therein.
of particular relevance to the question of whether the introduction of the hydorn opinion amounted to a disclosure and,thus,counsel failure to object amounted to a waiver,is kaiser foundation hospitals,superior court th,d kaiser.in kaiser,the neutral arbitrator failed to disclose his service as a kaiser party arbitrator on behalf of one of the parties to the arbitration.two years after the neutral arbitrator was appointed,and apparently before the arbitration concluded,counsel for kaiser wrote a letter to opposing counsel in which he stated that the neutral arbitrator had served as a party arbitrator on behalf of his client.id.at,d.although the trial court suggested it was possible one party might make the adequate advisements an arbitrator himself should make ibid,it determined that counsel disclosure was inadequate and vacated the arbitration award.the court of appeal affirmed,stating,of course,as the trial court recognized,the consequences of such a failure to disclose may be overcome if the pertinent facts are actually revealed,or otherwise become known,to the parties in some other fashion.we agree,however,with the court that the terse,and essentially misleading,phraseology of counsel letter of acceptance did not adequately fulfill that obligation here.id.at,d.
in kaiser,information about a neutral arbitrator past contacts with a party was disclosed far more explicitly than kagel prior service was disclosed during the laughon arbitration.laughon counsel was presented with an exhibit that purportedly did nothing more than support opposing counsel legal position.although a close scrutiny of the document would have revealed that kagel had served as the arbitrator in this matter in which the van bourg firm represented a party,there was no discussion of the possible conflict.clearly,neither kagel nor local called it to laughon counsel attention,nor was that counsel given an opportunity an opportunity which,in any event,would obviously be untimely under section to object to kagel continuing service as an arbitrator.in fact,when asked about the document during his deposition,laughon counsel stated that,although he recalled seeing the document during the arbitration he could only guess that he recalled it was an arbitration award rendered by kagel.when asked if he noticed that an attorney for the van bourg firm had appeared in that matter,he replied,you know,i do recall that this got a whole lot of attention from me during the arbitration because i did think it was very important.but i do recall that it was introduced.
a case cited by local in support of its waiver argument is also instructive,although ultimately not helpful to it.in health services management hughes cir,the american arbitration association aaa failed to disclose as required that several proposed arbitrators had previous business relationships with a party to the arbitration.on the first day of arbitration,counsel for one of the parties asked whether any of the arbitrators had any conflicts of interest,and the arbitrators disclosed these prior relationships.counsel indicated he had not received this disclosure directly from the aaa,as required.however,after the disclosure was made,the arbitrator announced that if either party wanted to place any objections on the record,they should do it at that time.id.at.counsel did not do so.after the arbitration award was issued,health services management sought to have it set aside on the ground that the conflict disclosure had not been made by the aaa,pursuant to its own rules.
the court rejected this argument.it found that health services management had learned about the previous business relationships between hughes and the arbitrators at the january hearing and had an opportunity to object the court noted that,had this not occurred,aaa failure to disclose the existence of the prior relationship would clearly be the basis upon which to vacate the arbitration decision.health services management hughes,supra,at.the health services management court held that the parties objection to the arbitrator required disclosure was waived,because the disqualifying information had been directly disclosed to the parties and,following this disclosure,the parties were given an opportunity to object to the arbitrator service.
similarly,in hsmv adi limited d,the court found that,although a careful study of certain documents might have revealed a disclosable conflict,this alone was not sufficient to support a finding that hsmv waived the arbitrator conflict of interest.the court specifically held that,c learly,as a threshold matter one must know of,understand and acknowledge the presence of a conflict of interest before one can waive the conflict.in that case,as in this one,no waiver can be found when t he record simply does not demonstrate that the party actually knew,understood and acknowledged the presence of a conflict before the conclusion of the arbitration proceedings.ibid.
sound policy reasons support our conclusion that the events here constitute neither a disclosure nor a waiver of an arbitrator conflict.the united states supreme court found in commonwealth coatings continental casualty,supra,at,that the failure to make a required disclosure is grounds for vacating an arbitration award even if there is no proof of actual bias.the court noted that,w e should,if anything be even more scrupulous to safeguard the impartiality of arbitrators than judges,since the former have completely free rein to decide the law as well as the facts and are not subject to appellate review.we can perceive no way in which the effectiveness of the arbitration process will be hampered by the simple requirement that arbitrators disclose to the parties any dealings that might create an impression of possible bias.id.at.
our legislature has crafted disclosure rules designed to protect the integrity of the arbitration process,including the specific disclosure requirements set out in section.the requirement that arbitrators make timely disclosures of potential conflicts is a particularly important safeguard.we can not agree that this important disclosure requirement may be fulfilled in the manner local contends.at the very least,laughon was entitled to the functional equivalent of the disclosure mandated by statute,an explicit,formal proffer of the disqualifying information and an opportunity to object 
we conclude,therefore,that because no effective disclosure of the disqualifying information took place,the trial court erred in finding that laughon knowingly waived her objection to kagel failure to disclose his prior service as a neutral arbitrator in the hydorn matter when she did not object after the opinion in that case was offered into evidence during the arbitration.
the cases cited by local in support of its argument to the contrary do not compel a different result.in cobler stanley,barber,southard,brown associates d.cobler,stanley,barber argued that the arbitrator failed to disclose certain matters which might create an impression of possible bias and which,under the aaa arbitration rules,should have been disclosed.the trial court,however,held that the arbitrator was not biased and,further,that any claim of apparent bias was waived because stanley barber was well aware of the purported grounds for apparent bias due to its counsel knowledge of the arbitrator activities that gave rise to the bias claim.here,in contrast,it is not at all clear,as it was in cobler,that laughon was aware of the grounds for kagel required disclosure.moreover,the disclosure obligations and waiver rules in cobler were promulgated by the aaa.cobler does not,therefore,discuss the disclosure rules set out in section.
ray wilson anaheim memorial hospital d.ray wilson,disapproved on other grounds in moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,is also distinguishable.in that case,the disqualifying information was,in fact,disclosed.the issue in ray wilson was not whether there was a proper disclosure,but whether the arbitrator failure to disclose this information directly to aaa under its rules mandated vacation of the award.the court concluded that this claim was waived,because aaa rules specify that a party who proceeds with an arbitration with knowledge of any violation of aaa rules will be deemed to waive that objection.id.at.ray wilson,like cobler,is distinguishable because it construes an arbitrator disclosure obligations under the aaa rules,rather than under section.
finally,in britz,food dairy th,d,the court found that substantial evidence supported the trial court conclusion that one of the appellants had timely knowledge of the receipt of certain business referrals that were not disclosed by the arbitrator.here,however,the facts support no such conclusion.
citing section,subdivision c,local also contends that,because laughon did not move to disqualify kagel under section,subdivision a,she has waived any right to object to kagel service as an arbitrator of her case.section,subdivision a provides that a proposed neutral arbitrator shall be disqualified if he or she fails to comply with section and any party entitled to receive the disclosure serves a notice of disqualification within calendar days after the proposed nominee or appointee fails to comply with section.section,subdivision c provides in pertinent part that t he right of a party to disqualify a proposed neutral arbitrator pursuant to this section shall be waived if the party fails to serve the notice pursuant to the times set forth in this section,unless the proposed nominee or appointee makes a material omission or material misrepresentation in his or her disclosure.
these provisions do not mandate waiver in this case for three reasons.first of all,although the language of section,subdivision a,does not make this clear by its express terms,it obviously applies only when an arbitrator fails to make a disclosure required under section and within calendar days of the date the disclosure should have been made,the party entitled to the disclosure is or becomes aware of facts which should have been disclosed.such was clearly not the case here.second,section,subdivision c,as previously noted the only provision in any of the relevant sections pertinent to waiver,manifestly applies only when the proposed arbitrator has made the requisite disclosure.this is made clear by the exception to the waiver rule posited in the last clause of the first sentence of the subdivision unless the proposed nominee or appointee makes a material omission or material misrepresentation in his or her disclosure,subd.c,italics added.
third and finally,and as noted earlier,section,subdivision c,makes clear that n othing in this subdivision shall limit the right of a party to vacate an award pursuant to section thus,although laughon could not have been expected to object to kagel under section,subdivision a,she is not precluded from doing so pursuant to section.
the trial court also concluded that,e ven if the facts and circumstances are insufficient to constitute a waiver,the totality of the information which could have been disclosed,whether or not the collective bargaining agreement arbitrations are included does not reveal any disqualifying bias or prejudice.from the history of results of other arbitrations,there was reason to believe that if there was any bias,it would be against boone and his law firm,not against laughon.a reading of the transcript of the arbitration does not support the charges by laughon that the arbitrator was rude to her but friendly to local.local contends that the arbitration award must be confirmed because kagel failure to disclose his service as arbitrator of the hydorn matter was not the sort of dealing that might create an impression of bias.
the trial court appears to have been under the impression that,if it found there was no actual bias,it could confirm the arbitration award.however,the question of whether kagel was actually biased against laughon is not the relevant
