case,doc,exh.
in august,homesense assigned its rights in the mortgage and home loan to associates financial services company of alabama,associates.associates subsequently assigned the loan between frazier and homesense to citifinancial,its successor in interest.frazier used a portion of the loan proceeds he received to pay on his credit card balances and other debts.although he received over in cash from the loan transaction,he did not tell frazier about the loan,and had his mortgage statements sent to a post office box rather than to his and frazier home address.
in november,frazier stopped making payments on the loan,claiming it was fraudulent.he and frazier filed a complaint against citifinancial in state court on december asserting claims for breach of contract,fraud,and misrepresentation,and seeking rescission of the mortgage.specifically,they alleged that citifinancial and its agents assigns misrepresented that the loan was unsecured,that frazier was unaware that the mortgage was secured by their home,and that the mortgage was executed under false pretense and in violation of state statutes.
citifinancial removed the case to federal court and filed a motion to compel arbitration of the fraziers claims.on march,the fraziers amended their complaint to allege violations of the act tila,et,claiming that citifinancial knew frazier signature on the mortgage had been forged,yet reported the loan to credit agencies.along with their amended complaint,the fraziers filed a motion for summary judgment in response to citifinancial corporation,llc motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings and memorandum in support thereof asserting,inter alia,that the mortgage was invalid under alabama code thus entitling frazier to rescission of the mortgage,and that frazier lacked capacity to execute the loan documents,including the arbitration agreement.the fraziers argued additionally that frazier was not a beneficiary of the loan transaction because she neither received nor benefitted from the proceeds from the loan,which were spent under the sole discretion and authority of frazier.case,doc.at.the fraziers amended their complaint once more on june to assert a claim for slander to title.
on june,a magistrate judge issued a report recommending that citifinancial motion to compel arbitration be granted.the magistrate judge first found that because frazier formally signed the arbitration agreement as part of the loan transaction,there was little question that he agreed to arbitrate his claims.case,doc.at.frazier claims were also subject to arbitration,the magistrate judge found,because although she did not sign any of the transactional documents associated with the mortgage much less the arbitration agreement,her claims were inseparable from frazier,and her interest in the home was encumbered by the mortgage frazier executed.
district judge inge prytz johnson adopted the report and recommendation on november,noting,inter alia,that because frazier benefitted from the loan proceeds and her claims arose directly out of the loan transaction,it would be plainly inequitable to allow her to disavow the terms of the transaction,including the arbitration agreement.case,doc.at.judge johnson dismissed the fraziers complaint with prejudice,ordered the case to arbitration,and denied the fraziers subsequent motion to reconsider.the fraziers did not timely appeal.
on may,frazier,proceeding alone,filed an action to quiet title in alabama state court.in her complaint,she also sought a declaratory judgment that citifinancial lien against the fraziers home was invalid,an injunction prohibiting citifinancial from foreclosing on the lien,and damages for slander to title.citifinancial removed the case to federal court,seeking to dismiss her quiet title action and to compel to arbitration her declaratory judgment,injunctive relief,and slander to title claims.on august,district judge david proctor dismissed without prejudice frazier quiet title action,finding that it was barred under alabama code because the pending arbitration proceeding was an action that tested her title to the subject property.in so concluding,judge proctor reasoned that the alabama supreme court determination in lee saad constr,dfp architects,so d,that arbitration proceedings and judicial actions stand on equal footing for purposes of res judicata and collateral estoppel,leads inexorably to the conclusion that an arbitration proceeding would be considered an action for purposes of the quiet title statute.to treat arbitration proceedings otherwise would not give them the same effect as alabama courts do.at.judge proctor then found that frazier declaratory judgment and slander to title claims were subject to arbitration for the reasons set forth in judge johnson november opinion and ordered them to arbitration.frazier timely appealed.
after a hearing,the arbitrator issued a decision and award finding that frazier signature on the mortgage had been forged,but that frazier voluntarily entered into the secured loan transaction and therefore owed all sums specified in the note the arbitrator further found that the fraziers tila,fraud,slander to title,and rescission claims were unavailing because the fraziers failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that homesense,or the lawyer who conducted the closing,were agents or associates of citifinancial.insofar as the evidence showed that associates and citifinancial underwrote the loan and had no right to control the activities of homesense or its agents,citifinancial could not be vicariously liable for any misconduct by homesense or the lawyer who performed the closing.with respect to frazier tila claim based on citifinancial having reported to credit agencies that the mortgage was in arrears,the arbitrator found that there was no evidence that citifinancial had any actual or constructive knowledge that frazier was not in fact responsible for the mortgage as it was not until the case went into arbitration that citifinancial learned that frazier signature on the mortgage had been forged.prior to the arbitration,citifinancial did not know and had no reason to know of the forgery since all of the loan documents in its possession appeared to have been properly notarized and authenticated.frazier slander to title claim likewise failed because citifinancial lack of knowledge that her signature had been forged precluded her from proving the malice necessary to prevail on such a claim.finally,the arbitrator found that frazier had no right to rescission of the mortgage because there was no evidence she intended to repay citifinancial for the loan proceeds received by her husband.
the arbitrator then awarded citifinancial in damages for breach of the promissory note,in attorneys fees,and an equitable lien against the fraziers home in the amount of.the arbitrator expressly stated,however,that he ha d no authority to allow citi f inancial to proceed to foreclose on the frazier property and that such relief must instead be obtained in a separate action for judicial or foreclosure.case,doc,exh.at.the arbitrator further noted that,despite citifinancial equitable lien,frazier was entitled to retain her homestead exemption under,which prohibits conveyance of a homestead by a married person without the voluntary signature and consent of the other spouse.
the district court confirmed the arbitration award on september,finding first that the fraziers had no right to a de novo appeal to a panel because,under the terms of the arbitration agreement,the right to appeal was available only where the amount in controversy exceeded.since the amount of the award was only,the appeal provision was not triggered.the district court further found that the fraziers had raised no grounds justifying vacatur modification of the arbitration award under the faa,
the fraziers moved the court to reconsider to vacate,modify,or correct the award,arguing that the award was subject to vacatur under a because the arbitrator exceeded his authority in granting citifinancial an equitable lien because citifinancial did not request such relief the award was subject to modification correction under b because in granting citifinancial an equitable lien,the arbitrator decided a matter not submitted to him the award was subject to modification correction under c because the arbitrator decision,insofar as it granted citifinancial an equitable lien while simultaneously finding that frazier was entitled to retain her homestead exemption,was subject to multiple interpretations and thus imperfect the award was arbitrary and capricious,against public policy,and made in manifest disregard for the law the fraziers were entitled to a de novo appeal before a panel and frazier was not bound by the arbitration agreement and could not be compelled to arbitrate her claims.case,doc.at.
the district court denied the fraziers motion on september.the court first found that the award was not subject to vacatur under a because,contrary to the fraziers assertion,citifinancial expressly asked that an equitable lien be granted in its favor in its brief,and such relief was permitted by alabama law.sections b and c were also inapplicable,the court found,because citifinancial did submit its request for an equitable lien to the arbitrator and because the correction the fraziers were seeking,to wit,nullification of the equitable lien,would directly affect the merits of the dispute in this case.with respect to the bases for vacatur upon which the fraziers relied,the district court found that the award was not arbitrary and capricious,against public policy,or made in manifest disregard for the law because nothing in the record indicated that the arbitrator was aware of,but consciously and deliberately disregarded,applicable law in fashioning his award.having previously determined that the fraziers had no right to a de novo appeal,and that frazier was bound by the arbitration agreement,the court found meritless the fraziers remaining arguments.
and frazier filed separate notices of appeal from the district court and september orders confirming the arbitration award and denying their motion to vacate modify the award,respectively.we consolidated the appeals on december,but subsequently dismissed frazier appeal for want of prosecution.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,frazier contends that the district court erred in confirming the arbitrator award and denying her motion to vacate the award because in granting citifinancial an equitable lien,the arbitrator exceeded his authority under a,decided a matter not submitted to him under b,and issued an imperfect award under c the arbitrator exceeded his authority in deciding matters related to foreclosure and possession of the home that were not submitted to arbitration the award failed to address frazier tila and rescission claims,rendering it arbitrary and capricious and the arbitrator decision was contrary to public policy and made in manifest disregard of the law.frazier further argues that the district court improperly calculated the amount in controversy for purposes of determining that she was not entitled to an appeal,erroneously enforced the arbitration award against her,and erred in dismissing her action to quiet title.
as an initial matter,and for the reasons set forth in judge johnson november and september orders,we find meritless frazier claims that she was not bound by the arbitration agreement and was entitled to appeal the arbitrator award to a panel,respectively.we likewise discern no error in judge proctor august memorandum opinion concluding as a matter of law that frazier action to quiet title was barred under.
we review confirmations of arbitration awards and denials of motions to vacate arbitration awards under the same standard,reviewing the district court findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.see peebles merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir brown itt consumer fin,cir.
section of the faa provides that,upon application of any party to the arbitration,the court must confirm the arbitrator award unless it is vacated,modified,or corrected in accordance with sections and of the statute.as described supra,section permits vacatur of arbitration awards only in four narrow circumstances 
where the award was procured by corruption,fraud,or undue means 
where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,or either of them 
where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing,upon sufficient cause shown,or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced or 
where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.
a.under section,arbitration awards may be corrected modified in three situations,only two of which are alleged to exist in this case w here the arbitrators have awarded upon a matter not submitted to them,unless it is a matter not affecting the merits of the decision upon the matter submitted,and w here the award is imperfect in matter of form not affecting the merits of the controversy.b,c.there is a presumption under the faa that arbitration awards will be confirmed,and federal courts should defer to an arbitrator decision whenever possible.harbert int l,llc hercules steel,cir 
we think it clear that none of the statutory bases for vacating an arbitrator award under the faa applies in this case.contrary to frazier assertions,the arbitrator did not exceed his authority or award upon a matter not submitted to him in granting citifinancial an equitable lien against the subject property.as the district court found and the record substantiates,citifinancial expressly requested such relief in its submissions to the arbitrator.given the arbitrator explicit statement that he had no authority to authorize foreclosure and that citifinancial must obtain such relief in a separate action for judicial or foreclosure,frazier contention that the arbitrator exceeded his powers in awarding citifinancial a right to foreclose is likewise without merit.finally,we agree with the district court that c is plainly inapplicable,as the arbitrator grant of an equitable lien,even assuming it was error,did not render the award imperfect in matter of form not affecting the merits of the controversy.c emphasis added.
having determined that the award was not subject to vacatur modification under sections or,we turn to frazier additional arguments that the award was arbitrary and capricious,in violation of public policy,and made in manifest disregard for the law.although our prior precedents have recognized these three grounds for vacatur,see harbert int l,at hall street casts serious doubt on their legitimacy.
in hall street,the parties executed an agreement to arbitrate in which they also agreed that the district court could vacate any award if the arbitrator factual findings lacked evidentiary support or if the arbitrator legal conclusions were erroneous.see at.at.the precise issue before the court was whether the statutory bases for vacatur of an arbitrator award set forth in may be supplemented by contract.id.at.at.answering this question in the negative,the court held that and respectively provide the faa exclusive grounds for expedited vacatur and modification,reasoning that the provision for judicial confirmation of an arbitrator award contained in 
carries no hint of flexibility.on application for an order confirming the arbitration award,the court must grant the order unless the award is vacated,modified,or corrected as prescribed in sections and of this title.there is nothing malleable about must grant,which unequivocally tells courts to grant confirmation in all cases,except when one of the prescribed exceptions applies.
id.at.at.read together,sections substantiat e a national policy favoring arbitration with just the limited review needed to maintain arbitration essential virtue of resolving disputes straightaway.id.at.at.expanding the statutory grounds would,the court warned,open the door to the legal and evidentiary appeals that can render informal arbitration merely a prelude to a more cumbersome and judicial review process.id.quotation marks,alteration,and citation omitted 
although the court does not explicitly extend its holding in hall street to judicial expansions of and,at least some circuits have read hall street as prohibiting all grounds for vacatur,whether or contractually.for example,the fifth circuit,relying on hall street unequivocal holding that the statutory grounds listed in section are the exclusive means for vacatur,has held that manifest disregard of the law is no longer an independent ground for vacating arbitration awards under the faa.citigroup global markets bacon,cir.the court reasoned that i n the light of hall street repeated statements that we hold that the statutory grounds are exclusive,it could not be interpreted as applying only to contractual expansions of and.id.at.see also united parcel service,cir we acknowledge the supreme court recent holding in hall street that manifest disregard of the law is not a valid ground for vacating or modifying an arbitral award in cases brought under the faa.
the second and ninth circuits have taken a different approach,treating manifest disregard of the law not as an additional,independent ground for vacatur,but instead as a judicial interpretation of the district court power under a to vacate an award where the arbitrator exceeded his powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award was not made.a.see comedy club,improv west,cir,cert.denied,improv west comedy club.concluding that after hall street associates,manifest disregard of the law remains a valid ground for vacatur because it is shorthand for a statutory ground under the faa,specifically a animalfeeds int l,cir,cert.granted,animalfeeds int l.holding that manifest disregard,reconceptualized as a judicial gloss on the specific grounds for vacatur enumerated in section of the faa,remains a valid ground for vacating arbitration awards.
finally,the sixth circuit has concluded in an unpublished opinion that while hall street significantly reduced the ability of federal courts to vacate arbitration awards for reasons other than those specified in,it did not foreclose federal courts review for an arbitrator manifest disregard of the law because it held only that the faa prohibits private parties from supplementing by contract the faa statutory grounds for vacatur,without expressly addressing whether those grounds may be supplemented judicially.coffee beanery,ww,fed.appx,cir,cert.denied,coffee beanery,ww,llc.
we hold that our bases for vacatur are no longer valid in light of hall street.in so holding,we agree with the fifth circuit that the categorical language of hall street compels such a conclusion.see hall street,at.at the text compels a reading of the and categories as exclusive id.at.at the statutory text gives us no business to expand the statutory grounds id.at.at and provide exclusive regimes for the review provided by the statute.as frazier has failed to demonstrate the existence of any of the statutory grounds for vacating or modifying the arbitrator award,the district court was bound by to confirm the award.
iii.conclusion 
frazier appeals the district court orders confirming the arbitration award in favor of citifinancial and denying her motion to vacate or modify the award.for the foregoing reasons,we affirm.
we dismissed frazier appeal for want of prosecution on march.we dismissed frazier appeal for want of prosecution on march.
