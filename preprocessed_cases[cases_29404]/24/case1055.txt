five years after the tragedy at columbine high school,we are called to determine whether the district court rightly put to rest a lawsuit between michael and vonda shoels,whose son isaiah was killed at columbine,and the parents of the two shooters.over strenuous objection,the district court found that the shoels,through counsel,had entered a binding agreement to settle their claims in april of.because the shoels have provided us with no reason to think that the district court factual findings were clearly erroneous,we affirm the order of the district court.
background 
in the year,michael and vonda shoels sued a number of defendants for failing to prevent or facilitating the killing of their son.two groups of defendants are relevant to this appeal first,the harrises and klebolds,parents of the shooters,and second,three associates of the shooters named mark manes,phillip duran,and robyn anderson,who were later added to the lawsuit collectively referred to as the manes group.the shoels primary legal counsel was geoffrey fieger,a michigan attorney who retained the exclusive right to communicate with the shoels and,for the most part,was the only one authorized to negotiate on their behalf.fieger worked with jack beam associates as local counsel,and especially with douglas raymond,an associate at that firm.in the summer of,fieger specifically authorized local counsel to offer to settle with the harrises and klebolds if they would pay the policy limits of their homeowner insurance to the shoels and one other family.
reluctant to settle with the families of two victims without simultaneously resolving the potential claims of all the other victims and their families,the klebolds suggested that they might want to involve other potential plaintiffs in the process.beam urged them not to do so,and warned in a letter that their offer was the only attempt which will be made by these families to settle within your clients policy limits,and that settlement with fieger clients will substantially reduce the klebolds personal exposure by not facing a trial with a lawyer with fieger elan.app.
in the following months,a growing number of potential claimants became involved in trying to work out a global settlement.one of the attorneys,stephen wahlberg,emerged as the primary spokesman for these plaintiffs.while he was not authorized to act on behalf of any other attorneys clients,he was the intermediary who would relay communications back and forth between the various defendants and the various plaintiffs.in september of,he demanded that the klebolds,harrises,and mark manes pay their policy limits in full an aggregate amount of roughly million to a group of thirteen plaintiffs in return for releasing their claims.although formally included in this group,the shoels remained tentative about actually accepting a settlement until they knew more definitely the amount they could expect to receive.
in november of,the klebolds,the harrises,and mark manes made a counteroffer.they pointed out that there were still potential claimants outside of wahlberg group,whose claims would not be resolved by the proposed settlement.six of those claimants,represented by jim rouse,had refused to join wahlberg coalition despite substantial efforts to include them.in their opinion,any settlement that allowed the harrises and klebolds to resolve the claims against them using only insurance thereby to escape with respect to their personal unacceptable.they wanted the harrises and klebolds to pay personally for the victims losses,at least to some extent,and apparently also demanded a chance to confront the harrises and klebolds face to face.the other eighteen had not been represented by counsel up to that point,and it was not known whether they were interested in pursuing their potential legal claims.the defendants acknowledged that it was unlikely that rouse group would settle,but offered to settle with the remaining claimants for million,assuming that the wahlberg group could get the other eighteen to agree.
to muster the required consensus,wahlberg group enlisted the help of an organization called the judicial arbiter group,an association of retired judges who provide alternative dispute resolution services.the group agreed to help contact the remaining victims their families one of its members,judge jim carrigan,agreed to help the various plaintiffs divide the settlement proceeds by serving as an arbiter who would determine the relative value of each claim,based on the claimant damages and likelihood of success.eventually,all but four of the eighteen families agreed to join in the wahlberg settlement negotiations,and the remaining four seemed unlikely to sue at all.in march,arbitration agreements were sent out to each of the participating families.because raymond,the shoels local counsel,had not received the shoels copy in early april,wahlberg sent a second copy of the arbitration agreement on april,stating that everyone else had signed and requesting the shoels signature.
meanwhile,the parties continued to negotiate which plaintiffs would settle with each group of defendants,how much of their insurance proceeds each group of defendants would pay to settle the plaintiffs claims,and how much they would be allowed to set aside to defend against any other claims not covered by the settlement.on march,wahlberg faxed to the shoels counsel a letter from rouse confirming that his clients would not settle with the klebolds and harrises.then,on april,wahlberg advised the shoels counsel that rouse thought his clients would participate in arbitration of their claims against defendants manes and duran.wahlberg also speculated that some of rouse clients might have second thoughts about the klebolds and harrises as well.
a settlement conference was held on april,the results of which were sent by fax to the parties including jack beam,local counsel for the shoels in a letter dated april.that letter made it clear that the rouse plaintiffs were not participating in the settlement with the klebolds and harrises,but suggested that they would participate in the other settlements.in the negotiations,the parties ultimately agreed that instead of negotiating the amount to be reserved for the rouse group and other nonparticipating claimants,they would let the arbiter determine it.according to the final proposal set forth in the letter,the harrises and klebolds would put of their insurance policy limits into escrow,leaving the other to cover possible claims.then,the arbiter would determine what share of the escrowed funds each potential claimant including the nonsettling claimants should receive.the amounts attributable to nonsettling plaintiffs would be held in reserve to cover any successful claims,and any unused portion of those funds would be distributed to the settling plaintiffs after the statute of limitations expired.
the proposed settlements with defendants manes,anderson,and duran had a similar structure,with one exception those defendants refused to pay their insurance proceeds unless everyone including the rouse group,agreed to release their claims.furthermore,defendants manes and duran were likely,and anderson was threatening to file for bankruptcy if a unanimous settlement was not reached this made proceeding to trial considerably less attractive.according to the april letter,manes had agreed to deposit of insurance proceeds immediately and hold the remaining in reserve until the statute of limitations ran.duran had preliminarily agreed to deposit of his insurance money so long as everyone participated,and anderson had of insurance proceeds available for settlement,though her settlement proposal was not yet finalized.
by april,the six families represented by jim rouse had definitely agreed to settle with the manes group.this left only the shoels who had not committed to settle with those defendants.wahlberg called raymond,explained that everyone else was on board,including the rouse group,and said that it was time for the shoels to make a choice.in wahlberg recollection,it was clear that he was speaking about the negotiations with manes,anderson,and duran.two days after the april conversation,however,raymond claimed that wahlberg falsely led him to believe that the rouse group was settling with the harrises and klebolds as well.in any event,raymond said that he would have to speak with fieger and his clients.they were not able to reach fieger that day,but the next morning april wahlberg had another conversation with raymond and someone at fieger office,again stressing that the shoels needed to decide what they were going to do and give him something in writing.later that same morning,fieger office sent a letter to wahlberg,apparently signed by fieger which read as follows 
this letter shall serve to confirm that and shoels have approved settlement with defendants klebold,harris,manes,anderson,and duran.
app.wahlberg immediately faxed that letter on to counsel for the klebolds and harrises,together with a general acceptance letter on behalf of all the claimants.
within hours,this apparently successful conclusion to the settlement negotiations began to unravel.when the shoels attorneys realized that the rouse group was not settling with the klebolds and harrises,they immediately repudiated the agreement.raymond sent a letter saying that they were shocked that the rouse group was not settling with the klebolds and harrises,which he considered contrary to the representation that everybody is on board except the shoels.he redescribed fieger letter as saying that the shoels had tentatively approved settlement,and insisted that the shoels would not settle until they got the full deal in writing.app.
that same day,wahlberg wrote back,expressing dismay that raymond was shocked and reviewing the terms of the settlement.app.raymond responded,saying,i want to make it clear to you that we were not shocked that there was a settlement.we were shocked that there was a settlement that did not include rouse group as to klebold and harris.app.over the next several days,fieger requested more information about the precise amount that the shoels could expect to receive.wahlberg explained the process and that until the arbiter had ruled,it was impossible to put a precise value on the shoels claim under the settlement.however,he eventually estimated that the shoels claim might be valued at somewhere between and.fieger responded that his clients would never settle a claim with the harris es and klebolds wherein they stand to receive.app.emphasis in original at one point in the correspondence,wahlberg wrote that the shoels would not be bound by the april letter because they had not yet signed any agreements.however,after further discussions with counsel for the harrises who were less forgiving,he wrote back,saying that he had been mistaken and that the shoels,like all the other parties,were bound by the settlement agreement reached on april.
the official claim releases were not signed until that august,after the arbitration was complete but before its results were disclosed.the shoels signed their final releases against manes,anderson,and duran,but not against the klebolds and harrises.although the harrises and klebolds maintained their position that the shoels were bound by their april acceptance,they did make further settlement overtures to the shoels,in hopes they could persuade the shoels not to contest the validity of the settlement agreement.when those negotiations broke down,the shoels moved to have their case sent back to state court where fieger was confident that he could get the case to a jury,and the klebolds and harrises brought motions to enforce the settlement agreement.after an evidentiary hearing in march of,the district court determined that the shoels had accepted an offer to settle on april,and that they were bound by their contract.
discussion 
a trial court has the power to summarily enforce a settlement agreement entered into by the litigants while the litigation is pending before it.united states hardage,cir.we review the district court decision to enforce such an agreement for an abuse of discretion.id.at.an abuse of discretion occurs when the district court based its decision on an erroneous conclusion of law or where there is no rational basis in the evidence for the ruling.wang hsu,cir.issues involving the formation and construction of a purported settlement agreement are resolved by applying state contract law.united states mccall,cir.
in this appeal,appellants present three primary arguments for overturning the district court enforcement of the settlement agreement.first,they argue that fieger did not have his clients express authority to settle the claims,making his april letter ultra vires and hence invalid.second,they argue that the terms of the settlement were too vague to constitute a binding agreement,and were at most a preliminary agreement to agree.third,they argue that their mistake about the rouse group participation,which they claim was caused by wahlberg misrepresentation,gave them the option of voiding the contract,which they immediately did.we consider each contention in turn.
relying on the settled colorado rule that an attorney can not settle a claim unless the client expressly authorizes him to do so,the shoels first argue that fieger had no authority to settle their claims on their behalf.see cross dist.court,en banc a s we have stated on numerous occasions,an attorney does not have the authority to compromise and settle the claim of his client without the knowledge or consent of his client.in response,appellees point out that fieger himself testified that he had exclusive authority to negotiate on behalf of the shoels,and that in june of he authorized local counsel to make a settlement offer.of course,that evidence is not dispositive an attorney may be authorized to negotiate even if the client retains sole authority to sign off on the final agreement,and the fact that an attorney has his client consent to authorize an offer in one case does not prove that he has it to accept a very different offer several months later.
more helpful is appellee citation to thomas colorado trust deed funds,cir,where this court held that there is a presumption that an attorney has express authority to settle unless there is evidence to the contrary in the record.when they first disputed the settlement,counsel for the shoels never claimed that their clients had not signed off on the acceptance or that fieger had been acting contrary to his clients wishes.appellants now cite evidence that,at earlier stages of negotiations,they had refused to settle without knowing in advance the ultimate dollar value they would receive.fieger strains to read this as evidence of a limitation on his authority to settle,but we are not convinced.parties often relax their supposedly demands over the course of negotiations,and the mere fact that a party does so through counsel does not suggest that counsel has exceeded the scope of his express authority.of course,counsel for the shoels did renew their demand for a precise figure after april,but only once they learned that the rouse group was not participating.appellants position seems to have been that,despite their demand for a fixed settlement amount,if all the other attorneys agreed to the arbitration procedure,they would not be the sole laggards or obstructionists.app.thus,even if fieger long refusal to settle except in return for a fixed dollar amount were probative of a corresponding limitation on his authority,his apparent willingness to settle so long as the rouse group before the arbiter had determined what the shoels would be just as probative of his authority to do so.
evidence about the shoels general negotiating position provides at best indirect evidence for whether the shoels really did change course and agree to the arbitration process by april.the most direct evidence is the text of the april letter itself this letter shall serve to confirm that and shoels have approved settlement with defendants klebold,harris,manes,anderson and duran.app.emphasis added.if one takes that sentence at face value,it states that the shoels either approved the agreement themselves or authorized fieger to do so.admittedly,the record also contains a few stray remarks that could possibly be read to indicate a lack of authority for instance,fieger did testify that the shoels had already indicated they refused to sign the arbitration agreement in the days leading up to april,suggesting that they were still refusing to participate when the acceptance letter was sent.app.but that testimony was all in support of fieger claim that his letter was misworded,and that in fact neither he nor the shoels meant to commit to settlement on april.the district court specifically discredited that claim.thus,the facts as found by the district court establish that fieger,at least,intended to settle.in light of the language of fieger letter and the presumption that an attorney does not act without authorization,the most natural conclusion is that the shoels also intended to settle.indeed,there was no hint of a division between the shoels and their counsel in the proceedings below.thus,there was a sufficient basis in the record for the district court finding that the shoels,through counsel,accepted the offer.
but even if we were not convinced of this,it would be improper to reverse the district court on this ground,because the shoels never properly presented their claim to that court.when pressed at oral argument,fieger stated that he did raise the claim,and cited several pages of the transcript where he testified that the shoels consistently refused to settle without knowing the dollar amount they would receive.but even though fieger testimony about the shoels refusal to consent could conceivably have provided a factual basis for the legal claim he now raises,that is not enough a party must also present the legal basis of the claim to the district court clearly and explicitly.see natural gas hegler,cir refusing to consider a legal claim suggested by the evidence but not argued below lyons jefferson bank trust,cir stating that vague,arguable references to a point in the district court proceedings do not preserve the issue on appeal quoting monarch life ins.elam,brackets and ellipses in original.nowhere in the briefing or argument did fieger argue that he lacked authority or cite any cases raising the issue of an attorney authority to settle on behalf of a client.his theory was not that he had settled the case without the shoels permission rather,his theory was that neither he nor the shoels settled or intended to settle.the general rule in this circuit is that a party may not lose in the district court on one theory of the case,and then prevail on appeal on a different theory.mcdonald,cir quoting lyons,at.
of course,we do have discretion to make exceptions in extraordinary circumstances,and as appellants note,we are more willing to exercise that discretion when the newly raised issue is primarily a legal one.see,petrini howard,cir a federal appellate court is justified in reversing a judgment on the basis of issues not raised below when,as here,the issues involved are questions of law,the proper resolution of which is beyond reasonable doubt,and the failure to address the issues would result in a miscarriage of justice.but because the question of fieger authority is essentially factual,it would be inappropriate to make an exception in this case.had this issue been properly raised below,both sides could have presented evidence including,perhaps,the crucial testimony of and shoels about what the shoels knew and what they authorized,rather than focusing on fieger intent to settle which is irrelevant if he lacked authority to settle in the first place.when a fact question is not squarely presented to the finder of fact and the adverse party,it would be unfair to allow an appellant to prevail simply because the evidence accidentally adduced on that question tips in the appellant favor.see singleton wulff,d explaining that appellate courts should generally decline to reach newly argued issues so that litigants may not be surprised on appeal by final decision there of issues upon which they have had no opportunity to introduce evidence.that is doubly true when an appellant wishes to argue that the acts of an attorney are not imputable to his client,as they are generally presumed to be.
next,the shoels argue that the april letter could not have created a binding contract because the terms of the proposed settlement were still too vague.they claim that at most,their agreement was a nonbinding agreement in principle,subject to further negotiations.in colorado,whether negotiations are sufficiently definite and final to create a binding contract is to be decided by the finder of fact,rocky mountain airways,en banc.the district court determined that there was a binding contract,and the record supports its finding.wahlberg april letter,as well as his subsequent telephone conversations with the shoels counsel,laid out the terms of the klebolds and harrises offer in detail,explaining exactly how much they were offering,how a portion of that amount would be held in reserve to cover the rouse group claims,and how the remainder would be distributed among the settling plaintiffs.fieger reply letter was no less definite,stating in categorical terms that the shoels had approved settlement.it contained no language suggesting that their approval was provisional or tentative as raymond tried to describe it the next day.the context of that letter also suggests that it was meant to be binding.the shoels had been participating without committing to the arbitration process for quite some time.as the district court noted,the question on april was whether they would finally commit so that the settlement,as set forth in the april letter,could be finalized.and if the content and context of the letter were not enough to show that the parties meant to enter a binding agreement,we have local counsel own insistence,just one day after the april letter,that the shoels attorneys were not surprised that there was a settlement.app.
despite this evidence,appellants contend that the district court finding was clear error.they stress the fact that at the time of their alleged acceptance,there was no way they could know how much they would get out of the settlement.this,they claim,makes their case analogous to colorado cases in which an agreement was held unenforceable.see,griffin griffin,en banc difrancesco particle interconnect.but these cases involved very different facts.in griffin,a husband and wife had agreed as part of a divorce settlement that they would reach a joint agreement about where their daughter would go to school.when they were unable to reach such an agreement,the mother who had custody of the child and thus the legal right to choose her school chose a school over the father objection.the colorado supreme court held that because the parties separation agreement made no provision for the resolution of disagreement concerning the selection of schools,and because the court could not force the parents to agree on a school,it could not enforce the agreement.griffin,at.similarly,difrancesco involved a license agreement that not only left essential terms like the royalty rate and license scope unspecified,but also failed to specify any method by which these terms could later be determined.at.the lack of such a method brought those cases within the firmly settled colorado rule that i f essentials are unsettled,and no method of settlement is agreed upon,there is no contract.greater serv.homebuilders inv.ass albright,en banc emphasis added.
in stark contrast to these cases,the settlement agreement set forth in the april letter which is what the plaintiffs accepted on april provided a method for fixing a definite value for the shoels claims a neutral arbiter,judge carrigan,would determine their value.in such circumstances,it is irrelevant that the value of the claims was difficult to predict in advance otherwise,every futures contract would be void in colorado.once appellants knew how much money the klebolds and harrises were offering to make available,and that those funds would be distributed according to the relative value of each plaintiff claims as determined by judge carrigan,the arrangement was sufficiently specific to constitute an enforceable contract.
appellants can also be understood to raise a closely related,but conceptually separable,argument.it is that even if the terms were specific enough to be enforceable,still appellants correspondence was meant merely to state tentative approval,not final agreement.under colorado law,an acceptance conditioned on reaching a later,more detailed agreement is not binding.difrancesco,at.moreover,correspondence during the course of negotiations is often best construed as being conditioned in this way.pierce marland oil,in dep t.however,though some evidence in the record supports this interpretation of the april acceptance,it is insufficient to disturb the district court factual finding.
first,appellants note that the april letter purported to approve settlement with robyn anderson,and since it is undisputed that she had not yet offered a particular amount in settlement,they argue that the april approval of settlement with her could not have been meant as a binding acceptance.they then infer that the letter approval could not have been meant as a binding acceptance of the other defendants offers,either.that is one possible interpretation of the letter.another possibility is that fieger april reference to robyn anderson was a simple mistake and was therefore irrelevant to the effect of the letter with respect to the valid offers.at the time,wahlberg interpreted the approval letter in yet a third way in his view,the letter did not operate directly as an acceptance of the various settlement offers rather,by approv ing settlement,it gave wahlberg authorization to settle on behalf of the shoels.in the aftermath of fieger disavowal of his april letter with respect to the klebolds and harrises,wahlberg reaffirmed his understanding that fieger letter had given him authority to settle the shoels claims against anderson,duran,and manes,and fieger subsequent correspondence appeared to concede that point.if wahlberg interpretation was correct,it would not matter that anderson claims were not settled for another week or so.on that interpretation,the april letter gave wahlberg authority to settle the various claims he exercised that authority immediately with respect to the klebolds and harrises but only later with respect to anderson.thus,even if we reject the district court simpler view that the april letter was an acceptance,we still find ample record support for its ultimate factual conclusion that a binding agreement was formed that day.
second,appellants rely on the fact that the shoels never released their claims by signing the official arbitration agreement itself.appellants suggest that signing the release form was a condition precedent to the existence of a valid agreement.in part,this contention seems to be based on a conflation of conditions precedent to the agreement and conditions precedent to the klebolds and harrises performance.while it is true that no funds were to be disbursed until the releases were signed,it does not follow that no contract existed until that time.appellants also rely on language from section iv b of the judicial arbiter group arbitration agreement,which states that b y signing this agreement the claimant is agreeing to be bound by the distribution as awarded by the arbiter.app.they claim that this language makes signing a necessary precondition to being bound.but while it does appear that the agreement contemplated acceptance by signing,the quoted language does not imply that signing the agreement was the only way to accept.its true effect is to set forth one of the consequences of entering the agreement namely,becoming bound by the arbitration,not to limit the means by which the agreement might be entered.
finally,there is the text of the claimants joint acceptance letter itself.some of its language does seem provisional 
further,the statute of limitations shall be tolled for days from april for anyone participating in the proceedings before judge carrigan so that we may prepare a mutually acceptable settlement agreement.
app.emphasis added.this language,while relevant,is not dispositive.while the letter clearly contemplates working out a more detailed agreement,nowhere does it state that the existence of a binding contract is conditioned on successfully completing that process.t he mere intention to reduce an oral or informal agreement to writing,or to a more formal writing,is not of itself sufficient to show that the parties intended that until such formal writing was executed the parol or informal contract should be without binding force.rocky mountain airways,at,quoting coulter anderson,in dep t.it may be possible to interpret wahlberg language as saying that there was no binding agreement on april,and if such an agreement were not formulated within thirty days,the plaintiffs would remain free to bring suit.but it is also possible that the plaintiffs did consider themselves bound,but required the statute of limitations to be tolled so that they would still be able to bring suit in the event that the defendants breached the agreement to deposit their funds in escrow.see goltl cummings,in dep t finding that a settlement agreement existed in similar circumstances.given the beginning of wahlberg letter the purpose of this letter is to accept the settlement proposal,on balance it,too,supports the district court conclusion.and whatever ambiguities may be read into the text now,the district court rightly resolved those ambiguities in light of raymond contemporaneous admission that the parties understood the april settlement to be final.see app.thus,whether fieger letter was itself meant as an acceptance,or whether it was meant to authorize wahlberg to settle on behalf of the shoels,the district court determination that there was a binding acceptance has ample record support.
appellants cite in their favor new york life ins.k n energy,cir,in which this court applied colorado law to hold a note purchase agreement unenforceable.however,the purported agreement in that case was marked by its use of the conditional tense to describe what would be the case if the deal were consummated,and unlike wahlberg letter,it specifically stated that the deal would not be consummated until the parties reached final agreement upon terms,conditions,covenants and other provisions satisfactory to prudential.id.at.those facts alone suffice to distinguish k n energy.in addition,k n energy is of limited relevance here,because it did not squarely decide whether a contract existed.instead,because several conditions precedent to the actual note purchase had not been fulfilled,the panel held that the purported agreement was either an unenforceable agreement to agree or a contract subject to conditions precedent which were never fulfilled.id.emphasis added.the shoels have not shown that the harrises and klebolds have failed to perform any act on which the shoels obligation to release their claims was conditioned.rather,the harrises and klebolds have deposited their funds as required,and now demand that the shoels fulfill their part of the bargain.
appellants final argument is that they should not be held to the contract because their acceptance was predicated on either a mistake or a misrepresentation.in particular,they assert that in the discussions and correspondence immediately prior to fieger acceptance,wahlberg told local counsel that everybody is on board except the shoels,app,and everyone else has signed the agreement,app,falsely leading the shoels and their counsel to believe that the rouse plaintiffs had reconsidered their refusal to settle with the klebolds and harrises.this is not a newly argued objection to the alleged settlement.as we have already noted,just one day after fieger acceptance,raymond wrote to wahlberg w e were not shocked that there was a settlement.we were shocked that there was a settlement that did not include rouse group as to klebold and harris.app.
the district court found that because it had been since at least march of that the rouse group was refusing to settle with the klebolds and harrises,wahlberg statements that everyone else had signed the agreement could not reasonably be interpreted to mean that the rouse plaintiffs had changed their minds.rather
