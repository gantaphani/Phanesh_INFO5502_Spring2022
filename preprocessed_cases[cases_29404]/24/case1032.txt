in this appeal we are asked to decide,for the first time in this circuit,whether we have jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal of the denial of a motion to dismiss premised on the existence of an arbitration agreement,notwithstanding the fact that the defendants did not explicitly move to stay the litigation or compel arbitration under the federal arbitration act faa.we hold that we do not.based on the plain text of the faa,our canons of construction of jurisdictional statutes,and the supreme court categorical approach to the faa appellate jurisdiction provision,we hold that in order to properly invoke appellate jurisdiction under the act,the movant must either explicitly move to stay litigation compel arbitration pursuant to the federal arbitration act,or it must be unmistakably clear from the four corners of the motion that the movant seeks relief provided for in the faa.we thus dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction and remand the case to the district court.
background 
plaintiff sean conrad sued his former employer,phone directories,and its chief executive and financial officers defendants marc and mike bingham,respectively all three defendants will be collectively referred to as pdc on tort and claims.jurisdiction in the district court was premised on diversity of citizenship conrad is a citizen of oklahoma and defendants are domiciled in utah,and conrad sought more than in damages.see a.the gravamen of conrad suit,in essence,is that pdc violated an agreement to employ him,as well as to provide him with five percent of the profits when the company was sold in.
pdc argues,however,that conrad signed a later employment agreement that included a clause requiring all disputes between pdc and conrad to be submitted to arbitration.in response to conrad complaint,pdc filed a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure.pdc asserted three bases for dismissal first,that the second employment agreement required conrad to bring his claims in utah,rather than oklahoma,and thus that the suit should be dismissed for improper venue under rule b second,that the dispute resolution provisions of the second employment agreement required conrad to arbitrate his claims,and thus that the court should dismiss those claims and third,that conrad claims were legally deficient for various reasons and should thus be dismissed under rule b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
while the arbitration agreement was an important part of pdc motion to dismiss,the motion did not ask the court to enforce the agreement under the faa.the portion of pdc motion that addressed the agreement asserted only that plaintiff complaint should be dismissed because plaintiff agreed to arbitrate all claims relating to his employment with pdc.app.at.only once in its memorandum in support of the motion,at the outset of its arbitration argument,did pdc mention the possibility of any outcome other than outright dismissal.id.at if the court does not dismiss this matter for improper venue,the court should issue an order compelling arbitration and dismissing plaintiff claims.pdc motion did not,however,explicitly ask the district court to stay the proceeding pending arbitration or to compel arbitration under either or of the faa.see empowering district courts to stay litigation where an issue therein is subject to arbitration under a written agreement authorizing district courts to compel arbitration under a valid agreement to arbitrate.the only mention of either provision of the faa came in a quotation in a parenthetical appended to the citation of a third circuit case at the end of pdc arbitration agreement argument.
the district court granted pdc motion with respect to some of conrad tort claims,but denied the motion to dismiss the complaint in full under the arbitration agreement.in the district court view,a t a minimum,genuine issues of material fact exist as to the applicability of the second employment agreement to the parties relationship and conrad claims herein and as to the enforceability of the second agreement,assuming any applicability.app.at.pdc filed an immediate appeal of this denial,asserting that its appeal was taken pursuant to a,the appellate jurisdiction provision of the faa.
ii.appellate jurisdiction 
before addressing the merits of pdc arguments,we must first assure ourselves that we possess jurisdiction over this appeal.though neither party initially briefed the question of our appellate jurisdiction,we ordered supplemental briefing on the issue of whether faa a grants us jurisdiction to review the district court order.see kennedy lubar,cir recognizing this court ability to raise questions of appellate jurisdiction sua sponte.
title,section of the united states code grants courts of appeals jurisdiction over all final decisions of the district courts of the united states.a final decision is a decision by the district court that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.utah ex rel.utah state of health kennecott,cir quoting catlin united states.by its very nature,the decision to deny a motion to dismiss is not final rather than ending the litigation,it is a decision that it will continue.see hyde,cir.under normal circumstances,therefore,we would have no power to review the district court decision to deny pdc motion.
the faa,however,contains a statutory exception to the final decision rule for certain categories of ordinarily orders.under the statute,
a an appeal may be taken from 
a refusing a stay of any action under section of this title,
b denying a petition under section of this title to order arbitration to proceed,
c denying an application under section of this title to compel arbitration,
d confirming or denying confirmation of an award or partial award,or 
e modifying,correcting,or vacating an award 
an interlocutory order granting,continuing,or modifying an injunction against an arbitration that is subject to this title or 
a final decision with respect to an arbitration that is subject to this title.
congress purpose in passing the faa was to reverse judicial enmity to arbitration as a method of dispute resolution.see gilmer lane,d.section a serves that end by ensuring that district court orders hostile to arbitration agreements can be immediately appealed.see ansari qwest commc ns,cir sandvik ab advent int l,cir noting that failing to review orders denying arbitration could circumvent the faa clear purpose of enforcing binding arbitration agreements.
had pdc brought a motion either to stay proceedings or to compel arbitration under faa or,and had the district court then denied that motion,our jurisdiction would be clear.chelsea family pharmacy,pllc medco health solutions,cir exercising appellate jurisdiction over the denial of a motion to stay litigation ansari,at finding appellate jurisdiction even where district court denied faa petition on procedural grounds.but pdc did not so move in the district court.instead,it moved to dismiss the complaint outright under rule,a motion only partly premised on the existence and enforceability of the arbitration agreement.therefore,the question for us is whether we should treat a generic motion to dismiss under rule as a motion made under section or under section of the faa for the purposes of taking jurisdiction under a.
whether a court of appeals can or should treat a motion to dismiss as a motion under the faa for the purposes of a is an unsettled issue nationwide,and has not been previously addressed in our circuit.see harrison nissan motor in,cir noting that some courts have found appellate jurisdiction,but that the question remains open.to resolve it,we look to the text of a and our canons of statutory construction,to how the supreme court has treated the statute,and to the decisions of our sister circuits.
text of faa a 
when interpreting a term in a statute,we turn first to the text.johnson riddle,cir.if the words of the statute have a plain and ordinary meaning,we apply the text as written.see jones comm r of internal revenue,cir.we may consult a dictionary to determine the plain meaning of a term.id.at.we also take into account the broader context of the statute as a whole when ascertaining the meaning of a particular provision.in re wise,cir quoting robinson shell oil,d.if we can not determine the meaning of a statutory term merely by reference to the text,we may also look to traditional canons of statutory construction to inform our interpretation.see lamb thompson,cir.
the term at issue in a is the preposition under.in order for us to find appellate jurisdiction here,we must decide that the phrases under section in a a and under section in a b encompass not only motions explicitly brought pursuant to those provisions,but also motions that in some manner contemplate the applicability of or without mentioning them by name.the most definition of under in webster dictionary is within the grouping or designation of.webster third new international dictionary ed.this definition does not necessarily settle the question.when a motion is brought under rule,it is not within the designation of either or the notion of designation implies explicitness.such a motion,however,could conceivably be within the grouping of a or motion if it encompasses the same arguments that an faa motion might.
the structure of a,however,offers a more substantial clue to the intent of congress.section a sets out seven different otherwise district court actions that may be immediately appealed denying a motion denying a petition denying an application under,which allows enforcement of international arbitration orders confirming or denying an arbitration award altering or vacating an award granting or altering an injunction against an arbitration and entering any other final decision with respect to an arbitration.a.that congress chose specifically to enumerate the limited conditions under which a order may be appealed argues against our recognizing a further category of permitted appeals,namely,appeals from the denial of motions to dismiss based in part on arbitration agreements.
canons of construction also support the notion that under section or section should be interpreted only to encompass motions brought explicitly pursuant to the faa or those in which it is plainly apparent that the applicant seeks only arbitration.because of the limited and defined nature of the jurisdiction of the federal courts,we are bound to construe statutes conferring jurisdiction narrowly.weber mobil oil,cir see also pritchett office depot,cir it is that statutes conferring jurisdiction upon the federal courts are to be narrowly construed in light of our constitutional role as limited tribunals.citing shamrock oil gas sheets.by encompassing only those motions explicitly brought under the faa or unmistakably invoking its remedies,rather than all motions founded at least in part on arbitration agreements,conrad reading of a is clearly the narrower of the two.
finally,two policy maxims also argue in favor of our conclusion.first,this court has recognized that,where jurisdictional matters are concerned,we prefer clear,rules.see mccauley halliburton energy,cir noting the preference in the context of a a appealability analysis.second,there is a policy preference in the federal courts disfavoring piecemeal appeals.see pimentel sons guitar makers,pimentel,cir citing gardner westinghouse broad,d.our approach serves both of those policy interests.the rule we adopt today is both clear and easily administrable.if the motion falls within one of the seven categories laid out in a,or unmistakably seeks only the relief offered by one of those provisions,it may be appealed if not,it may not.this approach will also eliminate the demonstrated by this determining whether an interlocutory appeal may be maintained.
the administrative problems of the alternative rule are illustrated in this case,where we are asked to give controlling weight to some incidental phrase or reference otherwise buried in a motion that would not typically alert a judge that relief is being requested under or of the faa.the possible connection to the faa is even more attenuated here because the clear almost exclusive thrust of the motion to dismiss was to ask the court to examine the merits of the case and to dismiss it for lack of merit.this relief is inconsistent with a request to have the arbitrator decide the case.it is clearly inconsistent with the policy behind the faa to ask the court to decide the merits of the case and then almost incidentally suggest that if the court does not rule in the movant favor,then the movant would like a second bite at the apple before the arbitrator 
on the whole,thus,a analysis grounded in the plain text of seems the better approach to this jurisdictional issue.therefore,based on the text and the overall structure of the statutory provision,as well as canons of construction and policy considerations,we conclude that a permits interlocutory appeals only over those motions brought explicitly pursuant to the faa,or motions in which it is unmistakably clear that the defendant seeks only the relief offered by the faa.
b.the supreme court interpretation in arthur andersen,carlisle 
while it does not control the outcome of the question presented here,the supreme court recent decision in arthur andersen,carlisle,d,provides additional support for a categorical,approach to a.the issue presented in that case was whether the denial of a motion to compel a to an arbitration agreement nevertheless to arbitrate was still brought under section,so as to invoke the appellate jurisdiction granted in a.
the court answered that question in the affirmative,and in doing so it admonished courts to avoid conflating the question of a appellate jurisdiction with the underlying merits of the appeal.the sixth circuit had looked through the motion to the merits of the arguments,and held that its andersen could not enforce the arbitration agreement against carlisle,a did not confer jurisdiction to hear the appeal.but the supreme court held that j urisdiction over the appeal must be determined by focusing on the category of order appealed from,rather than upon the strength of the grounds for reversing the order.at internal quotation marks omitted,emphasis added.thus,even if arthur andersen argument for why it could enforce the arbitration agreement against carlisle were utterly frivolous,the reviewing court would not be divested of jurisdiction to hear the appeal,as long as arthur andersen explicitly asked for a stay pursuant to.see also id.at e ven utter frivolousness of the underlying request for a stay can not turn a denial into something other than an order refusing a stay of any action under section.quoting a.
in dissent,three justices argued that whether the party against whom enforcement of an arbitration agreement is sought is a party to the agreement should be a threshold question to the application of a,but the majority solidly rejected that approach.determination of whether was invoked in a denied stay request is immeasurably more simple and less factbound than the threshold determination respondents would replace it with it is more appropriate to grapple with that merits question after the court has accepted jurisdiction over the case.arthur andersen.at.rather than engage in a inquiry into the status of the parties,the majority instructed the lower courts to look squarely and exclusively at the category of the order appealed from to decide whether a applies.see id.at.
while the question facing this court is different,the methodology we adopt today is consistent with the supreme court admonition.pdc preferred approach would require courts of appeals carefully to parse the district court motions and memoranda to determine,factually,whether the arguments pressed in the district court sufficiently raised the concerns of the faa to deem the motion brought under section or under section.to us,this is akin to the type of factbound threshold determination the respondents urged the supreme court to adopt in arthur andersen,and that the court rejected.by focusing on the category of the order appealed from,as the arthur andersen court did,we avoid conflating the jurisdictional question and the merits of the appeal and reach our jur
