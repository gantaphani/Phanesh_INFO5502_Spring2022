factual and procedural background 
on august,the reigelspergers were inspecting a business in yuba city.in that process,reigelsperger twisted his back,causing him severe lower back pain.
the owner of the business arranged for reigelsperger to see james siller,a licensed chiropractor,at siller office in yuba city.when the reigelspergers arrived at the office,it was dark and the office was closed.siller appeared shortly thereafter,unlocked the office,and escorted reigelsperger to an examining room,where reigelsperger advised siller he was having severe pain in his lower back.
siller examined and treated reigelsperger,leaving him in considerably less pain than when he arrived.when reigelsperger was preparing to leave,he asked siller what he owed for the treatment and then paid siller in cash as payment in full.siller did not give reigelsperger a bill for the services rendered that day.
about the same time they were discussing the cost of siller services,siller handed reigelsperger a form arbitration agreement and informed consent waiver,which he told reigelsperger he needed to sign for siller file.reigelsperger signed the arbitration agreement and waiver.there was no discussion concerning further treatment.the reigelspergers and siller exited the office together and left in their respective vehicles.
the arbitration agreement required that the parties submit to arbitration any dispute as to medical malpractice and stated that t his agreement is intended to bind the patient and the health care provider who now or in the future treat s the patient italics added.
reigelsperger did not return to siller for further treatment of his lower back.however,about two years later,on september,he again sought chiropractic treatment from siller,this time for his cervical spine and shoulder as a result of an injury incurred during that treatment,the reigelspergers filed a complaint against siller for medical malpractice alleging injury to his neck,right shoulder and right upper extremity.
on september,siller filed a petition for an order compelling arbitration and stay of the pending legal action and the notice of hearing.the reigelspergers filed their opposing papers on september.the trial court denied siller petition after finding there was no account between reigelsperger and siller.siller now appeals from the denial of his petition.
discussion 
of arbitration agreement 
siller contends the trial court erred by applying section,subdivision c,as a ground for denying his petition and by disregarding the plain language of the arbitration agreement 
siller argues that there is a strong presumption in favor of arbitrability and any doubt must be resolved in favor of arbitration.thus,he reasons that because there was no waiver or revocation of the agreement,it must be enforced according to its plain meaning.the reigelspergers contend the agreement is not enforceable because an account was not established on the occasion of the first treatment,the agreement was not explained to reigelsperger,and siller did not sign the agreement.
we find the agreement is not enforceable because it does not apply to future treatment for the reason there was no ongoing relationship between the parties established on the occasion of the first treatment 
generally speaking,a written agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy thereafter arising is valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.such agreements are enforceable and there is a strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,d,moncharsh heily blase cal th,d.
the legislature has also codified the right to voluntary arbitration of medical malpractice claims and has declared that agreements to arbitrate,when drafted in a prescribed form,are not unconscionable nor are they contracts of adhesion.hilleary garvin d,subd.e.subdivision c of section provides that o nce signed,such a contract governs all subsequent account transactions for medical services for which the contract was signed until or unless rescinded by written notice within days of signature because the arbitration agreement before us contains the requisite statutory language,it governs all subsequent account transactions for medical services,subd.c.
whether an account exists is a question of fact.cochran rubens th,d.when the question of fact turns on the trial court determination of disputed facts,we review the court ruling to determine whether there is sufficient evidence.id.at,d gross recabaren d.the evidence is sufficient if there is substantial evidence to support the ruling,evidence that is reasonable in nature,credible,and of solid value,estate of teed d.
in gross recabaren,supra,d,the court defined an account within the meaning of section while an open book account has been defined as an account with one or more items unsettled,it also includes an account with dealings still continuing.citation.by contrast,a closed account is,according to black law dictionary,one to which no further additions can be made on either side thus,it is clear that the open or closed nature of a book account turns not on the account balance per se,but on the parties expectations of possible future transactions between them.d at.cochran rubens,supra,th at,d.the court in cochran rubens further explained that whether the parties expect possible future transactions between them in the context naturally depends on whether there is a continuing relationship.th at,d.
in this case the trial court concluded the parties did not have an account and did not contemplate possible future transactions between them.there is substantial evidence to support these findings.there was no account in the technical sense because there was no evidence of a permanent record evidencing an open account of debits and credits.costerisan delong d.a book account is a permanent record,constituting a system of bookkeeping.nor was there an account in the sense that there was an ongoing relationship in which the parties expected possible future transactions.to the contrary,after siller treated reigelsperger on august,reigelsperger paid him in full,thereby closing out his account.indeed,siller did not even give reigelsperger a bill for his services or a receipt for payment received.it was only after services were rendered that the arbitration agreement was signed.
siller treated reigelsperger in for an acute condition under circumstances in which he needed immediate treatment.reigelsperger saw siller once for that problem and did not schedule any further appointment for treatment of his lower
