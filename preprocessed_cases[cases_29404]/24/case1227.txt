william rice and others sued attorney gary downs for legal malpractice,breach of fiduciary duty,and breach of a written agreement downs drafted to govern a limited liability corporation he formed with rice and others.the trial court ordered rice to arbitrate all of his claims pursuant to an arbitration provision in the written agreement.after arbitration,both rice and downs appealed,raising various contentions,including rice contention that the arbitration provision did not encompass his tort claims.we agree with rice on this point and conclude the trial court erred by compelling arbitration of those claims.accordingly,we partially reverse the judgment and conclude the other contentions on appeal are moot.
background 
allegations of rice complaint 
in april of rice filed a complaint in los angeles superior court alleging legal malpractice and other claims,no.the complaint alleged that as of,downs and law firms in which he was a partner served as counsel for rice,kristoffer kaufmann,and companies they were affiliated with.rice,kaufmann,and their companies did business in the affordable housing market.downs,rice and kaufmann decided they would form a company together to develop properties with affordable rents and government subsidies.to that end,downs,acting as counsel for rice,kauffmann,and the new company,highland property development,llc hpd prepared an operating agreement and formed hpd.downs entered into joint ownership of hpd with rice and kaufmann while still acting as counsel to them,but neither downs,nor any of the law firms in which he was a partner,advised rice,kaufmann or hpd with respect to actual or potential conflicts of interest,nor did they comply with california rules of professional conduct,rule.
the operating agreement contained the following provisions relevant to this appeal each member hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in california in any action on a claim arising out of,under or in connection with this agreement or the transactions contemplated by this agreement.except as otherwise provided in this agreement,any controversy between the parties arising out of this agreement shall be submitted to the american arbitration association for arbitration in los angeles,california.it further provided,no member or affiliate of a member,is entitled to remuneration for services rendered to the company except as otherwise expressly provided for in this agreement.
in,douglas day joined hpd as a fourth member.the complaint alleges that downs,again acting as counsel for all of the plaintiffs,prepared an amended operating agreement for hpd and formed highland property construction,hpc to contract for construction work on hpd projects.downs,rice,day,and kaufmann were the shareholders in hpc.at no time did downs,or the law firms of which he was a partner,advise of potential or actual conflicts,or comply with california rules of professional conduct,rule.the amended operating agreement contained the same terms regarding arbitration,jurisdiction,and compensation quoted above.
the complaint further alleges that pursuant to the compensation provisions in the operating agreement and the amended operating agreement,downs was not entitled to bill hpd for time he spent working on hpd legal or other matters,and he was not entitled to be personally compensated for any hpd related work performed by others at his law firm.
the complaint further alleges that in,based upon legal advice by downs,kaufmann was removed as a member and manager of hpd for cause.kaufmann demanded arbitration,seeking a declaration that his removal was improper and he was still a member of hpd,along with damages and attorney fees.downs arranged for a single attorney to represent himself,rice,and day in the kaufmann arbitration,without disclosure or waiver of conflicts of interest.
the complaint alleges that,as a result of the kaufmann arbitration,rice and day learned that downs had been billing hpd,through his law firm,for his personal time in providing legal services,both with respect to internal hpd affairs,and with respect to the various projects,contracts and other activities of hpd,even though this was prohibited under the terms of the operating agreement.rice,day and kaufmann were not aware of this previously because the law firms sent invoices that did not specify the attorneys working on matters or the hours and billing rates of those attorneys.rice and day also learned,for the first time,that downs had also been sharing in overrides bonuses from his law firm,as a billing partner,for hpd work done by other attorneys at the firm.when confronted with this disclosure,downs became hostile,accused rice and day of breaching the operating agreement or attempting to rescind or modify it unlawfully by challenging the payments downs had received for hpd related legal services,and downs filed an arbitration demand against rice and day,making those same accusations.
the complaint alleges downs,acting as counsel for rice,day,kaufmann,hpd,and hpc,committed legal malpractice by,inter alia,failing to advise his clients of potential or actual conflicts,and obtain their informed consent before forming hpd and hpc,and drafting the operating agreements entering into business transactions with his clients,specifically the formation of hpd and hpc,and the preparation and execution of their operating agreements,without advising of the potential conflicts and without complying with california rules of professional conduct,rule placing his own interests above those of his clients,in part by drafting and structuring the operating agreement for hpd in a manner that,based on downs present contentions,was detrimental to his clients and beneficial to downs and providing poor or incorrect legal advice and counseling with respect to the dispute with kaufmann,resulting in exposure of hpd,rice and day to damages and litigation,including strategies premised on incorrect readings of the operating agreement,or ambiguities in the operating agreement drafted by downs,and by arranging for a single attorney to represent downs,rice and day without disclosing and obtaining informed consent to actual or potential conflicts.
the legal malpractice cause of action also alleges five categories of deficiencies in the original and amended operating agreements and alleges that downs cost hpd and the plaintiffs hundreds of thousands of dollars of damages and extra expenses by deliberately interfering with pending transactions involving hpd which were being handled by nixon peabody downs firm,in order to obtain personal gain at the expense of hpd and the other members downs caused the attorneys at nixon peabody to take actions that were detrimental to hpd and plaintiffs,in an effort to coerce benefits for himself at the expense of his clients.
the complaint further alleged downs and nixon peabody also a named defendant owed a fiduciary duty to rice and the other plaintiffs by virtue of their relationship as attorney and client,which downs and nixon peabody breached by,inter alia,failing to disclose and obtain waivers of actual and potential conflicts between downs and his law firms on the one hand,and the other members or hpd or hpc on the other hand by engaging in business transactions with clients without complying with the provisions of california rules of professional conduct,rule and causing the attorneys at nixon peabody to take actions that were detrimental to hpd and plaintiffs,in an effort to coerce benefits for himself at the expense of his clients.
the complaint also asserted a breach of contract cause of action against downs alleging that he breached the operating agreement by secretly billing and being compensated for his own time working on hpd matters and receiving overrides or bonuses for the services provided by others in his firm.the complaint further alleged downs and nixon peabody were unjustly enriched by plaintiffs because downs and nixon peabody were paid attorneys fees that were not owed,and which downs,individually,and as a partner of nixon peabody,had agreed would not be charged.
finally,the complaint sought rescission and restitution,alleging by virtue of downs legal malpractice,breach of fiduciary duty,his failure to comply with california rules of professional conduct,rule,and his failure to disclose and obtain informed consent with respect to actual and potential conflicts with his clients,downs has improperly obtained benefits under the terms of the operating agreement and the amended operating agreement of hpd.but for the breach of fiduciary duty,legal malpractice and other misconduct of downs,he would not have obtained those benefits and would not have rights under the operating agreement.based on the conduct of downs,his rights under the operating agreement are rescinded,and he is obligated to pay restitution to rice,day and kaufmann,specifically,his share of all profits received from hpd and hpc.
downs complaint 
the day after rice complaint was filed,downs filed his own complaint in los angeles superior court against rice,day,and kaufmann,no.downs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to void and prevent performance of a settlement agreement between rice,day,and kaufmann.
trial court compels arbitration 
downs moved to compel arbitration as to all causes of action in rice complaint,based upon the arbitration provisions in the original and amended operating agreements.downs informed the court that the kaufmann and downs arbitrations had already been consolidated,and he wanted the claims in rice complaint to be resolved in the consolidated arbitration.
rice simultaneously moved to stay the downs arbitration in favor of litigating rice overlapping claims,which also involved nixon peabody,which was not a signatory to the agreements containing the arbitration provision.rice also opposed the motion to compel arbitration.nixon peabody filed its own response to the motion to compel arbitration,opposing arbitration of the malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty causes of action but not the remaining causes of action.
the trial court granted the motion to compel arbitration of all of the claims in rice complaint and denied rice motion to stay the downs arbitration.with respect to the motion to compel,the trial court concluded that the arbitration clause was broad enough to encompass tort causes of action and because the gravamen of these claims involves the operating agreements,these causes of action arise out of the operating agreement.
arbitration proceedings 
rice refiled his claims against downs as a in arbitration.
rice apparently encountered significant difficulty,delay,and obstruction by downs and nixon peabody in obtaining documentary discovery.in its postarbitration ruling on motions to confirm and vacate the arbitration award,the trial court recounted some of these problems and referred to what rice and day persuasively characterize as a coordinated campaign to delay and deflect.eventually,on the evening of december,a friday,with the arbitration hearing scheduled to commence on january,nixon peabody sent a disk containing approximately emails and nearly documents,yet failed to include all documents responsive to rice discovery requests.the following monday,rice dismissed his claims without prejudice.
upon downs request,the arbitrator ordered rice claims dismissed with prejudice.
the arbitrator ultimately awarded downs declaratory relief on two points that he did not breach the original or amended operating agreement or any other obligation by billing his time for legal services performed in connection with representing hpd and that the settlement agreement between rice,day,and kaufmann was void and downs did not interfere with it.the arbitrator did not decide downs claim for declaratory relief to the effect he did not commit malpractice or breach of fiduciary duty.the arbitration award required rice,day,and downs to repay certain sums to hpd and awarded downs and kaufmann attorney fees against rice and day.
trial court partially vacates,but otherwise confirms arbitration award 
downs filed a petition in the trial court to confirm the arbitration award.rice filed a petition to vacate the arbitration award to the extent the arbitrator had converted his dismissal without prejudice into a dismissal with prejudice.
after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing,the trial court granted both petitions,it reinstated rice dismissal without prejudice,but otherwise confirmed the arbitration award.
judgment and appeals 
the trial court entered judgment.both rice and downs appealed,and the appeals were consolidated.

the trial court erred by compelling arbitration of certain claims.
rice contends the trial court erred by compelling arbitration of his legal malpractice,breach of fiduciary duty,and rescission claims because they are tort claims and the narrow arbitration provision in the operating agreements does not encompass them downs contends the arbitration provision is sufficiently broad to encompass rice claims the parties arbitration agreement governs any controversy arising out of the hpd operating agreements any controversy includes tort claims,and tort claims can and,in this case,they all do arise out of those agreements.
each party approach is somewhat inadequate to resolve the issue before us.the issue is not resolved simply by determining whether the arbitration clause is narrow or broad,whether the arbitration clause could encompass tort claims,or even whether the claims in issue sound in tort,not contract.the issue is whether the particular claims in issue are controversies arising out of the operating agreements.while they clearly fall within the category of any controversy,we conclude that they did not arise out of the operating agreements and should not have been ordered to arbitration.
any controversy 
several courts have held that a phrase such as any dispute or any controversy potentially encompasses tort claims.efund capital partners pless th,efund lewsadder mitchum,jones templeton,d,lewsadder.we agree,but that alone is not determinative.the parties did not simply agree to arbitrate any controversy,effectively meaning every controversy between them.any controversy is necessarily modified by arising out of this agreement.
moreover,even under a very broad arbitration provision,such as any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement,tort claims must have their roots in the relationship between the parties which was created by the contract before they can be deemed to fall within the scope of the arbitration provision.bos material handling,crown controls d,bos.in coast plaza,where the parties had agreed to arbitrate any problem or dispute that arose under or concerned the terms of the service agreement th at,the appellate court examined the claims and concluded,these claims unquestionably have arisen under the service agreement and are inextricably related to its terms and provisions id.at.
similarly,the efund and lewsadder courts did not end their analysis by concluding that tort claims were potentially embraced within the scope of any dispute or any controversy.in each case,the court examined the nature of the agreement and of the claims and their relationship to one another,determining that the particular claims arose from or out of the agreement efund,supra,th at pp.or arose out of my employment or the termination of my employment lewsadder,supra,d at.
arising out of the operating agreements 
we view the operating agreements arbitration provision in the context of the whole agreements,in light of the usual and ordinary meaning of the contractual language and the circumstances under which the agreements were made,and attempting to give effect to every part,if reasonably practicable,with each clause helping to interpret others.in this case,the parties intent is revealed by contrasting the narrowly worded arbitration clause with the immediately preceding,expansively worded jurisdiction clause.while the parties consented to jurisdiction in state and federal courts sitting in california for any action on a claim arising out of,under or in connection with this agreement or the transactions contemplated by this agreement italics added,they agreed to arbitrate only any controversy between the parties arising out of this agreement.viewing these adjacent provisions together,it seems clear that the parties intended to arbitrate only a limited range of claims,those arising out of the agreement,while litigating a much broader range of claims,any claim arising out of,under,or in connection with the agreement or transactions contemplated by the agreement.the parties could easily have copied and pasted the broader text from the jurisdiction clause to the arbitration clause,but chose not to do so.this omission has significance,especially in light of precedent in the courts specified in the jurisdiction clause,on which the parties and the attorneys who drafted the agreement downs others in his firm were entitled to,and presumably did,rely.
as a general rule of construction,the parties are presumed to know and to have had in mind all applicable laws extant when an agreement is made.these existing laws are considered part of the contract just as if they were expressly referred to and incorporated.citation.existing law includes the common law of the state.progressive west ins.superior court th.with respect to the wording of arbitration clauses,the court in cape flattery observed and held there is a good reason to indicate clearly to contracting parties what specific language will signify that the scope of their arbitration agreement is narrow.once they know the specific language that is required,they can rely on that language to produce a result they jointly desire i n this case,when the parties entered into the agreement,mediterranean and tracer had both been decided.the agreement concerned the salvage of a vessel that had run aground in the ninth circuit.there is no reason to believe that the experienced lawyers representing both parties intended that the language they chose would be interpreted differently than it had been in those cases.we conclude that because the language in the arbitration provisions in mediterranean and tracer is the same as the language in the agreement,the narrow interpretation of arising under in those cases controls.at.
the parties in this case entered into the original operating agreement in,by which time it was well established in both state and ninth circuit decisions that an arbitration provision that included both the arising from or arising out of type of language and a phrase such as in connection with or relating to extended the scope of an arbitration provision to also encompass tort claims having their roots in the relationship between the parties which was created by the contract bos,supra,d at and every dispute between the parties having a significant relationship to the contract and all disputes having their origin or genesis in the contract simula,supra,at,whereas provisions using only phrases such as arising out of or arising from were narrower in application and extended only to disputes relating to the interpretation and performance of the agreement cobler,supra,d at mediterranean,supra,at tracer,supra,at.
four years later,when the parties entered into the amended operating agreement in october of,the state of the law remained the same in california courts and the ninth circuit.efund,upon which downs relies,and bono,upon which rice relies,had both been decided,but neither changed the state of the law.bono involved a very specific and narrow arbitration clause applying to any controversy among the parties involving the construction or application of any provision of this agreement,and the court concluded it did not encompass a defamation claim by one contracting party against another.th at.efund involved an unusually worded arbitration provision applying to a ny dispute or other disagreement arising from or out of the agreement.th at.the appellate court not only concluded that each cause of action stemmed from the relationship created by the agreement and thus arose from or out of it,it also distinguished the language of the parties arbitration clause from the standard narrow arising out of type of clause the crucial language in the arbitration clause differs from that discussed in the two ninth circuit opinions relied upon by the trial court.the critical language in the two ninth circuit opinions were arising hereunder in mediterranean enterprises,and arising out of this agreement in tracer research.citation.by contrast the language in the arbitration clause in this case is materially broader arising from or out of than that in mediterranean enterprises,or tracer research.moreover,as we have explained,language of the type at issue here,when broadly construed,has consistently been applied in california opinions to require arbitration of tort claims.th at,italics added.moreover,even if we were to assume efund effected some change in the state of the law,the parties did not modify the language of the arbitration provision in the amended operating agreement to take advantage of such a change.they easily could have added from or to their arbitration provision to take advantage of the ruling in efund,but did not do so.
given both the state of the law at the time the parties entered into the original and amended operating agreements and the stark contrast between the parties limited arbitration provision applying only to controversies arising out of the agreement and their much broader jurisdictional provision extending to claims arising out of,under or in connection with the agreements or the transactions contemplated by the agreements,we necessarily conclude the parties intended the arbitration provision to apply to a very limited range of controversies,not ones merely connected with the operating agreements or transactions contemplated by those agreements and certainly not all controversies between them.had the parties intended a broadly applicable arbitration clause,they could have simply used the same phrasing they used in the jurisdiction clause.the parties,as well as the attorneys drafting the agreements,are presumed to be aware of and to have relied upon the judicial interpretation in california and the ninth circuit of the language they used.
accordingly,we conclude that while the arbitration provision encompasses contractual claims and perhaps even tort claims arising from the agreement,a tort claim based upon violation of an independent duty or right originating outside of the agreement does not arise from the agreement and falls outside the scope of the arbitration provision.
rice malpractice,breach of fiduciary duty,and rescission claims do not arise out of the operating agreements 
malpractice cause of action 
rice complaint alleges that downs and his law firms represented rice and kauffman before the three men decided to create a business together,before downs formed hpd,and before he prepared the operating agreement.this relationship did not arise out of the operating agreement or even the parties decision to go into business together.moreover,neither the original nor the amended operating agreement addresses an relationship between downs and anyone else,including rice or hpd.the legal malpractice cause of action alleges that downs violated duties created by his relationship with rice by acts and omissions such as failing to advise of his actual and potential conflicts of interest,entering into business transactions with his clients,and providing poor or incorrect legal advice.the cause of action is based upon violations of duties created by the relationship,not by the operating agreements.the cause of action does not turn on an interpretation of any clause in the contract and is not based upon performance or failure to perform under the contract.thus,the malpractice cause of action does not arise out of the agreements.it may relate to the agreements or be connected with them,but the parties arbitration provision is limited to claims arising out of the agreements.accordingly,the arbitration provision does not encompass the legal malpractice claim,and the trial court erred by compelling arbitration of it.
downs argues,with respect to each cause of action,that it arises out of the agreements because,but for the agreements,the claim would not exist.he cites adam decharon th adam for the proposition that this but for the agreement standard is used to determine whether a claim arises out of an agreement.in adam,a home seller failed to disclose known drainage and flooding problems,in violation of civil code section and a provision of the contract for the sale of the home that required the seller to deliver a disclosure statement.the purchasers prevailed on their failure to disclose cause of action,but not their breach of contract cause of action.the issue on appeal was whether the purchasers were entitled to attorney fees under the fees provision in the real property contract,which allowed the prevailing party to recover fees in any action arising out of this agreement.th at pp.although the purchasers were not entitled to recover attorney fees under civil code section because they did not prevail on their breach of contract cause of action,the appellate court concluded they were entitled to recover fees under code of civil procedure section and explained one of the causes of action on which the adams prevailed was the failure of decharon to comply with the requirements of civil code section et.she did not complete the real estate transfer disclosure statement.that this cause of action concerns the violation of a statute does not make it any less one arising from the agreement.but for the agreement to purchase,there would be no cause of action for violation of section et.moreover,section of the real estate contract required decharon to deliver the disclosure statement within two calendar days of seller acceptance.th at.
adam obviously did not pertain to the wording of an arbitration clause,and the court did not hold that a claim arises out of an agreement if,but for the agreement,the claim would not exist,as downs urges.moreover,adam is distinguishable from the present case,even beyond the differing factual context.in adam,the relationship between the seller and purchasers of the property stemmed solely from the real property contract.the seller disclosure obligation came into existence only upon formation of that contract,and the contract reflected the statutory disclosure obligation.here,however,the relationship between rice and downs and the duties rice alleges downs and his firm breached
