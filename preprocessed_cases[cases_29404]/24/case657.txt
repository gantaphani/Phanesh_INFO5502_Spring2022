in this appeal we decide whether david webster filed his motion to vacate an arbitration award in federal district court one day too late.the district court concluded that the motion was untimely,having determined that the statute of limitations began to run when the award was placed in the mail and stopped when the defendants were served with notice of webster motion three months and one day later.webster contends that both dates were improper benchmarks.we conclude that under of the federal arbitration act faa,webster motion was untimely.in reaching this decision,we have found it necessary to clarify our prior decisions concerning the critical dates for purposes of the faa limitations period.
kearney,hired webster as general counsel in.the following year,electronic data systems corporation acquired kearney.after working for the new entity for a number of years,webster lost his job when kearney legal department was eliminated.he brought claims against the defendants collectively eds for age discrimination and breach of his employment agreement.that agreement contained a mandatory arbitration provision,under which the parties agreed to arbitrate employment disputes according to the procedures of the american arbitration association aaa.accordingly,webster filed a demand for arbitration in october,and,after nearly two years,a hearing was held.ultimately the arbitrator found for eds.
the arbitrator issued the award on january.that same day,the award was placed in the mail and also distributed to both parties counsel via.a cover letter dated january accompanied both disseminations.webster attorney,norman lerum,first opened the on january,although he acknowledges that the message was received by his office computer on january.unsatisfied with the arbitrator decision,webster sought to overturn the award on the ground that the arbitrator had exceeded his authority,see a.toward that end,he filed a motion to vacate the award in federal district court on april,and served eds with notice of the motion on april.eds responded by moving to dismiss webster action as untimely.
the faa provides that when a party moves to vacate,confirm,or modify an arbitration award,notice must be served upon the opposing party or his attorney within three months after the award is filed or delivered.eds argued that the award was delivered for purposes of the faa when it was placed in the mail on january,or alternatively when it was the same day.eds further maintained that it was served when it received notice of the filing of the federal action on april day after the anniversary of the award delivery.the district court took the delivery date to be january,when the was sent and received although not opened.the court held that the statute of limitations expired on april,exactly three months later,rendering webster federal action untimely.
we note at the outset that,although the parties agree that our review is de novo,they dispute whether this appeal is from the denial of a motion to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b or a motion for summary judgment under rule.they are both mistaken,and we are puzzled by the way the parties purport to be experienced with litigation under the in the district court.under the faa,a ny application to the court hereunder shall be made and heard in the manner provided by law for the making and hearing of motions.this provision of the faa,we have held,removes actions to confirm or vacate arbitration awards from the realm of civil cases governed by the federal rules of civil procedure.see fed civ,a health servs.mgmt.hughes,cir.in hughes,the filer of a motion to vacate protested the district court denial of the motion and the entry of judgment in favor of the opposing party on the ground that the district court had not afforded the movant the process required by federal rule of civil procedure,including scheduling conferences and briefing.we held that of the faa preempts the applicability of the federal rules in favor of the rules governing motions practice.similarly,other courts have concluded that actions under the faa to challenge or confirm awards proceed outside the federal rules,except insofar as the faa is silent.see productos mercantiles e industriales,faberge usa,cir,prof l planning,cir.
accordingly,the procedures used in this case diverged from those required by the faa.no complaint or motion to dismiss or any other filing conceived by the federal rules of civil procedure need have been filed.webster,as the party challenging the award,should have filed a motion to vacate and provid ed the court with all matters that it desires the court to consider in support of that motion.hughes,at.eds,in turn,could have contested the motion by seeking confirmation of the award,again submitting whatever supporting documentation was necessary for a decision.if necessary,and in keeping with its motions practice,the district court could have scheduled a hearing or other additional steps.we do not suggest that the procedural foibles amounted to reversible error this was a case of mislabeling rather than mishandling.the district court did not rule on the merits of webster motion,and the parties had the opportunity to submit documentary evidence on the issue of timeliness,the only matter now before us.see productos mercantiles e industriales,at explaining that district court properly decided motion based solely on papers submitted by parties.we simply note the procedural irregularities by way of considering whether the parties properly identify the standard of review as de novo.they are correct,but not because we are reviewing an appeal from a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment,but because a district court decision on a motion to vacate or confirm an arbitration award under the faa is reviewed de novo.cytyc deka prods,cir patten signator ins.agency,cir sarofim trust of the,cir.we turn now to the issue of timeliness.
on appeal,webster argues that his motion was timely for a number of reasons.we begin with the more straightforward issue of when the statute of limitations ceases to run.webster contends that the filing of a motion to vacate is the relevant benchmark because filing signals the commencement of a federal action.eds contends that the phrase service of notice in of the faa should be construed literally to mean that the limitations period stops only when notice is served.
the rule that webster suggests has no grounding in the plain language of the relevant statute,and that is where our inquiry begins and ends,absent some ambiguity.see greenfield mills,macklin,cir apfel,cir.we find nothing ambiguous about provision that the statute of limitations is tolled when notice of a motion to vacate is served upon the opposing party or his attorney.despite this plain language,webster insists that the clear intent of was to toll the three month limitation with the commencement of an action to vacate the challenged arbitration award,the filing of the motion.he maintains that of the faa was superseded by federal rule of civil procedure,which provides a civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.but our preceding analysis should make clear that the federal rules do not preempt the faa,and that a complaint is not needed at all in an action to vacate or confirm an award.see hughes,at.indeed,the federal rules themselves provide that they apply to federal civil suits with the exceptions stated in rule,and rule a provides that in proceedings under the faa title nine of the united states code,these rules apply only to the extent that matters of procedure are not provided for in those statutes.webster argument that the federal rules supercede faa by implication therefore is unavailing.accordingly,the statute of limitations did not terminate until webster gave the defendants notice of his intent to challenge the arbitration award on april.
before moving on,we wish to clarify some of our previous statements about the tolling date.the parties point out,correctly,that at least two of our past decisions could be read to provide some support for webster position that the statute of limitations stops upon the filing of a motion
