statutory overview 
the state contract act governs specified public works projects that exceed a certain cost,and requires competitive bidding for covered projects.the act mandates that once a bid is accepted and the parties enter into a contract,the remedy for the resolution of claims arising from the contract shall be arbitration under the statutory provisions.this arbitration process is administered by the office of administrative hearings oah,and by a committee composed of industry and governmental representatives,known as the public works contract arbitration committee public works arbitration committee,tit.
the public works arbitration committee certifies arbitrators with experience in public construction matters to preside over statutory public works arbitration hearings,and maintains a list of those certified arbitrators the certified panel,d.the state contract act and the implementing regulations provide a detailed procedure to assist the parties in mutually selecting an arbitrator from the certified panel,and allow the parties to petition the superior court if this process does not result in the selection of a mutually agreeable arbitrator.once the arbitrator is selected,the arbitrator is subject to numerous disclosure obligations,and either party may disqualify the arbitrator based on a required disclosure.an arbitrator failure to disclose is a basis for vacating the arbitration award after it is issued.code civ,subd.a guseinov burns th,d.
factual and procedural background 
coffman public works contracts 
coffman successfully bid on three road construction projects governed by the state contract act,and entered into three separate contracts with caltrans.the parties later had disputes on each project,and coffman sought arbitration,or planned to seek arbitration,with respect to these disputes.the following summarizes the facts alleged pertaining to each of these construction projects.
route project 
coffman entered into a contract requiring coffman to construct highway between highway and interstate.the stated contract price was.during the construction,numerous disputes arose between caltrans and coffman concerning issues such as the scope of the work and differing site conditions.in july,coffman substantially completed the work.in june,caltrans issued a final denial of coffman claims for additional payments.
in september,coffman filed an arbitration complaint against caltrans for.coffman requested that caltrans stipulate to an experienced and qualified arbitrator from outside the certified panel.caltrans refused to agree to this request.coffman and caltrans then participated in,and exhausted,the arbitrator selection process under the applicable regulations.
in july,coffman filed a petition with the superior court seeking an order declaring the statutory arbitration requirement to be facially unconstitutional and unenforceable.in response,caltrans filed its own petition for the appointment of an arbitrator from the certified panel.the court denied coffman petition,but stated the denial was without prejudice to raise the constitutional challenge in an alternate forum.the court then granted caltrans request for the appointment of an arbitrator.in october,the court issued a minute order appointing david robison from the certified panel as an arbitrator on the route project arbitration.
route project 
in,coffman and caltrans entered into a written contract for construction work along interstate.the stated contract price was.coffman completed the work in about october.during the project,various disputes arose between coffman and caltrans.in july,caltrans issued a final written decision denying coffman claims for additional payment.in october,coffman filed an arbitration complaint against caltrans for.the arbitration proceeding is currently pending.
interstate project 
in,coffman and caltrans entered into a written contract for the construction of managed lanes on interstate at the interstate separation.the stated contract amount was.coffman began work in december.the work has not yet been completed,but coffman has calculated that it will be owed an additional million based on the parties existing disputes.upon completion of the project,coffman intends to submit a claim for payment,and if the claim is denied,it will be required to file a complaint in arbitration with the oah.
declaratory relief complaint 
in november,coffman filed the declaratory relief complaint at issue in this appeal.coffman alleged the facts summarized above pertaining to the three construction projects,and asserted two causes of action.in the first cause of action,coffman alleged the arbitration rules in the state contract act and implementing regulations are facially unconstitutional because the rules create an inherent financial bias in the arbitrator to favor caltrans because of caltrans status as a repeat customer in the arbitrations violate a contractor first amendment right to petition and due process rights by requiring contractors to pay the costs of the arbitration and violate a public works contractor equal protection rights by requiring claims against caltrans to proceed under the arbitration scheme,while excluding contractor claims against other public agencies.
in the second cause of action,coffman alleged the arbitration provisions are unconstitutional as applied because all arbitrators on the certified panel are biased in favor of caltrans.coffman did not allege any specific supporting facts,but instead asserted generally that caltrans substantial delay in the contract payment and arbitration process effectively chills and abridges the contractor ability to receive payment for work performed and is intended to punish and deter a contractor from pursuing his or her statutory rights.
caltrans filed a demurrer,arguing that coffman complaint failed to state a cognizable cause of action.on the facial challenge,caltrans argued the statutory scheme does not result in biased arbitrators or violate a contractor first amendment or equal protection rights.on the challenge,caltrans argued that coffman did not allege any facts about the manner in which the arbitration provisions were unconstitutional as applied to coffman case.caltrans further asserted that the claim was not ripe because coffman concerns were hypothetical and coffman has not suffered any harm.
in response,coffman focused primarily on its argument that the certified panel arbitrators are necessarily biased in favor of caltrans because caltrans is a repeat customer at public works arbitrations.in support,coffman discussed facts that were not alleged in the complaint.first,coffman stated that caltrans is a party in percent of all public works arbitration hearings,citing statistical records posted on the oah web site.second,coffman asserted that of the certified panel arbitrators have previously worked at unspecified times as an arbitrator on a caltrans arbitration,and therefore percent of the arbitrators are biased by statutory definition.based on these facts,coffman argued the entire statutory scheme is set up in such a way that every arbitrator on the panel has an inherent financial incentive to rule in favor of the state and caltrans because the state is always a party and caltrans is the arbitrator repeat customer of the time.
at the hearing on the demurrer,coffman counsel also discussed the status of the arbitration in the route project matter.he stated that caltrans had objected to the original arbitrator selected by the court robison on the basis that robison had previously served as an arbitrator for coffman.the court then appointed another arbitrator who had issued a large monetary award in favor of a different contractor,but caltrans also successfully objected to this arbitrator.coffman counsel argued that caltrans objections to these certified panel arbitrators support coffman claims that the statutory scheme results in biased arbitrators.counsel said coffman could amend its complaint to add these and other factual allegations to show how caltrans is able to manipulate the system.
after the hearing,the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.the court found coffman failed to state facts sufficient to support a facial or an constitutional challenge to the applicable arbitration provisions.

review standards 
on appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after the court sustained a demurrer,a reviewing court must determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.zelig county of los angeles cal th,d.we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.ibid.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but do not assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.ibid.we exercise our independent judgment as to whether,as a matter of law,the complaint states a cause of action on any available legal theory.betancourt storke housing investors cal th,d.we further examine whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse.city of dinuba county of tulare cal th,d.
coffman brought a facial and an challenge to the constitutionality of the public works arbitration statutes.the validity of both claims may be decided on a demurrer.see kasler lockyer cal th,d,breneric associates city of del mar th,d alfaro terhune th,d.however,the analysis is different on each claim.
in evaluating a facial challenge,a court considers only the text of the measure itself,not its application to the particular circumstances of an individual.tobe city of santa ana cal th,d.the california supreme court has not articulated a single test for determining the propriety of a facial challenge.guardianship of ann cal th,d.under the strictest test,the statute must be upheld unless the party establishes the statute inevitably pose s a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions.ibid.under the more lenient standard,a party must establish the statute conflicts with constitutional principles in the generality or great majority of cases,italics omitted.under either test,the plaintiff has a heavy burden to show the statute is unconstitutional in all or most cases,and can not prevail by suggesting that in some future hypothetical situation constitutional problems may possibly arise as to the particular application of the statute.zuckerman state bd.of chiropractic examiners cal th,d.

ii.facial challenge 
in its complaint,coffman alleges three separate ways in which the arbitration provisions in the state contract act and implementing regulations facially violate a contractor constitutional rights establishing an arbitration system whereby all arbitrators are biased in favor of caltrans violating a contractor constitutional petition rights by requiring the contractor to share in the cost of the arbitration and violating a contractor equal protection rights.we conclude the complaint does not state a valid cause of action on any of these three grounds,nor does any proposed amendment to the complaint support the cause of action.
contentions pertaining to biased arbitrators 
coffman contends all arbitrators appointed from the certified panel have a financial incentive to rule in favor of the state and therefore all arbitrators are biased in favor of caltrans.in considering this claim,we first summarize the statutory and regulatory provisions governing the selection of an arbitrator,and then examine coffman arguments that this process inevitably results in a biased arbitrator.
provisions governing arbitration selection process 
the state contract act requires an arbitrator to be selected from the certified panel,unless the parties agree otherwise.see brutoco engineering construction,superior court th,d brutoco.the arbitrators on the certified panel are chosen by the public works arbitration committee.the public works arbitration committee consists of seven members three public members appointed by the governor,each of whom has at least years experience with a general contracting firm engaged in public works construction three government appointed by directors of the various departments including caltrans and the oah director,who is a nonvoting member.the appointed public members serve terms,and serve without compensation,except for expense reimbursement.ibid.
the public works arbitration committee is responsible for establishing standards and qualifications for the certification of arbitrators and for certify ing as arbitrators persons meeting such standards and qualifications.arbitrators selected by the committee are required to have substantial experience in public works construction projects,experience as public works arbitrators,and knowledge of california law.
the state contract act and implementing regulations provide detailed rules governing the selection of an arbitrator from the certified panel.the fundamental principles underlying these rules are full disclosure and mutual consent.after a party initially serves an arbitration complaint,the parties have days to agree on the selection of an arbitrator,b.if no agreement is reached,the regulations provide for a process in which the oah assists the parties in identifying an arbitrator who is acceptable to both parties.ibid.under these rules,each party must submit to the oah a list of five acceptable arbitrators from the certified panel,and the oah then reviews these lists for mutual preferences and selects an arbitrator who appears on both lists.ibid.
if a mutually acceptable arbitrator has not been identified after the second round of arbitrator list submissions,or six months from the filing of the arbitration complaint,whichever comes first,either party may petition the superior court to select one or more arbitrators in order of preference from among those who have indicated a willingness to serve as an arbitrator in the location for the hearing,d.code of civil procedure section provides the court with the authority to appoint an arbitrator when the parties can not agree to an arbitrator.
once an arbitrator is selected either through the administrative process or by the superior court after a petition by a party,the prospective arbitrator shall disclose to the oah any circumstances likely to prevent a prompt hearing and decision or to create a presumption of bias,a.the disclosures must satisfy specific standards from the judicial council ethics standards for neutral arbitrators in contractual arbitration ethics standards,including standard,a.
standard provides a person who is nominated or appointed as an arbitrator must disclose all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed arbitrator would be able to be impartial.standard d.the standard then contains numerous rules requiring an arbitrator to disclose certain relationships or circumstances,which specifically include an arbitrator prior service as a hearing officer for either party during the previous five years and detailed facts about the prior service,including the identity of the prevailing party and the amount of the award standard d a b.
as reflected in the margin,the disclosure requirements are comprehensive,covering any conceivable circumstance that might call into question the arbitrator ability to serve as a neutral hearing officer,and any facts that might possibly show the appearance of bias.additionally,these disclosure rules supplement and expand the statutory listing of required disclosures by arbitrators contained in code of civil procedure section,which requires a proposed arbitrator to disclose all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed neutral arbitrator would be able to be impartial,including t he existence of any ground specified in code of civil procedure section for disqualification of a judge and detailed information about current and prior arbitrations within the past five years involving parties to the pending arbitration 
under the state contract act,upon disclosure of a disqualifying circumstance,t he prospective arbitrator shall be disqualified by the oah if an objection is made by one of the parties within ten days from the date of the receipt of the information.if neither party objects within the time specified,the prospective arbitrator shall be deemed acceptable,b,italics added.further the arbitrator disclosure obligation under the state contract act is a continuing duty,applying from service of the notice of the arbitrator proposed appointment until the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding,c.
the statutes governing contractual arbitration provide parties with similar automatic disqualification rights.luce,forward,hamilton scripps,llp koch th,d luce forward code civ.section confers on both parties the unqualified right to remove a proposed arbitrator based on any disclosure required by law which could affect his or her neutrality.citation.there is no good faith or good cause requirement for the exercise of this right,nor is there a limit on the number of proposed neutrals who may be disqualified in this manner.citation.as long as the objection is based on a required disclosure,a party right to remove the proposed neutral by giving timely notice is absolute.luce forward,supra,at,d.
on our review of the statutory and regulatory provisions,there is no support for coffman arguments that the public works arbitration system necessarily results in biased arbitrators.to the contrary,the broad disclosure and disqualification protections provided by the state contract act,and its implementing regulations,that incorporate the ethics standards,as well as the disclosure rules of code of civil procedure section,provide assurance that an arbitrator who ultimately presides over a public works arbitration hearing will be neutral and acceptable to both parties.the fact that an appointed committee composed of an equal number of industry and government voting representatives screens and certifies the arbitrators provides additional grounds for concluding that any arbitrator with a predisposition to one side will not be qualified to serve as a public works arbitrator.to the extent a contractor believes a particular arbitrator is biased,the contractor can raise these concerns in the specific proceeding,either in response to the appointment of an arbitrator,or in response to a motion to confirm the award if new information is discovered during the arbitration proceedings.see brutoco,supra,th at,d.
as its primary legal theory,coffman argues the statutory scheme necessarily violates a contractor due process rights because the arbitrator must issue rulings favorable to caltrans in order to obtain future employment.coffman contends that any arbitrator placed on the certified panel develops an inevitable financial bias in favor of caltrans because caltrans is the steady and repeat customer in public works arbitrations.the asserted logic underlying this argument is as follows arbitrators on the certified panel are paid only if they are selected to conduct an arbitration most arbitrators who are on the certified panel have served as an arbitrator on a case in which caltrans was a party caltrans will presumably rely on this prior service factor to disqualify arbitrators who have ruled against it in a prior case and thus an arbitrator will have a financial incentive to rule in favor of caltrans because he or she wants to be selected as an arbitrator and the arbitrator does not want to be challenged for cause.
this chain of reasoning is unpersuasive.most important,coffman ignores that the rules permit any party including a contractor to disqualify an arbitrator based on a disclosure required under the ethics standards or statutory rules.one of these required disclosures is that the proposed arbitrator served as an arbitrator on a case in which caltrans was a party during the previous five years.standard d a i.the arbitrator must also disclose details of the prior service,including the identification of the prevailing party and the total amount of monetary damages awarded,if any.standard d b.if,based on this information,a contractor believes the arbitrator would not be fair or unbiased,the contractor would have the automatic right to disqualify this arbitrator,b.in this situation,any suggestion of bias would be removed.
coffman asserts that a contractor right to object to an arbitrator does not eliminate the potential bias because individual contractors are parties in public works arbitrations with much less frequency than is caltrans.coffman thus claims arbitrators have the incentive to rule in favor of the repeat customer rather than the party who is only an occasional litigant in the process.however,under coffman own theory,if a contractor is seeking to avoid a biased arbitrator,a relevant factor will be the arbitrator prior rulings in caltrans arbitrations.if the arbitrator has presided over a caltrans public works arbitration within the past five years,the contractor will have the right to this information under the ethics standards.standard d b.and if the contractor learns that an arbitrator has consistently ruled in favor of caltrans,the contractor will have the opportunity to disqualify the arbitrator.thus,under the structure of the mutual disqualification system,an arbitrator who wishes to be selected for future arbitrations would not have a particular incentive to favor either party,but instead to rule in a fair and impartial manner.
in this regard,this case differs from haas county of san bernardino cal th,d,relied upon by coffman.in haas,the california supreme court upheld a plaintiff due process challenge to the manner in which a county selected temporary administrative hearing officers to preside over alleged state law and ordinance violations.id.at,d.under the challenged rules,the county prosecutor selected the hearing officer at will,paid the hearing officer entire fee,and was free to select the same adjudicator for future disputes at the prosecutor own discretion.id.at,d.the high court concluded that this system for selecting hearing officers was unconstitutional because it created the risk that the officers would have a financial incentive to rule in favor of the county to obtain future work as a hearing officer.id.at,d.the court emphasized that the county rather than the opposing party would be the repeat customer upon whose goodwill,alone,the hearing officer prospect of future employment in that capacity depended.id.at,d,italics added.
the arbitrator selection process here is materially different.it is not caltrans goodwill alone that determines the arbitrator future employment as a public works arbitrator.instead,it is both and the must mutually agree to the arbitrator if the arbitrator has been a hearing officer at a prior caltrans arbitration.unlike haas,a single party does not have the authority to select the arbitrator.instead,the contractor and caltrans must come to an agreement on the arbitrator or a judge selects the arbitrator,and then each party has a right to strike an arbitrator for any disclosable circumstance,including if the arbitrator has worked for caltrans in the prior five years.this system provides strong incentive for the arbitrators to be fair to both parties if he or she desires future arbitration work.
moreover,unlike in haas,a neutral committee selects the potential individuals to serve as arbitrators in public works disputes,and the arbitrator must obtain recertification every seven years.composed of an equal number of governmental and industry voting representatives,the public works arbitration committee is structured to ensure that individuals not strongly associated with either side would be included on the certified panel.see brutoco,supra,th at,d.additionally,unlike the system in haas,a public works arbitrator is subject to the ethics standards,which the haas court noted would serve to greatly reduce the specific risk of bias arising from a paid adjudicator repeat service for the same party.haas,supra,cal th at,d.
we reject coffman alternate argument that the fact an arbitrator has presided over a prior caltrans arbitration necessarily means the arbitrator can not fairly preside over the case in an unbiased manner.in support of this contention,coffman cites the disclosure rules applicable to superior court judges code civ,which apply to arbitrators under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.these disclosure rules do not mean the arbitrator is unfit to serve as a neutral decisionmaker.under the applicable statutes and regulations,the public works arbitrator neutrality is assured by requiring extensive disclosures of all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain doubt that the proposed arbitrator would be able to be impartial,a and requiring the party to timely object to the arbitrator based on the disclosure if the party believes the arbitrator would not be appropriate,b.by establishing a broad disclosure requirement and then placing the burden on the parties to timely disqualify the arbitrator at the party option,the legislature did not provide that a disclosure,in and of itself,means the arbitrator could not be neutral 
in a related argument,coffman asserts that every arbitrator who is certified by the public works arbitration committee,is by definition,biased or because he or she applied to be on the certified panel.in support of this argument,coffman relies on code of civil procedure section,subdivision a a i,which provides a judge shall be disqualified if the judge has a current or prospective employment as a dispute resolution neutral,or has participated in discussions concerning such employment,and certain other circumstances are present,including that the arrangement or prior employment was with a party to the proceeding,or the matter before the judge concerns enforcement of an arbitration agreement.code of civil procedure section incorporates portions of section,subdivision a a i as a fact that must be disclosed under certain circumstances.see,subd.a.
reading these statutes together in a common sense manner,the provisions do not mean that an arbitrator application for certification from the public works arbitration committee reflects bias or the appearance of bias.a central purpose of the certified panel is to ensure that parties to public works contracts have an experienced hearing officer with a background in these projects,leading to better informed rulings and more efficient dispute resolution.it would defeat this purpose to hold that all such arbitrators are subject to disqualification merely because they applied to be on the certified panel.there is no basis for concluding an application to serve on the certified panel reflects bias or the appearance of bias.
in its reply brief,coffman argues the process of mutual disqualification means that an arbitrator will never be selected.it contends that because the challenges are limitless there will be an endless process of disqualifications,and that caltrans will intentionally delay the process by continuing to assert challenges until it obtains an arbitrator who is biased in caltrans favor.
these arguments do not support coffman facial challenge to the statutory scheme.as coffman acknowledges,numerous caltrans arbitrations have taken place before a mutually agreed upon public works arbitrator.the possibility that in some future situation,the parties will have difficulty selecting an arbitrator or that caltrans will unreasonably delay the process does not show that the statutes inevitably pose a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions,nor does it show the scheme violates due process in the generality or great majority of cases.guardianship of ann,supra,cal th at,d,italics omitted.
further,the argument that the selection process is is unsupported by the applicable statutory and rule provisions.the regulations establish a maximum period for parties to agree to an arbitrator,and then the parties may petition the court to appoint an arbitrator,d.the court would then have the inherent equitable authority to impose reasonable time limits on the selection process.moreover,we are required to presume good faith on the part of public officials,see city of banning desert outdoor advertising,d.if a party believes caltrans has acted in bad faith in a particular case,the contractor would be entitled to raise the issue with the court in that case.
