for reasons disputed by the parties and not relevant here,world rentals franchise business quickly deteriorated.by early,world rentals stopped making principal payments to volvo finance,which alleges that it refrained from declaring a default for over a year while world rentals attempted to sell its volvo rents franchise.in may,volvo finance learned that a interest payment from world rentals had been returned unpaid.
on may,facing imminent legal action by volvo finance,the world parties sued volvo rents and volvo finance in the united states district court for the southern district of florida.asserting various contract and tort claims,the complaint essentially alleged that volvo rents and volvo finance made fraudulent representations that induced the world parties to sign the franchise agreements,loan documents,and guaranty agreements.volvo finance promptly filed counterclaims against the world parties for,among other things,breach of the loan documents.volvo finance alleged as the event of default that world rentals failed to make required payments under the loan documents.volvo finance did not rely on any breach of the franchise agreements.on july,the world parties amended their complaint to add additional claims and a request for declarations that the arbitration provisions in the franchise agreements were unenforceable,and that both volvo entities right to invoke those arbitration provisions had been waived by volvo finance participation in the litigation.
on august,volvo rents moved to stay the world parties claims against it so that their dispute could be arbitrated under the arbitration provisions contained in the franchise agreements.volvo finance,on the other hand,sought dismissal,or in the alternative,summary judgment on the claims filed against it.the world parties then repudiated their amended complaint by agreeing that the arbitration provision was enforceable,and to stay all claims and compel arbitration of the entire dispute,including the claims filed by and against volvo finance.the district court initially granted the world parties and ordered arbitration of the entire dispute,but reversed course on reconsideration,concluding that volvo finance could not be compelled to arbitrate.thus,under the district court orders,the dispute between the world parties and volvo rents would proceed to arbitration,but the dispute between the world parties and volvo finance would be litigated in federal court.
the world parties timely appealed,seeking an order compelling volvo finance to arbitrate.we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal under title a a and b.
under federal law,arbitration is a matter of consent,not coercion.volt info,bd.of trs.of leland stanford junior,d.accordingly,a party ordinarily will not be compelled to arbitrate unless that party has entered into an agreement to do so.employers ins.of wausau bright metal specialties,cir.we have recognized,however,that common law principles of contract and agency law allow a signatory such as world rentals to bind a such as volvo finance to an arbitration agreement under any of five distinct theories incorporation by reference assumption agency and estoppel.id.the world parties rely primarily on incorporation by reference,but they also argue that volvo finance can be compelled to arbitrate under theories of agency,and estoppel.none of these arguments is persuasive.
taking the world parties primary argument first,they say that the incorporation provisions contained in two of the fifteen loan documents incorporate by reference the arbitration provisions contained in the franchise agreements,and thus volvo finance can be compelled to arbitrate.this argument actually raises two issues.first,do the incorporation provisions in the loan documents incorporate the arbitration clauses in the franchise agreements and second,if so,does the dispute between the world parties and volvo finance fall within the terms of those arbitration provisions because these inquiries turn on the meaning of contractual language and the district court did not consider any extrinsic evidence to determine the parties intent,we review the district court denial of the world parties motion to compel arbitration de novo.see zaklama mount sinai med,cir contract interpretation,generally a question of law,is subject to de novo review on appeal.
to begin with,two of the fifteen loan documents provide all documents referred to in this loan document are hereby incorporated in their entirety as if fully restated in this loan document.those two loan documents also specifically refer to the franchise agreements by including a breach of the franchise agreements among the events of default.accordingly,the world parties argue that the plain language of the two loan documents incorporates the franchise agreements in their entirety,which of course includes the arbitration provisions in those agreements.volvo finance,on the other hand,claims that the incorporation language in the two loan documents is simply vague boilerplate that was never intended to incorporate the arbitration provisions in the franchise agreements.according to volvo finance,an incorporation provision should be read to incorporate an arbitration clause in a separate contract only if the arbitration clause itself is specifically
