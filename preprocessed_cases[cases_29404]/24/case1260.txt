in prior proceedings,the superior court denied defendant david pullman motion to compel arbitration under an arbitration clause in a agreement.we affirmed the ruling on the ground that a later agreement between the parties,which contained no arbitration provision,superseded the agreement.little pullman,may,nonpub.opn.soon after our decision was filed,pullman ventured unilaterally to rescind the later agreement.he then moved a second time to compel arbitration under the agreement,arguing rescission of the later agreement effectively reinstated the agreement.the trial court again denied the motion.
we conclude pullman has not perfected a rescission of the later agreement and,even if he had,unilateral rescission of that agreement would not by itself reinstate the agreement.we therefore affirm the trial court ruling.
factual and procedural background 
this litigation concerns a dispute over residual income rights once owned by the bankruptcy estate of sherman hemsley,a television and film actor popular for his portrayal of george jefferson in the television show the jeffersons.residual income from hemsley work is paid to the screen actors guild,which distributes the income to whoever owns the rights to it.when ownership is disputed the guild will either retain the money pending resolution of the dispute or,if no resolution is forthcoming,file an interpleader action.in this case,each side alleges the other has made false representations to the guild concerning ownership of the hemsley residual rights,which has caused the guild to retain certain residuals.
the prior lawsuit 
in,pullman and plaintiff william little entered into an agreement the original agreement pursuant to which they would jointly purchase from the hemsley bankruptcy estate the right to receive from the screen actors guild residual income resulting from hemsley work.the parties agreed that pullman would pay little and structured asset sales,pullman company,would own the hemsley residuals but pay percent of the income to little.they also agreed to arbitrate any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to any of the transactions or services contemplated in the agreement.
a dispute arose,and on july,little filed suit in los angeles superior court against pullman and structured asset sales little pullman,no,alleging the original agreement was illegal and seeking its rescission.pullman moved to compel arbitration in that action but the motion was taken off calendar when developments in the hemsley bankruptcy intervened.on september,little amended his complaint to seek only dissolution of a joint venture he alleged had arisen from the original agreement,not rescission of the agreement itself.pullman then renewed his motion to compel arbitration.
in,pullman,little and structured asset sales entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release the settlement agreement resolving their disputes over the hemsley residuals.the settlement agreement required little to return the pullman had paid him and dismiss his lawsuit in exchange for pullman release of all claims against little and all of his right,title and interest in and to the sherman hemsley residuals.payments already received by pullman and little were to be retained by each of them.
although the settlement agreement contained no direct reference to the original agreement,it provided this agreement expresses the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof,and supersedes all prior oral or written agreements,commitments and understandings pertaining to the subject matter hereof.there was no arbitration provision.
on april,counsel for little and pullman agreed in a side letter that little would cooperate in securing payment to structured asset sales on residual checks currently held by pullman but as yet uncashed by sending joint letters on behalf of their clients to the holders of funds represented by the checks,advising them the funds had been assigned to structured asset sales and requesting that they make payment on the checks.
in,pullman,despite having relinquished all right,title and interest in and to the sherman hemsley residuals,informed the screen actors guild he was claiming approximately in hemsley residuals the guild was currently holding.over the course of several communications,pullman demanded that the screen actors guild not release the residuals to little and represented that there was no settlement whatsoever.
the present lawsuit 
on august,little sued pullman for breach of contract and fraud,alleging pullman interfered with the hemsley royalty stream by informing the screen actors guild there was no settlement and little had no right to the hemsley residuals.he sought damages and an accounting.on september,pullman moved in the superior court to compel arbitration,contending that because the settlement agreement was entered into to resolve the parties disputes under the original agreement,the present lawsuit effectively involved a dispute under the original agreement and was governed by that agreement arbitration clause.
little opposed the motion,contending inter alia that the original agreement had never been formed and in any event had been declared illegal in the initial litigation pullman waived any right to arbitration through his excessive delay in bringing the motion to compel arbitration,and the settlement agreement,which contained no arbitration provision,superseded and terminated the original agreement,including its arbitration provision.
the trial court denied pullman motion to compel arbitration,and on may,we affirmed that ruling,holding that o nce the settlement agreement ended the effectiveness of the original agreement arbitration provision,the parties had no agreement to arbitrate any disputes at all by declining to include arbitration as a provision of their settlement agreement the agreement that superseded the original agreement,rendering it aside as void and obsolete they opted not to agree that they would resolve future controversies with arbitration.little pullman,supra.
post appeal proceedings 
on july,approximately six weeks after our decision in the prior appeal was filed,pullman sent a notice of rescission of the settlement agreement to little.the notice stated the following take notice that david pullman and structured asset sales,llc hereby rescind the agreement titled settlement agreement and mutual release executed by william little little on march,and executed by david pullman and structured asset sales,llc collectively pullman on april,and including but not limited to the side letter dated april,between little and pullman.the grounds for rescission of this agreement are the failure of consideration in accordance with california civil code section b and b,fraud in the inducement under california civil code section,and failure of performance and or failure of consent or assent.rescinding parties hereby tender any consideration received under the said agreement.
pullman tender consisted of a check in the amount of,which pullman did not deliver but purportedly made available for pickup at his company and attorney office.
on august,pullman filed a in this action for rescission of the settlement agreement and breach of contract.he alleged little failed to perform his obligations under the agreement particularly his obligation to release any claim to residuals being held by the screen actors guild that had been paid before the settlement agreement was entered into and never intended to do so,as evidenced by his conduct.pullman alleged that after the parties entered into the settlement agreement,little claimed ownership of hemsley residuals being held by the screen actors guild but belonging to structured asset sales misused structured asset sales tax identification number committed tax fraud and effectively took the position in the instant lawsuit that the settlement agreement was rescinded and is void and the original agreement was illegal.
on august,pullman filed in the superior court a motion to compel arbitration,arguing his rescission of the settlement agreement extinguished that agreement and reinstated the original agreement,along with its arbitration provision.in a declaration filed with the motion pullman stated little never intended to perform his obligations under the agreement,as evidenced by his refusal to seek payment to structured asset sales on stale residuals checks it possessed.he argued these were constructive payments of constructive monies he had constructively received.pullman further argued that little misused structured asset sales tax identification number,committed tax fraud,and maintained that the original agreement was illegal,all of which indicated he never intended to perform his obligations under the settlement agreement.
little opposed the motion.he argued pullman failed to effect rescission of the settlement agreement because he did not restore the he had received from little.little also argued arbitration of disputes arising from the original agreement could not be ordered until a final judgment was entered in pullman favor on his for rescission of the settlement agreement.
the hearing was scheduled for december.on december,pullman filed a second declaration,dated one day earlier,in which he stated he sent a check for to little by federal express,apparently on the same day as the declaration was made,december.a copy of the check was attached to pullman declaration.dated july,the check was drawn on td bank by the payor donaldson lufkin jenrette inc money market.it is not clear from the record what this entity is or how it is related to pullman.no address was given for the payor,and the comment line of the check bore five lines of small handwritten script stating,as best we can make out,the following structured asset sales,llc and david pullman payment in full to effect the rescission of agreement dated and executed by william little and countersigned by david pullman and structured asset sales llc.
little rejected the tender and returned the check,informing pullman he did not recognize it as payment.pullman apparently then the check to little,who again rejected it.
at the hearing on pullman motion to compel arbitration,pullman argued his tender of the to little completed the rescission,extinguished the settlement agreement,and entitled him to arbitration under the original agreement.little argued the settlement agreement had not been rescinded because little had rejected pullman tender,made only one week earlier the trial court,having apparently not seen pullman december,declaration or the copy of the check attached to it,said pullman representation of tender was outside the evidence presented for the hearing.at any rate,the court said,as pullman had for rescission,the rescission issue and its ramifications could be determined as part of the litigation in chief.it therefore denied the motion.
pullman timely appealed.

we held in the prior appeal that pullman was not entitled to arbitration of the dispute over ownership of the hemsley royalty stream because the arbitration provision in the original agreement had been superseded by the settlement agreement,which contained no similar provision.pullman now contends he has rescinded the settlement agreement and is therefore entitled to arbitration under the original agreement.
the issues are did pullman rescind the arbitration agreement if he did,does unilateral rescission of that agreement permit him to invoke the arbitration provision of the original agreement absent a determination that the rescission was justified must the trial court decide whether pullman was justified in rescinding the settlement agreement in the context of his motion to compel arbitration and if the rescission is justified,does it resuscitate the original agreement arbitration provision the answers are no to the first three questions and,as to the last,maybe.
pullman failed to rescind the settlement agreement 
a party that believes it has been fraudulently induced to enter into a contract may rescind.village northridge homeowners state farm fire casualty cal th.rescission is accomplished by giving notice to the other party to the agreement and restoring or offering to restore everything of value received,larsen johannes d,settlement agreement may be rescinded if the rescinding party returns benefits received under the agreement.
here,pullman failed to return or offer to return to little the he received from little as part of the settlement agreement.although he stated in his notice of rescission that he tendered any consideration received under the settlement agreement,his december,declaration clarified that the tender consisted of an undelivered check in the amount of,payable not on the order of pullman or structured asset sales,but on the order of a third party money market entity.furthermore,the payment was not unconditional,but stated it constituted payment in full to effect the rescission of the settlement agreement.
there are three problems with this tender.first,pullman did not offer to pay or deliver the,but merely made available for a check for.ordinarily,a n offer in writing to pay a particular sum of money,or to deliver a written instrument or specific personal property,is equivalent to the actual production and tender of the money,instrument,or property.code civ.but pullman offered neither to pay little nor to deliver a written instrument for that amount.he offered only to make the instrument not the money available to be picked up at an ambiguous location through his company and attorney law office.this would have required little to find out where the check was located and travel to that location to receive it.
second,the tender was conditional on little accepting that it constituted payment in full to effect the rescission of agreement dated and executed by william little and countersigned by david pullman and structured asset sales llc.when a claim is disputed and a check tendered by the debtor in settlement of the claim contains the words payment in full,acceptance of the check constitutes an accord and satisfaction of the claim,subds.a c.it is unclear exactly what pullman meant by appending this condition to the check,but it could reasonably mean that by accepting the check little waived any claim that the did not constitute full payment or admitted the truth of pullman claim that the settlement agreement was procured by fraud.
third,little,in the end,rejected the check,which he was entitled to do.although it is normal business practice to allow payment of a debt by check,a creditor who does not wish to be paid in that manner may refuse to accept the tender on the ground that it does not constitute a lawful offer of money,any objection to mode of payment must be made at the time of tender code civ,same noyes habitation resources,d.if the creditor does so,the debtor must return with a conforming tender.noyes habitation resources,at.on december,little rejected the by then check tendered by pullman and gave a reason for doing so he did not recognize a possibly stale check from an unknown entity as proper payment.pullman was then obligated to make a conforming tender.he refused to do so,instead the same check to little and refusing to take it back at the hearing.
