in an effort to hasten resolution of the federated department stores and other debtors bankruptcy estate,the bankruptcy court for the southern district of ohio ordered those creditors who had litigation pending against the debtors to submit their claims to arbitration before bringing their claims to court.creditors were given an opportunity to opt out of this dispute resolution process,and some did.appellants christopher and marion spierer,however,did not,and the bankruptcy court stayed their state court suit against the debtors until the spierers had gone through the arbitration process.the spierers subsequently sought to lift the stay so that they could proceed directly in state court,however,arguing that the stay should never have been imposed.the bankruptcy court denied this motion,and the district court affirmed on the grounds that the spierers could not challenge the imposition of the stay in their appeal from the denial of a motion to lift the stay.to the extent that the spierers challenge the bankruptcy court jurisdiction to impose the stay,we may hear the appeal.because the stay was within the bankruptcy court jurisdiction,however,we affirm the judgment of the bankruptcy court.
background 
claiming that they had suffered injuries as a result of exposure to toxic chemicals in a mattress that they had obtained from the defendants,christopher and marion spierer filed suit against the federated department stores and certain of federated subsidiary companies in new york state court in.the spierers were not the only individuals who were suing the defendants,and on january,the the for bankruptcy protection in the district court for the southern district of ohio.later that year,having determined that no global settlement of the claims against the debtors was imminent,the bankruptcy court lifted the automatic stay on all pending litigation.the spierers were then free to proceed with their claim and apparently began preparing for a trial in new york state court.
of the thousands of claims that had been brought against the debtors,all but a few were resolved over the next several years,and in the interest of settling the estate quickly,the debtors had moved the bankruptcy court to adopt an alternative dispute resolution adr procedure for any remaining claims.with all parties in interest having been given notice and after holding a hearing,the bankruptcy court agreed to order the remaining claimants,including the spierers,to bring their claims first to adr.on january,the bankruptcy court stayed all litigation over personal injury claims then pending against the debtors.in doing so,the bankruptcy court cited as authority sections,and of title.section grants bankruptcy courts the power to issue any order necessary or appropriate to accomplish the bankruptcy code provisions.section provides that the confirmation of a reorganization plan vests all of the estate property in the hands of the debtor,see b,and section a states that a discharge in bankruptcy serves as an injunction against actions to collect on the debtor personal liabilities,see a.
at least one claimant who had objected to the debtors adr proposal was exempted from the adr process so long as his trial would be commenced by a certain date,but claimants such as the spierers who had not opposed the proposal were required to submit their claims to arbitration.claimants could choose whether the arbitration would be binding,and if claimants bringing personal injury actions chose for the arbitration to be,they could serve notice within ten days of the decision that they still intended to litigate their claims.
although the spierers had not opposed the mandatory adr procedure before it was adopted,they soon let their feelings on it be known.having moved to florida,the spierers claimed that a medical condition prevented them from traveling to new york for the arbitration.in,the bankruptcy court denied the spierers request that the arbitration be ordered to occur in boca raton,florida,as the bankruptcy court determined that the choice of venue for the adr would best be left to the arbitrator.the bankruptcy court also denied their request that they be exempted from the adr process altogether and be permitted to litigate without first going through the adr.finally,the bankruptcy court made clear that matters governing discovery in the adr process would be left to the arbitrator.the spierers filed no notice of appeal from these orders.
the spierers still objected to the adr process,however,and moved the bankruptcy court to lift its stay on litigation.in the may,order from which the spierers now appeal,the bankruptcy court noted that the spierers had missed their opportunity to opt out of the adr process and that the adr would expedite the settlement of the remaining claims.accordingly,the bankruptcy court refused to lift its prior stay on litigation,and it held that the spierers were bound to use the adr process before they could go to court.
the spierers filed a notice of appeal from that may,order and brought their claim to the district court,which had jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeal pursuant to a.as they do before this court,the spierers argued that the bankruptcy court had lacked the power to send their claims to adr.the district court ruled that this attack was on the january,order imposing the adr plan,and that the january,order could not be challenged in an appeal from the may,refusal to lift the stay.the district court thus dismissed the appeal.

ii.analysis 
appellate jurisdiction 
although the spierers notice of appeal to the district court explicitly stated that they were appealing from the bankruptcy court may,order denying their motion to lift the stay,and made no mention of the january,order that imposed the stay,the notice is sufficient to allow them to challenge the bankruptcy court jurisdiction to impose the stay.to be sure,the may,order was not a final judgment,an appeal from which would necessarily incorporate all prior rulings and orders.newman fed.express,cir quoting crawford roane,cir,cert.denied,d.and indeed,we construe a notice of appeal from a particular interlocutory order as being limited to that order.see crawford,at.here,however,by appealing from the court refusal to lift the stay,the appellants necessarily called into question the court jurisdiction to impose it.it goes without saying that if the bankruptcy court lacked the power to impose the stay in the first place,then the motion to lift the stay should have been granted.although it does not appear that the bankruptcy court jurisdiction to have issued the stay was discussed in the order from which the appeal was taken,courts review judgments,not opinions or arguments,see,chevron natural res.def.council,d,so the appellate court reviewing the judgment refusing to lift the stay must consider whether the law required otherwise.
of course,the spierers have waived most of the arguments that might support the theory that the stay was improperly imposed.their motion to lift the stay never suggests,for example,that the stay exceeded the bankruptcy court statutory power under,or.accordingly,the spierers have waived the argument that imposing the stay violated the statutory restrictions.see overstreet urban county gov t,cir.
