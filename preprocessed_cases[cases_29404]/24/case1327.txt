plaintiffs la serena properties,llc,casa margaritaville,and steven yates appellants appeal from a judgment entered after the trial court sustained the demurrers of defendants gerald weisbach weisbach and the american arbitration association aaa respondents without leave to amend.appellants sued respondents for damages,as well as other relief,alleging five separate causes of action,all of which arise out of the alleged failure of arbitrator weisbach to disclose a certain conflict of interest during the appointment process.
we agree with the trial court that the alleged claims of misconduct,no matter how pleaded,all arise out of the conflict of interest disclosure procedure that is integrally part of the arbitration process.thus,respondents are protected from liability by the common law arbitral immunity for acts.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural backgrounds 
when considering an appeal from a judgment entered after the trial court sustained a demurrer without leave to amend,we accept as true all facts in the complaint and give a reasonable construction to the complaint as a whole.animal legal defense fund mendes th,fn,citing blank kirwan cal d.in addition,we may consider matters that are properly the subject of judicial notice,and were considered by the trial court.buesa.city of los angeles th.therefore,our factual summary is derived from the complaint,including exhibits a through f incorporated by reference in that pleading.holland morse diesel,th.
the complaint alleges that appellants entered into a construction contract and a subsequent promissory note with merchant builders,mbi in,both of which included mandatory aaa arbitration provisions.subsequently,a dispute arose between appellants and mbi,and appellants demanded arbitration under the aaa arbitration clauses contained in the contract and note.mbi refused to arbitrate,and appellants filed a motion to compel arbitration.the motion was granted.
after being compelled to go to arbitration,it is alleged that mbi lawyers conspired among themselves to persuade appellants to accept weisbach as the arbitrator,without disclosing that weisbach had a longstanding family relationship with one of mbi counsel,david baskin baskin,in that weisbach was the boyfriend of baskin sister.appellants then tentatively agreed to weisbach serving as the arbitrator.
a notice of appointment was sent to weisbach by aaa,indicating that he had been selected as arbitrator.the notice included a conflicts of interest disclosure form,which aaa directed weisbach to complete.weisbach was informed in the notice and disclosure form that he would not be able to serve as arbitrator until the form had been duly executed and was on file with aaa.the form included the following admonition and instruction 
it is most important that the parties have complete confidence in the arbitrator impartiality.therefore,please disclose any past or present relationship sic with the parties,their counsel,or potential witnesses,direct or indirect,whether financial,professional,social or of any other kind.this is a continuing obligation throughout your service on the case and should any additional direct or indirect contact arise during the course of the arbitration,or if there is any change at any time in the biographical information that you have provided to the aaa,it must also be disclosed.any doubt should be resolved in favor of disclosure.if you are aware of direct or indirect contact with such individuals,please describe it below.failure to make timely disclosure may forfeit your ability to collect compensation.the association will call the disclosure to the attention of the parties.
weisbach completed the form disclosing only a former association with gerald carroll,an attorney who worked with long levit while weisbach served as of counsel to the firm.weisbach dated the disclosure form september,and signed it.
the complaint also alleges that weisbach joined the conspiracy with mbi counsel at some time prior to september.hours later,on september,weisbach sent an email to aaa stating that he had just received a call from baskin informing weisbach that baskin was representing mbi in the dispute.weisbach then stated david is a personal friend.while i do not believe that our relationship would prejudice my hearing of this matter,this relationship does present a potential conflict.please so inform the parties and advise.a copy of the email was faxed to counsel in the case,along with a cover letter from aaa,asking that aaa be advised within days if there was any objection to the appointment of weisbach.apparently,neither side then objected to weisbach service as arbitrator.
with the agreement of mbi counsel,weisbach did not disclose his familial relationship with baskin,or the depth and character of his relationship with the baskin family,including the fact that he was in a romantic relationship with baskin sister.appellants claim that the partial disclosures of weisbach relationship with carroll and baskin were intended to appear as if complete disclosures had been made when the full nature of the conflict was concealed from appellants.
the arbitration commenced on march,and extended over days.mbi was represented by baskin and his son,caleb baskin.an arbitration award was issued by weisbach on july,and was clarified in an amended award on september.the final award denied more than claims made by appellants against mbi,including eight fraud claims,but awarded appellants a total of for two claims.appellants were also awarded in attorney fees,and reimbursement of,which they previously had paid in excess of their allocated percent share of the costs of the arbitration.
almost two years later,on may,the president of mbi wrote to the aaa,complaining about the failure of weisbach to disclose his intimate involvement with baskin sister.mbi complained that this conflict caused weisbach to struggle to render an impartial verdict,and ultimately resulted in a or split verdict.appellants alleged that prior to their receipt of their copy of this letter they had no knowledge of this relationship and weisbach failure to disclose it.
subsequently,court proceedings were commenced in the santa cruz county superior court seeking to set aside the arbitration award.that relief was ultimately granted on october.
appellants filed the complaint in this action on january,the causes of action alleged against respondents included fraud,fraudulent concealment,breach of contract,unfair business practices,and negligence.appellants sought an award of damages,disgorgement of profits,punitive damages,prejudgment interest,and costs,including attorney fees.
the first cause of action alleged that weisbach and aaa had committed fraud because they failed to disclose weisbach relationship with baskin sister,which fraudulently induced appellants to select him as the arbitrator.in the second cause of action alleging fraudulent concealment,appellants alleged that weisbach deliberately concealed his relationship with baskin sister in order to secure appellants consent for weisbach to serve as the arbitrator.this same claim is asserted against aaa,which allegedly ratified weisbach intentional misconduct.
the third cause of action for breach of contract is alleged only against aaa and claimed that aaa breached its arbitration contract with appellants by failing to make a full and complete disclosure of its arbitrator qualifications and fitness to serve as a fair and neutral arbitrator.this same claim similarly alleged that aaa failed to supervise weisbach in connection with his service as an arbitrator.the fourth cause of action claimed violations of business and professions code sections and and alleged that aaa engaged in false and misleading advertising by advertising to the public that it maintains a panel of qualified and neutral arbitrators,and by providing parties with completed disclosure forms falsely attesting to its rigorous investigation into the prospective arbitrator impartiality for their particular dispute.the fifth cause of action for negligence is alleged only against aaa and claimed that aaa failed to use reasonable care to ensure that proper disclosures were made by weisbach.
separate demurrers were filed by respondents,contending that the absolute arbitral immunity for acts barred appellants suit.both demurrers also asserted that,pursuant to aaa arbitration rules to which appellants agreed to be bound,vacation of the arbitration award was the sole remedy for any alleged misconduct committed by respondents arising from the proceedings.the demurrers were opposed by appellants,and a hearing was held in the matter on april.
the trial court sustained both demurrers without leave to amend.the ruling was based upon the court determination that the failure to disclose weisbach relationship with baskin sister,even if involving respondents complicity,fell within the absolute arbitral immunity 
the doctrine of absolute judicial immunity has its roots in the english common law,and has been applied in this state for more than a century.howard drapkin d.it protects judges from civil lawsuits for acts performed as part of the judicial function.it is limited to acts normally performed by a judge,and does not include purely administrative or legislative acts.id.at,fn.immunity applies if the acts fall within the scope of the judicial function,even if the conduct complained of was malicious or corrupt.id.at.
common law judicial immunity has been extended to private and public arbitrators.the leading decision in california on arbitral immunity is stasz schwab th stasz.that case did not involve an allegation of failure to disclose a potential conflict of interest,but a claim that the arbitrator was biased against one of the parties.stasz,supra,th at.
the court extensively reviewed the history of the arbitral immunity,and the stated reasons for its continuing application.it began by quoting from two earlier california supreme court decisions as our supreme court has stated arbitrators are judges chosen by the parties to decide the matters submitted to them arbitrators have been extended the protection of judicial immunity,because they perform the function of resolving disputes between parties,or of authoritatively adjudicating private rights.in re marriage of assemi cal th,it long has been recognized that,in private arbitration proceedings,an arbitrator enjoys the benefit of an arbitral privilege of immunity because the role that he or she exercises is analogous to that of a judge there is hardly any aspect of arbitration law and practice more settled,both in domestic and international relations,than the immunity of arbitrators from court actions for their activities in arriving at their award.this arbitrators in private contractual arbitration proceedings from tort well established in california.moore conliffe cal th,stasz,supra,th at.
later,the stasz opinion discussed the multiple public policy reasons offered by previous courts for applying the immunity california public policy encouraging arbitration as an efficient means for resolving disputes has created the need for independent judgments which are free from fear of legal action arbitral immunity furthers this need t he independence necessary for principled and fearless is best achieved by shielding persons involved in the arbitral process from intimidation caused by the fear of a lawsuit arising out of the exercise of arbitral functions the existence of arbitral immunity is also in part due to the resemblance of arbitration proceedings to judicial proceedings a lthough arbitration is a proceeding different from a court proceeding and the functions performed by the arbitrator are somewhat different from those of the judge,arbitration is as much an adjudicatory process as the judicial process.this comparability in functions creates a similar necessity for independence in decisionmaking thus,it is reasonable to use arbitral immunity just as judicial immunity does in the judicial arena,to protect the decisionmaking process from reprisals by dissatisfied litigants.thiele rml realty partners th,stasz,supra,th at.
in determining whether absolute immunity applies to the conduct of a public or private arbitrator,the courts look at the nature of the duty performed to determine whether it is a judicial the name or classification of the officer who performs it,and many who are properly classified as executive officers are invested with limited judicial powers.citation.howard drapkin,supra,d at.where immunity applies,it likewise shields the sponsoring organization,such as aaa here,from liability arising out of the misconduct alleged.this includes claims for breach of contract resulting from the sponsoring organizations alleged failure to appoint an ostensibly neutral arbitrator.stasz,supra,th at.
central to impartial by arbitrators and judges alike is the need for them to make disclosures that may give rise to a challenge to the judge impartiality by one of the parties,even if the judge or arbitrator concludes that he or she is not disqualified.the responsibility of judges to make such disclosures is under california law.canon of the california code of judicial ethics states in all trial proceedings,a judge shall disclose on the record information that is reasonably relevant to the question of disqualification under code of civil procedure section,even if the judge believes there is no actual basis for disqualification.for trial judges,noncompliance with this ethical disclosure requirement may subject the judge to discipline by the commission on judicial performance.cal,art.vi.
similarly,a person serving as an arbitrator pursuant to an arbitration agreement has statutory and ethical duties to comply with certain disclosure requirements.code of civil procedure section,subdivision a mandates that a person proposed to serve as a neutral arbitrator shall disclose all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed neutral arbitrator would be able to be impartial the section goes on to describe those types of relationships that must be disclosed,including a ny professional or significant personal relationship the proposed neutral arbitrator has or has had with any party to the arbitration proceeding or lawyer for a party.code civ,subd.a.
ethics standards for neutral arbitrators in contractual arbitration were adopted by the judicial council effective july,and a person proposed as a private arbitrator must also comply with them.by statute,these standards are mandated to cover,among other subjects,the disclosure of interests,relationships,or affiliations that may constitute conflicts of interest code civ,subd.a.standard d addresses what relationships must be disclosed by a proposed arbitrator.the disclosure includes situations where t he arbitrator or a member of the arbitrator immediate family has or has had a significant personal relationship with any party or lawyer for a party.ethics standards for neutral arbitrators in contractual arbitration,standard d.
the importance of this disclosure responsibility to the proper functioning of the arbitration process has recently been discussed in mahnke superior court th courts have long struggled with the problem of ensuring not only the neutrality but also the perception of neutrality of arbitrators,who wield tremendous power to decide cases and whose actions lack,for the most part,substantive judicial review.as the united states supreme court observed in vacating an arbitration award under the federal arbitration act,it is true that arbitrators can not sever all their ties with the business world,since they are not expected to get all their income from their work deciding cases,but we should,if anything,be even more scrupulous to safeguard the impartiality of arbitrators than judges,since the former have completely free rein to decide the law as well as the facts and are not subject to appellate review.we can perceive no way in which the effectiveness of the arbitration process will be hampered by the simple requirement that arbitrators disclose to the parties any dealings that might create an impression of possible bias.commonwealth casualty,see ceriale amco ins.th,disclosure required when disclosed information might create an impression of
