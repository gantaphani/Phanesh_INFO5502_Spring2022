fisher presented several theories to the trial court in opposition to the enforcement of the arbitration clause,including that the arbitration clause required her to waive an unwaivable statutory right to bring a class action lawsuit under the california legal remedies act the clra and that the arbitration agreement was both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.
we uphold the trial court denial of the petition to compel arbitration.
factual and procedural backgrounda.fisher complaint 
on july,fisher filed her complaint for injunctive relief,restitution,rescission,and damages both on her own behalf and as a class action lawsuit.fisher defined the class as those who purchased a vehicle from dch from july,to then present,and after signing an risc,dch rescinded the original risc and had the consumer sign a subsequent risc for the same vehicle,but the new contract was dated the date of the original purchase contract and involved financing at an annual percentage rate greater than,who executed an risc for the purchase of a vehicle for personal use where registration and licensing fees were not properly disclosed on a separate line in the contract as required.
as for fisher individual claims,she alleged that in august she agreed to purchase a used dodge neon from dch.she was advised the vehicle had been through a thorough inspection and was a safe vehicle.it was not disclosed that it had previously been used as a daily rental vehicle.she further alleged that her risc did not separately itemize the license and registration fees.
according to the allegations in the complaint,fisher began having problems with the vehicle.in the meantime,she was contacted by dch and informed she had to sign a new risc.fisher refused,but dch threatened to repossess her vehicle if she did not.she signed a new risc,which provided for a new finance company.the contract she signed on august,was backdated to august.
fisher listed six causes of action for the class,including violation of the clra and civil code sections and,subdivision a for backdating contracts violation of the clra and civil code sections,subdivision a and,subdivision a for improperly designating license and registration fees violation of the automobile sales finance act the asfa and civil code section for backdating the second sales contract violation of the asfa and civil code section for improperly designating license and registration fees commission of unlawful,unfair,fraudulent business practices and violation of business and professions code section for backdating the second sales contracts and commission of unlawful,unfair,fraudulent business practices and violation of business and professions code section for failing to properly designate license and registration fees.
fisher listed four additional individual causes of action,including negligent misrepresentation of the condition and inspection of the neon intentional misrepresentation of the condition of the neon,the terms of the contract,and repossession rights violation of the clra and civil code section for misrepresentation of the neon condition and inspections and violation of the consumer warranty act and civil code section for delivering a vehicle with serious defects and nonconformities with warranties.
in her prayer for relief,fisher requested,among other amounts,rescission restitution on of all monies required to be expended by her and the class,plus injunctive relief on the individual and class claims.
dch petition for order compelling arbitration 
on december,dch filed its notice of petition and petition for orders compelling binding contractual arbitration,severing injunctive relief claims if inarbitrable,staying or dismissing proceedings pending arbitration,and staying injunctive relief claims pending arbitration if inarbitrable petition to compel arbitration.according to the petition to compel arbitration,dch had demanded that fisher enter into binding arbitration prior to filing the complaint,but she had refused.
the binding arbitration clause appeared in a box on the back of the agreement in both the first and second risc that fisher signed.the page on which it appeared was neither signed nor initialed.in bold letters it stated,arbitration clause please your legal rights.it stated either you or we may choose to have any dispute between us decided by arbitration and not in court or by jury trial.capitalization omitted.it also stated,if a dispute is arbitrated,you will give up your right to participate as a class representative or class member on any class claim you may have against us including any right to class arbitration or any consolidation of individual arbitrations.capitalization omitted.it further stated,you expressly waive any right you may have to arbitrate a class action.finally,it included language that,if the waiver of class action lawsuits or classwide arbitration was found unenforceable,the entire arbitration clause was unenforceable.
the petition to compel arbitration requested that the court find fisher claims of injunctive relief under the clra to be amenable to arbitration if it found they were not,the court should sever them from the arbitrable claims.dch contended the arbitration clause in the risc signed by fisher was governed by title united states code section of the federal arbitration act the faa.the faa preempted any california laws.further,the petition to compel arbitration was governed by code of civil procedure section except where application of that section would frustrate section of the faa.the sale of the neon involved interstate commerce because the vehicle was manufactured outside of california and transported to california on interstate highways accordingly,the faa applied.dch also claimed that the class action waiver was enforceable due to the fact that the dispute in this case involved large amounts of money and did not warrant class action.
attached to the petition to compel arbitration were declarations from dch employees.david pavlik was a finance and insurance manager with dch.he was responsible for having customers sign the risc.it was his practice to explain the documents to the customer at the time they were signed.on august,fisher signed an risc for the purchase of the neon.on august,fisher signed a rewritten risc.
dch requested a stay of the lawsuit pending the resolution of whether arbitration would be ordered.that request was granted by the trial court.
fisher opposition to the petition to compel arbitration 
fisher opposed the petition to compel arbitration,contending that the clra claims seeking injunctive relief could not be arbitrated.fisher additionally argued that the faa did not preempt california law.fisher claimed that she had a right under the clra to file a class action lawsuit and could not be asked to waive that right.she also argued that the arbitration clause was both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.
fisher pointed out in her opposition that the arbitration clause contained a poison pill it stated that,if the classwide arbitration and class action lawsuit waivers were found to be unenforceable,the entire arbitration clause was unenforceable.based on the language in the risc,the inarbitrable claims could not be severed,and the entire arbitration clause could not be enforced.
in a declaration filed with her opposition,fisher claimed that on august,when she signed the risc,she was given a large stack of documents and told to sign them they were not explained to her.she did not know she could negotiate the terms.she was never told about the arbitration clause on the back side of the risc,and she did not see it.the arbitration clause was not explained to her.fisher had no idea what arbitration was.
when she signed the second contract on august,she was not told about the arbitration clause.she was not financially able to pay for arbitration.fisher contends that at no time in signing the first or second risc was the issue of arbitration discussed.
dch reply to fisher opposition to the petition to compel arbitration 
in its reply to fisher opposition,dch admitted that the trial court was bound by precedent that held injunctive relief claims are inarbitrable.it contended that the noninjunctive relief claims should also be subject to arbitration because the class action waiver was not unconscionable and was enforceable the arbitration clause was not unconscionable,and if part of it was,that offending part should be severed dch did not waive the right to arbitrate and the inarbitrable claims must be severed and stayed while the arbitrable claims proceed.
dch argued that many of the cases cited by fisher regarding unconscionable classwide arbitration waivers involved smaller amounts of money.further,there was no unwaivable statutory right under the clra.dch argued the arbitration agreement was not unconscionable and agreed the standard was a determination of procedural and substantive unconscionability.dch also argued that the clra injunctive relief claims must be arbitrated under the faa or be severed and stayed pending arbitration of the other claims.
attached to the reply was a declaration from ken colson,the general manager of dch.he stated that dch risc was a preprinted form.dch also had programmed in its computer a similar sales contract that did not include the arbitration provision.he directed his sales and finance staff to explain the terms of the risc to customers.a customer was free to negotiate the terms of the sales contract.
the average price of a vehicle sold at dch was,plus between to in finance charges.that amount would have to be paid by dch if a sales contract was rescinded.the neon was sold for.dch had never enforced paying only the first of the arbitration fee,even though the language of the arbitration clause included such limit.it was dch policy to pay all of the fees upfront for the customer.the risc had been changed to separate the license and registration fees to conform with state law since fisher had signed the risc.
dch also provided a declaration from dch attorney,who represented automobile dealerships and the california new car dealers association cncda,which was comprised of dealerships in california.he declared that a lawsuit involving rescission of an automobile contract usually rendered an award of to.
pavlik,the finance and insurance manager,submitted a supplemental declaration.he again indicated that his practice,in order to ensure customer satisfaction,was to explain the risc to the customer.pavlik encouraged questions regarding the documents from the customer.
fisher filed objections to the declarations.she asked that the supplemental declaration from pavlik be stricken as irrelevant.further,a majority of the attorney declaration was irrelevant.fisher also objected to colson declaration based on lack of personal knowledge,foundation,and relevance.
hearing of february,and order 
a hearing on the petition to compel arbitration was held on february.the trial court first noted that it had read the lengthy documentation filed by the parties,including the points and authorities,attachments,and the cases.
the trial court then noted that it was being asked to consider procedural and substantive unconscionability issues.it noted that fisher relied upon gutierrez autowest,th it asked dch why that case did not control.dch admitted that,based on the declaration submitted with the opposition,procedural unconscionability had been shown,but it contended that the declaration contained inadmissible conclusions.dch argued that the declarations from colson and pavlik showed the facts of this case differed greatly from the case cited by fisher.the arbitration clause appeared on the backside of risc in bold type and surrounded by a box.dch argued there was no procedural unconscionability.fisher could buy the neon anywhere,and dch had an alternative sales contract without the arbitration waiver if she had requested it.dch argued it was an arm length transaction between the consumer and retailer.
fisher argued that she had no opportunity to negotiate the preprinted sections of the contract.pavlik did not declare that he spoke specifically with fisher about the arbitration clause.
the trial court then addressed substantive unconscionability in that fisher had no right to appeal an arbitration award under the clause unless she received an award of no money.fisher would have the right to appeal if there was a court action.further,even if the consumer wanted to choose filing the case in court,dch could veto that decision and require arbitration.the provision also specifically referred to injunctive relief,which would only apply to dch,not to fisher.fisher argued that injunctive relief was not subject to arbitration,so the clause seemed inconsistent with california law.dch could not exercise its right to appeal unless the award was over.
the parties then asked to discuss the classwide arbitration and class action lawsuit waiver.fisher argued that she could not be asked to waive her rights under the clra,and she had a right to file a class action lawsuit under the clra.fisher then pointed the trial court to the fact that,according to the terms of the risc,if the class action waiver was unenforceable,the entire arbitration clause was unenforceable.dch relied upon the two federal cases,discussed,post,in arguing that the faa preempted the clra.the trial court advised the parties that it was going to look at the cases and would issue a notice of ruling.
a minute order was issued on february,stating,the petition to compel binding contractual arbitration heard is denied.there was no ruling on the evidentiary objections.dch filed a notice of appeal on february,and an amended notice of appeal on february.
on march,the cncda filed its application for leave to file a brief of amicus curiae and its brief.this court granted its request.on march,fisher filed its answer to the amicus curiae brief.
preemption of the clra by the faa 
dch argued in its opening brief that the faa preempted california law in the determination of the enforceability of the arbitration clause.fisher responded that the class action waiver in dch arbitration clause violates the antiwaiver provision contained in the clra and is not preempted by the faa.accordingly,fisher could not agree to waive her right to bring a class action lawsuit or request classwide arbitration under the clra.
as alluded to,ante,the risc both the first and the second signed by both parties contains a poison pill provision.it states,if a waiver of class action rights is deemed or found to be unenforceable for any reason in a case in which class action allegations have been made,the remainder of this arbitration clause shall be unenforceable.hence,we consider if fisher waiver of her right to file a class action lawsuit or submit to classwide arbitration under the clra was proper first if we find that she could not waive these rights,then the entire arbitration clause is unenforceable.see gentry superior court cal th,t he question whether an arbitration agreement has been validly formed is of course different from whether that agreement was unconscionable.
standard of review 
w hen a petition to compel arbitration is filed and accompanied by prima facie evidence of a written agreement to arbitrate the controversy,the court itself must determine whether the agreement exists and,if any defense to its enforcement is raised,whether it is enforceable.because the existence of the agreement is a statutory prerequisite to granting the petition,the petitioner bears the burden of proving its existence by a preponderance of the evidence.if the party opposing the petition raises a defense to enforcement that party bears the burden of producing evidence of,and proving by a preponderance of the evidence,any fact necessary to the defense.citation.rosenthal great western fin.securities cal th,accord,engalla permanente medical group,cal th,olvera el pollo loco,th.
petitions to compel arbitration are resolved by a summary procedure that allows the parties to submit declarations and other documentary testimony and,at the trial court discretion,to provide oral testimony.flores evergreen at san diego,llc th.the de novo standard of review applies only where the trial court denial of a petition to arbitrate presents a pure question of law.see parada superior court th,robertson health net of california,th.
in the instant case,the trial court did not state the reasons upon which it reached its decision to deny dch petition to compel arbitration.it was presented with several theories upon which the arbitration clause could have been invalidated,including that it required a waiver of fisher right to request classwide arbitration or file a class action lawsuit under the clra that it was unconscionable.we have no way of knowing on what theory the trial court relied in reaching its decision.
here,it is undisputed that the risc signed by fisher included an arbitration clause,and that clause included a waiver of her class action rights.since we resolve the instant case on this purely legal review the claim de novo.
faa preemption 
california law incorporates many of the basic policy objectives contained in the federal arbitration act,including a presumption in favor of arbitrability citation engalla permanente medical group,supra,cal th at.
civil code section provides that a ny consumer entitled to bring an action under section an individual consumer claim may,if the unlawful method,act,or practice has caused damage to other consumers similarly situated,bring an action on behalf of himself and such other consumers to recover damages or obtain other relief as provided for in section.the clra applies to any contract undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer,subd.a.civil code section states,any waiver by a consumer of the provisions of this title is contrary to public policy and shall be unenforceable and void.see also america online,superior court th.the complaint alleged on behalf of both the class and fisher that dch engaged in deceptive practices as defined in civil code section,subdivision a.hence,under the clra,fisher could not be asked to waive her right to file a class action lawsuit or request classwide arbitration.
the faa makes agreements to arbitrate valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.see also perry.thomas,fn,d.with the enactment of the faa,congress precluded states from singling out arbitration provisions for suspect status,requiring instead that such provisions be placed upon the same footing as other contracts.doctor assocs.casarotto,d.
the issue to be decided here is whether the waiver of a state statutory right under the clra constitutes a ground that exists at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.we have found no california case that directly addresses the issue.the ninth circuit court of appeals has found that the faa preempts the clra.
in ting v.at t,the ninth circuit examined in the context of cellular telephone contracts an agreement that included an arbitration clause that barred class action lawsuits.id.at.it first noted,the faa makes agreements to arbitrate valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.citation.with the enactment of the faa,congress precluded states from singling out arbitration provisions for suspect status,requiring instead that such provisions be placed upon the same footing as other contracts.citation.under,however,state law is not entirely displaced from federal arbitration analysis a s long as state law defenses concerning the validity,revocability,and enforceability of contracts are generally applied to all contracts,and not limited to arbitration clauses,federal courts may enforce them under the faa.citations.id.at.
the ninth circuit then noted that the clra applies only to individual consumers who purchase or lease any goods or services and not to any other type of contract or government purchases.ting v.at t,supra,at.it then concluded,because the clra applies to such a limited set of transactions,we conclude that it is not a law of general applicability.citations.ibid.
after ting,the california supreme court decided discover bank superior court cal th.in discover bank,the supreme court refused to invoke a blanket policy that class action waivers are invalid as a matter of law.id.at.we do not hold that all class action waivers are necessarily unconscionable.but when the waiver is found in a consumer contract of adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages,and when it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money,then,at least to the extent the obligation at issue is governed by california law,the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of the party from responsibility for its own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another.citation.under these circumstances,such waivers are unconscionable under california law and should not be enforced.ibid.
prior to reaching this decision on unconscionability,however,the court stated,w e note that plaintiff does not plead a clra cause of action and so does not invoke its antiwaiver provision nor does he seek recovery under any other california statute as to which a class action remedy is essential.citation.rather,plaintiff contends that class action or arbitration waivers in consumer contracts,and in this particular contract,should be invalidated as unconscionable under california law.discover bank superior court,supra,cal th at,fn.omitted.
the discover bank court then addressed preemption as it pertained to unconscionability.at the outset of our discussion,we note that the faa is silent on the matter of class actions and class action arbitration.indeed,not only is classwide arbitration a relatively recent development,but class action litigation for damages was for the most part unknown in federal jurisdictions at the time the faa was enacted in.citation.the congress that enacted the faa therefore can not be said to have contemplated the issues before us.accordingly,our conclusions with respect to faa preemption must come from the united states supreme court articulation of general principles regarding such preemption.discover bank superior court,supra,cal th at,fn.omitted.
it then went on to hold,nothing in any supreme court case,however,suggests that state courts are obliged to enforce contractual terms even if those terms are found to be unconscionable or contrary to public policy under general contract law principles.as discussed,section of the faa and cases interpreting it make clear that state courts have no such obligation.agreements to arbitrate may not be used to harbor terms,conditions and practices that undermine public policy.citation.discover bank superior court,supra,cal th at.
in gutierrez autowest,supra,th,the appellate court addressed a case in which a dealership advertised a lease price for a car with zero down.id.at.although the case did not involve the waiver of class action rights,it is instructive.when the buyer went to the dealership,he was told the advertised lease price was only applicable if a large down payment was made.ibid.the lease agreement included an arbitration clause on the back of the contract.id.at.the buyer of the car initiated a lawsuit alleging,among other things,causes of action for fraud and negligent misrepresentation under the clra.gutierrez,at.in opposition to the dealership motion to compel arbitration,the buyer alleged that the arbitration agreement should not be enforced because,among other reasons,the arbitral forum fees exceeded their ability to pay.ibid.
the court in gutierrez stated,any analysis of the enforceability of an arbitration clause properly begins with a discussion of the faa citation,and its preemptive effect on state laws that im
