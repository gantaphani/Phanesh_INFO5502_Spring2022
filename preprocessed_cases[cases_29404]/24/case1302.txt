factual and procedural history 
on january,appellants filed a complaint for declaratory relief in los angeles superior court.in the complaint,tmig alleged that it is purportedly a party to a written agreement with respondent dated january,for the provision of restaurant linens.the written agreement,attached as exhibit a to the complaint,shows that todd christian,whose title was general manager,signed the agreement on behalf of tmig.the agreement contained an arbitration clause providing that u nless the monetary sum sought is within the jurisdiction of the small claims court,any and all disputes with respect to this agreement shall be resolved pursuant to the rules of the american arbitration association,at its los angeles office.in the first cause of action,tmig sought a judicial determination that christian did not have authority to execute the agreement and bind it to the terms thereof that the damages claimed by respondent under the agreement were illegal liquidated damages and that the arbitration clause was unenforceable under california law.
similarly,aic also sought declaratory relief and a judicial determination of its obligations under a written agreement with respondent dated january,for the provision of restaurant linens.the agreement,attached as exhibit b to the complaint,shows that it was signed by ed inglese,the president of aic.it contained an arbitration clause identical to that in the agreement between tmig and respondent.it also provided that the agreement will automatically renew for an additional months,unless respondent receives written notice of termination.in the second cause of action,aic sought a judicial determination that the damages claimed under this agreement were illegal liquidated damages that the arbitration clause was unenforceable under california law and that the contract expired on january,and was not renewed.
respondent did not answer the complaint,but instead,filed a petition to confirm an arbitration award against tmig and for attorney fees and costs in the petition,respondent alleged that tmig had prematurely terminated the written agreement that respondent had sent a demand for arbitration to tmig and filed a copy of the demand with the american arbitration association aaa that an arbitrator had been appointed and the parties had been notified of the fact that an arbitration hearing had occurred on january,that tmig had elected to not participate in the arbitration process for reasons stated in several letters from tmig counsel that an arbitration award in favor of respondent had been made on january,and that tmig had been served with a copy of the arbitration award.
respondent attached as an exhibit to the petition a january,letter from tmig counsel,stating that tmig position was that the document signed by its former employee,todd christian,was neither authorized n or ratified and that t he issue of whether a valid and enforceable arbitration clause exists was within the sole jurisdiction of the superior court.in support of the latter contention,tmig counsel cited gilbert street developers,llc la quinta homes,llc th gilbert street,in which the appellate court held that an arbitration clause incorporating a future arbitration rule did not clearly and unmistakably allow the arbitrator to determine arbitrability.id.at.the january letter also referenced code of civil procedure section,which authorizes a party to file a motion to compel arbitration where the other party declines to participate in arbitration 
in the arbitration award,attached as an exhibit to respondent petition to confirm,the arbitrator addressed the arguments raised by tmig counsel.the arbitrator determined that he could rule on whether a valid and enforceable clause existed under rule a of the commercial arbitration rules and mediation procedures of the aaa.he distinguished gilbert street from the instant case on the ground that rule a was enacted in and the instant agreement was entered into on january.thus,the arbitration clause did not incorporate a future arbitration rule rather,it incorporated a preexisting rule.the arbitrator also determined that the agreement was,and because it was,respondent was not required to resort to section prior to proceeding with the arbitration.finally,the arbitrator found that the agreement was signed by todd christian as general manager of tmig which fact was confirmed by witness testimony at the arbitration hearing namely by maximo escobar who,on behalf of respondent,signed the agreement concurrently.testimony established that christian was in fact holding himself out as the general manager and as one authorized to sign.there was never any disavowal of said agreement by tmig who impliedly accepted the benefits of same by operating thereunder.
in support of the petition to confirm the arbitration award,respondent also attached declarations by two of its employees,cesar velasco and escobar,explaining the circumstances of the execution of the agreement by christian.although velasco and escobar described the events from their respective viewpoints and signed the declarations under penalty of perjury,they did not explicitly state that their declarations were made on the basis of personal knowledge.
in addition to the petition to confirm the arbitration award,respondent also filed a motion to strike the first cause of action by tmig on the basis that it had no merit in light of the arbitration award.in support,respondent attached a declaration by lawrence levine attaching certain correspondence.he did not aver that the declaration was made on the basis of personal knowledge.
respondent also filed a motion to strike the second cause of action by aic,or to abate that cause of action.in support,respondent attached declarations by pete calzada and levine.calzada stated that he found no written notice from aic that the aic agreement had been terminated.levine declaration attached copies of correspondence between him and aic counsel.
appellants filed a consolidated opposition to the petition to confirm the arbitration award and to the motions to strike.they also objected to all of the declarations on the basis that the declarations failed to state that they were made on the basis of personal knowledge.after a hearing and supplemental briefing,on may,the superior court issued its ruling granting the petition to confirm the arbitration award against tmig,awarding attorney fees and costs related to that petition,and striking the first cause of action in the complaint.in its order,the superior court determined that christian was an ostensible agent of tmig,and that tmig had ratified the contract by accepting the benefits of the agreement.the court also determined that because the arbitration clause was,respondent was not required to petition the court for an order compelling arbitration prior to proceeding with the arbitration.the court noted that the arbitration clause also permitted the arbitrator to render a valid ex parte award when one party fails to appear at the arbitration because under rule of the rules of aaa,t he arbitration may proceed in the absences sic of any party or representative who,after due notice,fails to be present or fails to obtain a postponement.as an alternative ground for finding a valid arbitration clause,the court held that tmig had waived any right to contest the arbitration clause by participating in the arbitration process.
the court rejected the argument that the damages awarded by the arbitrator constituted illegal liquidated damages.the court sustained appellant objections to the declarations of lawrence levine,cesar velasco,and maximo escobar on the ground that they fail ed to state they are based on personal knowledge.t
