statement of facts and procedural history 
cano is a clinical neurologist.titolo was cano patient from october through february.on october,titolo signed a arbitration agreement,which includes,in part,the following language which code of civil procedure section requires be included in medical arbitration agreements it is understood that any dispute as to medical malpractice,that is as to whether any medical services rendered under this contract were unnecessary or unauthorized or were improperly,negligently or incompetently rendered,will be determined by submission to arbitration as provided by california law,and not by a lawsuit or resort to court process except as california law provides for judicial review of arbitration proceedings.both parties to this contract,by entering into it,are giving up their constitutional rights to have any such dispute decided in a court of law before a jury,and instead are accepting the use of arbitration.all claims based upon the same incident,transaction or related circumstances shall be arbitrated in one proceeding notice by signing this contract you are agreeing to have any issue of medical malpractice decided by neutral arbitration and you are giving up your right to a jury or court trial.
titolo had a disability policy with provident life and accident insurance company provident.on march,titolo signed an authorization for use and disclosure of medical information,requesting and permitting cano to disclose titolo privileged and confidential medical information to provident.on the same date,titolo provided cano with an attending physician statement and asked cano to certify to provident that titolo was disabled.cano declined to sign the form because she was not titolo primary treating physician.
in june,cano informed provident that titolo was not disabled,but that her disability claim was a scam and she was a fraud.cano also sent provident a copy of titolo medical file.provident denied titolo disability claim.
titolo sued cano for breach of fiduciary duty,violation of privacy rights,and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,all based on cano june communications with provident.cano filed a petition to arbitrate.the trial court denied the petition because titolo is seeking damages for actions not part of the provision of medical services and the arbitration agreement would not apply.

discussion 
standard of review,burdens of proof,and public policies 
we review the order denying the petition to compel arbitration de novo because the trial court did not resolve any factual disputes in rendering its decision.metalclad ventana environmental organizational partnership th,d.
to determine whether a contractual arbitration clause requires arbitration of a particular controversy,the controversy is first identified and the issue is whether that controversy is within the scope of the contractual arbitration clause.in re tobacco cases i th,d.the petitioner bears the burden of proving the existence of a valid arbitration agreement by the preponderance of the evidence,and a party opposing the petition bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence any fact necessary to its defense.engalla permanente medical group,cal th,d.the evidence may be presented by affidavits,declarations,and other documentary evidence,as well as oral testimony received at the court discretion.ibid.
once the existence of a valid arbitration clause has been established,t he burden is on the party opposing arbitration to demonstrate that an arbitration clause can not be interpreted to require arbitration of the dispute.buckhorn jude heritage medical group th,d.in other words,an order to arbitrate a particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.dryer los angeles rams cal d.
in connection with her petition to compel arbitration,cano submitted a copy of a arbitration agreement signed by titolo and by cano authorized representative.titolo does not challenge the validity of the arbitration agreement.cano has therefore met her burden of establishing the existence of a valid arbitration agreement.the burden thus shifts to titolo to establish her claims are not subject to the arbitration agreement.
at this point in the analysis,two equally important policies become applicable.first,resolution of disputes through the process of arbitration is favored in this state,and any doubt as to the meaning and interpretation of an arbitration agreement is resolved in favor of requiring arbitration.moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,bono david th,d.
however,t here is no public policy favoring arbitration of disputes which the parties have not agreed to arbitrate.engineers architects community development th,d.therefore,the second policy guiding our decision is that no dispute may be ordered to arbitration unless it is within the scope of the arbitration agreement.in determining the scope of an arbitration clause,t he court should attempt to give effect to the parties intentions,in light of the usual and ordinary meaning of the contractual language and the circumstances under which the agreement was made citation.citation.victoria superior court cal d.t he terms of the specific arbitration clause under consideration must reasonably cover the dispute as to which arbitration is requested.bono david,supra,th at,d.
the arbitration agreement 
the arbitration agreement between titolo and cano covers any dispute as to medical malpractice.the agreement defines medical malpractice as whether any medical services rendered under this contract were unnecessary or unauthorized or were improperly,negligently,or incompetently rendered.
are cano actions in communicating with titolo disability insurer and providing the insurer with titolo medical records,all at titolo request,within the provision of medical services by a physician to a patient yes.communications between physicians and insurance companies regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients are a necessary part of the provision of medical services to those patients.the practice of medicine today requires close interaction among medical professionals,their patients,health care insurers,and health management organizations.cano obtained titolo medical information by rendering medical services to her.further,titolo only requested that cano communicate with titolo insurer because cano had provided medical services to her.therefore,the acts of which titolo complains are medical services provided to titolo.titolo herself acknowledged this reality as explained post,she informed the trial court in another related case that the present case was based on cano actions and services as a physician and arose out of actions related to cano medical treatment of titolo.
interrelationship between the arbitration agreement and section 
the trial court concluded,and titolo argues on appeal,that titolo claims against cano are not within the arbitration provision because section,subdivision g defines professional negligence as a negligent act or omission to act by a health care provider in the rendering of professional services,which act or omission is the proximate cause of a personal injury or wrongful death,and titolo does not assert a claim for a personal injury or wrongful death.true,titolo first amended complaint does not seek damages for personal injuries or wrongful death.
the dispositive question in this case is what is the meaning of the language contained in the agreement to arbitrate between titolo and cano the arbitration agreement itself covers medical services and its language is pursuant to and in full compliance with the requirements of section.titolo does not argue otherwise.indeed,the failure to use the language specified by the statute could render the arbitration provision unenforceable.see reigelsperger siller cal th,d.the arbitration agreement does not limit its application to cases involving personal injuries or wrongful death,and does not quote from or refer to section,or mention the term professional negligence.we can not read more into the parties arbitration agreement than it provides.
section applies to a ny contract for medical services which contains a provision for arbitration of any dispute as to professional negligence of a health care provider,subd.a,italics added.in a separate subdivision,the statute defines professional negligence as a negligent act or omission to act by a health care provider in the rendering of professional services,which act or omission is the proximate cause of a personal injury or wrongful death,subd.g,italics added.
but section also requires that an arbitration agreement contain language making the agreement applicable to any dispute as to medical malpractice,that is as to whether any medical services rendered under this contract were unnecessary or unauthorized or were improperly,negligently or incompetently rendered,subd.a,italics added.this required language for the arbitration agreement does not use the terms professional negligence,personal injury or wrongful death.
we read section reference to medical services according to its plain meaning.accordingly,we reject titolo argument that the legislature must have intended that the terms medical malpractice and professional negligence be used synonymously.as quoted above,section itself defines medical malpractice and professional negligence in different ways thus,the terms are not synonymous.the words actually used in the agreement signed by the patient and the physician control,not other words included in the statute,but not included or required to be included in the contract.
even if the arbitration agreement had also included the language of section referring to professional negligence,the statute would not preclude the arbitration agreement pertaining to medical services from applying to titolo claims in this case.as long as the arbitration agreement includes the language required by section,as it did here,the parties may broaden their agreement with additional language.reigelsperger siller,supra,cal th at,d.
analysis of related cases 
our conclusion is supported by central pathology service medical clinic,superior court cal th,d,central pathology,in which the supreme court held,whenever an injured party seeks punitive damages for an injury that is directly related to the professional services provided by a health care provider acting in its capacity as such,then the action is one arising out of the professional negligence of a health care provider,and the party must comply with section a.in that case,the plaintiffs had originally sued the defendant for medical negligence and loss of consortium.id.at,d.the plaintiffs later filed a motion for leave to amend to add claims for fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress,and to seek punitive damages,based on the same facts as the original complaint.ibid.the trial court granted the motion,concluding the procedural requirements of section did not apply because the fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims did not relate to a professional negligence claim.ibid.
the supreme court disagreed,and remanded the case to the court of appeal with directions to issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order granting leave to amend and to conduct further proceedings under section,subdivision a.central pathology,supra,cal th at,d.i dentifying a cause of action as an intentional tort as opposed to negligence does not itself remove the claim from the requirements of section a.the allegations that identify the nature and cause of a plaintiff injury must be examined to determine whether each is directly related to the manner in which professional services were provided.thus,a cause of action against a health care provider for battery predicated on treatment exceeding or different from that to which a plaintiff consented is governed by section because the injury arose out of the manner in which professional services are provided.by contrast,a cause of action against a health care provider for sexual battery would not,in most instances,fall within the statute because the defendant conduct would not be directly related to the manner in which professional services were rendered.citation.and,contrary to plaintiffs argument,section a applies regardless of whether the complaint purports to state a single cause of action for an intentional tort or also states a cause of action for professional negligence.the clear intent of the legislature is that any claim for punitive damages in an action against a health care provider be subject to the statute if the injury that is the basis for the claim was caused by conduct that was directly related to the rendition of professional services.id.at,d.
the supreme court continued,in the portion of its opinion key to our analysis of the scope of the words medical services plaintiffs cause of action for fraud in this case is directly related to the manner in which defendants provided professional services.the claim emanates from the manner in which defendants performed and communicated the results of medical tests,a matter that is an ordinary and usual part of medical professional services.it is therefore governed by section a.plaintiffs cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress is predicated on the same alleged acts as the fraud claim.therefore,it too is directly related to defendants performance of professional services and is governed by section a.central pathology,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.thus,communication of medical test results is an ordinary and usual part of a physician provision of medical services to his or her patient.under the same analysis,so too is the communication of information between a physician and a disability insurer regarding the patient diagnosis and treatment at the request of the patient.
herrera superior court d.and baker sadick d.similarly support our holding in this case.in herrera,supra,d at page,the appellate court noted that section definition of malpractice includes more than negligence,and that a malpractice action may include theories such as battery,breach of contract,and deceit.and,in
