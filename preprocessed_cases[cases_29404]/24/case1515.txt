in szetela discover bank th,d szetela,the court of appeal held an arbitration clause prohibiting arbitration to be unconscionable and unenforceable.the trial court in the present case relied upon szetela to rule that the arbitration clause at issue here is likewise unconscionable.recognizing that the issue is pending before our supreme court,we will not follow szetela and will conclude instead that under the facts in the present case the contractual ban on arbitration is not unduly,harsh,or in violation of public policy 
factual and procedural background 
three separate lawsuits were brought against defendant cingular wireless,llc,and other providers of wireless telephone service,challenging the early termination fee charged to customers who end their wireless telephone service before the expiration of the term of the service agreement.
rita parrish sued in orange county as a private attorney general under the unfair competition law ucl bus,et,alleging that the early termination fee constituted an unlawful liquidated damages provision in an unconscionable contract.jerilyn marlowe and seven other named plaintiffs brought a class action in alameda county alleging violations of the ucl and the consumers legal remedies act clra,et.in the third lawsuit,astrid mendoza sued in alameda county as a private attorney general and as a class representative to challenge both the early termination fee and cingular locked headsets that preclude the use of competitors networks.these three lawsuits were consolidated and coordinated with other lawsuits pending against other wireless service providers.
the wireless telephone service agreement at issue in all three lawsuits provides for arbitration of all disputes and claims arising out of or related to the agreement.in july,cingular modified the arbitration clause,making it more advantageous to the customers,and cingular notified its customers of the change by way of an insert included with the customers monthly bill.both the original and the modified versions of the arbitration clause provide that either party may bring an individual action in small claims court,notwithstanding the agreement to arbitrate all disputes.the modified arbitration clause provides that the arbitration will be governed by the commercial dispute resolution procedures and the supplementary procedures for disputes of the american arbitration association aaa the modified version significantly changed the procedure for payment of fees if the customer initiates arbitration,cingular will promptly reimburse the customer for the filing fee.moreover,cingular will pay all filing,administration,and arbitrator fees unless the arbitrator finds that the customer claim is frivolous,in which case payment of fees will be governed by the aaa rules and thereby apportioned by the arbitrator and if the arbitration award is equal to or greater than the customer demand,cingular will pay the customer attorney fees and expenses.
most significantly,both the original and the modified version of the arbitration clause allow only individual claims to be heard in arbitration.the modified version reads as follows the arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party individual claim you and cingular may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity,and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.further,you agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person claims,and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding,and that if this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable,then the entirety of this arbitration clause shall be null and void.capitalization in original.
cingular petitioned to compel arbitration of plaintiffs disputes although cingular did not make a specific request to the court for individual arbitration,cingular took the position that any arbitration conducted would be limited to arbitration of individual claims.plaintiffs opposed the petition,arguing,inter alia,that the arbitration clause was unconscionable in precluding relief,and in requiring plaintiffs to pay the costs of arbitration if they should lose.the trial court agreed with plaintiffs that the ban on arbitration is unconscionable and invalid under the court of appeal decision in szetela,supra,th,d.the court denied cingular petition to compel arbitration.by way of dictum,the court noted that if the arbitration clause were enforceable,the arbitration would be on an individual basis and not as a class or representative claim.cingular now appeals from the order denying arbitration.
discussion 
injunctive relief 
plaintiffs seek,in addition to monetary recovery of the early termination fees,injunctive relief to benefit the general public.however,the california supreme court has held that such claims for injunctive relief are not arbitrable.cruz pacificare health systems,cal th,d,ucl broughton cigna healthplans cal th,d,crla.cingular acknowledged below that the claims for injunctive relief were not arbitrable under cruz and broughton,and on appeal cingular again recognizes that this court is bound to follow existing precedent from the california supreme court.we will,therefore,affirm the trial court denial of cingular petition to compel arbitration of the claims for injunctive relief.
ii.monetary claims 
nonsignatory parrish 
with one exception,the plaintiffs who are subject to cingular petition to compel arbitration are parties to the arbitration clause in cingular wireless service agreement.the one exception is plaintiff rita parrish,who is not and never has been a subscriber to cingular wireless service.she brought suit only as a private attorney general under the ucl for the benefit of the general public we conclude that plaintiff parrish can not be compelled to arbitrate.
by statute,an order compelling arbitration is warranted when an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists and a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy.code civ.the fundamental assumption of arbitration is that the parties have consented to resolving their disputes outside the judicial process.the strong policy favoring arbitration as a means of resolving disputes does not extend to persons who are not parties to the arbitration agreement and have not elected to submit to arbitration.county of contra costa kaiser foundation health plan,th,d accord benasra marciano th,d.a proceeding to compel arbitration is essentially a suit in equity for specific performance of an arbitration agreement.a court in equity has no power to compel third party nonsignatories to arbitrate absent some implied authority by the signatory to bind the nonsignatory.th at,d see also marcus millichap real estate investment brokerage hock investment th,d.

superior court th,d,upon which cingular relies,is not on point.the question in that case was whether a forum selection clause could be enforced against a plaintiff who was not a party to the telephone service contract but who brought the action as a private attorney general under the ucl.we draw a distinction between a forum selection clause and an arbitration clause.a forum selection clause may be enforced against a nonparty who is closely related to the contractual relationship.id.at,d lu of california,th,d.enforcement of an arbitration clause,in contrast,requires more than the nonparty connection to the contract,buckner tamarin th,d father arbitration agreement with medical providers did not bind his adult daughters on their wrongful death claims benasra marciano,supra,th at,d arbitration agreement signed by corporation president not binding on the individual in his claim for libel kaneko ford design citipark,d.arbitration clause in contract between designer and third party not binding on property owner.
our supreme court has left unresolved the question whether a plaintiff seeking restitution as a private attorney general under the ucl can be compelled to arbitrate when the plaintiff is not a party to the arbitration agreement but is acting on behalf of injured consumers who are parties to the arbitration agreement.cruz pacificare health systems,supra,cal th at,fn,d.we observe that the question has little practical significance,because the same factors that preclude a private attorney general from being compelled to arbitrate also serve to limit the plaintiff relief in court.while civil penalties may be assessed when the action is initiated by a governmental prosecutor bus,monetary damages are not recoverable under the ucl.bank of the west superior court cal th,d.a private plaintiff is limited to injunctive relief or restitution,the return of money obtained through an unfair business practice bus.and restitution requires an ownership or vested interest in the money nonrestitutionary disgorgement of profits is not available to an individual acting as a private attorney general under the ucl.korea supply lockheed martin cal th,d.as the supreme court explained,the breadth of standing under this act allows any consumer to combat unfair competition by seeking an injunction against unfair business practices.actual direct victims of unfair competition may obtain restitution as well.id.at,d,italics added.in the present case,plaintiff parrish is not an actual direct victim of cingular early termination fee and is acting only as a private attorney general.she has no monetary remedies under the ucl,even assuming arguendo that her claims remain viable.see fn,ante.at most,her remedy is injunctive relief,and,as we have said,the claims for injunctive relief are not arbitrable.
b.the ban on arbitration 
unconscionability 
at the outset,we observe that the parties and the trial court have mischaracterized the arbitration clause as a ban on class actions.in actuality,the disputed portion of the arbitration agreement prohibits class arbitration.class actions through litigation are necessarily precluded by the agreement to arbitrate.the question we face here concerns only the manner of plaintiffs can be denied class treatment of individual claims within the arbitral forum.
an agreement to arbitrate is valid,irrevocable,and enforceable except when grounds exist for the revocation of any contract.code civ,subd.b.unconscionability is one ground upon which a court may refuse to enforce a contract,and the burden is on the party opposing arbitration to prove the defense.engalla permanente medical group,supra,cal th at,d.
the determination of unconscionability is a question of law for the court,subd.a flores transamerica homefirst,th,d.on appeal,when the extrinsic evidence is undisputed,as it is here,we review the contract de novo to determine unconscionability.th at,d stirlen supercuts,th,d.
it bears emphasizing that a finding of unconscionability in a contract clause does not necessarily mean that the contract can not be enforced.the trial court has discretion to sever the unconscionable provision and enforce the remainder of the contract or to limit the application of the unconscionable clause so as to avoid an unconscionable result,subd.a little auto stiegler,cal th,d.in the present case,however,the modified version of the arbitration clause precludes severance of the ban on class arbitration t he arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or sic,on more than one person claims,and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding,and if this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable,then the entirety of this arbitration clause shall be null and void.
in determining whether a particular contractual provision is unconscionable,we examine both a procedural and a substantive element of unconscionability.the procedural element focuses on the way in which the disputed provision was,whether there was oppression or surprise.oppression arises from an inequality of bargaining power that results in no real negotiation and an absence of meaningful choice.surprise involves the extent to which the supposedly terms are hidden in a prolix printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce them.the substantive element of unconscionability has to do with the effects of the contractual provision and whether it is overly harsh or.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,inc cal th,d,armendariz a m produce fmc d.
to be unenforceable,a contract must be both procedurally and substantively unconscionable,but the courts employ a sliding scale or a balancing relationship between the two elements of unconscionability,such that the greater the degree of unfair surprise or unequal bargaining power,the less the degree of substantive unconscionability required to annul the contract and vice versa.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d,marin storage trucking,benco contracting engineering,th,d.
we agree with the trial court conclusion that the arbitration agreement,as amended through the bill insert,was a contract of adhesion and,hence,procedurally unconscionable.see flores transamerica homefirst,supra,th at,d stirlen supercuts,supra,th at,d.cingular concedes the point.see szetela,supra,th at,d contract amendment contained in bill stuffer was procedurally unconscionable.the more difficult question is whether the ban on class arbitration is substantively unconscionable.
that issue was addressed in szetela,supra,th,d.there the plaintiff was a credit card holder who alleged that the bank credit card company had improperly charged him a fee for exceeding his credit limit.the arbitration clause in the credit card agreement prohibited joining or consolidating claims in arbitration or arbitrating claims as a representative,as a member of a class,or as a private attorney general.when the plaintiff brought a class action,the bank successfully moved to compel arbitration on an individual basis.the appellate court held the ban on class treatment to be unconscionable,and the court directed the trial court to proceed to arbitration on a class basis.
the szetela court reasoned that the ban on class arbitration was unfairly although styled as a mutual prohibition on representative or class actions,it is difficult to envision the circumstances under which the provision might negatively impact discover,because credit card companies typically do not sue their customers in class action lawsuits.this provision is clearly meant to prevent customers from seeking redress for relatively small amounts of money,such as the sought by szetela.fully aware that few customers will go to the time and trouble of suing in small claims court,discover has instead sought to create for itself virtual immunity from class or representative actions despite their potential merit,while suffering no similar detriment to its own rights.szetela,supra,th at,d.
the lack of mutuality is,of course,a basis for finding substantive unconscionability.armendariz,supra,cal th at,d.the courts have found unconscionable a clause requiring arbitration for the weaker party while giving the stronger party a choice of forum.id.at,d,only employee claims of wrongful termination subject to arbitration little auto stiegler,supra,cal th at,d,allowing appeal of any award over effectively gave only employer right to appeal harper ultimo th,d personal injury damages not available without contractor consent flores transamerica homefirst,supra,th at,d only borrower claims subject to arbitra
