sarah morrison appeals from a order denying her motion for attorney fees under civil code section and government code section after the parties had resolved their dispute by settlement.we will affirm the order.
facts and procedural history 
on january,morrison signed a lease and moved into an apartment at vineyard creek apartments in santa rosa,california.the lease agreement provided on the first page,which morrison initialed,that the apartment would be used as a private residence and for no other purpose.morrison did not disclose her intention to operate a family child care home in the apartment.
on january,morrison delivered notice to respondent vineyard creek,pursuant to health and safety code section,subdivision d of the california child day care facilities act child day care act.health,et in the notice,morrison declared her intent to operate a family child day care facility in her apartment beginning march.
toward the end of january,after passing the required home inspection,morrison received her state license to operate a family child care home.she arranged to provide child care for three families in her apartment.
the child day care act including chapters,and of division of the health and safety code was enacted to provide a comprehensive,quality system for licensing child day care facilities to ensure a quality day care environment because child day care facilities contribute positively to children and because good quality child day care services are an essential service for working parents.health.while the child day care act is primarily focused on licensing and quality of care,health and safety code section precludes property owners from prohibiting or restricting the use of residences as child day care homes 
on january,vineyard creek attorney,jeffrey breithaupt,responded to morrison notice.he stated that the operation of a day care business in her apartment would constitute a breach of the lease provision that required only private residential use of the premises.in his view,the protections of the child day care act applied to residences,not a apartment complex like vineyard creek.breithaupt further notified morrison that a ny attempts by you to operate a family child care home out of your apartment is a breach of the residential agreement and will result in litigation against you.breithaupt invited morrison or her attorney to contact him if she had any questions.
morrison delayed the opening of her family child care business and retained legal counsel at the child care law center.
by letter dated february,attorney claire ramsey of the child care law center responded to breithaupt.ramsey opined that the child day care act did apply to apartment buildings.
breithaupt replied to ramsey by letter dated february.breithaupt remained unconvinced that the child day care act,which specifically references residences,applied to apartment complexes,but invited ramsey to provide any law to the contrary.otherwise,he would continue to advise his client to enjoin morrison from maintaining a family child care home at the vineyard creek apartments.
more than two months later,on april,morrison attorneys responded that,after further research,they still believed that the child day care act applied to apartment complexes or,perhaps more accurately,to apartments in a apartment complex.ramsey look ed forward to vineyard creek favorable response by april.otherwise,ramsey threatened,morrison would pursue litigation seeking equitable relief as well as damages for loss of income and retaliatory eviction.
on april,breithaupt answered that the statute was not suited to complexes.he noted as stated in the dicta of barrett dawson th,the statute is tailored to the promotion of family day care homes appropriate to lots zoned for dwelling see health,not commercial kindergartens.breithaupt asserted that the issue is of primary importance to the owners of the apartments and they are willing to vigorously defend against any suit your center or sarah morrison may bring.italics added.
a.the lawsuit 
on may,morrison filed a verified complaint against vineyard creek,and numerous other defendants collectively,vineyard creek,alleging violations of the child day care act specifically,health,california statute,california fair employment and housing act,and business and professions code section,as well as breach of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment,negligence,and negligent infliction of emotional distress 
in her complaint,morrison sought an injunction enjoining the defendants from evicting,discriminating against,or retaliating against morrison.she also requested declaratory relief,damages for lost income and emotional distress,and c osts of suit and reasonable attorneys fees.
on the same day she filed her complaint,morrison opened her family day care home in her apartment.vineyard creek did not take any action against her.
in,shortly after the lawsuit was filed,vineyard creek retained new counsel.by the end of may,counsel reviewed the legislative history of the child day care act and concluded it was,in fact,intended to apply to apartments.on june,barely a month after the lawsuit was served,vineyard creek counsel called morrison attorney and informed her that vineyard creek withdrew its opposition to morrison day care home and agreed to compensate her for her actual damages.at this point,the parties had not engaged in any discovery or court hearings.
by letter dated june,ramsey acknowledged vineyard creek agreement that the child day care act applied to morrison situation,but requested concessions to resolve the case amend morrison lease to reflect her right to operate a family child care home without fear of eviction or retaliation not harass morrison,discriminate against her,or violate her right to operate a family child care home give morrison a right to renew her lease provide morrison a positive letter of reference if she chose to vacate the apartment pay morrison in damages reimburse her for all costs she incurred in pursuing her legal rights in court include provisions in other vineyard creek leases reflecting the right to operate a family child care home comply with all applicable fair housing laws enter into a stipulated judgment with continuing jurisdiction and agree that morrison is entitled to recover her attorney fees.
on september,having not received a response to the settlement proposal,morrison attorneys sent to vineyard creek attorney a letter and proposed settlement agreement.the letter clarified that morrison demand for in damages included for her actual damages,for statutory damages based on morrison discrimination and retaliation claims,and for emotional distress.the letter warned that morrison would commence discovery if the parties could not resolve the outstanding settlement issues soon.
in october,morrison attorneys served discovery demands,including form interrogatories,special interrogatories,and requests for production of documents,on five of the six defendants.morrison also noticed the deposition of property manager alkire and vineyard creek former attorney,breithaupt.vineyard creek requested extensions of time to respond to the discovery requests and ultimately provided responses that morrison deemed insufficient.
meanwhile,vineyard creek attorneys sent a counteroffer on november,proposing a settlement of.the parties continued to negotiate.
in january,morrison attorneys threatened to file a motion to compel further discovery responses from vineyard creek.vineyard creek asserted that the motion was unnecessary because further responses were en route and the discovery was needless anyway since the only remaining issue was proof of morrison damages.in february,morrison nonetheless filed a motion to compel production of documents and further responses to discovery.the motion to compel was granted as to two housing manuals.
vineyard creek propounded its own discovery,pertaining to the issue of morrison actual damages.morrison was served and responded to two sets of form interrogatories and a set of special interrogatories.she was also served and complied with requests for production of documents,and vineyard creek took her deposition.
from january to at least march,vineyard creek counsel repeatedly requested evidence of morrison claimed damages,noting on one occasion his request for some credible showing of true,actual damages as his clients were prepared to pay such in settlement.
on march,vineyard creek served subpoenas on morrison clients,morrison former employers,and the community care licensing division.according to vineyard creek attorney,the subpoenas were tailored to the issue of morrison actual damages and were served only because morrison attorneys had not provided the requested evidence.morrison filed a motion to quash the subpoenas,seeking to protect the privacy of her clients and to prevent the disclosure of confidential information about their children.the motion also sought to prevent former employers and the community care licensing division from disclosing certain records.the record does not indicate the outcome of the motion.
settlement 
in may,three weeks before trial was scheduled to begin,the parties orally settled the case.on june,the parties signed a settlement agreement.
in the settlement agreement,vineyard creek did not admit liability or violation of any statute.to the contrary,the settlement agreement provided defendants deny the entirety of plaintiff allegations.this settlement agreement does not constitute and shall not be deemed an admission of any wrongdoing or concession of any liability by defendants as to plaintiff allegations.
under the heading of health safety code compliance,vineyard creek agreed to recognize morrison right to operate a family child care home in compliance with all health and safety codes,agreed not to harass or discriminate against morrison,and agreed to comply with all applicable health and safety code sections regarding family child care homes.under the heading of fair housing compliance,vineyard creek agreed to comply with all fair housing laws.under the heading of tenant protections,vineyard creek agreed to refrain from any and all retaliatory actions against morrison.vineyard creek also agreed that morrison could renew her lease for any period up to one year assuming she was not otherwise in violation of the lease,and promised a letter of good standing as a tenant if and when she chose to vacate the apartment assuming she was in good standing to qualify for such a letter.although morrison had demanded in economic damages,vineyard creek agreed to pay.vineyard creek further agreed to resolve the matter by stipulated judgment with a reservation of jurisdiction and to bifurcate the issues of costs and attorney fees.morrison dropped her demands that vineyard creek amend her lease to reflect her right to operate a family child care home and to add a provision to all leases at all properties owned or managed by vineyard creek confirming that tenants could operate licensed family day care in their apartments.
the settlement agreement was approved by the trial court in february.it appears from the register of actions that a judgment,at least as to most defendants,was entered in february as well.
morrison motion for attorney fees 
in may,morrison filed a motion under code of civil procedure section private attorney general statute,civil code section retaliatory eviction statute,and government code section,subdivision a feha,for attorney fees payable to her attorneys,including the western center on law and poverty,the child care law center,and private attorney nancy palandati.the motion requested for work on the substantive case in attorney fees with a multiplier,plus for work on the attorney fees motion.as of the date of morrison reply brief in support of her motion september,morrison was requesting in attorney fees.
in a page written decision,the trial court denied morrison motion for attorney fees.this appeal followed 
ii.discussion 
although the issue motivating this litigation was squarely based on whether the child day care act applied to an apartment in a apartment complex,the child day care act is not at issue in this appeal.we therefore do not decide whether,or to what extent,the child day care act validly applies to tenants seeking to operate family day care homes in apartments in apartment complexes.nor do we decide whether a private right of action may be implied from the statute.
at issue instead is whether the trial court should have awarded morrison attorney fees under statutes other than the child day care act.we review the denial of morrison motion for attorney fees for an abuse of discretion.graciano robinson ford sales,th.although morrison urges us to review the trial court decision de novo,we would reach the same result if we applied de novo review.see loduca polyzos th,determination of legal basis for award of attorney fees is reviewed de novo as a question of law.
as mentioned,morrison asserted many causes of action in her complaint,including causes of action for violation of the child day care act,the statute,feha,the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment,negligence,and negligent infliction of emotional distress.of these claims,the parties agree,only the statute and feha permit an award of attorney fees,and such an award is available only to the prevailing party.
morrison prevailed in the lawsuit,in the sense that she obtained some of the relief she sought vineyard creek agreed to allow her to remain in her apartment and to operate her family day care home,and it also agreed to pay the damages morrison allegedly incurred as a result of vineyard creek delay in acknowledging her right to do so.the question,however,is whether morrison was the prevailing party on claims for which she sought and could recover attorney fees namely,her claims for violation of the statute and feha.graciano,supra,th at.
because the dispute in this case was resolved by a settlement agreement rather than by adjudication,we begin by examining the settlement agreement.see folsom butte county of governments cal d,a party may be a successful party under code civ.proc,even if the litigation is resolved by settlement rather than by adjudication.
prevailing party under the settlement agreement 
in the matter before us,the settlement agreement does not state that vineyard creek violated the statute or feha,retaliated against morrison for her assertion of her rights,or discriminated against her.to the contrary,the settlement agreement states defendants deny the entirety of plaintiff allegations.this settlement agreement does not constitute and shall not be deemed an admission of any wrongdoing or concession of any liability by defendants as to plaintiff allegations.
a settlement agreement might indicate that a party prevailed on one or more claims,even if the other party does not expressly admit it.planned parenthood aakhus th,decided under code civ.the question,it is contended,is whether the claims contributed substantially to remedying the conditions at which the claims or lawsuit were directed.see folsom,supra,cal d at.
morrison contends this standard was met,arguing that she ultimately obtained all the declaratory and injunctive relief she had requested in her complaint,plus in damages.upon examination,however,morrison argument is unpersuasive.
first,as to declaratory relief,morrison is simply incorrect.she did not obtain any judicial declaration at all.
second,as to injunctive relief,it is unclear that the and feha causes of action contributed substantially to vineyard creek agreement to take or not to take certain actions.vineyard creek did agree to refrain from discriminating against morrison,to comply with all fair housing laws,and to refrain from any and all retaliatory actions against morrison.this bears some similarity to the injunctive relief morrison requested in the prayer of her complaint,albeit in much more general terms than the specific requests to enjoin vineyard creek from d iscriminating against morrison on account of her source of income and r etaliating against morrison for asserting her rights under the rental agreement and the law.it is highly questionable,however,that vineyard creek general promises to comply with housing laws and to refrain from discriminating and retaliating against morrison in the future are really traceable to the or feha claims themselves.the and feha claims explicitly sought relief for actions that had already occurred,they did not explicitly seek injunctive relief,and the statute does not even provide specifically for injunctive relief moreover,vineyard creek agreement not to discriminate or retaliate in the future would stem naturally from its recognition of morrison rights under the child day care act alone.indeed,according to paragraph of morrison complaint,vineyard creek violation of the child day care act had resulted in the threat of litigation against her for breaching her lease,suggesting that vineyard creek agreement not to retaliate against morrison stemmed from the merits of the claim under the child day care act.morrison has not established that inclusion of the or feha claims in her lawsuit contributed substantially to the relief she obtained.
as to damages,vineyard creek ended up paying in satisfaction of all claims for damages and interest.while the settlement agreement notes that the payment satisfies all of morrison claims,the september,letter from morrison attorney,which was before the trial court,sheds light on what claims actually led to that payment.the letter explained that morrison demand for in damages was comprised of for morrison actual damages delay in starting the day care center,for statutory damages based on morrison discrimination and retaliation claims,and for emotional distress.italics added.although all claims sought recovery for actual damages,the fact that vineyard creek did not pay the for statutory damages could lead to a reasonable inference that the payment was for morrison damages as a result of the violation of the child day care act plus interest,and not any amount towards her discrimination and retaliation claims under the statute or feha.
there is also some question whether it was really morrison lawsuit that got morrison her relief.before the lawsuit was filed,vineyard creek attorney twice asked ramsey for authority that would change his view as to the scope of the child day care act.although morrison attorney knew of the legislative history that ultimately convinced vineyard creek to permit morrison to operate her family day care home,and referred to it generally in her april,letter,she did not actually provide the legislative history to vineyard creek before filing the lawsuit.we do not imply that she had any obligation to do so but the fact is that this legislative history concerning the child day care act not the assertion of the and feha claims is what seemed to trigger vineyard creek decision to permit morrison to open her family day care home and compensate morrison for her damages.once vineyard creek understood the scope of the child day care act,it made no effort to evict or harass morrison or discriminate or retaliate against her,and there is no indication it would have done so absent the filing of the and feha claims.
in sum,based on the settlement agreement itself,morrison did not establish that she was the prevailing party on the relevant claims.
in any event,the parties and the trial court have focused not on the settlement agreement,but on whether the evidence demonstrated that vineyard creek in fact violated the statute or feha.morrison contends that t he issues on appeal include whether vineyard creek threats of litigation for enforcing rights under the day care act are unlawful under california statute and whether feha protects tenants from discrimination based on source of income when using their property as authorized under the day care act.of course,consideration of the merits of morrison and feha claims makes a lot of sense.in the first place,the merits of those claims may be germane to whether they substantially contributed to vineyard creek consenting to the relief morrison obtained.furthermore,it would certainly be anomalous for a party to recover attorney fees under claims that had no merit,simply because the party obtained relief due to other claims for which attorney fees could not be awarded.we therefore turn to the merits of morrison claims.
civil code section 
civil code section provides for an award of reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in any action brought for damages for retaliatory eviction,where,as here,attorney fees are requested upon initiation of the action,subd.g.morrison retaliatory eviction arguments are based on subdivision c of civil code section.
subdivision c of civil code section provides it is unlawful for a lessor to increase rent,decrease services,cause a lessee to quit involuntarily,bring an action to recover possession,or threaten to do any of those acts,for the purpose of retaliating against the lessee because he or she has lawfully organized or participated in a lessees association or an organization advocating lessees rights or has lawfully and peaceably exercised any rights under the law.in an action brought by or against the lessee pursuant to this subdivision,the lessee shall bear the burden of producing evidence that the lessor conduct was,in fact,retaliatory.italics added.
morrison argues that she lawfully and peaceably exercised her rights under the law,subd.c by advising vineyard creek that it could not restrict or prohibit her operation of a family child care home in her apartment.she argues further that vineyard creek retaliated by its two letters,dated january and february.by these letters,morrison contends,vineyard creek decreased residential services by preventing morrison lawful right to open a family day care home threatened to cause her to vacate the premises involuntarily by not permitting her to operate the family day care home and threatened to bring an action to recover possession of the apartment.the trial court,however,found there was no evidence that vineyard creek did any of those things.
substantial evidence supports the finding that vineyard creek did not threaten to increase rent,decrease services,cause a lessee to quit involuntarily,or bring an action to recover possession in retaliation for morrison notice that she would operate a family day care home,subd.c.the january,letter from vineyard creek attorney stated that morrison use of the unit as a family day care home would constitute a breach of the lease and result in litigation,and his february,letter stated that he would continue to advise his client to enjoin morrison from maintaining a family child care home.there is no mention of evicting morrison,terminating her tenancy,or reducing services,and in context the reference to litigation pertains to enjoining her from operating the family child care home in her apartment,not kicking her out of the apartment.
morrison arguments to the contrary are meritless.she contends that civil code section,subdivision c protects tenants against behaviors that negatively effect,or threaten to effect,their tenancies,whether or not the landlord uses the word eviction.the point,however,is not that vineyard creek never used the actual word eviction,but that the concept of eviction was never communicated.
as to vineyard creek january,letter,morrison points to breithaupt language that an attempt to operate a family child care home out of her apartment would be a breach of the residential agreement and will result in litigation against you.morrison argues the lease agreement states that,upon breach,the owner might terminate the tenant right to possession by lawful means the lawful means for terminating a tenancy is through the unlawful detainer process ergo,the letter threatened eviction.in essence,morrison urges,an attorney statement of his client legal position concerning the interpretation of a lease and the tenant planned activity constitutes actionable retaliation.
morrison position is untenable.the law has not become so far removed from common sense that an owner of residential rental property or his attorney can no longer express his view on the provisions of a lease,and his intent to enforce them,when his tenant plans to do something the owner believes is a breach.this is not actionable retaliation under civil code section,subdivision c.see feldman park lane associates th,threats concerning contemplated unlawful detainer action were privileged and not the proper basis for retaliatory eviction claim feldman.
morrison view of vineyard creek february,letter is also far off the mark.the letter stated that vineyard creek would enjoin morrison from maintaining a family child care home at the vineyard creek apartments and to take whatever steps are necessary to enforce it.italics added.morrison argues that the statement,to take whatever steps are necessary to enforce the injunction threatened to decrease services,the lawful use of her unit.see,subd.c.however,if vineyard creek had obtained an injunction,enforcing the injunction would not diminish the lawful use of her unit,but implement it 
morrison also reminds us that civil code section is a remedial statute aimed at protecting tenants from certain types of abuses and is to be liberally construed to effect its objectives and to suppress,not encourage,the mischief at which it was directed.barela superior court cal d.but the mischief at which the statute was directed certainly was not a landlord attorney expressing an interpretation of a lease to a tenant whom he thinks is about to breach it.see id.at,applied where landlord served a notice to quit and filed an unlawful detainer action after the tenant reported the landlord molestation of the tenant child to police.see also newby alto riviera apartments d,prohibits retaliation against a lessee for the exercise of a lessee rights relating to the fitness of buildings for human occupancy and the lessor duty to repair,disapproved on other grounds by marina point,wolfson cal d,fn.
instructive in this regard is feldman,supra,th,which neither party has cited.there,a property owner filed an unlawful detainer action against its tenant and subtenants.id.at.the subtenants filed a for retaliatory eviction and numerous other causes of action,claiming among other things that the property owner agent had made the following threats before any litigation was actually filed the agent had prosecuted hundreds of evictions,so he knew the landlord would win regardless of the outcome,the subtenants would never be able to rent another apartment in san francisco he knew the law and discussed the case with his uncle,a federal judge and the subtenants would not be able to file a lawsuit because they would not win.id.at.the property owner filed an motion to strike the under code of civil procedure section,on the ground that the arose out of protected first amendment activity and the alleged wrongdoing was protected by the litigation privilege.feldman,supra,at.
the court of appeal in feldman held that the threats by the property owner agent were within the scope of the statute,as communications in connection with an ongoing dispute and in anticipation of litigation.feldman,supra,th at.see code civ,subd.e.the court further held that the alleged threats were absolutely privileged under civil code section,as prelitigation communications relating to litigation that is contemplated in good faith and under serious consideration.feldman,supra,at.the court explained whether taken individually or as a whole,the owner agent statements were clearly connected to and made in anticipation of the eviction action they threatened.whether done maliciously or without reasonable grounds to believe that the subtenants were unlawful occupants of the premises,the statements were privileged.id.at,italics added.the court held that the subtenants retaliatory eviction claim had no merit and was properly stricken,in part because the property owner had not taken any action or made any statements independent of the eviction litigation and the assertion of the right to occupy the apartment,such that all the bases for the retaliation claim were privileged.id.at.
as applied here,feldman teaches that the statements by vineyard creek attorney are not a valid basis for morrison claim under civil code section.morrison had explicitly premised her claim on breithaupt statements in his january and february letters,which threatened to bring legal action for the purpose of enforcing the lease provision at issue or,in morrison view,to evict her.these statements were plainly communications in furtherance of the object of the contemplated litigation.see birkner lam th,landlord service of notice terminating a tenancy,and his refusal to rescind it even after the tenants informed him they constituted a protected household due to their age or disability and length of tenancy,constituted petitioning activity protected by the statute.
in fact,one need look no further than subdivision e of civil code section to understand the point.that provision permits a lessor to recover possession of a dwelling and to do any of the acts described in subdivision c if the notice of termination,rent increase,or other act,and any pleading or statement of issues in an arbitration,if any,states the ground upon which the lessor,in good faith,seeks to recover possession,increase rent,or do any of the other acts described in subdivision c,subd.e,italics added.
vineyard creek letters stated its position whether legally correct or not in good faith.indeed,there is no evidence that vineyard creek acted in bad faith.by morrison own assertion,it was not readily apparent whether the child day care act which at times including in its statement of legislative intent refers to residences applied to dwellings.declarations submitted by morrison in support of her motion for attorney fees indicated there was confusion among landlords over whether the child day care act applied to dwellings,and attorney ramsey of the child care law center had to conduct what she termed exhaustive research into the statutes and their legislative history to resolve this issue of first impression.when vineyard creek learned of the legislative history,it promptly permitted morrison to proceed with her family child care home and offered to compensate her for her loss.
at any rate,morrison insistence that vineyard creek letters should be interpreted to threaten a retaliatory eviction,decrease in services,or other wrongdoing is merely an argument that the trial court should have drawn an alternative inference from the evidence.that does not compel reversal.the appropriate test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason.when two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts,the reviewing court has no authority to substitute its decision for that of the trial court.citations.in re marriage of rosevear th.
the court did not err in denying attorney fees under civil code section.
government code section 
government code section provides that the court may,at its discretion,award the prevailing party reasonable attorney fees and costs in a civil action brought under government code section or for a discriminatory housing practice under feha,subd.a.in her complaint,morrison alleged a discriminatory housing practice prohibited by government code section,contending that vineyard creek discriminated against her based on her source of income.
government code section,subdivision a,makes it unlawful f or the owner of any housing accommodation to discriminate against or harass any person because of the race,color,religion,sex,sexual orientation,marital status,national origin,ancestry,familial status,source of income,or disability of that person.italics added.the legislative purpose behind the inclusion of the source of income language was to curb a growing trend among landlords to refuse to rent to anyone on section housing or evict an existing section tenant because the landlord no longer wanted to accept section vouchers.jud.com,reg,bill,hearing date,april,assem.com.on judiciary,reg,bill,hearing date,july,as amended july.
there is no evidence whatsoever that vineyard creek harassed or discriminated against morrison because the source of her income was going to be a family day care home,as opposed to some other source.
first,vineyard creek objection to morrison running a family day care home was not based on the source of her income,but on the fact that her lease expressly limited her use of the apartment to private residential purposes.similarly,morrison lease with vineyard creek did not preclude any particular source of income,but all nonresidential use of the apartment.vineyard creek cared about how she was going to use the apartment,not where she got the money to pay her rent.in fact,the trial court found,if morrison had stated she wanted to open a free day care home,vineyard creek still would have objected.
second,when morrison applied for the apartment,vineyard creek was aware that morrison primary source of income was from her work as a child care provider as a nanny.vineyard creek nonetheless rented the apartment to her without objecting to that source of income.while working as a nanny may not be the same as operating a family day care home,a trier of fact could reasonably infer from this evidence that vineyard creek had no objection to morrison paying her rent from funds earned in her operations of a family day care home.
third,vineyard creek did not discriminate against morrison based on the type of business she wanted to run out of her apartment,because vineyard creek prohibition was against all nonresidential uses,not just family day care homes.nor is there any evidence whatsoever that vineyard creek put the residential use provision in its lease as a ploy to keep people from opening family day care homes in particular.as the trial court found,no matter what kind of nonresidential use morrison had sought for her apartment,and whether that nonresidential use was for the purpose of generating income or not,vineyard creek would have objected.
morrison argues that a property owner can not engage in discriminatory treatment under the guise of demanding compliance with its own residential rules and regulations.auburn woods i homeowners fair employment housing com.th.but that does not mean that seeking compliance with its own residential rules and regulations establishes unlawful discriminatory treatment.the fact is that vineyard creek was not treating morrison any differently than anyone else because of the way she was going to make money to pay the rent,but because of the way she was going to use her apartment.
lastly,morrison contends the trial court mistakenly thought that government code section banned discrimination based on source of income only with respect to prospective tenants.we disagree with morrison reading of the record.the trial court found there was no discrimination,based on income or otherwise,before the decision to rent to plaintiff,and no discrimination based on source of income.italics added.in any event,substantial evidence supported the conclusion that there was no discrimination under government code section.
the trial court did not err in declining to award morrison attorney fees

in support of her motion,morrison had submitted declarations from four purported expert witnesses,who opined that many landlords in california misinterpret the child day care act and are confused about its application to multifamily dwellings,and the morrison settlement helped tenants protect their rights to provide day care in their homes.one of the declarants stated the settlement in the morrison case positively impacts the family child care providers we regu
