american technologies,ati,appeals from an order denying ati motion to compel arbitration and stay judicial proceedings ati contends federal law governs the arbitration agreement and the trial court therefore lacked discretion under state arbitration law to deny the motion.we agree.
under california law,when a party to an arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending court action with a third party,and there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact,the court has several options.it may refuse to compel arbitration,or it may stay either the arbitration or the court proceeding pending completion of the proceedings in the other forum.code of civ,subd.c section c.under the federal arbitration act,section et.faa,the court only option in these circumstances is to stay the court proceeding and compel the arbitration.
in cronus investments,concierge services cal th,d,cronus,the parties to an arbitration agreement had contracted to utilize california law,but had also agreed the designation of california law would not preclude application of the faa,if it would be applicable.id.at,d.under these contract provisions,our supreme court held section c was not preempted by the faa.cronus reasoned the parties had chosen california law to govern their agreement,the procedural sections of the faa were not applicable,and thus the competing contract provisions were not in conflict.because the parties had made a clear choice of california procedural law to govern their arbitration,volt info.sciences bd.of trustees,d volt controlled.under volt,section c was not otherwise preempted by the procedural sections of the faa.
cronus explained,however,that the parties to an arbitration agreement may expressly designate that any arbitration proceeding should move forward under the faa procedural provisions rather than under state procedural law.cronus,supra,cal th at,d.we hold the parties in the instant case did just that,and accordingly the court erred when it denied ati petition to compel arbitration.
in a single lawsuit,plaintiffs perry rodriguez and kathy rodriquez sued ati for professional negligence,and several insurance companies for breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.the professional negligence cause of action asserted ati was hired by a defendant insurance company to perform remediation and repairs to the insured premises,but ati negligently performed its duties.plaintiffs asserted they were forced to sell their house on an as is basis for a price far below its market value and to dispose of u nsalvageable items of personal property.kathy rodriguez claimed to have suffered illness and personal injury due to exposure to mold and mold contamination.the complaint also alleged the insurance companies refused to pay adequate benefits for water damage and mold contamination under policies covering plaintiffs home and personal property.
ati performed the remediation and repair work on plaintiffs home pursuant to a work proposal and authorization contract which,inter alia,included the following arbitration clause arbitration pursuant to the federal arbitration act,any controversy or claim arising out of or related to this agreement or the breach of any provision thereof shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the construction industry arbitration rules of the american arbitration association currently in effect,unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.although the contract contains references to certain provisions of california law regarding ati lien rights,it contains no express provision designating california law generally,and the american arbitration association construction industry arbitration rules are silent as to the procedure to be followed when related litigation involves third parties.
pursuant to code of civil procedure section et ati petitioned to compel arbitration and stay the judicial proceeding.plaintiffs opposed the motion,relying,inter alia,on section c,and arguing a motion to compel arbitration should be denied when a party to an arbitration agreement is also a party to litigation with a third party that arises out of the same transaction or series of related transactions,and presents a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact.plaintiffs contended arbitration against ati and litigation against the insurers could result in inconsistent rulings on common issues of law and fact.ati responded that the arbitration agreement was governed by the faa,and therefore section c did not apply.the court denied the petition based on section c and whaley sony computer entertainment america,th,d whaley 
discussion 
because the arbitration agreement is governed by federal law,arbitration can not be stayed under section c 
ati contends the parties expressly agreed the faa would govern arbitration of disputes under the contract.ati concludes section c is inapplicable to the contract and the court therefore had no discretion to deny the petition to compel arbitration.for reasons we explain,we agree.
a court order denying arbitration under section c is ordinarily reviewed for abuse of discretion.whaley,supra,th at,d.but the issue presented federal law governs the arbitration a question of law involving interpretation of statutes and the contract with no extrinsic evidence.we therefore apply a de novo standard of review.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d,parsons bristol development cal d.
the faa and section c 
the faa applies to arbitration clauses in contracts involving interstate commerce and was designed to overrule the judiciary refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate,citation,and to place such agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.volt,supra,at.however,the faa purpose is not to provide special status for arbitration agreements,but only to make arbitration agreements as enforceable as other contracts cronus,supra,cal th,d.
section of the faa provides that a written arbitration clause shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.section of the faa mandates that,if suit is brought in a court of the united states upon an issue referable to arbitration,the court must,upon a party application,stay the judicial proceeding until the arbitration is completed.
code of civil procedure section,echoing the faa language and its policy favoring arbitration,likewise provides that a written arbitration agreement is valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.unlike the federal statute,however,california law does not require a court to stay judicial proceedings pending the completion of arbitration in all cases.under section c,if a party to an arbitration agreement is also a party to related litigation with a third party that creates the risk of conflicting rulings on a common issue of law or fact,the court may refuse to enforce the arbitration agreement and may order intervention or joinder of all parties in a single action or special proceeding may order intervention or joinder as to all or only certain issues may order arbitration among the parties who have agreed to arbitration and stay the pending court action or special proceeding pending the outcome of the arbitration proceeding or may stay arbitration pending the outcome of the court action or special proceeding.ibid.thus,while the faa does not deal with the special practical problems that arise in multiparty contractual disputes when some or all of the contracts at issue include agreements to arbitrate,california has taken the lead in fashioning a legislative response to this problem,by giving courts authority to consolidate or stay arbitration proceedings in order to minimize the potential for contradictory judgments.volt,supra,at,fn.
volt,mount diablo,and cronus 
ati cites volt,supra,d,mount diablo medical center health net of california,th,d mount diablo,and cronus,supra,cal th,d,for the proposition that when the parties have expressly chosen the faa to govern their arbitration,and they have not designated any competing state law,the procedural provisions of the faa preempt california arbitration law and render section c inapplicable.
in volt,supra,d,the contract contained a clause providing that t he contract shall be governed by the law of the place where the project is located id.at,california,and an arbitration clause stating claims were to be decided by arbitration in accordance with the construction industry arbitration rules of the american arbitration association.id.at,fn.in litigation involving the parties to the contract and third parties,a california trial court denied a motion to compel arbitration and stayed the arbitration proceedings pursuant to section c.volt,at.the california court of appeal affirmed,holding that by specifying that their contract would be governed by california law,the parties had incorporated the california rules of arbitration,including c,into their arbitration agreement.id.at.the united states supreme court affirmed the california court of appeal.the supreme court held application of the california statute is not by the faa in a case where the parties have agreed that their arbitration agreement will be governed by the law of california.id.at.the supreme court reasoned just as parties may limit by contract the issues which they will arbitrate citation,so too may they specify by contract the rules under which that arbitration will be conducted.where,as here,the parties have agreed to abide by state rules of arbitration,enforcing those rules according to the terms of the agreement is fully consistent with the goals of the faa,even if the result is that arbitration is stayed where the faa would otherwise permit it to go forward.id.at.
in mount diablo,supra,th,d,the contract included a clause specifying the agreement validity,construction,interpretation and enforcement id.at,d were governed by california law,and an arbitration provision requiring controversies were to be resolved by arbitration under the appropriate rules of the american arbitration association.id.at,fn,d.in a lawsuit involving the parties to the contract and third parties,the trial court denied a motion to compel arbitration,relying on volt,supra,d and section c.mount diablo,at,d.affirming the trial court ruling,the court of appeal applied a inquiry asking whether the language was broad enough to include state law on the subject of arbitrability,and if so,whether section c reflected a hostility to the enforcement of arbitration agreements that the faa was designed to overcome.mount diablo,at,d.the mount diablo court answered the first question in the affirmative,interpreting the provision explicit reference to enforcement to reasonably include such matters as whether proceedings to enforce the agreement shall occur in court or before an arbitrator.id.at,d.the court then concluded that section c did not contravene the faa policy favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements section c is not a provision designed to limit the rights of parties who choose to arbitrate or otherwise to discourage the use of arbitration.rather,it is part of california statutory scheme designed to enforce the parties arbitration agreements,as the faa requires.section c addresses the peculiar situation that arises when a controversy also affects claims by or against other parties not bound by the arbitration agreement.the california provision giving the court discretion not to enforce the arbitration agreement under such order to avoid potential inconsistency in outcome as well as duplication of not contravene the letter or the spirit of the faa.mount diablo,at,d.
finally,cronus,supra,cal th,d,involved several contracts whose clauses stated the agreements would be construed and enforced in accordance with california law,without giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions thereof.id.at,d.but the contracts arbitration provisions appeared to limit or condition the choice of california law,specifying that the designation of a situs or specifically a governing law for the contracts did not preclude application of the faa,if it would be applicable.id.at,fn,d.the arbitration clauses further stated arbitration would be conducted under the rules for commercial arbitration of the american arbitration association.ibid.in litigation including involving the parties to the contracts and third parties,the trial court denied a motion to compel arbitration and stayed the arbitration proceedings under section c.cronus,at,d.
the california supreme court affirmed,employing a analysis similar to that employed in mount diablo.under united states supreme court jurisprudence,we examine the language of the contract to determine whether the parties intended to apply the faa to the exclusion of california procedural law and,if any ambiguity exists,to determine whether section c conflicts with or frustrates the objectives of the faa.cronus,supra,cal th at,d.examining the contract language,the court and parties agreed the scope of the clause incorporating california rules was limited by applicable provisions of the faa and was nullified only where the faa provisions are inconsistent with the california arbitration act.id.at,d.having found an ambiguity in the contract as to the parties intentions,the court proceeded to the second prong of the inquiry and examined whether section c conflicts with the faa.
cronus analyzed the faa substantive and procedural provisions separately,and summarized the faa procedural sections as follows section of the faa concerns the enforcement of arbitration agreements in a pending lawsuit.it requires the courts of the united states to grant a party request for a stay of litigation on an arbitrable issue,pending completion of the arbitration.citation.section of the faa concerns petitions for enforcement of an arbitration agreement where one party refuses to arbitrate.it requires a united states district court to entertain an application to compel arbitration.cronus,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
based on the language of the statutes and legislative history,the cronus court concluded the faa procedural provisions generally do not apply to state court proceedings.thus,the court implicitly concluded sections and of the faa were not applicable within the meaning of the contract arbitration clause.the court conclusion was bolstered by the statement of the united states supreme court in volt that w hile we have held the faa substantive provisions and applicable in state as well as federal court citation,we have never held that and,which by their terms appear to apply only to proceedings in federal court citations,are nonetheless applicable in state court.cronus,supra,cal th at,d.cronus noted that in doctor associates,casarotto,d,the united states supreme court had reaffirmed volt distinction between the procedural and substantive aspects of the faa by describing section c as determin ing only the efficient order of proceedings and not affect ing the enforceability of the arbitration agreement itself.cronus,at,d.
turning to the faa substantive provisions,cronus addressed the question whether section c application would undermine and frustrate section policy of enforceability of arbitration agreements.cronus,supra,cal th at,d.cronus quoted volt conclusion that the california arbitration rules generally foster the federal policy favoring arbitration cronus,at,d,and are manifestly designed to encourage resort to the arbitral process.id.at,d.distinguishing mastrobuono,supra,d,the cronus court stated section c is not a special rule limiting the authority of arbitrators,but is instead an evenhanded law that allows the trial court to stay arbitration proceedings while the concurrent lawsuit proceeds or stay the lawsuit while arbitration proceeds to avoid conflicting rulings on common issues of fact and law amongst interrelated parties.cronus,at,d.having found that section c does not conflict with the faa applicable procedural and substantive rules,the cronus court concluded thus,we need not construe any ambiguities as to the scope of the arbitration provision against the application of section c.cronus,at,d.
