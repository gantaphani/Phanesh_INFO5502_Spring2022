the question presented in this case is whether the federal arbitration act faa permits arbitration agreements to override the statutory right to bring representative claims under the labor code private attorneys general act of paga,et we conclude that the faa does not demand enforcement of such an agreement.a plaintiff suing for paga civil penalties is suing as a proxy for the state.a paga claim is necessarily a representative action intended to advance a predominately public purpose.when applied to the paga,a private agreement purporting to waive the right to take representative action is unenforceable because it wholly precludes the exercise of this unwaivable statutory right.at t mobility llc concepcion.concepcion does not require otherwise.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs milton brown and lee moncada were employed by defendant morgan tire auto,llc,doing business as wheel works.both plaintiffs were nonexempt hourly employees.brown was a general automotive service technician who had worked for defendant just under two years.moncada was employed as a head mechanic for nine months.
on july,plaintiffs filed a putative class action lawsuit against defendant alleging violation of californias wage and hour laws.the first amended complaint alleges that defendant did not pay its hourly employees for all hours worked,did not pay overtime,failed to provide meal and rest periods,did not issue complete and accurate wage statements,did not issue pay on time,and delayed final paychecks to discharged employees.plaintiffs also allege one cause of action under the unfair competition law bus,et.plaintiffs seek restitution and damages.in addition,plaintiffs claim civil penalties on behalf of themselves and all other aggrieved employees as allowed by the paga.
in the course of their employment plaintiffs had signed an agreement to be bound by defendant employee dispute resolution plan edrp.the edrp provides that all employment related disputes will be submitted to mediation and arbitration rather than to the courts or to governmental agencies.the edrp further specifies parties to the edrp waive any right they may otherwise have to pursue,file,participate in,or be represented in disputes brought in any court on a class basis or as a collective action or representative action.this waiver applies to any disputes that are covered by the edrp to the full extent such waiver is permitted by law.all disputes subject to the edrp must be mediated and arbitrated as individual claims.the edrp specifically prohibits the mediation or arbitration of any dispute on a class basis or as a collective action or representative action.
notwithstanding the edrp,defendant did not raise arbitration as an affirmative defense in its answer.defendant participated in discovery and negotiated the terms of a stipulated protective order relating to the class members.defendant took the deposition of plaintiff brown.defendant also agreed to produce the names and contact information of all putative class members and agreed to participate in private mediation on a basis.
at the time plaintiffs filed this case,california law made arbitration agreements containing class action waivers unenforceable in virtually all consumer cases.discover bank superior court cal th,discover bank.gentry superior court cal th gentry made class action waivers unenforceable in wage and hour cases if the trial court found that a class action would be more effective in vindicating the employees statutory rights.on april,the united states supreme court filed concepcion,supra,overruling discover bank.although concepcion did not mention gentry,defendant promptly filed a motion to compel arbitration,arguing that concepcion impliedly overruled gentry as well as discover bank.plaintiffs opposed the motion,arguing that defendant had waived its right to arbitrate and,in any event,concepcion did not affect the gentry rule.the superior court concluded that gentry was no longer good law,found that defendant had not waived its right to arbitrate,and granted the motion to compel individual arbitration.plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from that order.
ordinarily,an order compelling arbitration is not appealable and may be reviewed only after the parties complete arbitration and appeal from the judgment.muao grosvenor properties,th.writ relief is available in exceptional circumstances.united firefighters of los angeles city of los angeles d.since plaintiffs arguments involve a rapidly developing area of the law,we notified the parties that we would consider the notice of appeal as a petition for writ of mandate.the matter proceeded as such and we issued an order to show cause.we now conclude that plaintiffs are entitled to some of the relief they requested.
ii.legal framework 
in its most generic form an arbitration agreement merely requires the parties to resolve their disputes by way of arbitration,a process that is intended to be simpler,less formal,and more expeditious than the process of resolving disputes in court.see mitsubishi motors soler chrysler plymouth,mitsubishi.as arbitration agreements have evolved,they have added features to further simplify the process.one such feature is the class action waiver,which typically binds the parties to arbitrate their disputes on an individual basis,prohibiting collective or representative actions.
congress enacted the faa to overcome widespread judicial antipathy to arbitration agreements.concepcion,supra.at.under the faa arbitration agreements must be enforced according to their terms.specifically,the faa provides a written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.the faa reflects both a policy favoring arbitration and fundamental principles of contract.concepcion,supra,at.c ourts must place arbitration agreements on an equal footing with other contracts,citation and enforce them according to their terms.id.the parties agree that the faa applies in this case.
the final phrase of united states code section,the savings clause,permits arbitration agreements to be declared unenforceable upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.this saving clause permits agreements to arbitrate to be invalidated by generally applicable contract defenses,such as fraud,duress,or unconscionability,but not by defenses that apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.concepcion,supra.at.
until,discover bank,supra,cal th at pages through made class action waivers unenforceable if the arbitration agreement of which it is a part is a consumer contract of adhesion,disputes between the parties will likely involve small amounts of damages,and it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money.and gentry,supra,cal th at page,had held that in the case of alleged systematic,labor code violations,a class action waiver may be unenforceable given the existence of specified factors and a trial court conclusion that class arbitration is likely to be a significantly more effective practical means of vindicating the rights of the affected employees than individual litigation or arbitration and that disallowance of the class action will likely lead to a less comprehensive enforcement of overtime laws for the employees alleged to be affected by the employer violations ibid.
this state of the law changed in april,when the united states supreme court filed concepcion,supra.at page,explicitly overruling discover bank.concepcion held that the discover bank rule was preempted by the faa because discover bank stood as an obstacle to the overall purpose of the faa.id.at.notwithstanding the faa savings clause,courts may not invalidate an arbitration agreement based upon generally applicable contract principles,such as unconscionability,if those principles are applied in a fashion that disfavors arbitration.id.at.concepcion reasoned that,despite the discover bank requirements that the case involve a contract of adhesion,modest individual damages,and allegations of cheating,the rule would apply to virtually all consumer arbitration agreements.thus,discover bank effectively inserted,retroactively,the requirement that all consumer arbitration agreements permit arbitration.id.at.arbitration is fundamentally different than individual arbitration because it sacrifices the informality of the arbitration process,requires extensive procedural formality to protect absent class members,and greatly increases the risk to defendants by magnifying the potential liability in proceedings that are largely insulated from judicial review.id.at.thus,requiring the parties to include arbitration in all consumer arbitration agreements discourages,rather than encourages,arbitration as a dispute resolution tool and,unless the parties had agreed to it,arbitration directly conflicts with the requirement that arbitration agreements be enforced as written.accordingly,the discover bank rule is preempted by the faa.ibid.concepcion did not mention gentry.
iii.the questions presented 
since concepcion was decided there has developed a difference of opinion among our courts of appeal as to the effect of that case upon the enforceability of class action waivers in the employment context.see,iskanian cls transportation of los angeles,supra,review granted,concepcion requires enforcement of class action waiver when applied to a paga claim franco arakelian enterprises,review granted,concepcion does not require enforcement of a class action waiver that prohibits recovery under the paga.our supreme court has granted review in several cases to resolve some of these differences.the lead case before the supreme court is iskanian,which the supreme court web site notes as presenting the following issues did concepcion impliedly overrule gentry with respect to contractual class action waivers in the context of labor law rights does the high court decision permit arbitration agreements to override the statutory right to bring representative claims under the paga did defendant waive its right to compel arbitration 
in the present case,plaintiffs do not argue that gentry applies to invalidate the class action waiver here.accordingly,we express no opinion on that issue.plaintiffs do ask us to weigh in on the other two issues before the supreme court 
first,did the defendant waive its right to compel arbitration by failing to move to compel arbitration until after concepcion was decided 
second,does concepcion,supra,permit arbitration agreements to override the statutory right to bring representative claims under the paga 
plaintiffs third issue is not,as of this writing,before the supreme court.that is is the class action waiver preempted by the requirement of the national labor relations act nlra 
discussion 
did defendant waive its contractual right to individual.standard and scope of review 
generally,the determination of waiver is a question of fact,and the trial court finding,if supported by sufficient evidence,is binding on the appellate court.citations.when,however,the facts are undisputed and only one inference may reasonably be drawn,the issue is one of law and the reviewing court is not bound by the trial court ruling.agnes medical center pacificare of california cal th.because the facts in the present case are undisputed,we apply the independent standard of review.
both state and federal law emphasize that no single test delineates the nature of the conduct that will constitute a waiver of arbitration.agnes,supra,cal th at.agnes used,as a guide,a test used by most of the federal circuits to determine whether a party has waived the contractual right to arbitrate.that test requires a court to consider,whether the party actions are inconsistent with the right to arbitrate whether the litigation machinery has been substantially invoked and the parties were well into preparation of a lawsuit before the party notified the opposing party of an intent to arbitrate whether a party either requested arbitration enforcement close to the trial date or delayed for a long period before seeking a stay whether a defendant seeking arbitration filed a counterclaim without asking for a stay of the proceedings whether important intervening steps,taking advantage of judicial discovery procedures not available in arbitration had taken place and whether the delay affected,misled,or prejudiced the opposing party.sobremonte superior court th,quoting peterson,cir.id.at.
defendant argues that since application of the faa involves federal law,the test used by fisher becker paribas cir,is the applicable test.since fisher was decided,however,the ninth circuit has ruled that the determination of whether a party has waived the contractual right to arbitrate is a question of state law.cox ocean view hotel cir.accordingly,we apply the agnes analysis.
ii.acts inconsistent with right to compel arbitration 
the edrp purports to require plaintiffs to individually arbitrate their wage and hour claims.nevertheless,defendant actively litigated this case for months before mentioning arbitration.indeed,defendant engaged in discovery and even agreed to produce the names and contact information for members of the putative class and to participate in mediation.plaintiffs maintain that these are acts inconsistent with the right to compel arbitration.defendant argues that until concepcion was decided,the courts of this state had held that class action waivers like the one contained in the edrp were unenforceable.since the edrp gave the right to individual arbitration only as permitted by law,defendant reasonably believed it had no right to individual arbitration and any motion to enforce such a right would have been futile.concepcion represented a change in the law that gave defendant an argument that the edrp was enforceable according to its terms.
plaintiffs argue that this case is like roberts el cajon motors,th roberts or lewis fletcher jones motor cars,th lewis,in which the appellate courts rejected the defendants argument that they delayed compelling arbitration because of a concern about enforceability that was cleared up by concepcion.neither case is on point.roberts rejected the argument because concepcion was decided more than a year after the defendant filed its motion to compel arbitration.roberts,supra,at,fn.that is,there had not yet been any change in the law when the defendant filed its tardy motion to compel arbitration.
in lewis,the defendant had delayed filing a motion to compel arbitration until after concepcion was filed.according to the defendant,that was because it believed the discover bank rule made the arbitration agreement unenforceable.but as the appellate court pointed out,the plaintiff had not filed a class action.in other words,discover bank was inapplicable to the action even before concepcion overturned it.lewis,supra,th at.
plaintiffs also argue that defendant can not claim a motion to compel individual arbitration would necessarily have been futile prior to concepcion.plaintiffs point out that,because gentry is not a categorical prohibition of class action waivers,there was some chance that defendant could have convinced a court to enforce the edrp as written even before concepcion was filed.under gentry,in deciding whether to enforce a class arbitration waiver,a trial court must consider whether the potential for individual recovery would be modest,the possibility class members might suffer retaliation,the possibility that absent class members would be ill informed about their rights,and other real world obstacles to vindicating the employees rights in individual arbitration.if,based upon these factors,the trial court concludes that class arbitration is likely to be significantly more effective than individual actions in vindicating the employees rights and that disallowing a class action would likely lead to a less comprehensive enforcement of overtime laws the court must invalidate the class arbitration waiver.gentry,supra,cal th at.given the breadth of the gentry rule and the nature of the claims raised here,it was reasonable for defendant to believe,prior to concepcion,that a motion to compel individual arbitration was likely to fail.quevedo macy,d,quevedo,is precisely on point.
quevedo was filed in march as a wage and hour case against the defendant,macy.the macy employment agreement contained an arbitration clause and a waiver.however,i n light of gentry,macy reasonably concluded that it could not enforce the class action waiver in its arbitration agreement and did not move to compel arbitration until after concepcion was decided.quevedo,supra,d at.macy could have insisted upon arbitration but under gentry,class arbitration was all but inevitable.a right to defend against an individual claims in arbitration meaningfully differs from a right to defend against class and collective claims in arbitration if macy waived any right,it was the right to defend against quevedo class and collective claims in arbitration,citing concepcion,supra.at.accordingly,the court held that macy conduct was not inconsistent with a right to individual arbitration.quevedo,supra,at.the present case is factually indistinct from quevedo.we find that court reasoning to be sound and apply it to the present matter.
iii.participation in to plaintiffs 
factors two through five of the agnes test are related to the extent of the party participation in the judicial litigation.as to the sixth factor,prejudice,our courts will not find prejudice where the party opposing arbitration shows only that it incurred court costs and legal expenses.agnes,supra,cal th at.we assess prejudice in light of california strong public policy favoring arbitration.id.at,citing,moncharsh heily blase cal th.prejudice typically is found only where the petitioning party conduct has substantially undermined this important public policy or substantially impaired the other side ability to take advantage of the benefits and efficiencies of arbitration.agnes,supra,at.prejudice may be found where the petitioning party used the judicial process to gain information it could not have gained in arbitration,waited until the eve of trial to seek arbitration,or delayed so long that evidence was lost.ibid.
in this case,defendant participated in the class litigation to the extent necessary to defend the suit.in light of gentry,supra,cal th,it was reasonable for defendant to believe that it did not have the right to enforce the individual arbitration described in the edrp and,therefore,it would have been unreasonable to expect it to refrain from participating in the judicial process altogether.once the law changed,defendant did not delay in seeking to compel arbitration.defendant motion to compel arbitration was filed on may,only days after concepcion was filed,and roughly months after the court litigation had commenced.the rapidity with which defendant sought to enforce the arbitration agreement following the concepcion decision indicates that defendant was not involved in the litigation in order to take advantage of the judicial process prior to demanding arbitration.
plaintiffs argue that defendant propounded more discovery than may have been allowed by an arbitrator but plaintiffs have not shown how that additional discovery yielded information that defendant could not have obtained in the course of an arbitration.plaintiffs do not allege that any evidence has been lost by the month delay.nor is there any claim that defendant actions have impaired plaintiffs ability to have their individual disputes resolved fairly through arbitration.that is,plaintiffs have not been prejudiced.
we conclude that defendant did not waive or abandon its right to enforce the edrp.
the nlra does not make the class action waiver unenforceable 
on the merits,we first consider plaintiffs argument that the faa does not require enforcement of the class action waiver because that would impermissibly interfere with their rights to collective action granted by the nlra.the nlra makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to interfere with an employee right to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.plaintiffs urge us to adopt the position taken by the national labor relations board nlrb in horton,nlrb nlrb lexis,which held that a mandatory arbitration agreement prohibiting resolution of any disputes on a class or representative basis was a violation of the nlra.
horton is not binding precedent.although the nlrb construction of the nlra is entitled to great deference,the same deference is not accorded to the nlrb interpretation of either the faa or supreme court precedent.owen bristol care,cir.the question is one of statutory interpretation we apply the de novo standard of review.burden snowden cal th.
under the faa,courts must enforce agreements to arbitrate according to their terms even when the claims at issue are federal statutory claims,unless the faa mandate has been overridden by a contrary congressional command.compucredit greenwood,quoting express mcmahon.
we find no congressional command in the nlra that would preclude application of the faa.two california appellate courts have reached the same result.truly nolen of america superior court th,nelsen legacy partners residential,th.federal district courts in the ninth circuit are in accord.see morvant chang china bistro,d,jasso money mart express,d,t here is no language in the nlra or in the related norris laguardia act demonstrating that congress intended the employee concerted action rights therein to override the mandate of the faa.we join our state and federal colleagues in rejecting the argument.
the class action waiver is unenforceable as applied to the paga claim 
introduction 
we now turn to plaintiffs argument that the class action waiver is unenforceable as applied to the paga claim.plaintiffs urge us to follow brown ralphs grocery th,brown,which held that the faa did not require enforcement of an arbitration agreement that prevented an employee from acting as a private attorney general under the paga.defendant argues that brown was wrongly decided and the reasoning of concepcion,supra.makes the instant agreement enforceable even to the extent it prevents plaintiffs from pursuing a representative paga action.because there are no undisputed facts,the question is one of law calling for our de novo review.turtle ridge media group,pacific bell directory th.
ii.analysis 
the paga provides that any section of the labor code calling for a civil penalty to be assessed and collected by the labor and workforce development agency lwda may,as an alternative,be recovered through a civil action brought by an aggrieved employee,subd.a.for those labor code sections without a specified civil penalty,the paga establishes a default penalty and allows an aggrieved employee to bring a civil action to enforce that penalty,as well.id.subds.f,g.in either case,the statute describes the private action as one brought by an aggrieved employee on behalf of himself or herself and other current or former employees id.subds.a,g.as our supreme court has explained,an employee plaintiff suing under the paga does so as the proxy or agent of the state labor law enforcement agencies.the act declared purpose is to supplement enforcement actions by public agencies,which lack adequate resources to bring all such actions themselves.arias superior court cal th,arias.indeed,the individual employee suing for paga penalties recovers only a fraction of the penalty assessed.percent of the penalty goes to the lwda and percent to the aggrieved employees,subd.i.
as we explained above,concepcion clarified that,although the faa savings clause allows arbitration agreements to be invalidated for the same reasons any other contract may be invalidated,general contract principles can not be used in a way that disfavors arbitration.concepcion,supra.at.concepcion overturned the discover bank rule because discover bank effectively required all consumer arbitration agreements to include the option of class arbitration and,since class arbitration is m
