bauer mechanical,bauer filed a complaint in illinois state court seeking to vacate an award issued by an arbitration board pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement.the defendants,chicago journeymen plumbers local union,the union removed the case to the united states district court for the northern district of illinois and subsequently moved to file instanter an answer and,along with intervening counterplaintiffs,a counterclaim to enforce the arbitration board ruling.both the answer and counterclaim were attached to the motion for leave to file instanter.bauer did not reply to the counterclaim because,it contends,the pleadings were not properly filed.the district court entered a default judgment against bauer for the amount stipulated by the arbitration board,plus interest,and also awarded attorneys fees.we conclude that the answer and counterclaim were properly filed and the federal rules of civil procedure do not prohibit a court from accepting pleadings attached to motions.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
bauer is an illinois plumbing contractor and a successor to hausman plumbing heating company hausman.the joint arbitration board of the plumbing contractors association and chicago journeymen plumbers local union the board is an arbitral tribunal established pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement and is authorized to enforce the agreement in disputes between the parties.chicago journeymen plumbers local union,and hausman were among the parties that entered into a collective bargaining agreement in effect from june,through may.this agreement became binding upon bauer as hausman successor.
on may,upon charges filed by the union,the board found that hausman violated the collective bargaining agreement by failing to make payments for unreported hours worked by licensed journeymen,and by permitting employees other than licensed journeymen or apprentice plumbers to perform work within the union jurisdiction.the board ordered bauer,as hausman successor,to pay in contributions and fines and in interest,divided among the various union benefit funds and the plumbing council of chicagoland the board also set an interest penalty of per month until bauer paid the award in full.
on february,bauer filed a complaint in the circuit court of cook county,illinois seeking to vacate modify the arbitration award and naming the union,the board,and the plumbing contractors association as defendants.the defendants filed a notice of removal on march,and removed this action to the united states district court for the northern district of illinois.on april,the defendants filed a motion to dismiss,which the court granted as to all defendants except for the union.the union then filed a motion for leave to file instanter an answer to bauer complaint and,along with other arbitration award recipients hereinafter counterplaintiffs,a counterclaim to enforce the arbitration award the answer and counterclaim were attached to the motion for leave to file instanter and the district court accepted the pleadings after it granted the motion on may.
on august,after receiving no response to their counterclaim,the counterplaintiffs filed a motion for entry of judgment.at the hearing,bauer argued that the pleadings attached to the motion were not properly filed.the district court resolved the issue by recognizing the pleadings and granted bauer a extension to respond to the counterclaims.on september,bauer filed a response in opposition to the motion for entry of judgment,essentially restating the argument it had presented at the previous the counterclaim was not properly filed.bauer response,however,did not address the merits of the counterclaim.as a result,the district court granted the counterplaintiffs motion for entry of judgment on september,and awarded them,which included the arbitration award plus interest.bauer filed a motion to vacate judgment,which the district court denied on october,and bauer filed its first notice of appeal on october.the union and the other counterplaintiffs also filed a motion for fees and expenses under the employee retirement income security act erisa,g d,and the district court awarded in fees and in expenses.
on january,the union filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on bauer complaint,which sought to vacate modify the arbitration award.bauer did not appear at the hearing and,on february,the district court issued an order dismissing bauer complaint.the court also declared all judgments including the court september,ruling granting the union motion for entry of judgment on its counterclaim final and appealable.bauer filed a second notice of appeal on march,from the district court february,order entered on february,dismissing its complaint.
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction 
before reaching the merits,we must determine whether this court has jurisdiction to address bauer appeal from the district court september order enforcing the arbitration award.the union asserts that this ruling was not a final judgment and that bauer notice of appeal had no effect.
the district court proceedings shed light on some of the confusion surrounding this issue.the parties presented three primary claims before the court bauer complaint,which sought to vacate the arbitration board ruling at least as it applied to bauer the union and other counterplaintiffs counterclaim,which sought to enforce the arbitration award and the counterplaintiffs motion for attorneys fees and expenses.
the union argues that bauer october,notice of appeal was premature and therefore ineffective.under,we have jurisdiction to hear appeals from final decisions of district courts.this includes final judgments entered under rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,interlocutory decisions certified for appeal under rule b,or decisions that otherwise end the litigation on the merits and leave nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.adams lever,cir citation omitted.neither party disputes that the district court entered a final judgment on february.and under rule a a of the federal rules of appellate procedure,the appellant must file a notice of appeal within days of the entry of judgment.the complication here is that bauer filed its notice of appeal from the ruling enforcing the arbitration award on october,several months before the final judgment.so the question is whether bauer premature notice of appeal springs into effect after the entry of the final judgment.
rule a of the federal rules of appellate procedure permits a notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision,but before the entry of judgment,to be treated as filed on the date of the final judgment.here,bauer and the union had asserted competing claims the union sought to enforce the arbitration board ruling,and bauer sought to vacate the same.the september ruling in the union favor essentially foreclosed any relief on bauer complaint therefore,bauer belief that the order also disposed of its claims was reasonable.and since there were no remaining issues to decide,the premature notice of appeal springs forward to the date of the final judgment entered on february.see firstier mortg.investors mortg.ins,d recognizing that rule a was intended to protect the unskilled litigant who files a notice of appeal from a decision that he reasonably but mistakenly believes to be a final judgment emphasis added garwood packaging,allen,cir recognizing a premature notice of appeal from a judgment that had yet to dismiss one of the parties to the suit.therefore,this court has jurisdiction to consider all of the issues raised by bauer.
b.the union answer and counterclaim were properly filed 
bauer argues that the district court improperly granted the counterplaintiffs motion for judgment on the counterclaim because,it contends,federal courts can not recognize pleadings attached to motions.as a result,bauer maintains that it was never required to respond to the counterclaim.
bauer suggests that the crux of this issue lies in rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,which provides a conclusive list of pleadings,and rule,which states that a copy of any written instrument which is
