this appeal from the denial of a motion to compel arbitration presents the question whether the board of trustees of the city of delray beach police and firefighters retirement system agreed to arbitrate a dispute arising under its consulting contract with citigroup global markets,which helped the board evaluate the performance of several investment managers of pension funds the board oversees.the board complained that citigroup abused its position as pension consultant when it provided erroneous reports about the performance of the investment managers of the fund,recommended investment managers who would agree to place trades through citigroup,and engaged in transactions with assets of the fund.citigroup moved to compel arbitration on the ground that william adams,the chairman of the board,had bound the board to arbitrate any dispute with citigroup when he signed several account agreements through which one of the investment managers of the fund could buy and sell securities.those account agreements required arbitration of disputes under those and any other agreement between citigroup and the board.the board argued that adams had no authority to bind the board to arbitrate disputes under the consulting contract,and citigroup responded that adams had both implied actual authority and apparent authority to bind the board.the district court agreed with the board,held that adams had no authority to bind the board to arbitrate,and denied the motion to compel arbitration.because we conclude that adams had implied actual authority to bind the board to arbitrate disputes arising under the consulting contract,we reverse and remand with instructions.
background 
we divide our discussion of the background of this appeal into three parts.first,we describe the decisions of the board to hire citigroup as its pension consultant and to delegate to adams the authority to execute the account agreements.second,we describe the lawsuit that the board filed against citigroup.third,we describe the motion of citigroup to compel arbitration and the decision of the district court to deny that motion.
a.the hiring of citigroup and execution of the account agreements 
the board manages a pension trust fund for the benefit of the firefighters and police officers of delray beach,florida.see.stat,delray beach,code of ordinances ch.as the manager of the fund,the board hires professional investment managers to select investments for the fund.by law,the board must retain a professionally qualified independent consultant who shall evaluate the performance of any existing professional money manager and shall make recommendations to the board of trustees regarding the selection of money managers for the next investment term.stat.a,a.
in october,the board hired citigroup formerly salomon smith barney as its pension consultant.the parties signed a pension consultant contract,which required citigroup to report each quarter about the performance of the professional investment managers who made investments on behalf of the fund.the consulting contract required citigroup to compute the quarterly and annual performance of the total fund and individual managers on no less than a quarterly basis attend quarterly meetings attend special meetings and provide additional services agreed upon.the parties signed a materially similar contract in december.when that contract expired in,the parties,according to the complaint,continued their relationship without a written contract,orally agreeing to operate on the same terms previously agreed upon.
the board approved the consulting contract after consideration by the full board.the board discussed key provisions of the consulting contract,submitted the consulting contract to outside counsel stephen cypen for review and approval,and approved the consulting contract by a vote of the majority of the board.the board contends that,during negotiations of the consulting contract,the board expressly refused to agree to arbitrate disputes under the consulting contract,but citigroup denies that allegation.even so,the final consulting contract did not contain an arbitration clause.the consulting contract provided,any changes to this agreement requested either by the consultant or the board may only be effected if mutually agreed upon in writing by duly authorized representatives of the parties hereto.it continued,this agreement shall not be modified or amended or any rights of a party to it waived except by such a writing.
at a meeting in november,the board decided to hire nwq investments as an investment manager.as the minutes from that meeting reflect,the board agreed that once cypen has approved the nwq contract,chief adams,chairman,be given the authority to execute the contract on behalf of the.cypen approved the nwq contract and adams signed an agreement with nwq.according to citigroup,the board needed to open an investment account through which nwq could invest assets of the fund on behalf of the board and,although the board could have opened this account with any institution,the board chose to open it with citigroup.on december,adams executed several documents to open this account.in october,adams signed several similar documents to open a similar account,also with citigroup,for another investment manager of the board.
the account agreements contain a broad arbitration clause.above the signature block,the account agreements state,i acknowledge that i have received the client agreement which contains a arbitration clause.the client agreement,in turn,contains a clause that requires arbitration of all claims or controversies,whether such claims or controversies arose prior,on or subsequent to the date hereof,between me and citigroup.the client agreement requires arbitration of disputes concerning or arising from the construction,performance or breach of this or any other agreement between us.
lawsuit against citigroup 
in november,the board sued citigroup in a florida court.the complaint stated four claims.each claim alleged misconduct by citigroup as pension consultant to the board.
count one alleged that citigroup breached the consulting contract by failing to provide the services for which it was paid.citigroup computed the performance of the fund and the investment managers gross of fees,rather than net of fees,and repeatedly submitted false and misleading information to the board concerning matters relevant to evaluating the fund investment performance.the complaint alleged,these matters included,without limitation,the actual rate of return on the fund investments as compared with a purportedly appropriate benchmark rate of return,and the amount of appreciation in the fund securities portfolio.the complaint requested compensatory damages on the ground that the board paid for services never performed and that if the board had been aware of the real performance of the pension fund,it would have terminated citigroup,hired a new consultant,and achieved a better rate of return.moreover,the complaint alleged that citigroup utilized its position as pension consultant to engage in transactions involving fund assets through which it was able to obtain much larger compensation from its relationship with the board and the fund than the amount to which it was entitled under the consulting contract.
count two alleged breach of fiduciary duty.it alleged that a fiduciary relationship existed between citigroup and the board because citigroup induced the board to place its trust and confidence in citigroup,and citigroup assumed a role of superiority in its relationship to the board with respect to the areas of its purported expertise and exerted influence over the board.the board alleged that citigroup breached its duties as fiduciary by,among other things,repeatedly misleading the board about the performance of its investments and recommending that it hire investment managers who citigroup knew would agree to run securities trades through it as broker so that it could earn commissions.the complaint also alleged that citigroup breached its fiduciary obligations by repeatedly entering into fixed income and equity trades with the fund for its own account without disclosing to the board that it was trading as a principal,earning undisclosed profits from those trades,and periodically failing to provide these trades to the fund at current market rates.additionally,citigroup directed certain of the fund investment managers to run all their portfolio trading for the fund through citigroup without board approval.the complaint again requested compensatory damages.
count three alleged fraud.the complaint alleged that citigroup made false statements to the board concerning the performance of the pension fund by,for example,reporting performance gross of fees and overstating the appreciation of the fund investment portfolio over a period.it also alleged that citigroup produced false and misleading quarterly and annual reports on which the board relied in deciding to retain citigroup as consultant and to retain various of its investment managers as managers of the assets of the fund.it also alleged that citigroup fraudulently induced the board to hire investment managers that would run trades through citigroup as broker.the complaint requested compensatory damages.
finally,count four alleged negligent misrepresentation.the board alleged that citigroup negligently submitted inaccurate reports about the performance of the pension fund by reporting returns gross of fees,not net of fees as required by florida law misrepresenting the actual performance of the pension fund and misrepresenting the appreciation of the assets of the fund.the complaint again sought compensatory damages on the ground that the negligence of citigroup caused the board to retain an ineffective pension consultant and investment managers that were underperforming the market.
motion to compel arbitration 
in december,citigroup removed the action to federal court,and promptly moved to compel arbitration.it relied on the arbitration clause contained in the account agreements that adams signed in connection with the hiring of nwq as an investment manager.the motion to compel arbitration recounted the facts that we have described and stated that i n connection with its relationship with citigroup,the board opened investment accounts with citigroup in which the fixed income and equity securities transactions the board now complains about were executed on behalf of the fund.citigroup also stated that,when opening these accounts,the board entered into client agreements which contain broadly worded arbitration provisions that clearly encompass the claims asserted by the board in this action.citigroup argued that the broad arbitration clause covered the claims of the board because they concern or arise from accounts the board maintained with citigroup,transactions involving citigroup,the performance or breach of the board agreements with citigroup,and alleged duties arising from the business of citigroup.
the board argued that it never agreed to arbitrate disputes under the consulting contract.the board argued that adams lacked actual authority to agree to arbitrate claims arising under the consulting contract because the board had never voted to give him that authority.it argued that florida law requires all acts and decisions of the board to be effectuated by vote of a majority of the members of the board.stat,and it observed that the board never voted to modify or amend the pension consultant contracts by adding an arbitration clause to them and that the consulting contract stated that it could not be modified except in writing by duly authorized representatives of the parties.the board also argued that adams did not have apparent authority to subject claims under the consulting contract to arbitration because the board did nothing at all to suggest to citigroup that adams had any authority to modify the consulting contract.the board argued,rather than causing citigroup to believe that adams was authorized to amend the pension consultant agreements,the board included citigroup in the very meetings that confirmed that adams was not so authorized.according to the board,because citigroup representatives attended the meetings at which the full board debated the substance of the consulting contract,agreed to submit a draft of the consulting contract to outside counsel for approval,and then approved the final consulting contract by majority vote,citigroup knew that the board would not have given adams the authority to alter the consulting contract by executing the separate nwq contract.the board further argued that the customary practice of citigroup of alerting adams to the need for board or outside counsel review of substantive documents that required adams signature supported a ruling that citigroup could not have reasonably thought that adams could amend the consulting contract without involving the board.
the district court denied the motion to compel arbitration.the district court considered whether adams had actual authority to execute the account agreements that contained the arbitration clause instead of whether he had actual authority to bind the board to arbitrate disputes under the consulting contract.the district court stated that it had located no florida case in which a member of the board of a police or firefighter pension trust fund was able to bind the board via unilateral action.it concluded,absent any authority that would allow this court to overlook application of the previously cited florida statutes stating that the board acts through majority vote,the court concludes that adams lacked actual authority to execute the account agreements.the district court also held that adams lacked apparent authority to execute the account agreements.the court held that g iven citigroup presence at the previously mentioned board meetings,citigroup knew that adams could not sign the account agreements without approval of the board and its counsel.alternatively,the district court held that,even if adams had apparent authority to sign the account agreements because the board held him out as having that authority,the florida laws that provide that the board manages the pension fund by majority vote prevent the operation of ordinary principles of agency.
ii.standard of review 
we review the denial of a motion to compel arbitration de novo.becker davis,cir.
iii.discussion 
we divide our discussion into two parts.first,we explain that florida law permitted the board to delegate to adams authority to bind it to arbitrate disputes under the consulting contract.second,we explain that adams possessed implied actual authority to bind the board to arbitrate disputes under the consulting contract.
florida law permitted the board to delegate to adams the authority to bind the board to arbitration under the consulting contract.
citigroup contends that ordinary principles of administrative law permit the board to delegate to adams,its agent,the authority to bind the board to arbitrate disputes under the consulting contract.the board disagrees,and advances a related argument that the florida sunshine law.stat,prevented the board from delegating authority because,under that law,all decisions affecting the board must be made at a public meeting.we agree with the argument of citigroup that florida law permitted the board to delegate to adams the authority to agree to arbitrate disputes under the consulting contract.
citigroup argues persuasively that general principles of administrative law govern the board,which is a municipal agency those general principles of administrative law permit delegation and because no florida law prohibits the sort of delegation at issue,the board could delegate its authority.the board has offered no reason to doubt this argument about florida law.schlosser sch.bd.of fairfax,cir holding that agent could not bind board to arbitrate because state law affirmatively prohibited arbitration morgan bend cmty.sch,cir holding that state law affirmatively required full board to approve employment contracts so superintendent modification was invalid.delray beach municipal law does not prohibit delegation.it instead permits the board to hire and appoint those persons,agents or entities as in its discretion may be required or advisable to enable it
