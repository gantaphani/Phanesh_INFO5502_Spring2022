dean witter reynolds,brought this action seeking to enjoin respondent appellee karen howsam from arbitrating a dispute between dean witter and howsam with the national association of securities dealers nasd on the ground that the dispute was under nasd rules.the district court concluded that the parties,in a access client service agreement,had clearly and unmistakably agreed that all disputes between the parties,including questions regarding the arbitrability of those disputes,would be determined by an arbitrator rather than by the courts.the district court thus dismissed dean witter cause of action.exercising jurisdiction pursuant to,we conclude that the district court erred in finding that the parties clearly and unmistakably agreed to allow an arbitrator,rather than the courts,to decide whether specific disputes are arbitrable.we therefore reverse the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
background 
karen howsam howsam was a customer of dean witter reynolds,dean witter in march and april,at which time she was advised by dean witter,through two of its brokers,robert howard and paul siler,to invest in a total of four limited partnerships.howsam remained invested in those limited partnerships,allegedly due to the ongoing advice of dean witter,until late,at which point she closed her dean witter accounts and moved her funds to another investment firm.
during the period when howsam was a customer of dean witter,howsam entered into a standard access client service agreement access agreement.the access agreement,which was drafted by dean witter and signed by both howsam and a dean witter representative,stated 
the client agrees that all controversies between the client and dean witter any of its officers,directors,or employees,present or former,concerning or arising from i any account maintained with dean witter by client ii any transaction involving dean witter and client,whether or not such transaction occurred in such account or accounts or iii the construction,performance or breach of this or any other agreement between us,whether such controversy arose prior to,on or subsequent to the date hereof,shall be determined by arbitration before any organization or exchange of which dean witter is a member.the client may elect which of these arbitration forums shall hear the matter 
additionally,the access agreement contained a provision specifying that the agreement would be construed and enforced in accordance with new york state law without reference to choice of law doctrine.
pursuant to the terms of the access agreement,on march,howsam commenced an arbitration proceeding before the nasd regarding dean witter recommendation that she invest in the four limited partnerships.howsam filed an amended arbitration claim on april.in the amended claim,howsam alleged that dean witter,through its agents howard and siler,made material misrepresentations about the investments prior to her decision to purchase them,and that the investments were unsuitable for someone with her investment needs.howsam further alleged that dean witter,again through its agents,continued to inform her that the investments were sound,despite indications to the contrary,which impeded her understanding of the true nature of the investments until late.
in order to commence the arbitration before the nasd,howsam executed a uniform submission agreement submission agreement,as required by the nasd.the submission agreement stated that howsam agreed to submit her claims to the nasd with the understanding that the arbitration would be conducted in accordance with the rules and provisions of the nasd.specifically,the submission agreement stated 
the undersigned parties hereby submit the present matter in controversy,as set forth in the attached statement of claim,to arbitration in accordance with the constitution,by laws,rules,regulations,code of arbitration procedure of the sponsoring organization.
the submission agreement contained another provision asserting,the undersigned parties hereby state that they have read the procedures and rules of the sponsoring organization relating to arbitration.although only howsam signed the submission agreement,dean witter had effectively agreed to the submission agreement when,in the access agreement,it gave howsam the power to select the particular arbitration forum that would hear any dispute arising between the parties.
the nasd code of arbitration procedure nasd code contains a provision stating that n o dispute,claim or controversy shall be eligible for submission to arbitration under this code where six years have elapsed from the occurrence or event giving rise to the act or dispute,claim or controversy.see nasd code formerly nasd code based upon this provision in the nasd code,dean witter and howard,who was later dismissed from the filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of colorado,requesting declaratory relief in the form of a court determination that howsam claims were untimely and thus by the nasd,as well as an order enjoining the nasd arbitration proceeding pending resolution of dean witter claim.dean witter asserted that the question of arbitrability of howsam claims was for the court,and not for nasd arbitrators,to decide.
in response,howsam filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction motion.in the motion,howsam argued that the district court lacked jurisdiction to decide the issue of arbitrability because the parties,in the form of the access agreement,had agreed that all issues concerning or arising from dean witter services would be submitted to arbitration.additionally,howsam argued that the access agreement choice of law provision,which specified that new york state law would govern any dispute between the parties,required that nasd arbitrators,and not the district court,determine whether howsam claims were arbitrable because a claim arbitrability under of the nasd code is a question reserved for arbitrators under new york state law.
dean witter countered by arguing that,because howsam had not contested dean witter asserted basis for subject matter jurisdiction,diversity of citizenship,her motion arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction and that the complaint should be dismissed pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b was effectively a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under rule b.because the motion was more properly characterized as a motion to dismiss under rule b,dean witter argued,the district court should not consider the access agreement because it was not attached to or referenced in dean witter complaint.dean witter further argued that,even if the court were to look to the access agreement,it did not provide clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties agreed to submit the question of arbitrability to the chosen arbitration organization.
the district court granted howsam motion on june.the district court analyzed the language of the access agreement without referencing the submission agreement and concluded that its language provided clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties intended to submit all issues,including the issue of arbitrability,to the chosen arbitration body.see dean witter reynolds,howsam,slip op.at.june.
on appeal,dean witter argues,first,that the district court erred in looking to the access agreement because howsam motion was,in effect,a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b and,since dean witter never referenced the access agreement in its complaint,the access agreement was not properly before the court.second,dean witter argues that,regardless of whether the access agreement could potentially be reviewed by the court,that agreement was superceded by the submission agreement and thus was no longer the controlling agreement between the parties.third,dean witter asserts that,even if we find the district court review of the access agreement appropriate,that agreement does not clearly and unmistakably demonstrate that the parties agreed to have the question of arbitrability of any given dispute decided by an arbitrator rather than the courts.
discussion 
standard of review 
we have stated,because it is based on contract interpretation,arbitrability is a legal question that we review de novo.cogswell merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.district court determinations regarding subject matter jurisdiction are reviewed de novo.see hart dep t of labor ex rel.united states,cir.because this appeal arises from a motion to dismiss,we accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true,and view them in the light most favorable to the party.see prager lafaver,cir.
a.the district court properly reviewed the access agreement when deciding howsam motion to dismiss 
dean witter argues that the district court erred in treating howsam motion as a b motion rather than a rule b motion.that distinction is important because the district court looked outside the confines of dean witter complaint,to the access agreement,when deciding howsam motion,and generally courts should not look beyond the confines of the complaint itself when deciding a rule b motion to dismiss.without deciding whether the district court erred in treating howsam motion as a rule b motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,we hold that even if the district court had treated howsam motion as a rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim it still could have properly considered the language of the access agreement.therefore,any error that may have occurred when the district court characterized howsam motion as a rule b motion is harmless to this case.
it is permissible for a court to look beyond the four corners of the complaint when deciding a rule b motion to dismiss,see pringle united states,cir,but it is generally unacceptable for a court to do so when deciding a rule b motion to dismiss,see jackson integra,cir stating that a court must examine only the plaintiff complaint and can not review matters outside of the complaint when deciding a rule b motion.if the court on a rule b motion looks to matters outside the complaint,the court generally must convert the rule b motion into a rule motion for summary judgment.see fed.civ.c if,on a motion for judgment on the pleadings,matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court,the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in federal rule of civil procedure,and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by rule.
it is debatable whether the district court erred in deciding howsam motion under rule b rather than rule b.we need not resolve that issue in this case,however,because the district court was justified in looking to the access agreement in any event.it is accepted practice that,if a plaintiff does not incorporate by reference or attach a document to its complaint,but the document is referred to in the complaint and is central to the plaintiff claim,a defendant may submit an indisputably authentic copy to the court to be considered on a motion to dismiss.gff associated wholesale grocers,cir see also brooks blue cross blue shield of,cir w here the plaintiff refers to certain documents in the complaint and those documents are central to the plaintiff claim,the court may consider the documents part of the pleadings for purposes of rule b dismissal,and the defendant attaching such documents to the motion to dismiss will not require conversion of the motion into a motion for summary judgment.citing venture zenith data,cir.if the rule were otherwise,a plaintiff with a deficient claim could survive a motion to dismiss simply by not attaching a dispositive document upon which the plaintiff relied.see gff,at.
dean witter asserts that it did not reference the access agreement in its complaint.we disagree.in its complaint,dean witter stated dean witter and defendants are parties to an arbitration agreement.consistent with that agreement,defendants filed their arbitration with the nasd.the parties have presented only two arbitration agreements in this case the access agreement and the submission agreement.thus,the reference by dean witter to an arbitration agreement must be to the access agreement.the decision to commence arbitration before the nasd was consistent only with that agreement,which required howsam to submit all controversies to arbitration by the nasd or another arbitration body of which dean witter was a member.the submission agreement,on the other hand,was part of the submission of howsam claims to the nasd and it would make little sense for dean witter to allege that the act of submitting the submission agreement was consistent with itself.in addition,the submission agreement is referenced by another name in the following paragraph.see complaint at the time defendants filed their original statement of claim with the nasd,they also signed a uniform submission agreement emphasis added.we therefore find that dean witter did reference the access agreement,albeit minimally,in their initial filing with the district court.
the access agreement was the arbitration agreement pursuant to which howsam was obligated to submit her claims to binding arbitration by the nasd or another arbitration association of which dean witter was a member,and was therefore clearly central nigh indispensable to deciding the parties claims.accordingly,howsam brought the access agreement to the district court attention by discussing it in,and attaching it to,her motion to dismiss.dean witter has never argued that the copy of the access agreement attached to howsam motion was not a true and complete copy of the original arbitration agreement between the parties.under these circumstances,we think it would have defied common sense for the district court to ignore the access agreement when rendering its decision in this case.gff,at.
for the foregoing reasons,we find the district court review of the access agreement appropriate in this case,regardless of whether howsam motion was considered under rule b or rule b.
b.the access agreement,as supplemented by the submission agreement,is the operative agreement between the parties.
we are next asked to decide which is the operative arbitration agreement in this case,the access agreement or the submission agreement.we find that the access agreement,as supplemented by the submission agreement,is the controlling arbitration contract between the parties.
dean witter has argued that the submission agreement superceded the access agreement,or,in the alternative,that the submission agreement modified the access agreement,and thus that the district court erred in analyzing only the access agreement when deciding howsam motion to dismiss.dean witter offers no convincing case law,however,to support its proposition that the submission agreement superceded the access agreement.instead,the cases cited by dean witter stand for the proposition that contract terms contained in an earlier arbitration agreement may be supplemented by later submission agreements signed by the parties.see,executone info,davis,cir it is well settled that the arbitrator jurisdiction is defined by both the contract containing the arbitration clause and the submission agreement.if the parties go beyond their promise to arbitrate and actually submit an issue to the arbitrator,we look both to the contract and to the scope of the submissions to the arbitrator to determine the arbitrator authority.citations omitted emphasis added piggly wiggly operators warehouse,piggly wiggly operators warehouse indep.truck drivers union local,cir before arbitration can actually proceed,it is necessary for the parties to supplement the agreement to arbitrate by defining the issue to be submitted to the arbitrator and by explicitly giving him authority to act.emphasis added.
when analyzing the parties intent regarding the scope of the proposed arbitration,we must therefore look both to the original arbitration agreement,in which the parties have generally agreed to arbitrate issues arising from their association,and to the submission agreement,in which the issues to be arbitrated are precisely defined.this is the case so long as there is no express contradiction between the initial arbitration agreement and the submission agreement.united food and commercial workers,local union safeway stores,cir extension of the arbitrator authority through submissions is only allowed to the extent that the submission does not violate an express provision of the collective bargaining agreement.
the extent to which an arbitration submission agreement may supplement an earlier,general agreement to arbitrate was implicitly acknowledged in cogswell merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir.the issue of which agreement controlled,the earlier arbitration agreement signed by both parties or the later submission agreement signed only by the plaintiff,was not squarely addressed by the cogswell court,presumably because the parties in cogswell agree d that their arbitration agreement incorporates the nasd code,and that the agreement is to be construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new york.at.nevertheless,the cogswell court reliance on the initial arbitration agreement is evidenced by its recognition of the choice of law provision,which was contained only in the initial arbitration agreement entered into by both parties see id.at.further,the cogswell court reliance on the subsequently filed submission agreement is evidenced by its statement that the parties agreement incorporated the nasd code,which was not referenced in the initial agreement but was specifically identified as the governing code of arbitration in the arbitration submission agreement signed by the plaintiff.see id.the court thus recognized that the earlier arbitration agreement had been supplemented by the submission agreement,at least to the extent that it identified the rules and regulations by which the plaintiff,through her election of the nasd as the arbitral body,agreed to be bound.accordingly,we read cogswell as recognizing that an arbitration submission agreement may supplement a prior arbitration agreement entered into by the parties,even without evidence that the party agreed to the express terms of the submission agreement,when the party had earlier given authority to the submitting party to choose an arbitration forum,as well as that forum rules and regulations,from among a list of approved arbitration organizations.
in this case,howsam agreed in the access agreement to choose an arbitration forum from a list of approved organizations should she choose to bring a claim against dean witter.in filing the submission agreement,howsam elected to have her claims resolved by the nasd pursuant to nasd rules and regulations.specifically,in signing the submission agreement,howsam agreed to submit the present matter in controversy,as set forth in the attached statement of claim,to arbitration in accordance with the constitution,by laws,rules,regulations,code of arbitration procedure of the sponsoring organization.there is no contradiction between the access agreement and the submission agreement,such that the latter can plausibly be seen to supplement the former.united food,at.we therefore conclude that both the access agreement and the submission agreement apply in this case.
c.the access agreement,as supplemented by the submission agreement,does not clearly and unmistakably demonstrate the parties intent to have issues of arbitrability decided by an arbitrator rather than by the courts 
agreement must provide clear and unmistakable evidence of the parties intent 
the supreme court has stated that arbitration is a matter of contract,and thus that parties should not be forced to arbitrate issues that have not been agreed upon.see at t,communications workers of,d interpreting an arbitration clause contained in a collective bargaining agreement.the court has further stated that u nless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise,the question of whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a particular claim is to be decided by the court,not the arbitrator.id.at.remanding the case to the district court to decide whether the collective bargaining agreement allowed arbitration of a particular labor dispute.
the supreme court explained the applicable standards in first options of chicago,kaplan,d,where it held that j ust as the arbitrability of the merits of a dispute depends upon whether the parties agreed to arbitrate that dispute,so the question who has the primary power to decide arbitrability turns upon what the parties agreed about that matter.at.citations omitted.the first options court also noted,however,the particular difficulty in allowing arbitrators to decide the scope of their own jurisdiction 
t he who primarily should decide arbitrability question is rather arcane.a party often might not focus upon that question or upon the significance of having the arbitrators decide the scope of their own powers.and,given the principle that a party can be forced to arbitrate only those issues it specifically has agreed to submit to arbitration,one can understand why courts might hesitate to interpret silence or ambiguity on the who should decide arbitrability point as giving the arbitrators that power,for doing so might too often force unwilling parties to arbitrate a matter they reasonably would have thought a judge,not an arbitrator,would decide.
id.at.citations omitted.accordingly,the court imposed a stringent test for the courts to apply in cases where the parties disagree over who should decide the arbitrability issue.specifically,the court stated courts should not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is clea r and unmistakabl e evidence that they did so.id.at.citing at t,at.alteration in original.
we adopted this standard in cogswell,where we were asked to decide whether the district court or an arbitrator should determine whether an arbitration claim is barred under the time limit contained in nasd code.see at.the plaintiff in cogswell commenced an arbitration proceeding with the nasd and then filed a motion to compel arbitration in the united states district court for the district of colorado.see id.at.in ruling on the plaintiff motion,the district court concluded that the arbitrators,and not courts,should determine whether the limitations period set forth in nasd code bars an arbitration claim.id.at.
on appeal we reversed,noting that courts in other jurisdictions were sharply divided on the issue,but that the majority of courts had concluded that courts,and not arbitrators,should determine whether an action is by the nasd code because that determination involves the scope of the arbitrator subject matter jurisdiction.see id.at.after discussing the holdings of courts reaching a contrary conclusion,as well as the supreme court recent decision in first options,the cogswell court adopted the majority view that the courts,and not arbitrators,should determine the arbitrability under nasd code of disputes submitted to arbitration,absent a clear and unmistakable agreement to the contrary.see id.at see also,oil,chemical,atomic workers int l union conoco,cir riley,anchor glass container,cir.
in analyzing the specific language at issue in cogswell,the court determined that the nasd code provision at issue,stating that n o dispute,claim or controversy shall be eligible for submission to arbitration under this code where six years have elapsed from the occurrence or event giving rise to the act or dispute,claim,or controversy,see nasd code,can reasonably be read in only one way as a substantive limit on the claims that the parties have contracted to submit to arbitration.see cogswell,at quoting painewebber,hofmann.cir.we thus concluded that a reading of nasd code simply could not provide the type of clear and convincing evidence that is required to allow arbitrators to decide the arbitrability of the parties dispute see id.at.based upon this finding,we concluded in cogswell that of the nasd code defines the arbitrators substantive jurisdiction and thus that the courts,not the arbitrators themselves,must decide whether a claim is under that provision.id.at.
new york state law does not govern the arbitrability issue 
howsam argues that this court decision in cogswell is not controlling because the access agreement contains a provision specifying that new york state law governs any dispute between the parties,without reference to choice of law doctrine.howsam notes that,after the cogswell decision was handed down on february,the new york court of appeals decided smith barney shearson,sacharow,in which it found that an arbitration agreement,which was substantially similar to the agreements at issue in this case,provided clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties intended to have the issue of arbitrability under nasd code decided by an arbitrator rather than the courts 
howsam is incorrect that the choice of law provision in the parties access agreement mandates that we follow new york state law rather our own precedent.the federal arbitration act,which applies to all arbitration agreements involving commerce,create s a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability,applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the act.moses cone memorial hosp.mercury constr,d.federal law in the terms of the arbitration act governs that issue in either state or federal court.id.as the first circuit court of appeals stated in painewebber,elahi,cir

the elahi court was faced with a choice of law provision in the arbitration agreement which,as in the case before us,provided that this agreement and its enforcement shall be construed and governed by the laws of the state of new york.see at.despite this contractual language,the elahi court held that the parties choice of law provision did not control the issue of arbitrability.the court,quoting mastrobuono shearson lehman hutton,d,held 
we think the best way to harmonize the provision with the arbitration provision is to read the laws of the state of new york to encompass substantive principles that new york courts would apply,but not to include special rules limiting the authority of arbitrators.thus,the provision covers the rights and duties of the parties,while the arbitration clause covers arbitration 
elahi,at.thus,the federal substantive law of arbitrability,rather than state law,must be applied when deciding whether the arbitration at issue was under the nasd code see id.at t he question whether a court or an arbitrator applies the nasd time bar relates closely to arbitrability,so we must apply the federal common law of arbitrability that has developed pursuant to the faa.uhc mgmt.computer sci,cir a number of cases have interpreted that decision as similarly rejecting the notion that a general state clause appended to a contract that also includes an arbitration provision will preempt the applicability of the faa in a federal court proceeding.citing ferro garrison,cir gallus,pudgie famous chicken,cir national union fire ins.belco petroleum,cir elahi,at atlantic aviation,ebm group,cir.
we have no doubt that the arbitration agreement in this case,which was intended to cover all controversies related to dean witter provision of investment services to howsam,involve d commerce as broadly defined by the supreme court in terminix dobson,d concluding that the word involving,like affecting,signals an intent to exercise congress commerce power to the full.see elahi,at merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith masland,finding arbitration agreement stemming from the parties investment services relationship to fall within the purview of the faa notwithstanding a choice of law provision in the contract selecting new york law dean witter reynolds,daily,supp,same.accordingly,we hold that the access agreement,as supplemented by the submission agreement,is subject to the federal substantive law of arbitrability despite the choice of law provision contained in the access agreement.see elahi,at masland.at the faa creates a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability t o the extent that the contract purports to establish new york law as controlling the issue of arbitrability,the contract language is preempted by the faa.daily,supp.at there is no dispute that the account agreement is within the scope of the faa because it is one clearly involving commerce.thus the court finds that the account agreement is subject to federal arbitration law rather than new york law.citation omitted.on the arbitrability issue before us,then,we are not governed by how the new york court of appeals construed similar arbitrability language,but are governed instead by the federal law of arbitrability,as that law has been established in the tenth circuit by cogswell 
under this court cogswell decision,the parties agreement does not provide clear and unmistakable evidence of the parties intent to have the arbitrability issue resolved by an arbitrator rather than the courts.
of course,the most clear and unmistakable agreement to arbitrate the issue of arbitrability would be an express statement to that effect in the parties contractual agreement to arbitrate disputes arising between them.indeed,the supreme court has stated that silence or ambiguity about the question who primarily should decide arbitrability,first options,at,should not be viewed as giving the arbitrators that power,for doing so might too often force unwilling parties to arbitrate a matter they reasonably would have thought a judge,not an arbitrator,would decide,id.at.given the supreme court stated disregard for silence or ambiguity in the contractual language,it seems entirely possible that an express statement in the contract is not only preferable,but necessary,to a finding that the parties clearly and unmistakably agreed to submit arbitrability questions to an arbitrator rather than the courts.we need not resolve that issue,however,because the language contained in the access agreement and submission agreement falls squarely within this court previous holding in cogswell and thus can not,under cogswell,provide clear and unmistakable evidence of the parties intent 
the cogswell court focused on the language of relevant provisions in the nasd code when it determined that the parties agreement did not provide clear and unmistakable evidence of the parties intent regarding the arbitrability issue.the nasd code language addressed by the cogswell court is identical to the nasd code language adopted in the submission agreement,such that cogswell governs our interpretation of that language.in addition,even if we go beyond the nasd code sections analyzed by the cogswell court,the language contained in the underlying arbitration agreements at issue in cogswell is materially indistinguishable from the language of the access agreement and submission agreement at issue in this case.
in cogswell,the original arbitration agreement stated that the parties agree d that any controversy arising out of the client business or this agreement shall be submitted to arbitration conducted according to the rules and procedures of the new york stock exchange,nyse or of the national association of securities dealers,nasd as the client may elect.see cogswell,at.here,as noted above,the access agreement stated 
the client agrees that all controversies between the client and dean witter any of its officers,directors,or employees,present or former,concerning or arising from i any account maintained with dean witter by client ii any transaction involving dean witter and client,whether or not such transaction occurred in such account or accounts or iii the construction,performance or breach of this or any other agreement between us,whether such controversy arose prior to,on or subsequent to the date hereof,shall be determined by arbitration 
we find no material difference between the contractual language at issue in cogswell and the relevant contractual language conta
