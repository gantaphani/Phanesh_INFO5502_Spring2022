this case requires us once more to clarify the limited role played by courts in reviewing labor arbitration awards.respondent drywall dynamics,drywall entered into a labor agreement with petitioner southwest regional council of carpenters swrcc or the union according to which drywall assigned to a contractors association authority to bargain on its behalf.some years later,having grown dissatisfied with this arrangement,drywall attempted to terminate the agreement at what it thought was the appropriate time,only to discover that the union and the association had executed a memorandum of understanding extending the term of the agreement.
an arbitrator held that drywall was bound by the memorandum.but the district court vacated the arbitration award,holding that the arbitrator interpretation of the parties agreement was not plausible and was,moreover,contrary to public policy.we conclude that the district court decision exceeded its narrow authority to determine whether the arbitrator award was based on the parties contract and whether it violated an explicit,and dominant public policy,associated coal united mine workers of,dist,d,and accordingly reverse.
factual and procedural background 
drywall is a construction company swrcc represents workers in the construction industry.on july,drywall and swrcc entered into a memorandum agreement according to which drywall agreed to be bound by a master labor agreement mla between the union and the conference of the western wall ceiling contractors association wwcca or the association,as well as any extensions,renewals or subsequent master agreements.drywall waived any right that it may have to terminate,abrogate,repudiate or cancel this agreement during its term or during the term of any future modifications,changes,amendments,supplements,extensions,or renewals of or to said master agreement.the memorandum agreement further provided that drywall authorize d the association to represent it unless drywall gave notice of its desire to withdraw from the agreement at least sixty days,but no earlier than ninety days prior to the termination date of the mla.the mla in place when the parties executed the memorandum agreement was due to expire on june,but provided that it would continue to remain in full force and effect from year to year thereafter without change or modification unless either party proposed such changes within to days of the termination date.
on april,drywall notified the union of its intent to no longer be bound by the mla as of june.in fact,the union and the association had already negotiated a successor mla,which would expire on june.in response to drywall notice,the union informed the company that its purported termination was untimely,although the union erroneously asserted that the agreement new end date was september.drywall opted not to dispute this point and continued complying with the mla.
on april,drywall again gave the union notice of its intent to terminate the agreement,this time as of june.on may,the union informed drywall that its proffered termination was untimely,asserting that the agreement remained in effect until june,as provided by the successor mla.
in fact,before sending this communication,the union had,on april,executed a memorandum of understanding mou with the association.the mou provided for an extension of the mla until june,in exchange for the union agreement to defer a portion of a negotiated pay raise.the mou further provided that only wwcca conference members who affirmatively agree to this agreement will be bound to it and so permitted to pay the lower rate.those members who did not affirmatively agree to the mou were to pay the full increase previously agreed upon.
on april,drywall attempted again to terminate its agreement with the union and the wwcca,effective june.the union once more responded that the termination was untimely,explaining as was the case that the agreement had been extended until june.
on july,the union filed a grievance against drywall with the southern california drywall joint adjustment board adjustment board or board,alleging six specific contractual violations the grievance came before an adjustment board arbitration panel for hearing in august and september.during the first day of the hearing,on august,the union asked the board to resolve,in addition to the six violations named in the initial grievance,the question whether drywall purported termination of its agreement with the union was effective.drywall objected,arguing that whether it had effectively terminated its contract in was not relevant to any of the grievances filed by swrcc.relying on a provision of the mla requiring grievances to be brought within thirty days after the complaining party has actual knowledge of the facts giving rise to the dispute,drywall moved to dismiss the termination issue based on timeliness and argued that the union contention was procedurally barred.in response,the adjustment board issued an interim award in which it indicated that it would decide the validity of drywall termination because the issue is related to the overall grievance,but held that issue in abeyance pending further review of the evidence.
later,the board issued interim award ii,in which it unanimously ruled that drywall purported termination of the mla in was untimely because the mou had extended the agreement until.in support of that conclusion,the board noted that the union and the association had each given consideration for the modification of the agreement,and that drywall was bound by the negotiations and the agreements of those parties.the parties resolved the remaining grievance issues outside of arbitration.accordingly,on july,the board issued its final award,which restated its previous findings and confirmed that there were no remaining issues.
the union filed a petition in the district court seeking to confirm the arbitration award.after drywall filed a petition to vacate the award,the district court issued an order denying the union petition and granting drywall.
in so ruling,the district court acknowledged that arbitration awards are entitled to substantial deference from the district court,but nonetheless held the award unenforceable,on two bases.first,the court ruled that the arbitration panel interpretation of the contracts was not plausible.the mou provided that it would apply only to those members of the association who affirmatively agreed to it,but n o evidence was presented to the panel that drywall did so,nor did the panel make a finding of fact that drywall consented to the extension of the mla.absent such a finding,the court concluded,it was not plausible for the panel to find that the extension of the mla was binding on drywall.second,relying on the supreme court decision in charles bonanno linen service,nlrb,d,the court held that the arbitration award violated a clear public policy in favor of voluntary relationships among employers and bargaining units because a s interpreted by the panel,the agreements gave wwcca absolute authority to negotiate on drywall behalf and perpetually bind it to extensions of the mla without further consent by drywall.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
beginning with the supreme court steelworkers trilogy,the unique and critical role played by arbitration in the context of a collective bargaining agreement has been a bedrock of national labor policy.see united steelworkers of am.am,united steelworkers of am.warrior gulf nav,d united steelworkers of am.enterprise wheel car,d.as warrior gulf explained,the grievance machinery under a collective bargaining agreement is at the very heart of the system of industrial.at.indeed,arbitration in the labor context is more than a mechanism for resolving disputes.instead,the processing of disputes through the grievance machinery is actually a vehicle by which meaning and content are given to the collective bargaining agreement.id.
because of the centrality of the arbitration process to stable collective bargaining relationships,courts reviewing labor arbitration awards afford a nearly unparalleled degree of deference to the arbitrator decision.stead motors of walnut creek auto.machinists lodge,int l ass of machinists aerospace workers,cir en banc.this deference applies both to the arbitrator interpretation of the parties agreement and to his findings of fact.id.at.
with regard to contractual interpretation,as the supreme court has admonished,the parties hav e authorized the arbitrator to give meaning to the language of the agreement,so a court should not reject an award on the ground that the arbitrator misread the contract.united paperworkers int l union,afl cio misco,d.we have taken this instruction to heart,explaining that even if we were convinced that the arbitrator misread the contract or erred in interpreting it,such a conviction would not be a permissible ground for vacating the award.mason hosp.state nurses ass n,cir footnote omitted.indeed,s ince the labor arbitrator is designed to function in essence as the parties surrogate,he can not misinterpret a collective bargaining agreement.stead motors,at.in this sense,his award is their contract.id.quoting theodore antoine,judicial review of labor arbitration awards.thus,as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,his award must be upheld.misco,at.a court may intervene only when an arbitrator award fails to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement,such that the arbitrator is merely dispens ing his own brand of industrial justice.enterprise wheel,at.
similarly,t he parties did not bargain for the facts to be found by a court,but by an arbitrator chosen by them.misco,at.i mprovident,even silly,factfinding is hardly a sufficient basis for disregarding what the agent appointed by the parties determined to be the historical facts.id.at.because of this precept,a court is barred from disregarding the arbitrator factual determinations,let alone supplementing them with its own.stead motors,at.
to be sure,there are limited circumstances in which the vacatur of a labor arbitration award is justified.we have recognized four such circumstances 
when the award does not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement and the arbitrator is dispensing his own brand of industrial justice where the arbitrator exceeds the boundaries of the issues submitted to him when the award is contrary to public policy or when the award is procured by fraud.
cal.gas util.workers union of,local,afl cio,cir.the district court concluded that the first and third of these circumstances obtain in the present case.drywall further urges that the arbitrator decision excced ed the boundaries of the issues submitted to him.we discuss each proffered basis for vacatur in turn.
i.the scope of the grievance 
we address as an initial matter whether the adjustment board decision to consider the termination issue,even though it was not one of the issues initially articulated,provides grounds to vacate the board determination on that issue.we agree with the district court that it does not.
once a matter is submitted to arbitration,procedural questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition are presumptively not for the judge,but for an arbitrator,to decide.howsam dean witter reynolds,d quoting john wiley sons,livingston,d.so,too,the presumption is that the arbitrator should decide allegation s of waiver,delay,or a like defense to arbitrability.id.quoting moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.
in this case,in response to the union request on the first day of arbitration hearings that the board decide whether drywall contract with the union was still in existence or had terminated,drywall moved to dismiss the termination issue based on timeliness and argued that the union contention was procedurally barred.the board,in its first interim award,noted drywall objection but ruled that the termination issue will be decided by the panel because the issue is related to the overall grievance and because the contractor presented evidence and argument on this issue.the board rejection of drywall timeliness argument was a quintessentially procedural decision to which the district court was required to and properly did defer.
ii.the district court plausibility ruling 
the mou between the union and the association provided that it would apply to wwcca conference members who affirmatively agree to this agreement.the district court concluded that it was implausible for the arbitration panel to interpret this agreement as applying to drywall,for two reasons first,evidence before the district court indicated that drywall was not a member of the association at the time of the mou second,no evidence was presented to the adjustment board indicating that drywall affirmatively agreed to be bound by the extension.
the district court erred in two respects in making its plausibility ruling.most fundamentally,the court conducted the wrong inquiry.under controlling supreme court precedent,a court may not evaluate an arbitrator interpretation of an agreement to determine whether it meets some judicial standard of acceptability as a construction of the contract.rather,as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,that a court is convinced he committed serious error does not suffice to overturn his decision.misco,at.it is only when the arbitrator strays from interpretation and application of the agreement and effectively dispense s his own brand of industrial justice that his decision may be unenforceable.major league baseball players ass garvey,d quoting enterprise wheel,at.the question is not,therefore,whether the arbitrator interpretation of the agreement was plausible,in the sense of one a court might render,but instead whether he made any interpretation or application of the agreement at all.if so,the court inquiry ends.
the district court error is perhaps understandable in light of language from a long line of ninth circuit cases articulating enterprise wheel admonition that an arbitrator decision must draw its essence from the agreement as requiring a plausible interpretation of the contract.sheet metal workers int l ass local union madison,of,cir see also,ass of pulp paper workers,local rexam graphic,cir united food commercial workers union,local,afl cio united markets,cir holly sugar distillery,rectifying,wine allied workers int l union,afl cio,cir.as we have carefully explained,however,the plausibility inquiry does not represent an independent avenue for a attack on an arbitral award.rather,it is nothing more than another way of formulating the old rule of enterprise wheel that an arbitrator may not dispense his own brand of industrial justice.haw.teamsters allied workers union,local united parcel,cir.hawaii teamsters reiterated that the relevant inquiry is simply whether the arbitrator decision concerns construction of the contract,not an evaluation of the merits of that construction.id.quoting enterprise wheel,at emphasis added in hawaii teamsters.
as a description of the appropriate standard for evaluating a labor arbitration award,the word plausible is thus somewhat misleading.it could suggest some inquiry into the quality of the arbitrator interpretation.the likelihood of such a misunderstanding,we fear,has been exacerbated in recent years.in the wake of the supreme court decision in ashcroft iqbal,d,the term plausible has taken on additional coloration in legal parlance.iqbal described the plausibility determination it requires at the stage of litigation as a task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense in determining the legal sufficiency of a federal court complaint.id.at.such an active,substantive judicial role is in sharp contrast to the judicial hands off approach long required in labor arbitration cases,as long as the arbitrator engages with the interpretive task.
we conclude that it is time for us to retire the use of plausibility as a term to describe the courts role in reviewing labor arbitration awards.we do not,of course,propose any substantive change to the settled law in this area,nor could we.we merely reiterate,and emphasize,the fundamental concept hawaii teamster
