background 
on september,the agency issued a proposal to remove from his position as a special agent for the agency for conduct unbecoming an officer of the service,improper admission of aliens,failure to follow the instructions of a supervisor,and for improper release of sensitive information.at.responded in a written reply on november,and in an oral reply on november.id.thereafter,the agency advised by letter that he was being removed and that his removal was effective upon receipt of the letter.id.the letter also explained right to contest his removal.
on april,the union notified the agency by letter that it was invoking arbitration as to the removal.id.subsequently,on may,the agency advised the union that it wished to schedule arbitration proceedings,but the union did not respond.over thirteen months after the union letter invoking arbitration,on may,the agency informed the union by letter that s ince the union is the moving party in this matter and has not acted on this case in over a year,the case is closed in accordance with past practice.id.the letter further informed the union that it should contact the agency with any concerns.almost fifteen months later,on august,the union responded for the first time,demanding that the agency schedule the grievance for arbitration.id.the agency agreed to schedule the grievance,but maintained that the grievance was not arbitrable based on an established past practice that barred arbitrations that were not advanced for over a year.id.at.
before the arbitrator,the union maintained that the grievance was arbitrable because the union had fulfilled all of its obligations by invoking arbitration in conformance with relevant contractual provisions.the union further argued that there was no language in the collective bargaining agreement directing an arbitrator to dismiss the grievance under these circumstances,noting that the agency closeout policy had been an issue in previous separate arbitrations.id.at.additionally,the union argued that it had challenged this policy in unfair labor charges filed with the federal labor relations authority flra in and in.id.at.
the agency,on the other hand,maintained that the grievance was not arbitrable because the grievance case had been closed in accordance with the agency past practice of closing out cases where the union has taken no action to advance the grievance to arbitration in over a year.conceding that the parties collective bargaining agreement was silent on any requirement regarding advancing grievances after arbitration has been invoked,the agency maintained the existence and consistent application of a practice beginning in the,supporting its position of a clear past practice with past arbitration awards,unrebutted testimony,and past letters averaging to thirty per year.id.at.acknowledging that the union did challenge the policy in and in its filing of two unfair labor practice charges with the flra,the agency noted that the flra dismissed the charges on the basis that the practice of closing out cases existed well before the filing of the charges and thus those charges before the flra were themselves untimely.id.at.the agency further relied on the union conduct with respect to this case,pointing out that it took the union almost fifteen months to object or respond to the agency notification that it was closing this case after one year of inaction.id.
after hearing the evidence and argument from both sides,the arbitrator held that the grievance was not arbitrable.first,the arbitrator found that the agency had clearly and consistently implemented a closeout policy since the,finding that the a gency dismissed such grievances for over years while averaging between approximately and dismissals each year.id.at.
second,the arbitrator found that the union clearly had notice of the agency policy,noting that t he evidence is also undisputed that the agency regularly and routinely notified the local unions of its decisions dismissing these grievances under the closeout policy.id.thus the arbitrator concluded that there is no doubt that the union and its various local unions in the eastern district were aware of this policy.id.
third,the arbitrator found that the union by its action or inaction over this period assented to the agency policy.hence,the arbitrator rejected the union argument that it objected to the agency practice of dismissing cases that were abandoned for over a year,relying on the evidence regarding case processing since the,including this one.the arbitrator noted that there was no evidence,in this record,other than counsel statements that the union objected to the dismissal of this grievance until counsel that the grievance be scheduled for months after the case had been closed out.id.at.additionally,the arbitrator relied on the fact that the union offered no evidence of having successfully grieved this issue to arbitration again weakened the union assertions that it has repeatedly objected to these dismissals.id.at.according to the arbitrator,
the union consent is implied by the fact that essentially none of the local unions nor the union eastern regional formally or successfully protested these actions through the grievance procedure that the two protests to the flra were denied and that,in this record,there was no demonstration that the union ever filed any other formal grievance specifically challenging the policy or that the policy was ever found to be in violation of the collective bargaining agreement,at least up until this grievance,some years after the fact.
id.at see also id.at finding that the flra declined to issue complaint concluding that the policy had been in existence for some time.in sum,the arbitrator held that the weight of the evidence supported the agency position regarding a binding past practice,and the union offered no substantial evidence to rebut it.this petition for review ensued.

ii.discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews decisions of an arbitrator under the same standard of review as decisions of the merit systems protection board.it is a deferential standard,requiring the federal circuit to affirm the decision of the arbitrator unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence.c.
on appeal,raises four issues.first,he argues that the record does not support the arbitrator reasoning because the testimony by the witness for the agency was false and misleading and that none of the past cases verified an agency closeout policy.second,argues that the arbitrator misapplied the standard for demonstrating past practice,stating that 
t o demonstrate a past practice,the party asserting it must demonstrate that it continued for a long period of time and that the other side did nothing to attempt to halt it.in addition,the agency must demonstrate the practice was occurring in the local workplace where they claim the practice existed.
