trial court proceedings 
salvador amezcua filed a class action complaint against el pollo loco in october.he alleged that he was employed as general manager of a restaurant owned and operated by el pollo loco.he alleged that he and other el pollo loco general managers were treated as exempt managerial workers but spent the majority of their time performing nonmanagerial tasks,that they were wrongfully denied overtime compensation,and that they were unable to take meal breaks.he also alleged that el pollo loco incentive compensation system resulted in deductions from the employees wages for losses that should have been borne by the employer.the court determined that this action was related to another class action,elias el pollo loco.county,no.elias.both cases were reassigned to the same judge.
el pollo loco demurred to the complaint in july,arguing that amezcua had no standing to sue because he had filed a bankruptcy petition and that the claims were the property of the bankruptcy trustee.el pollo loco also moved to compel arbitration of the complaint by amezcua.amezcua opposed the motion,and filed a first amended complaint in august adding olvera as a named plaintiff.the first amended complaint alleges counts for failure to pay overtime failure to provide meal breaks unlawful deductions from earnings failure to provide accurate itemized wage statements unfair business practices bus,et and conversion.amezcua then dismissed the complaint with prejudice as to himself only,leaving olvera as the sole named plaintiff.
el pollo loco filed a motion to compel arbitration of the complaint by olvera.olvera opposed the motion.at a hearing on the motion in october,the trial court requested supplemental briefing on procedural and substantive unconscionability.the court also sustained without leave to amend a demurrer to the sixth count for conversion.the court later stayed the action pending a decision by the california supreme court on a petition for review in another action.
el pollo loco filed a new motion to compel arbitration in october,after the california supreme court filed its opinion in gentry,supra,cal th,d.el pollo loco argued that olvera was a party to an arbitration agreement that precluded class arbitration and that the agreement was neither procedurally nor substantively unconscionable.it filed a declaration stating that its employees were not required to sign the acknowledgment form or given a deadline to return the signed form,that the employees were free to decide whether to sign the form,and that some employees did not return a signed form.it also argued that enforcing the class arbitration waiver would not undermine the employees unwaivable statutory rights under the rule from gentry,supra,cal th,d.el pollo loco argued that two of the named plaintiffs in the elias action did not sign the arbitration agreement and therefore could not be compelled to arbitrate,and that compelling olvera to arbitrate his individual claims in this action would not prevent its current and former employees from maintaining a class action in elias if the court were to grant class certification in that action.el pollo loco sought an order compelling olvera to arbitrate his individual claims and staying the trial court proceedings pending completion of the arbitration.
olvera argued in opposition that the arbitration agreement was procedurally unconscionable because it was presented as a nonnegotiable policy change applicable to all employees,and because the more easily readable portion of the materials given to the employees misrepresented the dispute resolution policy as required mediation rather than arbitration.he argued that the class arbitration waiver was because only the employees would contemplate seeking classwide relief,and that the arbitration agreement therefore was substantively unconscionable.he also argued that a class action would be the most effective means of vindicating the employees unwaivable statutory rights,and that consideration of the modest size of the potential individual recovery,the potential for retaliation against individual employees who sue the company,and the fact that some employees may be unaware of their legal rights supported the conclusion that the class arbitration waiver was unenforceable under the rule from gentry,supra,cal th,d.he argued that if the class arbitration waiver were deemed enf
