appellants employers insurance of wausau wausau and rogers construction company rogers appeal the district court order compelling arbitration of a claim asserted by appellee bright metal specialties,bright arising from a dispute on a government construction project in everglades national park.the district court held that wausau,a miller act surety,became a party to bright subcontract and the arbitration provision therein by virtue of wausau takeover agreement with the government,wausau completion contract with its completion general contractor,rogers construction rogers,and the ratification agreement with bright.wausau argues that it did not contractually agree to arbitrate with bright,that it is not bound by the arbitration provision in bright subcontract,and that the miller act precludes arbitration of a claim against a miller act surety such as wausau.rogers concedes that it is bound by bright subcontract,but contends that bright claim is excluded from arbitration pursuant to an arbitration exception in the subcontract.moreover,bright contests our jurisdiction to hear this appeal.we conclude that the district court order was an appealable final decision and affirm the arbitration order with respect to both wausau and rogers.
background 
the parties agree to the following facts,most of which are established by contract.on or about july,the national park service government contracted with.for the repair of roofs to certain buildings located in the everglades national park the project.wausau,as contract surety,provided performance and payment bonds for the project on behalf of,its principal,in favor of the government,as required by the miller act,et.in september,subcontracted a portion of the project work to bright pursuant to a written agreement the subcontract or subcontract that included an arbitration clause.
the government subsequently terminated for its default on the project,and called upon wausau to complete the work pursuant to the performance bond.on or about may,the government and wausau entered into a takeover agreement by which wausau agreed to complete the prime contract for.on or about may,wausau entered into a contract for completion and construction the completion contract with rogers whereby rogers became the completing contractor for all remaining work under the prime contract.pursuant to the completion contract,wausau agreed to assign to rogers all of wausau right,title and interest in and to executory subcontracts for the performance of project work.
on or about june,bright and wausau entered into a ratification agreement which resolved bright payment bond claim and ratified the subcontract.first,wausau and bright resolved claims relating to monies due bright for work performed prior to termination.second,bright agreed to complete the subcontract and agreed to start work on the project within seven days after request by wausau,its agent,or assigns,including any completion contractor engaged by wausau.third,the ratification agreement provided that wausau could assign its rights under the subcontract and this agreement to a completion contractor.finally,the parties agreed that wausau would pay bright the remaining retainage,as fulfillment of its obligations to bright,if work did not begin within a specified period.thereafter,wausau required bright to complete the subcontract with rogers as the completion contractor.bright resumed work on the project in june.
in december,bright and wausau settled a payment bond claim previously submitted by bright for work,labor materials performed furnished under its subcontract with 
near completion of the project,bright sought additional compensation for delays and damages caused by the government.ultimately,bright submitted to rogers a request for equitable adjustment rea under the subcontract.as required by the contract documents,rogers submitted the request to wausau for presentation by wausau to the government.bright,rogers,wausau and the government met in denver,colorado in february to address project claims,including bright rea.at the meeting,the government offered to settle bright rea for approximately,less than two percent of the amount sought by bright.bright declined the settlement offer and left the meeting.after bright left the meeting,wausau accepted the government settlement offer without bright approval or consent.bright did not submit any further claims against the government,directly or through rogers or wausau,regarding the amounts sought in the rea.
in january,bright filed a demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association aaa for alleged breach of contract by rogers and wausau.bright claimed losses in the amount of plus interest,attorney fees and costs.
in february,wausau filed a complaint in the district court for the southern district of florida against rogers and bright seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the arbitration case.in a separate action against wausau and rogers,bright filed a motion to compel arbitration,pursuant to the federal arbitration act,and based on an arbitration clause in the subcontract between bright and case.wausau and rogers filed claims for declaratory and injunctive relief seeking to stay the arbitration 
the two actions were consolidated and referred to magistrate judge ted bandstra.on december,magistrate judge bandstra issued an amended report and recommendation that wausau and rogers be compelled to arbitrate bright claim.the district court,judge presiding conducted a de novo review and by order entered september,affirmed the magistrate amended report and recommendation granting bright motion to compel arbitration,denying wausau and roger motions for injunctive relief,and denying all remaining motions as moot.in addition,the district court dismissed each of the underlying consolidated actions in deference to arbitration,and denied roger request for reconsideration.
wausau and rogers appeal from the district court decision.bright challenges our jurisdiction to hear this appeal asserting that the district court order was not a final decision with respect to arbitration under a of the federal arbitration act faa.
ii.standard of review 
the jurisdictional issue is a question of law,which we review de novo.see randolph green tree fin,cir.we review de novo the district court order compelling arbitration.see randolph,at.
iii.analysis 
final decision under the federal arbitration act 
as a threshold matter,we decide whether we have jurisdiction over this appeal.special rules govern appeals from a district court arbitration order as set forth in section of the faa.see see also american express fin.advisors,makarewicz,cir.the question here is whether the district court order compelling arbitration of bright claim and dismissing the underlying actions is a final decision with respect to an arbitration within the meaning of the statute.a.
in arguing that we lack jurisdiction,bright distinguishes between embedded and independent proceedings,a distinction this court has recognized,albeit without using those labels see thomson mckinnon,salter,cir cited in randolph,at.bright correctly notes that,generally speaking,a decision of the district court is final when it disposes of all the issues framed by the litigation and leaves nothing for the district court to do but execute the judgment.see randolph,at quoting catlin united states.however,bright contends that the phrase final decision does not include an order compelling arbitration and dismissing the other claims in the action,when that order occurs in an embedded proceeding such as this one 
we find that bright argument is foreclosed by the supreme court recent opinion in green tree fin,d.that decision held that a district court order compelling arbitration and dismissing all other claims is final within the meaning of a,and therefore appealable,even when that order occurs in an embedded proceeding involving both a request for arbitration and other claims for relief.green tree fin.at.here,as in green tree fin,the district court directed the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitration and dismissed both cases leaving the court nothing to do but execute the judgment.accordingly,we have jurisdiction over the consolidated actions because the arbitration order disposes of all the issues framed by the litigation and leaves nothing for the district court to resolve.
b.the applicability of the subcontract arbitration clause 
having determined that we have jurisdiction over this appeal,we now turn to the question whether the parties agreed to arbitrate the present dispute.wausau contends that it may not be compelled to arbitrate because it is not a party to any agreement containing an arbitration clause.bright argues that wausau ratified the subcontract and therefore,assumed the duty to arbitrate pursuant to an arbitration provision therein.
choice of law 
federal law establishes the enforceability of arbitration agreements,while state law governs the interpretation and formation of such agreements.see perry thomas,d.federal law counsels that questions of arbitrability,when in doubt,should be resolved in favor of arbitration.see moses cone mem l hospital mercury constr,d.thus,as with any other contract,the parties intentions control,but those intentions are generously construed as to issues of arbitrability 
wausau duty to arbitrate.
as an initial matter,wausau is correct that,under the faa,no party can be compelled to arbitrate unless that party has entered into an agreement to do so.see at t,communications workers,d.courts,however,have recognized a number of theories under which may be bound to the arbitration agreements of others.see,generally,am.arbitration ass n.cir.these theories arise out of common law principles of contract and agency law incorporation by reference assumption agency ego and estoppel.see id.at see also ms dealer serv.franklin,cir.
in this case,the district court concluded that wausau agreed to arbitrate disputes with bright when it stepped into the shoes of and signed the ratification agreement with bright.the court reasoned that the ratification agreement,signed by wausau and bright,incorporated by reference the subcontract,thus,expressing wausau intent to arbitrate disputes arising out of the subcontract in accordance with the arbitration provision therein see,united states fidelity and guaranty west point constr,cir compelling surety to arbitrate where performance bond incorporated by reference subcontract that contained arbitration provision.
we agree with the district court that wausau is bound by the arbitration provision in the subcontract.by signing the takeover agreement,wausau assumed all duties and responsibilities of to complete the prime contract in exchange for the balance of the contract price.see,travelers,et united states.holding that surety became a party to the prime contract upon executing a takeover agreement with the united states.while the takeover agreement did not specifically obligate wausau to any contractual provisions previously negotiated between bright and,this agreement clearly reveals wausau intent to step into the shoes of.the ratification agreement,executed with bright,guaranteed performance of the subcontract work according to the terms and conditions of the subcontract.this agreement evinces wausau intent to affirm the subcontract,including the arbitration provision therein.see green ford motor credit,port largo club,warren,so d,dca.finally,the completion contract granted wausau the option to assign its rights in the subcontract to rogers.read together,these agreements lead us to conclude that wausau gained the benefits and obligations of the subcontract between and bright.thus,wausau became bound by the arbitration provision in the subcontract.
wausau does not contest that it acquired rights under the subcontract.pursuant to the ratification agreement,wausau obtained bright agreement to complete the subcontract at no additional cost.wausau also acquired the right to assign its rights under the subcontract to a completion contractor.wausau concedes that it exercised its right to assign the subcontract to rogers however,wausau contests its obligation to arbitrate under the agreement.this is tantamount to wausau asking the court to recognize its rights under the subcontract without the correlative duties therein.
wausau argues that it could not have assumed the obligation to arbitrate under the subcontract because that subcontract automatically terminated,by its own terms,upon the government default of on april.a fair reading of paragraph of the subcontract,however,leads us to conclude that the subcontract became terminable,but did not automatically terminate when the government defaulted wausau does not assert,and we find no evidence in the record,that wausau or bright terminated the subcontract pursuant to its termination provisions.we also find it disingenuous for wausau to have taken full advantage of the subcontract and now argue that it was not in effect.
finally,wausau contends that it can not be compelled to arbitrate with bright because the miller act places exclusive jurisdiction of claims against miller act sureties in federal court.the district court found that the miller act does not preclude arbitration,and alternatively,that wausau waived any such protection afforded it.we agree.
under the miller act,a claim against a surety arising under a miller act bond shall be brought in federal court.see.the miller act does not apply here because bright alleges that wausau breached the subcontract bright does not pursue a claim against wausau payment bond.even if it applies,the miller act does not preclude arbitration under the faa where the parties have previously agreed to arbitrate disputes.see united states ex.rel.portland constr.weiss pollution control,cir staying miller act suit pending outcome of arbitration where subcontract contained arbitration provision united states ex.rel.capolino sons,electronic missile facilities.cir requiring subcontractor to arbitrate miller act payment bond claim pursuant to arbitration provision in subcontract,which provision was not prohibited by the miller act.accordingly,we conclude that wausau assumed obligations to arbitrate with bright when wausau took over the project and ratified the subcontract 
roger duty to arbitrate 
rogers concedes that it is bound by the arbitration provision in the subcontract.however,rogers objects to arbitration on the basis of an exception to arbitration contained in the subcontract.specifically,rogers claims that b of the subcontract expressly excludes from arbitration pass through claims,or claims asserted by bright up the ladder to the government pursuant to this exception,the agreement to arbitrate between rogers and bright would not apply to any claim brought by bright against rogers if rogers asserted that the claim,in whole or in part,was against the government owner since the contract between rogers and the government does not provide for binding arbitration.based on the magistrate judge findings,the district court concluded that the exception does not apply for two reasons bright rea was not a claim under the subcontract and bright rea was never asserted against rogers as required by the exception provision.
our review of the record evidence accords with the findings of the magistrate judge.the arbitration exception set forth in paragraph of the subcontract does not apply because bright rea is not a claim under the subcontract.the subcontract provides that claims relating to the government had to be submitted by rogers in the manner and within the time elements provided in contract documents for like claims by the contractor upon the government.subcontract.the prime contract between and the government required the contractor and later rogers to submit all claims in accordance with the contract disputes act see prime contract,article.moreover,the prime contract provided that a demand for payment of money exceeding was not a claim under the contract disputes act until it was certified by the contractor 
in the district court,rogers conceded that bright submitted a claim against the government in an amount exceeding for delays and damages caused by the government.see roger response to bright motion to compel.ultimately,rogers wausau advised bright to submit its claim
