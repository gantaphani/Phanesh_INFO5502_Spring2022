background 
is a wisconsin corporation that manufactures and distributes medical equipment.tecnimed is a brazilian corporation that markets and sells medical equipment,and has distributed products and those of its predecessor companies in brazil since.
in,tecnimed and executed two agreements to govern their relationship,a sales and service agreement and a distribution agreement collectively,the agreements.unlike prior contracts between tecnimed and predecessors of,the agreements did not grant tecnimed exclusive distribution rights.each agreement contained an arbitration clause.the sales and service agreement provided,in relevant part,that thirty days following notice given by one party to the other of any controversy,claim or dispute between the parties arising out of or relating in any way to this agreement which the parties are unable to resolve by mutual negotiation or mediation,either party shall be entitled to have such controversy,claim or dispute finally settled by arbitration,in accordance with the rules of the commercial arbitration commission iacac.the distribution agreement contained a clause to the same effect.
by early,controversies had arisen according to,tecnimed owed approximately million on unpaid invoices according to tecnimed,sold products directly into the brazilian market,bypassing tecnimed in violation of certain licenses.on march,after fruitless negotiations,wrote to tecnimed initiating the arbitration process outlined in the agreements.ten days later,tecnimed advised that it had commenced legal action in the tenth civil circuit court of porto alegre,brazil.
on april,filed a notice and request for arbitration with the iacac.after further fruitless negotiations,tecnimed advised the iacac that the commission lacked jurisdiction to consider claims,and that tecnimed would not be participating in the arbitration.the iacac nonetheless appointed a panel,consisting of one arbitrator from brazil,one from the united states,and one from canada.
on may,tecnimed filed its complaint with the porto alegre court,naming as defendants and ge brasil,and alleging,inter alia i that the agreements lacked contractual equilibrium and were unenforceable under brazilian law ii that tecnimed was not required to arbitrate its dispute with because the agreements had expired iii that wrongfully terminated the agreements,causing a loss of profits to tecnimed iv that illegally imported three pieces of equipment into brazil without tecnimed authorization,causing tecnimed to suffer moral damages v that breached the agreements by failing to pay tecnimed sales commissions for certain products vi that tecnimed was entitled to exclusive distributorship of products in brazil and vii that tecnimed was entitled to a declaration of of debt to for equipment purchased by tecnimed under the agreements.
moved on both fronts it answered the porto alegre complaint,and filed a statement of claim with the iacac arbitral panel.in response,tecnimed filed a petition in new york state court seeking a permanent stay of the arbitration the new york action.removed the petition to the united states district court for the southern district of new york,and asserted counterclaims for an order compelling arbitration and for an injunction to bar tecnimed from prosecuting the porto alegre action.
in april while tecnimed petition for a stay of arbitration was pending in the district court,the iacac panel rejected tecnimed challenge to arbitral jurisdiction,ruling that the arbitration clauses were valid and binding that the claims had submitted to the panel were within the scope of the arbitration clauses,as were the claims tecnimed was asserting in porto alegre and that the panel would consider the issues in the porto alegre action to the extent deemed necessary.
on june,the district court eaton,ruled that the arbitration clauses were valid and that all of claims,as well as all of tecnimed claims asserted in the porto alegre action,were arbitrable.the court thereupon granted motion to compel arbitration,rejected tecnimed request for a stay,entered an injunction,and ordered tecnimed to immediately take all steps necessary to cause dismissal of the porto alegre action.if the suit in porto alegre was not dismissed by june,tecnimed had until june,to explain why.
on june,tecnimed filed a notice with the porto alegre court requesting that its case be placed on the suspense calendar.according to expert on brazilian law,placement on the suspense calendar would halt the case for no more than six months.in any event,the porto alegre court notified on june,that it was required to file a manifestation the brazilian equivalent of a to tecnimed reply to answer to the complaint.
apprised of these developments,the district court directed to draft a joint petition to dismiss the petition pursuant to brazilian law by july,and ordered tecnimed either to sign it by july,or to register objections to the draft by that date.tecnimed counsel refused to sign the petition on the grounds that it did not protect tecnimed from the running of the applicable statute of limitations and that,under brazilian law,tecnimed would have to pay a large honorarium fee of of the value of the claim as a consequence of dismissing the case 
on july,filed a motion to hold tecnimed and its president,paulo werlang,in civil contempt for failing to dismiss the porto alegre action.argued that tecnimed notice of suspension to the porto alegre court was defective because it failed to furnish a portuguese translation of the district court order that the honorarium on the stated value of the be nominal and that under brazilian law the statute of limitations would be tolled automatically pending arbitration.
on july,the district court ordered the parties to amend the petition to provide expressly that the statute of limitations would be tolled pending the arbitration,ordered tecnimed to sign the modified petition by july,and warned that noncompliance would trigger sanctions.tecnimed did not sign.instead,it moved for a stay of the injunction pending appeal and for postponement of the scheduled july hearing.the district court denied the postponement,found that tecnimed had violated its july order to sign the petition,and ordered tecnimed to pay for each day of continued noncompliance.the court also ordered paulo werlang who resides in brazil to appear in person at the july hearing,to show cause why tecnimed should not be subjected to further sanctions.the court indicated in a subsequent order that it would consider holding both tecnimed and werlang in civil and criminal contempt.
at the july hearing,werlang failed to appear as ordered.the district court found that tecnimed and werlang were in civil contempt for willfully violating its orders,but declined to issue a finding of criminal contempt.the court ordered tecnimed and werlang,jointly and severally,to pay per day until september,and per day thereafter,until tecnimed complied fully with the court orders.
this court consolidated tecnimed separate appeals of the district court grant of an injunction and its contempt ruling.
discussion 
the standard of review for the grant of a permanent injunction,including an injunction,is abuse of discretion.johnson son,clorox,cir see also china trade dev.choong yong,cir.
it is beyond question that a federal court may enjoin a party before it from pursuing litigation in a foreign forum.china trade,at.but principles of comity counsel that injunctions restraining foreign litigation be used sparingly and granted only with care and great restraint.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also deutz ag,cir.
an injunction against parallel litigation may be imposed only if a the parties are the same in both matters,and b resolution of the case before the enjoining court is dispositive of the action to be enjoined.china trade,at.once past this threshold,courts are directed to consider a number of additional factors,including whether the foreign action threatens the jurisdiction or the strong public policies of the enjoining forum.id.at.tecnimed contends that neither threshold requirement has been satisfied,and that comity considerations render the injunction inappropriate.
tecnimed asserts that the parties in the two matters are not identical because ge brasil,which tecnimed named as a defendant in the porto alegre action,is not a party in the new york action.the record supports the district court finding of substantial similarity and affiliation between and ge brasil.
tecnimed claims against ge brasil arise out of the same facts,circumstances,and relationships as alleged in the dispute between tecnimed and.that is neither here nor there,except that tecnimed complaint in the porto alegre action specifically states that ge brasil is an appropriate party because more than of its shares are held by,which makes it an active participant in the business relationships arising from the agreements.the claims against ge brasil thus rest chiefly if not completely on its affiliation with.tecnimed cites a statement by a ge brasil official that ge brasil is not an affiliate of.by the same token,however,one tecnimed director referred in testimony to ge and its affiliate general electric do brasil.none of this matters much,however,because the word affiliate can be a term of art,and may have a particular meaning under the law of brazil as it does in american law.
the decisive point on this record is that ge brasil is named in the porto alegre action chiefly on the basis of its aspects of identity with.it is undisputed that and ge brasil are part of the general electric group of companies.tecnimed served process on in the porto alegre action at ge brasil address.tecnimed explains that such service was valid because although ge brail is not an affiliate of,it can be considered as such because holds at least of ge brasil capital.the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the parties to the two actions are thus sufficiently similar to satisfy the first threshold requirement of china trade.see motorola credit uzan,wl,dist.lexis,at finding sufficient similarity between parties,even though not all parties to the two actions were identical,because the real parties in interest are the same in both matters mastercard int l,argencard sociedad anonima,wl,dist.lexis,at finding sufficient similarity between parties despite intervention in foreign action by one party controlling shareholder,which was not a necessary party to that action.
under china trade,an injunction may be proper if resolution of the case before the enjoining court would be dispositive of the enjoined action.at.the case before the enjoining court here concerns the arbitrability of the parties claims therefore the question under china trade is whether the ruling on arbitrability is dispositive of the porto alegre litigation,even though the underlying disputes are confided to the arbitral panel and will not be decided by the enjoining court in short,the district court judgment disposes of the porto alegre action because the porto alegre litigation concerns issues that,by virtue of the district court judgment,are reserved to arbitration.
tecnimed argues that its brazilian claim for moral damages stemming from alleged violation of brazil import and licensing laws is a tort claim unique to brazilian law that can not be resolved through arbitration because an arbitration in the united states will result in a misunderstanding of brazilian import and registration law by the iacac arbitrators.perhaps this is true,though the panel assigned by the iacac includes one arbitrator from brazil however,to the extent that the claim is arbitrable,the district court ruling is dispositive even if the claim is unique to brazil.
as to arbitrability,tecnimed argues that this claim is not based upon the sale of products by tecnimed pursuant to the terms of the agreements,that it falls outside the purview of the arbitration clauses we review de novo a district court determination that a claim is arbitrable.vera saks,cir.
federal policy strongly favors the enforcement of arbitration agreements.see moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.therefore,the existence of any broad agreement to arbitrate creates a presumption of arbitrability which is only overcome if it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.cogeneration.smith cogeneration int l,cir quoting worldcrisa armstrong,cir see also chelsea square textiles,bombay dyeing,cir.the arbitration agreement here,covering as it does any controversy,claim or dispute arising out of the agreements,is of the broad type.if the allegations underlying the claims touch matters covered by the parties agreements,then those claims must be arbitrated,at citation omitted.
tecnimed claim for moral damages alleges that circumvented tecnimed as the distribution agent for certain products that were imported into brazil.this claim touches matters covered by the agreements,which govern the relationship between the companies regarding the distribution,sale,and service of products in brazil.certainly,the arbitration agreements here are susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.id.the district court committed no error in ruling that the claim for moral damages is arbitrable,and that such ruling is dispositive of the claim.
beyond the threshold criteria of china trade,other considerations include whether the foreign proceeding threatens a strong public policy or the jurisdiction of the domestic forum.see china trade,at.both considerations are salient in this case.
as the circuit has noted,an injunction will issue to preclude participation in the litigation only when the strongest equitable factors favor its use,and the granting of an injunction depends in part on the importance to the forum of the law allegedly evaded.laker airways sabena,belgian world airlines,see also gau shan bankers trust,cir only the evasion of the most compelling public policies of the forum will support the issuance of an antisuit injunction.
