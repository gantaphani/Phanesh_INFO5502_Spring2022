factual background 
martin began working with aa in dallas,texas in.he transferred to aa kansas city location in.in the spring of,martin began working as a fleet service clerk in the air cargo facility at kansas city international airport mci.while employed with aa at mci,martin was a member of twu,and the terms and conditions of his employment were governed by a cba between aa and twu.
aa terminated martin for allegedly violating rules,and of american airlines rules and regulations aa decision to terminate martin was based on aa belief that martin claimed pay to which he was not entitled by falsifying his entries for april.
the air cargo facility where martin worked did not have a time clock.employees were required to record their time manually.on april,martin was scheduled to work from to noon.martin entries indicated that he began work at and left at.martin other entries for that day indicated hour of paid lunch and a claim for one hour of overtime.a factual dispute remains as to the exact time martin left work on april,based on his own inconsistent versions of the events of the day and based on different versions offered by martin supervisor and.however,as we explain below,this factual dispute is immaterial to our resolution of martin lawsuit.
on april,aa initiated an investigation pursuant to article f of the cba.martin supervisor,kevin silvas,met with martin and twu steward,todd peck,to discuss the circumstances surrounding martin entries for april.silvas reconvened the f hearing the next day to elicit more facts from martin.twu station chairman,bob gering,joined peck in representing martin during the april meeting.after the april meeting,martin discussed his case with peck and gering.gering told martin that he had been speaking with aa chief operating officer,mary kay gribbons,and that he would do his best work for martin through gribbons.between april and may,gering had several conversations with gribbons about martin case,in an effort to find holes in aa case and persuade gribbons not to terminate martin.despite gering efforts,aa concluded that martin changed the time on his time sheet from to and that he was not in the cargo facility as he represented.on may,aa terminated martin for seeking pay for time not worked,in violation of aa rules and regulations.that same day,peck filled out a grievance form for martin to sign.martin signed the form,which included a provision authorizing twu to act as martin representative in the disposition of his grievance.martin grievance was filed with his supervisor,thereby invoking martin right under the cba to a discharge appeal hearing before gribbons.
twu vice presidents,glen harmon and don hahn,assumed primary responsibility for handling martin grievance and for advising and representing him at the discharge appeal hearing.prior to the hearing,harmon and hahn reviewed all of the relevant documentation.harmon spoke with gering on one or more occasions and traveled to the cargo facility at mci to familiarize himself with the physical layout of the facility.on multiple occasions,harmon and hahn each had telephone conversations with management representatives regarding martin case.rick rodriguez,then president of twu,also had one or more telephone conversations with management on martin behalf.harmon,hahn and rodriguez shared with each other all of the information they obtained in their investigation.
harmon and hahn concluded that the evidence against martin was overwhelming.first,they determined numerous inconsistencies with martin statements regarding when he left work on april.in addition,they were concerned about the physical appearance of his time sheet,which they believed had been altered.they also were concerned about martin tone and attitude during the course of aa f investigation.lastly,martin case involved a charge of violating rule,a charge which harmon and hahn understood to be very difficult to overcome based on past experience.
having reached these conclusions,harmon and hahn attempted to negotiate a resolution with gribbons which would reinstate martin.gribbons told the twu representatives that she would be willing to reinstate martin on a thin ice letter,if she felt that martin was being completely forthright at the discharge appeal hearing about what occurred on april.a thin ice letter is an agreement whereby aa reinstates an employee in exchange for a signed,undated letter of resignation from the employee,which aa can date and accept,effective immediately,if the employee violates any company rule after reinstatement.
martin discharge appeal hearing was held on may.on the evening before the hearing,martin had a conference call with twu representatives.on the day of the hearing,martin,harmon,hahn and gering met for about an hour prior to the hearing to discuss strategy.the twu representatives emphasized to martin that it was imperative that he be remorseful.during the hearing,martin persisted in denying that he changed his time sheet.as a result,gribbons determined martin was not completely truthful during the hearing and,therefore,decided not to offer martin a thin ice letter and denied his grievance.
on or about may,twu filed a petition for arbitration on behalf of martin pursuant to article of the cba.this was part of twu standard practice of immediately filing a petition in order to preserve a grievant rights while twu executive board decided whether to pursue arbitration.martin claims that he was unaware twu filed a petition for arbitration on his behalf.he alleges that on june,his counsel filed a petition for arbitration in accordance with article of the cba.
twu executive board met on june.after considering all of the relevant documentation and questioning harmon,hahn and martin,twu executive board unanimously decided not to submit martin case to aa system board of adjustment for arbitration.on july,twu informed martin of the decision and sent a letter to twu international asking that martin arbitration case be withdrawn.
martin brought this lawsuit,alleging that twu breached the duty of fair representation it owed to him in handling his grievance and that aa breached the cba by discharging him without just cause.martin also asserted a claim of defamation against silvas,harmon and aa.by agreement of the parties,silvas and aa were dismissed without prejudice on the defamation claim.twu,aa and harmon moved for summary judgment,and the district court granted all three motions.martin appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to twu and aa.martin did not appeal the district court grant of summary judgment to harmon.

breach of duty of fair representation 
martin initially claims that twu breached its duty under the rla to fairly represent him.he argues that the record,when properly viewed in a light most favorable to him,shows that his grievance was meritorious,that twu decision not to submit his case to aa system board of adjustment was arbitrary,and that twu handled his discharge appeal hearing and grievance in a perfunctory manner.we do not agree.
