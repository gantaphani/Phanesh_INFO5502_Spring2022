plaintiff,eric jensen,sought to rescind a franchise agreement with quik international quik pursuant to section of the franchise disclosure act of act ilcs west on the grounds that quik was not registered as a franchise with the illinois attorney general office,as required by sections and of the act.quik sought to stay the litigation in the circuit court of cook county and compel arbitration of jensen claim pursuant to an arbitration clause in the franchise agreement.the appellate court held that because compliance with the registration requirement of the act was a condition precedent to an enforceable contract,the franchise agreement was not binding on jensen,and he was not required to submit his claim to arbitration.d.for the following reasons,we reverse the decisions of the circuit and appellate courts and remand the cause to the circuit court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
jensen entered into a franchise agreement with quik,a nevada franchisor,whereby quik granted jensen the right to operate a franchise in illinois.the franchise agreement contained an arbitration clause,which provided that 
a ny controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement or its breach,including without limitation,any claim that this agreement or any of its parts are invalid,illegal or otherwise voidable or void,shall be submitted to arbitration.
quik subsequently notified jensen that it was in violation of the act because its registration as a franchise with the illinois attorney general office had expired at the time it entered into the franchise agreement with jensen.the notice also informed jensen of his rights under the act,including the right to sue for damages rescission of the franchise agreement.
jensen filed a complaint against quik,its president,and its chief executive officer,seeking damages and rescission of the franchise agreement.count i alleged that quik had violated sections and of the act by failing to register as a franchise in illinois.count ii alleged that quik violated section of the act by making incomplete and misleading disclosures.count iii alleged a violation of the consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act ilcs et west.
quik filed a motion to stay the litigation pending arbitration,then filed an arbitration demand in nevada pursuant to section of the federal arbitration act faa.jensen filed a to stay arbitration pending the circuit court ruling to stay the litigation.the circuit court denied quik motion to stay and granted jensen motion to stay arbitration.quik appealed from both orders pursuant to rule a,arguing that even though quik was not registered as a franchisor,jensen claim had to be submitted to arbitration because the federal arbitration act governed the agreement and required enforcement of the arbitration clause,superceding state law.
the appellate court affirmed,holding that the issue of whether the parties had entered into an enforceable contract is not arbitrable because the question of whether a contract existed is a question of law for the court.d.quik appeals.
prior to addressing the merits of quik arguments,we set forth the relevant provisions of the act.section of the act provides in pertinent part 
it is unlawful for any person to offer or sell any franchise required to be registered under this act unless the franchise has been registered under this act or is exempt under this act.ilcs west.
section of the act provides 
no franchisor may sell or offer to sell a franchise in this state if the franchisee is domiciled in this state or the offer of the franchise is made or accepted in this state and the franchise business is or will be located in this state,unless the franchisor has registered the franchise with the administrator by filing such form of notification and disclosure statement as required under section.ilcs west.
section provides that 
any person who offers,sells,terminates,or fails to renew a franchise in violation of this act shall be liable to the franchisee who may sue for damages caused thereby.in the case of a violation of section,fraudulent practices,amendment of disclosure statement,or escrow of franchise fees and surety bonds of the act,the franchisee may also sue for rescission.ilcs west.
because jensen was domiciled in illinois,the offer was made in illinois,and jensen operated the franchise business from his home in illinois,quik was required by section of the act to be registered with the illinois attorney general in order to enter into a franchise agreement with jensen.because quik was not registered with the attorney general office at the time of the sale,as required by sections and,jensen is entitled,pursuant to section,to sue for damages and seek rescission of the franchise agreement.as noted above,the franchise agreement provides that all claims,including those that the agreement is illegal or otherwise invalid,must be submitted to arbitration.the question becomes,then,whether jensen was entitled to pursue his statutory remedy of rescission in state court,or whether he is required by the terms of the franchise agreement to pursue it before an arbitrator.jensen maintains,and the appellate court found,that he can maintain his statutory claim for rescission in state court because no enforceable contract,and therefore no arbitration clause,existed as a result of quik failure to fulfill the condition precedent of registration with the attorney general office.
quik argues that the faa governs its motion to stay the litigation because the motion was brought pursuant to section of the faa the franchise agreement specifically provides that all issues relating to arbitration or enforcement of the arbitration clause will be governed by the faa and as a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce,the faa applies as a matter of law.citing prima paint flood conklin,d,quik contends that under the faa a court may consider only issues relating to the making and performance of the agreement to arbitrate,not the enforceability or validity of the contract containing the arbitration clause as a whole,and that questions concerning the validity and enforceability of the contract are for the arbitrator,not the courts,to decide.when presented with a motion to stay litigation pending arbitration under section of the faa,the court inquiry is limited to whether an agreement to arbitrate exists and whether it encompasses the issue in dispute.if the court finds that an agreement to arbitrate exists and the issue presented is within the scope of that agreement,a stay under section of the faa is mandatory.
quik contends that there is no dispute that the arbitration agreement exists or that it encompasses the claims alleged in jensen complaint.further,jensen complaint contains no allegations that the arbitration provision,as opposed to the franchise agreement as a whole,was procured through fraud,violated the act,or is otherwise invalid,void,or voidable.thus,quik maintains,the stay was mandatory under section of the faa.
quik misapprehends the holding of the appellate court in this case.the appellate court in the present case relied on its previous decision in barter exchange,of chicago barter exchange,d.in barter exchange,illinois and kentucky franchisees sought to rescind their franchise agreements because the defendant franchisor allowed its registration to expire before the franchise agreements were executed.the court held that illinois and kentucky laws requiring a franchisor to obtain a registration to do business within the state must be deemed part of the respective franchise agreements and that,as implied terms of the contract,those laws established conditions precedent to the effectiveness and enforceability of the contracts.because the franchisor failed to satisfy the condition precedent of registration,the court held,the franchise contracts were not binding on the franchisees and the contracts were subject to rescission.rescission implicitly invalidated the arbitration agreement and without an arbitration agreement,the franchisees were not required to submit their claims to arbitration.barter exchange,d at.
as in barter exchange,the gist of the
