this is an appeal from an order denying the defendants motion to compel arbitration.applying the law to the undisputed facts and exercising our independent judgment,we reverse the trial court ruling.as we explain below,the plaintiff can not avoid arbitrating its claims against the signatory defendant,because those claims are within the reach of the arbitration clause.and the plaintiff can not avoid arbitrating its claims against the nonsignatory defendant,because those claims are inextricably bound up with the obligations arising out of the agreement containing the arbitration clause.
background 
the parties to this action are molecular analytic systems plaintiff or mas and ciphergen biosystems,and laboratories,defendants.
the contracts 
plaintiff is in a contractual relationship with defendant ciphergen,arising from various contracts,including two that are at issue here a license agreement and a settlement agreement,both executed in following settlement of prior litigation.plaintiff has no express contractual relationship with defendant.
both of the agreements at issue here contain arbitration provisions.section of the settlement agreement requires arbitration of any dispute concerning the interpretation or enforcement of the terms of that agreement,the license agreement,and other specified contracts.that requirement is qualified by section of the settlement agreement,which states except as expressly set forth in section,no dispute between the parties need be submitted for binding arbitration,regardless of whether or not such dispute may arise out of or otherwise relate to that agreement,the license agreement,or the other specified contracts.the license agreement incorporates those arbitration provisions by reference.
plaintiff complaint 
in july,plaintiff filed its complaint in this matter.
the complaint includes the following factual allegations plaintiff licensed certain technology rights to defendant ciphergen in exchange for the payment of royalties on total adjusted revenue,all as provided in the license agreement,which is attached to the complaint as exhibit a.in,ciphergen in substance assigned its rights under the license agreement to.ciphergen failed to secure plaintiff written consent to the assignment,as required by the license agreement.ciphergen received million in cash from that transaction with,which constitutes revenue under the license agreement.but ciphergen failed to pay royalties on that revenue.plaintiff has never entered into a commercial license agreement with.nevertheless,in february,plaintiff received a letter from with a royalty check that did not appear to be calculated upon adjusted total revenue as required by the license agreement.
the complaint contains nine causes of action,the first four naming ciphergen,the next four naming,and the last one naming both defendants.the four claims against ciphergen alone are for breach of contract first cause of action,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing second cause of action,fraud third cause of action,and accounting fourth cause of action.as against,plaintiff asserts claims for interference with contract fifth cause of action and conversion sixth cause of action.alternatively,plaintiff posits the license agreement as a contract between plaintiff and,which breached,thereby entitling plaintiff to an accounting seventh and eighth causes of action.finally,against both defendants,plaintiff seeks a declaration of contractual rights ninth cause of action.
defendants motion to compel arbitration 
in november,both defendants moved for an order staying the court action and compelling arbitration.
in their memorandum of points and authorities in support of the motion,defendants sought arbitration of plaintiff claims against ciphergen,asserting that they all fall within the scope of the arbitration provision.defendants further argued that plaintiff parallel claims against must also be submitted to arbitration based on the doctrine of equitable estoppel.
as evidentiary support for their motion,defendants submitted a copy of the settlement agreement,attached as an exhibit to the declaration of ciphergen employee eric fung.
plaintiff opposed the motion,expressing disagreement with all of defendants arguments plaintiff disputed the scope of the arbitration clause,arguing against arbitration of any of its tort or equity claims against either defendant.additionally,plaintiff cited the lack of any arbitration agreement with as a basis for refusing arbitration with both defendants,arguing first that plaintiff could not be compelled to arbitrate with,because is a nonsignatory,and further that plaintiff should not be compelled to arbitrate with ciphergen,because of the potential for conflicting results if mas is compelled to arbitrate with ciphergen.see code civ,subd.c.
in december,the court conducted a hearing on the motion.at defense counsel request,the court allowed supplemental briefing with submission thereafter.
in february,the court issued its order denying defendants motion to compel arbitration.the order contains no explanation of the basis for the court ruling.defendants thereafter requested a statement of decision,which the court denied as untimely.see.
defendants brought this appeal.
in their opening brief,defendants make these arguments all of plaintiff claims are within the scope of the arbitration agreement may enforce the arbitration clause and section c does not apply to this case.
in its respondent brief,plaintiff interposes these many of its claims are not subject to arbitration defendants failed to show that was a party to an arbitration agreement nothing in the record supports application of the equitable estoppel doctrine and section c precludes arbitration.
in reply,defendants dispute all of plaintiff arguments.
discussion 
to establish the proper framework for our discussion,we first summarize the legal principles that inform our analysis.we then apply them to this case.
legal principles 
the purpose of arbitration is to have a simple,quick and efficient method to resolve controversies.new linen supply eastern environmental controls,d.for this reason,there is a strong public policy favoring contractual arbitration.mercury ins.group superior court cal th,mercury.but that policy does not extend to those who are not parties to an arbitration agreement,and a party can not be compelled to arbitrate a dispute that he has not agreed to resolve by arbitration.westra marcus millichap real estate investment brokerage,th,westra.
compelling contractual arbitration 
statutory mandate and exception 
section requires the court to order contractual arbitration in a proper case.it provides on petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy,the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists,unless enumerated exceptions apply.
one relevant exception is contained in section c.section c addresses the peculiar situation that arises when a controversy also affects claims by or against other parties not bound by the arbitration agreement.cronus investments,concierge services cal th,cronus.it is an evenhanded law that allows the trial court to stay arbitration proceedings while the concurrent lawsuit proceeds or stay the lawsuit while arbitration proceeds to avoid conflicting rulings on common issues of fact and law amongst interrelated parties.ibid.under this provision,contractual arbitration may have to yield if there is an issue of law or fact common to the arbitration and a pending action or proceeding with a third party and there is a possibility of conflicting rulings thereon.mercury,supra,cal th at.application of section c is discretionary with the trial court.cronus,at.
scope of arbitration 
the scope of arbitration is a matter of agreement between the parties.larkin williams,woolley,cogswell,nakazawa russell th,larkin.a party can be compelled to arbitrate only those issues it has agreed to arbitrate.ibid.thus,the terms of the specific arbitration clause under consideration must reasonably cover the dispute as to which arbitration is requested.bono david th.for that reason,the contractual terms themselves must be carefully examined before the parties to the contract can be ordered to arbitration by the court.id.at.

ii.analysis 
with those principles in mind,we address defendants contentions that plaintiff claims against ciphergen all fall within the scope of the arbitration agreement,and that may enforce the arbitration clause,with the result that section c does not apply to this case.before turning to the substance of those issues,we first discuss the applicable standard of review,which the parties dispute.
appellate review 
defendants urge de novo review,on the ground that no extrinsic evidence was admitted concerning the license agreement.plaintiff disagrees,arguing for more deferential review.to the extent that the appeal concerns application of the equitable estoppel doctrine,plaintiff urges substantial evidence review,given the factual nature of that inquiry.to the extent that the appeal concerns application of section c,plaintiff urges review for an abuse of discretion.in reply,defendants acknowledge that a ruling under section c is reviewed for an abuse of discretion,but they argue that that issue should not be reached in this case.
as we now explain,we agree with defendants that the issues presented here are all subject to our de novo review.
de novo review is proper because there is no conflicting evidence concerning arbitrability.
when the language of an arbitration provision is not in dispute,the trial court decision as to arbitrability is subject to de novo review.gravillis,supra,th at.thus,in cases where no conflicting extrinsic evidence is introduced to aid the interpretation of an agreement to arbitrate,the court of appeal reviews de novo a trial court ruling on a petition to compel arbitration.california correctional peace officers state,supra,th at.
this principle finds expression in many cases.see,bono david,supra,th at turtle ridge,supra,th at boucher,supra,th at buckhorn,supra,th at metalclad ventana environmental organizational partnership th,metalclad norcal mutual ins.newton th,coast plaza doctors hospital blue cross of california th,maggio windward capital management th,larkin,supra,th at brookwood bank of america th,vianna,supra,th at merrick writers guild of america,west,d.
the de novo review standard likewise applies to the question of rights to compel arbitration.whether and to what extent nonsignatories can also enforce the arbitration clause is a question of law,which we review de novo.rowe exline,supra,th at.
in this case,since no conflicting evidence concerning arbitrability with any party was presented,de novo review is proper.
no disputed factual issues are presented here.
as case law recognizes,when the trial court decision on arbitrability is based upon resolution of disputed facts,we review the decision for substantial evidence.norcal mutual ins.newton,supra,th at.but that rule does not apply when issues presented as factual questions are actually legal ones.ibid.
here,the facts bearing on the trial court decision derive solely from the language of plaintiff complaint and from the terms of the license agreement,neither of which is in dispute.for that reason,the doctrine of implied factual findings does not come into play.see in re marriage of arceneaux cal d,foster poultry farms th,whittington mckinney d.
nor does the consideration of equitable estoppel principles change the review standard in this case.although equitable estoppel is generally a question of fact,it is a question of law when the facts are undisputed and only one reasonable conclusion can be drawn from them.holyoke homes,lp california coastal com.th,question of whether plaintiffs should be estopped to contest the commission jurisdiction was subject to de novo review.in this case,the parties do not dispute the facts but rather whether those facts constitute sufficient legal basis for equitable estoppel.metalclad,supra,th at.since application of the equitable estoppel doctrine here depends entirely on the allegations of the complaint,that aspect of the case presents questions of law for our independent review.
this case does not involve any discretionary rulings.
when the trial court makes a discretionary decision under section c,the reviewing court will affirm unless an abuse of discretion is shown.mercury,supra,cal th at.but that deferential review standard does not apply unless a discretionary ruling was made under section c.
the court discretion under section,subdivision c does not come into play until it is ascertained that the subdivision applies,which requires the threshold determination of whether there are claims against at least one of the parties to the litigation a nonsignatory.rowe exline,supra,th at,fn.when a nonsignatory has the right to enforce an arbitration agreement based on application of the equitable estoppel doctrine,section c does not come into play.rowe exline,at.in such cases,the reviewing court need not determine whether the trial court selection among the alternative dispositions offered by the subdivision was an abuse of discretion.ibid.as we explain below,that is the case here.
having determined that de novo review is proper,we now turn to the substantive issues raised by defendants,beginning with those involving ciphergen.
plaintiff claims against ciphergen 
defendants provided a sufficient evidentiary predicate for their motion to compel arbitration.
at the outset,plaintiff challenges the foundation for defendants motion to compel arbitration.as noted above,a party seeking arbitration must provide prima facie evidence of a written agreement to arbitrate the controversy in question.rosenthal great western fin.securities,supra,cal th at.according to plaintiff,defendants never alleged facts support ing the existence of an agreement to arbitrate the disputed issues,and they never provided any evidence supporting any claim that is a party to an arbitration agreement.in plaintiff view,defendants can not rely on the allegations of the complaint to carry their initial burden,first because defendants actually deny all of mas claims including presumably,its alternative allegation that succeeded to ciphergen assets and also because the mixed allegations of the complaint on which defendants rely can not be used as evidentiary admissions.
in positing defendants denial of its claims as a basis for refusing arbitration,plaintiff relies on brodke alphatec spine,th brodke.as the brodke court observed in seeking enforcement of the contract,defendants have the burden under section to allege the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate.their petition serves the function of a complaint for specific performance.citation.absent an allegation of the existence of an agreement to arbitrate,the petition fails to state a cause of action for specific performance.id.at see also toal tardif th.distinguishing between pleading and proof of the agreement to arbitrate,brodke held defendants can not rely on the allegations in the complaint to meet their pleading burden.while plaintiffs admissions are an appropriate means by which the existence of an agreement may be proved,there is simply no reason to prove anything until the moving party alleges the existence of that which is to be proved.ibid.in brodke,defendants did not affirmatively allege the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate.they did the opposite.they contest ed the existence or validity of any such agreements with plaintiffs.thus,defendants failed to satisfy the most basic statutory prerequisite to granting the allege the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate.id.at.the brodke court rejected the notion that a party petitioning to enforce an arbitration clause may simultaneously deny the existence of the very contract sought to be enforced.id.at.and it discerned no public policy reason to compel the enforcement of a contract on behalf of a party who denies the very existence of the contract sought to be enforced.id.at.
plaintiff reliance on brodke is misplaced.the facts here are entirely dissimilar.in contrast to brodke,defendants here are not disputing the existence of the agreement alleged in the complaint.brodke,supra,th at defendants contested the existence of any written agreements with plaintiffs.to the contrary,defendants affirmatively asserted the existence of the license agreement in their moving papers.moreover,defendants made a positive showing that an agreement to arbitrate exists,by submitting a copy of the settlement agreement as an exhibit to fung declaration.adajar rwr homes,th,where the defendant seeking arbitration did not produce a copy of the documents claimed to incorporate the arbitration clause,it failed to prove the existence of an arbitration contract binding the plaintiffs.
in this case,defendants made a sufficient prima facie showing of an agreement to arbitrate,based not only on the allegations of the complaint but also on their moving papers and on their proffer of the settlement agreement.a plain reading of the statute indicates that as a preliminary matter the court is only required to make a finding of the agreement existence,not an evidentiary determination of its validity.condee longwood management th.in this case,defendants carried their initial burden of showing an agreement to arbitrate.
the arbitration agreement covers plaintiff claims against ciphergen.
here,plaintiff and ciphergen agreed to arbitrate any dispute concerning the interpretation or enforcement of the terms of the settlement agreement,the license agreement,and other specified contracts,but not any other disputes 
plaintiff concedes the arbitrability of two of its five claims against ciphergen,for breach of contract and declaratory relief,asserted in the first and ninth causes of action of the complaint.in the trial court,plaintiff argued the second,third and fourth causes of action against ciphergen do not seek to interpret or enforce the license agreement.in this court,without identifying particular causes of action,plaintiff states that it did not consent to arbitrate its tort or equity claims against either ciphergen or.based on these statements,we assume that plaintiff disputes the arbitrability of these claims against ciphergen a the second cause of action,for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing b the third cause of action,for fraud and c the fourth cause of action,for an accounting.
as we now explain,each falls within the scope of the arbitration clause.
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
the prerequisite for any action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is the existence of a contractual relationship between the parties,since the covenant is an implied term in the contract.smith city and county of san francisco d.the covenant does not exist independently of the underlying contract.spinks equity residential briarwood apartments th.generally,the implied covenant operates to protect the express covenants or promises of the contract.mcclain octagon plaza,llc th.the precise nature and extent of the duties imposed under the implied covenant thus depend upon the purposes of the contract.ibid.
in this case,the factual basis for plaintiff claim of breach of the implied covenant is its allegation that ciphergen deceived plaintiff about the nature of ciphergen transaction with,in order to facilitate its assignment of rights under the license agreement without first obtaining plaintiff consent and without paying royalties on the payment received from.apart from the allegations of deception,this cause of action rests on the same basis as plaintiff claim for breach of contract,which alleges assignment without consent and failure to make the required royalty payment.
plaintiff claim falls within the arbitration clause,which requires arbitration of any dispute concerning the interpretation or enforcement of specified agreements,including the license agreement.similarly worded arbitration clauses have been held to subsume claims for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.for example,an arbitration clause covering any dispute of any kind whatsoever,regarding the meaning,interpretation or enforcement of the provisions of this agreement was applied to a claim for breach of covenant in vianna,supra,th.as the court explained there,given the strong policy favoring arbitration,plaintiff agreement to arbitrate any dispute regarding enforcement of the provisions of the contract plainly covers a claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.id.at see also,boucher,supra,th at.
as settled case law recognizes,a complaint sounding in tort will not in itself prevent arbitration if the underlying agreement embraces the disputed matter.merrick writers guild of america,west,supra,d at.a long line of california and federal cases holds that claims framed in tort are subject to contractual arbitration provisions when they arise out of the contractual relationship between t
