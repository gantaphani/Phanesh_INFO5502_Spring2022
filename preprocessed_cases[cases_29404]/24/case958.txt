the department of treasury,internal revenue service irs,petitions this court to review an august,order by the federal labor relations authority flra.the flra,along with the intervenor,the national treasury employees union nteu,has this court to enforce the flra order.for the following reasons,we will deny the irs petition for review and grant the flra for enforcement.
factual background 
the facts underlying this case are not in dispute.in,the irs temporarily assigned revenue officers and revenue agents from its tacoma,everett,and bellevue,washington offices to work at the seattle district headquarters.these employees assisted with and telephone customers.
at all times relevant to this case,the irs and the nteu operated under a collective bargaining agreement cba.article,section of the cba stated that,w hen an employee travels from residence to a point of destination within official duty station,should not be required to leave home any earlier or arrive home any later than does when travels to and from usual assigned place of business.the tacoma,everett,bellevue,and seattle offices were all located within the same official duty station.
the nteu filed a grievance asserting that the irs failed to compensate the transferred employees for their increased commute time in violation of article,section of the cba.in july,the arbitrator found that article,section applied to the affected employees.the arbitrator also determined that the provision would allow for compensation for the extra commute time.furthermore,the arbitrator found that the cba provision constituted an express provision,which permitted compensation to these federal employees under the act.the arbitrator stated that the irs violated the flsa fair labor standards act,by not permitting employees to travel to and from the seattle jackson federal building in accordance with the procedure required by article,section.thus,the arbitrator sustained the grievance and ordered the irs to cease and desist from failing or refusing to implement article,section of the cba.
the irs filed exceptions to the arbitrator award with the flra.before the flra,the irs raised several arguments the arbitrator award was contrary to law because b prohibited federal employees from being compensated for commute time article,section of the cba fell short of being the type of express provision of a contract necessary to fall under b of the act and article,section was not a clear statement of an agreement to allow payment to affected employees for their commute time.the flra denied the exceptions.united states dep t of treasury internal revenue,wl.it rejected the latter two arguments on the merits.with respect to the first argument,the flra concluded that the irs had failed to make this argument to the arbitrator.thus,pursuant to the flra refused to consider this new argument on appeal of the arbitrator award.
after the flra denied the exceptions,the irs refused to implement the arbitrator award.as a result,the nteu filed an unfair labor practice charge.the nteu asserted that the irs failed to comply with the arbitrator award as required by and.it argued that this constituted an unfair labor practice under a.initially,the flra determined that the nteu unfair labor practice charge was untimely.however,the circuit reversed and remanded the matter back to the flra for consideration on the merits.see treasury employees union fed.labor relations.
on remand,the irs did not dispute that it failed to implement the arbitrator award.however,it argued that it did not commit an unfair labor practice because implementing the arbitrator award would have required the irs to engage in an illegal act of compensating the affected employees for their travel time.specifically,the irs asserted that the doctrine of sovereign immunity precluded an order of monetary relief absent a showing of an express waiver by the united states.once again,the irs argued that precluded paying the employees for their commute time.
the flra considered the sovereign immunity argument on the merits after noting that the issue could be raised at any time.the flra determined that had no affect on the sovereign immunity issue because b waived the government sovereign immunity under the circumstances of this case.therefore,the flra determined that the arbitrator award was enforceable,and that the irs violated a,by failing to comply with the arbitrator award.it ordered the irs to cease and desist from failing to comply with the arbitrator award.the flra ordered that bargaining unit employees who were required to travel outside their normal tour of duty to their temporary duty assignment be identified,including the length of their temporary assignment and affected bargaining unit employees be compensated for time spent commuting to their temporary duty assignment.the irs brought this petition for review order and the flra for enforcement of its order.
ii.appellate jurisdiction and standard of review 
this court has appellate jurisdiction over the flra order pursuant to a.w e will set aside only flra decisions that are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law.treasury employees union nteu fed.labor relations,cir quoting a.we review de novo the flra interpretation of a statute that it does not administer.see id.citations omitted see also united states dep t of air force fed.labor relations,noting that no deference is accorded to flra interpretation of the flsa because congress specifically delegated to the office of personnel management the authority to administer the act provisions on overtime pay.
iii.discussion 
the issue presented in this case is whether the flra award of compensation to those affected employees was in error because it violated the united states sovereign immunity.the parties dispute whether the united states has waived sovereign immunity under the act.the irs asserts that the act does not expressly waive sovereign immunity.the flra and the nteu counter by arguing that the act must be read as a complement to the flsa under these circumstances.
sovereign immunity,the flsa and the act 
we will consider the issue of sovereign immunity on the merits because it can be raised at any time by the government,as it goes to a court jurisdiction.see settles united states parole comm n,citing brown sec y of army.indeed,as the supreme court has noted,i t is axiomatic that the united states may not be sued without its consent and that the existence of consent is a prerequisite for jurisdiction.united states mitchell,d.
the waiver of the united states sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in the statutory text and will not be implied.see lane pena,d.furthermore,a waiver of the government sovereign immunity will be strictly construed,in terms of its scope,in favor of the sovereign.id.citing united states williams,d library of cong.shaw,d lehman nakshian,d.additionally,a statute legislative history can not supply a waiver that does not appear clearly in any statutory text the unequivocal expression of elimination of sovereign immunity that we insist upon is an expression in statutory text.id.quoting united states nordic,d.
the flsa was enacted in,and,among other things,granted covered employees statutory rights to overtime compensation.see.these rights are enforceable under the flsa through various remedies,as stated at in anderson clemens pottery,the supreme court defined to include the time spent by employees walking from their time clocks to their workstations.in response to anderson,congress passed the act in.see a finding that the flsa has been interpreted judicially in disregard of customs,practices,and contracts between employers and employees.the act pared back the definition of workweek set forth in anderson.indeed,as one court has noted with respect to the act 
w alking,riding,or traveling to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform,and activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or activities are excluded from flsa protections by the act employers need not pay employees ov
