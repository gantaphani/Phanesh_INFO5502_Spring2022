in this case,we are called on to decide whether our recent decision in jespersen th,d,which held that a claim for legal malpractice is not subject to a special motion to strike pursuant to code of civil procedure section,the statute section applies to the situation where the claim is attorney breach of duty of loyalty.we conclude that jespersen applies,and that the motion to strike should not have been granted.
factual and procedural background 
this is the second time these parties have been before us.in the prior case we were asked to determine whether res judicata foreclosed the claim of appellants michel benasra,denys goulin,and pour le bebe,plb,for breach of duty of loyalty against respondent mitchell,silberberg knupp ms k,who had represented appellants opponent,guess,in an arbitration the trial court had granted a defense motion for summary judgment based on the claim preclusion aspect of res judicata,because the arbitration panel had denied a motion to disqualify brought by appellants,thereby impliedly ruling that no breach of duty of loyalty occurred.we reversed.
this appeal is also from a ruling in favor of respondents.after the matter was remanded to the trial court,appellants were granted leave to amend the complaint to add two former ms k partners,respondents daniel petrocelli and robert welsh,who had left the firm while the appeal was pending.
respondents filed a special motion to strike pursuant to section.respondents argued that their representation of appellants rival in an arbitration came under section in that it was an act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,subd.e.
on the merits of the motion to strike,respondents presented evidence that they did not represent appellants at the time of the guess arbitration,and that there was no substantial relationship between the matters in which they formerly represented appellants and the guess arbitration.respondents further argued that appellants must prove that ms k actually obtained and improperly disclosed confidential information and that those disclosures actually caused them damage by changing the outcome of the guess arbitration.petrocelli and welsh argued separately that the claims against them were time barred when measured against the november filing of the amended complaint 
appellants opposed the motion to strike,presenting evidence through the declaration of benasra indicating that ms k had begun representation of guess in connection with the arbitration while it was still doing work for appellants or some of them.benasra further stated that petrocelli relentlessly me during the guess arbitration citations about housekeepers,drivers and girlfriends allegedly on plb payroll citation,my apartment in paris citation,a ring i gave to sharon stone citation,and the purported connection between my personal expenses and plb problems in paying royalties citation.while i engaged in no improprieties as the owner of an,ms k nonetheless made an issue of my personal which ms k learned as plb lawyers the declaration also stated that appellants have incurred more than to date in attorneys fees seeking to prevent respondents from breaching their duties of confidentiality and loyalty in connection with matters undertaken for guess adverse to appellants.
appellants separately requested permission to conduct discovery in advance of the motion to strike,seeking information that would show which attorneys at ms k worked on appellants matters and guess matters and when that work was performed.the trial court denied the discovery motion,stating in its order to establish a cause of action for legal malpractice,appellants must demonstrate the existence of a duty of care breach of that duty and damages.clearly appellants do not need any discovery to establish the first and third elements this evidence must be in appellants possession.appellants do not point to any particular discovery requests that relate to the breach of a duty of care by respondents.to establish a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty,appellants must demonstrate the existence of a fiduciary duty breach of that duty and damages.again,the only element on which appellants could possibly need to conduct discovery is breach of the duty.appellants also fail to point to any particular discovery requests that relate to the breach of fiduciary duty.appellants presumably know when respondents represented interests adverse or potentially adverse to theirs.after all,this case concerns respondents representation of guess,in a specific arbitration proceeding.appellants also know the nature of the matters in which the respondents represented them.appellants know or should know what work respondents did for them.thus,appellants should be able to help from respondents how the matters were similar,and the potential for a conflict.
the court granted the motion to strike.the court concluded that since section encompasses any cause of action against a person arising from any statement or writing made in,or in connection with an issue under consideration or review by an official proceeding or body,it applied to the claim before it,which the court characterized as follows appellants are seeking to impose liability on respondents because of their representation of a client in an arbitration proceeding and seek to impose civil liability on respondents from statements and writings made either directly in or in connection with the guess arbitration and judicial proceedings to confirm the award.
turning to the merits,the court reproved appellants for incorporating the benasra declaration in their opposition rather than addressing the issue directly.the court then went on to say assuming,arguendo,that the benasra declaration contains sufficient admissible evidence to establish breaches of the duties at issue and it is not at all clear that it does,the declaration contains no evidence of damages proximately caused by any breach.although benasra claims to have suffered damages in the form of attorneys fees incurred in seeking redress of his grievances,these are not damages proximately caused by the breaches at issue.to establish a prima facie case for legal malpractice or breach of fiduciary duty arising out of respondents representation of guess in the underlying arbitration,benasra must present competent,admissible evidence tending to establish that the underlying arbitration award would have been more favorable,or would not have been confirmed,had the respondents not breached their legal duties.
appeal was taken from the order granting the motion to strike,and the subsequent order granting attorney fees and costs to respondents.the appeals were consolidated by order of this court.
discussion 
section provides in pertinent part a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.the special motion to strike provides a mechanism for screening out meritless suits at an early stage.see jarrow formulas,lamarche cal th,d.
