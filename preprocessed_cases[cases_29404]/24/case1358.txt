the county of sonoma the county seeks relief from an order of the superior court compelling the county to arbitrate with real party in interest sonoma county law enforcement association sclea under the procedures established in code of civil procedure section et in county of riverside superior court cal th,d,riverside,the california supreme court held an earlier version of that statute unconstitutional,because the statute impermissibly infringed upon home rule powers reserved to local governments by article xi of the california constitution.riverside,at,d.the legislature amended the statute in response to the supreme court decision.but the county contends the amended version continues to intrude upon its constitutional authority to establish compensation and terms of employment for county employees.we agree with the county and will therefore grant its petition for writ of mandate.
the statutory background 
the county challenge focuses on the constitutionality of section et,but that statute can not be understood in isolation.because this case concerns the collective bargaining process between local government agencies and public employee organizations,the act mmba,government code sections,is also relevant to our analysis.see voters for responsible retirement board of supervisors cal th,d,voters for responsible retirement.we will therefore summarize the relevant provisions of the mmba before setting out the history of current section et.
the mmba was enacted to provid e a reasonable method of resolving disputes regarding wages,hours,and other terms and conditions of employment between public employers and public employee organizations,subd.a.the mmba covers employees of any public agency,a term that embraces all municipalities and local governmental subdivisions of the state,including counties,subds.c,d.the statute grants public employees the right to form and join employee organizations for the purpose of representation on matters of relations.
as pertinent here,the negotiation process established by the mmba requires public agencies to meet and confer in good faith with representatives of recognized employee organizations regarding wages,hours,and other terms and conditions of employment.if these meetings produce an agreement,the representatives of the parties must jointly prepare a written memorandum of understanding mou.the statute makes explicit,however,that the mou shall not be binding,but rather must be presented to the public agency governing body for determination.once the governing body approves the mou,it then becomes binding on both parties.voters for responsible retirement,supra,cal th at,d.
government code section states that the process should include adequate time for the resolution of impasses where specific procedures for such resolution are contained in local rule,regulation,or ordinance,or when such procedures are utilized by mutual consent.thus,if the parties reach an impasse in their negotiations,the public agency and the employee organization may agree to appointment of a mediator.in addition to mediation,the mmba authorizes public agencies to adopt additional procedures for dispute resolution,subd.a.if after meeting and conferring in good faith,the parties have reached impasse and exhausted any applicable impasse procedures,a public agency that is not required to proceed to interest arbitration may implement its last,best,and final offer,but shall not implement a mou.in those circumstances,the mmba permits unilateral implementation of a public agency last,best,and final offer.
senate bill 
in,the legislature adopted senate bill reg.sess.senate bill,which added title to part of the code of civil procedure.stats,ch,codified at code civ,et as initially enacted,senate bill provided for compulsory binding arbitration of labor disputes between employee organizations representing firefighters and law enforcement officers and the local agencies employing them then as now,the statute provided that if in the course of labor negotiations,an employer and an employee organization reached an impasse over matters within the scope of arbitration,the employee organization but not the employer could request referral of the dispute to an arbitration panel,subd.a.economic issues,including salaries,wages,benefits,and all other forms of remuneration,fall within the scope of arbitration,subd.g.
the arbitration panel established by senate bill consists of three members,with the employer and the employee organization each choosing one member,who then designate an impartial person with experience in labor and management dispute resolution to act as chairperson of the arbitration panel,subd.b.once selected,the arbitration panel is empowered to meet with the parties or their representatives,to make inquiries and investigations,to hold hearings,and to take any other action the panel deems appropriate,subd.a.the panel also has broad authority to subpoena witnesses,administer oaths,take testimony,issue subpoenas duces tecum and to require the production of the parties records,books,and papers,subd.b.
prior to the panel hearings,each of the parties is required to submit its last best offer of settlement as to each of the issues within the scope of arbitration,subd.a.after conclusion of the hearing,the panel decides the disputed contract issues by selecting,without modification,the last best offer that most nearly complies with a list of factors traditionally taken into consideration in the determination of those matters within the scope of arbitration,subds.b,c.the statute provides that the panel must then deliver its decision to the parties,but the decision is not to be publicly disclosed for a period of five days,during which time the parties may meet privately and amend or modify the decision by mutual agreement,subd.a.under the original version of the statute,the panel decision was made public at the conclusion of the period and automatically became binding on the parties.former,subd.b,as enacted by stats,ch.the statute empowers the arbitration panel to have the decision made part of any existing mou,subd.b.
county of riverside superior court 
in,the california supreme court declared senate bill unconstitutional.riverside,supra,cal th at,d.the high court determined that the legislation violated two separate sections of article xi of the california constitution.id.at,d.the court held that the statute violated section,subdivision b section,subdivision b of that article,which states that a county governing body shall provide for the compensation of its employees.id.at,d.it further held that the legislation was inconsistent with section,subdivision a section,subdivision a,which provides that t he legislature may not delegate to a private person or body power to make,control,appropriate,supervise,or interfere with county money,or perform municipal functions.id.at,d.
the supreme court held that senate bill contravened section,subdivision b by compelling the county to submit to binding arbitration of compensation issues.riverside,supra,cal th at,d.the court explained that the language of section,subdivision b clearly provides that the county,not the state,not someone else,shall provide for the compensation of its employees.riverside,at,d,italics in original.the statute violated section,subdivision b because it permits the union to change the county governing board from the body that sets compensation for its employees to just another party in arbitration and thereby deprives the county of the authority that section,subdivision b,specifically gives to counties.riverside,at,d.
the court rejected the notion that the statute could be upheld because it involved a matter of statewide concern.riverside,supra,cal th at,d.it acknowledged that the legislature may regulate as to matters of statewide concern even if the regulation impinges to a limited extent citation on powers the constitution specifically reserves to counties or charter cities.riverside,at,d.but the court distinguished two prior decisions in which it had upheld such statewide gates cal d,and people ex rel.seal beach police officers city of seal beach cal d,seal beach because the statutes challenged in those cases had imposed only procedural requirements.riverside,supra,cal th at,d,see seal beach,supra,at,requirement of,does not conflict with charter city authority to propose charter amendments under cal,art.xi,subd.b baggett gates,supra,at,establishing basic rights and protections for peace officers,does not violate charter cities power under cal,art.xi,to regulate police force and to provide or compensation,qualifications,or removal of employees.senate bill,in contrast,was substantive and not procedural,because it took away from counties the authority to establish local salaries and gave that power to an arbitration panel.riverside,supra,cal th at,d.unlike the statute at issue in seal beach,under senate bill,the county governing body did not retain the ultimate power to refuse an agreement and to make its own decisions.riverside,at,d,quoting seal beach,supra,at.
the riverside court also ruled that senate bill was inconsistent with section,subdivision a.riverside,supra,cal th at,d.the court agreed that the legislature has impermissibly delegated to a private arbitration power to interfere with county money by potentially requiring the county to pay higher salaries than it chooses and to perform municipal functions determining compensation for county employees.ibid.
once again,the court rejected the argument that the legislature could delegate the authority to set compensation to the arbitration panel because the delegation involved a matter of statewide concern.riverside,supra,cal th at,d.the court concluded that because section,subdivision b states that the county shall provide for employee compensation,compensating county employees is a municipal function,rather than a statewide concern.riverside,at,d,accord,id.at,d,conc.opn.of george,compensation of county employees is a quintessentially local question.as a consequence,establishing compensation for its employees is for the county to do,and section,subdivision a,prohibits the legislature from delegating that function to a private body.riverside,at,d.
senate bill 
the legislature responded to the decision in riverside by adopting senate bill reg.sess.senate bill.see stats,ch.senate bill amended section,subdivision b and added a new subdivision c to that section.see stats,ch.amended subdivision b now provides at the conclusion of the period,which may be extended by the parties,the arbitration panel decision,as may be amended or modified by the parties pursuant to subdivision a,shall be publicly disclosed and,unless the governing body acts in accordance with subdivision c,shall be binding on all parties,and,if specified by the arbitration panel,be incorporated into and made a part of any existing memorandum of understanding as defined in section of the government code,subd.b,amendment in italics.new subdivision c provides the employer may by unanimous vote of all the members of the governing body reject the decision of the arbitration panel,except as specifically provided to the contrary in a city,county,or city and county charter with respect to the rejection of an arbitration award,subd.c.
in enacting senate bill,the legislature declared that its intent was to m ake title commencing with section of part of the code of civil procedure consistent with the decision of the california supreme court in county of riverside superior court cal th,d.stats,ch,b.
procedural history 
petitioner is a general law county and is a public agency within the meaning of the mmba,subd.c.sclea is the exclusive employee representative of county employees with job classifications in certain law enforcement categories.the county and sclea were previously parties to an mou governing wages,hours,and other terms and conditions of employment for sclea membership.that mou expired by its terms on june.prior to its expiration,the parties began negotiations over a new agreement.they were unable to agree on the terms of a successor mou,and sclea declared an impasse in the negotiations in may.
the parties then proceeded to impasse mediation in accordance with the county employee relations policy.after a number of mediation sessions,the parties were still unable to reach agreement.on august,the county submitted its last,best,and final offer to sclea,but sclea members voted to reject it.further mediation likewise failed to yield an agreement,and on november,sclea formally requested that mediation be closed.
on november,sclea made a written request to submit the dispute to interest arbitration.the county denied the request on december,and expressed its view that the interest arbitration provisions of section et represented an unconstitutional delegation of municipal power to private persons and an illegal impingement on the county plenary authority over the terms and conditions of county employment.sclea later renewed its request for interest arbitration.the record is not entirely clear as to how the county responded to this request,if it responded at all,but it is apparent that the county refused to proceed to arbitration.
the county then notified sclea that it would submit a resolution to the county board of supervisors asking the board to implement unilaterally the terms of the county last,best,and final offer.the board adopted the resolution on january.
on january,sclea filed in the superior court a petition to compel arbitration pursuant to section et.the county opposed the petition to compel arbitration and filed its own seeking declaratory relief.the first cause of action of the county sought a declaration that section et is unconstitutional because the statute vest s in a private body,rather than a duly elected legislative body,the power to set the terms and conditions of county employment.sclea answered the county,and both parties filed for judgment on the pleadings.
the county principal argument below was that section et impinged substantially on its exercise of home rule powers guaranteed by section,subdivision b and section,subdivision a of article xi.it noted that the california supreme court had declared an earlier version of the statute unconstitutional in riverside,and asserted that the amended statute continued to infringe impermissibly on the county authority to provide for the compensation of its employees.the county further argued that the statute impermissibly delegated the municipal function of setting compensation to a private body,interfered with the board of supervisors ability to meet its obligations under the ralph brown act,et,and interfered with county money by imposing on the county the expense of participating in the interest arbitration proceedings.
the parties stipulated to having sclea petition and the issues raised in the county decided in a single proceeding.the superior court held a hearing on the petition and the parties motions for judgment on the pleadings on july.after receiving additional briefing from the parties,on august,the superior court issued an order on submitted matter.the order granted sclea motion for judgment on the pleadings and denied the county as to the county first cause of action the superior court ruled that section et was constitutional.it acknowledged that the process imposed by the statute is procedurally demanding but concluded that the county board of supervisors could convene and vote within five days to reject the arbitration panel award.the court stated,if the arbitrator decision is indeed rejected,the governing body is free to proceed with a determination of the compensation issue.the court therefore ordered the county to submit to arbitration.
the superior court granted a temporary stay of its decision until further order from this court on the county petition for writ of mandate.the county filed its petition in this court on august.the following day,we issued a temporary stay of the superior court august,order and directed sclea to submit a preliminary opposition to the petition,to which the county was permitted to reply.on october,we issued an order to show cause 
discussion 
in this court,the county renews the arguments made below that section et impermissibly infringes upon the county constitutional authority under section,subdivision b and section,subdivision a.after discussing our standard of review,we will first analyze the merits of the parties contentions regarding section,subdivision b before considering their arguments under section,subdivision a 
standard of review 
we accord a presumption of constitutionality to acts of the legislature,particularly when that body has adopted a statute with the relevant constitutional prescriptions clearly in mind.pacific legal foundation brown cal d.but we also must enforce the provisions of our constitution and may not lightly disregard or blink at a clear constitutional mandate.citation.amwest surety ins.wilson cal th,d.

sclea insists that we must deny the county petition unless no set of circumstances exists under which the law will be valid.we think this is a more stringent test than that applied by the california supreme court.see,san remo hotel city and county of san francisco cal th,d,minimum showing required for facial challenge is that statute is unconstitutional in the generality or great majority of cases.we may not uphold the law simply because in some hypothetical situation it might lead to a permissible result.california teachers state of california cal th,d.
ii.section et.violates section,subdivision b because it divests the county governing body of the ultimate authority to provide for employee compensation.
history and purpose of section,subdivision b 
in analyzing the parties arguments concerning section,subdivision b,we are guided by that section history and purpose.see riverside,supra,cal th at,d.the california supreme court reviewed the history of current section,subdivision b in voters for responsible retirement,supra,cal th,d.there,the court explained article xi,section b was originally enacted in june of,as part of a comprehensive revision of article xi,governing the constitutional prerogatives of and limitations on california cities and counties.voters for responsible retirement,at,d.its predecessor was former article xi,section,a provision that had been amended in to transfer control over the compensation of most county employees and officers from the legislature to the boards of supervisors.voters for responsible retirement,at,d.according to the supreme court,the purpose of the amendment was to give greater local autonomy to the setting of salaries for county officers and employees,removing that function from the centralized control of the legislature.id.at,d.thus,under section,subdivision b the county,not the state,not someone else,shall provide for the compensation of its employees.riverside,supra,cal th at,d,italics in original.
riverside drew additional support for this view from the ballot argument in favor of the amendment to former section.riverside,supra,cal th at,d.the argument to the voters stated that the measure gives the board complete authority over the number,method of appointment,terms of office and employment,and compensation of all deputies,assistants,and employees.ballot,special june,argument in favor of,italics added.later,in what our supreme court has termed an authoritative review of the predecessors to present article ix,sections,and dibb county of san diego cal th,d,professor arno van alstyne observed,the purpose of this provision,it seems clear,was to limit the power of the legislature for without it,the authority to enact legislation with respect to compensation of county employees would reside,as before,in the legislature.the vesting of this power in the boards of supervisors was thus apparently intended to be an exclusive vesting.background study relating to article xi,local government cal.const.revision,at.section,subdivision b is therefore a home rule measure,one specifically intended to deprive the legislature of the power to set compensation for county employees and to entrust that authority to county governing bodies.see riverside,supra,cal th at,d.
b.the compensation of county employees is a local,not statewide,concern.
sclea first argues that the statute is valid because it addresses a matter of statewide concern.citing the legislative findings in support of the bill,it contends that section et was enacted to avoid public safety labor strife that might otherwise lead to strikes by firefighters and law enforcement officers.see legislative findings and declarations.we disagree.
the supreme court rejected a virtually identical argument in riverside.riverside,supra,cal th at,d.while conceding that the legislature findings are entitled to great weight,it explained,t he legislature is empowered neither to determine what constitutes a municipal affair nor to change such an affair into a matter of statewide concern.citation.id.at,d.the court then held that compensating county employees is a municipal function.id.at,d.subsequent cases have followed riverside and held that a number of other policies affecting county employee compensation are matters of local,not statewide,concern.see dimon county of los angeles th,d meal periods and pay for missed meal periods curcini county of alameda th,d claims for overtime pay and meal and rest breaks in re work uniform cases th,d payment for work uniforms of county employees.it necessarily follows that the compensation of the county employees is not a matter of statewide concern 
c.the distinction between substantive and procedural regulation of labor relations 
although it held the compensation of county employees to be a local or municipal affair,riverside recognized that the maintenance of stable employment relations between police officers and their employers is a matter of statewide concern.riverside,supra,cal th at,d,quoting baggett gates,supra,cal d at.the court therefore agreed that the constitution does not prohibit the legislature from regulating such matters even if the regulation impinges to a limited extent on powers the california constitution reserves specifically to counties and cities.riverside,supra,d.riverside emphasize d that there is a clear distinction between the substance of a public employee labor issue and the procedure by which it is resolved citation.riverside,supra,cal th at,d.it drew a sharp contrast between cases involving the legislature attempts to regulate actual wage and salary levels and those in which the legislature had established only procedures governing labor relations.id.at,d.in the former category of cases,the court found that the legislature had infringed upon the constitutional rights of other governmental entities.see san francisco labor council regents of university of california cal d,statute requiring university of california to pay employees at least prevailing wages violated powers reserved to regents under art.ix,sonoma county organization of public employees county of sonoma cal d,statute prohibiting distribution of state funds to local public agencies that granted their employees allowances greater than those provided to state employees violated art.xi,subds.c f and art.xi,subd.b.in the latter category of cases,the court had upheld the challenged statutes because they imposed only procedural safeguards and requirements,and had impinged only minimally on home rule powers protected by article xi.seal beach,supra,cal d at,baggett gates,supra,cal d at.
in summary,procedural statutes do not conflict with the constitutional powers of local governments because the governing body of the agency retains the ultimate power to refuse an agreement and to make its own decision.seal beach,supra,cal d at.a statute is substantive,however,if under its provisions the county governing body does not retain the ultimate power to set employee compensation.riverside,supra,cal th at,d.the constitutionality of section et thus turns on whether it permits the county governing body to make the final decision on the compensation of county employees.the answer to this question requires us to examine section et in the context of the public employee labor relations scheme established by the mmba.see building material construction teamsters union farrell cal d,court must interpret provision of statute in context of entire statutory scheme,including statutory provisions in separate codes ailanto properties,city of half moon bay th,d same.
section impermissibly interferes with the governing body constitutional authority under section,subdivision b to establish employee compensation.
the county argues that the requirements of subdivisions b and c of section conflict with the county plenary legislative authority under section,subdivision b to provide for the compensation of employees.the county argument is twofold.first,it contends that under the procedures established by senate bill,it is the arbitration panel that establishes employee compensation,and the authority of the county governing board of reduced to a mere veto power.it asserts that this deprives the board of its constitutional right to set the compensation of county employees and leaves it with nothing more than the power to reject the arbitration panel decision,and then only by a unanimous vote.second,the county maintains that the unanimous vote requirement of section,subdivision c is inconsistent with section,subdivision b because the constitution grants the power to set employee compensation to the governing body,and in the county view,this can only mean a majority of the governing body.because section,subdivisions b and c make the arbitration panel decision binding on the county even if a majority of the board votes to reject the decision,the county argues that the statute has deprived the governing body of its authority to provide for the compensation of county employees.the county argument therefore turns on the proper interpretation of the term governing body in section,subdivision b.
sclea responds that section,subdivision b grants the legislature the power to provide for an elected governing body in each county.cal,art.ix,subd.b.according to sclea,this power necessarily includes the power to determine the number of board members and quorum and voting procedures.it contends that the unanimous vote requirement of section,subdivision c is merely procedural.sclea also asserts that the unanimous vote requirement does not,as the county contends,prescribe rule by the minority because a single vote could decide the fate of any proposed piece of legislation.it cites a number of constitutional and statutory provisions imposing supermajority requirements on the legislature and local governments and argues that despite such supermajority requirements,the resulting decisions are still considered actions of the legislative body to which the requirement applies.finally,in its supplemental brief,sclea argues that the unanimous vote requirement of section,subdivision c represents the legislature attempt to create a balance on the governing body power to implement its last,best,and final offer unilaterally.
the nature of interest arbitration 
before addressing the parties arguments,we pause briefly to explain the nature of interest arbitration,since the legal effect of this type of arbitration is relevant to our analysis.interest arbitration concerns the resolution of labor disputes over the formation of a collective bargaining agreement.grenig,alternative dispute resolution ed.dispute resolution methods.it differs from the more commonly understood practice of grievance arbitration because,unlike grievance arbitration,it focuses on what the terms of a new agreement should be,rather than the meaning of the terms of the old agreement.citation.hess collection winery agricultural labor relations bd.th,d hess.put another way,interest arbitration is concerned with the acquisition of future rights,while grievance arbitration involves rights already accrued,usually under an existing collective bargaining agreement.school comm.of hanover hanover teachers,fn,fn.an interest arbitrator thus does not function as a judicial officer,construing the terms of an existing contract and applying them to a particular set of facts.hess,supra,th at,d.instead,the interest arbitrator function is effectively legislative,because the arbitrator is fashioning new contractual obligations.ibid.
for these reasons,interest arbitration is sometimes referred to as contract arbitration or arbitration.stockton metropolitan transit dist.amalgamated transit union d.consequently,as professor later justice joseph grodin recognized,when binding interest arbitration is applied in the public sector,it may result in the arbitrator involvement in matters that extend beyond those over which labor and management customarily bargain in private sector disputes binding interest arbitration may push the arbitrator into the realm of social planning and fiscal policy.grodin,political aspects of public sector interest arbitration cal.the obvious reason for this is that costs arising from the terms of a binding interest arbitration award must be paid out of governmental funds.for example,if an interest arbitrator were to accept the demand by a firefighters union that a local government add an engine company,this might require the building of a new fire house or the purchase of new equipment,and could very well intrude upon management role of formulating policy.see fire fighters union city of vallejo cal d.a decision in a binding public sector interest arbitration proceeding might therefore require the governmental employer either to cut other items from its budget or to increase taxes.grodin,supra,cal.at.
section affects a governing body legislative powers.
the foregoing discussion supports the county contention that section affects matters ordinarily falling within the legislative powers of a county board of supervisors.the fixing of the salaries of county employees is unquestionably a legislative function.carrier robbins d,see alameda county employees county of alameda d.it is equally clear that t he fixing of the number of employees,the salaries and employee benefits is an integral part of the statutory procedure for the adoption of the county budget hicks board of supervisors d.the exercise of the board legislative power in budgetary matters entails a complex balancing of public needs in many and varied areas with the finite financial resources available for distribution among those demands it is,and indeed must be,the responsibility of the legislative body to weigh those needs and set priorities for the utilization of the limited revenues available.county of butte superior court d.in so doing,the board must weigh a number of other factors besides the level of the union members salaries.california teachers ingwerson th,d.the county is therefore correct in contending that section affects the board creative legislative function to set employee wages.
section,subdivision c grants a local governing body only a veto over the arbitration panel decision.
we also agree with the county characterization of the governing body authority under section,subdivision c.under that section,a governing body sole power is to reject the decision of the arbitration panel.this limited power of rejection is more akin to the veto power traditionally associated with the executive than it is to the legislative power to make laws.compare people bunn cal th,d,legislative function embraces the power to weigh competing interests and determine social policy with harbor deukmejian cal d,noting qualified and destructive legislative function of gubernatorial veto.the parties have referred us to no case involving a statute with an analogous voting requirement,and our own research discloses none.nevertheless,the few available authorities support the county view that the statute allows the governing body no more than a veto over the arbitration panel decision.consumer energy,power of one house of congress to block implementation of agency rule described as veto state ex rel.barker manchin,power of legislative committee or full legislature to sustain or reverse agency regulation constitutes a legislative veto power comparable to the authority vested in the governor.that is,the effect of the governing body rejection is exclusively negative,frustrating an act without substituting anything in its place.harbor deukmejian,supra,cal d at.thus,where the county governing body acts in accordance with section,subdivision c,subd.b,it does not thereby provide for the compensation of county employees.the result of such a vote is only to prevent another body from establishing binding terms for the compensation of county employees.
the term governing body in section,subdivision b necessarily means a majority of the governing body.
we turn now to the crux of the county argument.section,subdivision b grants the county governing body the power to establish the compensation of county employees although the constitutional provision does not specifically say that only a majority of the governing body,as opposed to a minority thereof,may set compensation,for the reasons we discuss below,no other construction of section,subdivision b is reasonable,or indeed even permissible.permitting a minority of a governing body to set the compensation of county employees by making the arbitration panel decision binding on the county would be inconsistent with both longstanding statutory rules of interpretation and established california case law,as well as deeply offensive to basic principles of representative democracy.
in determining how the term governing body in section,subdivision b is to be interpreted,we are guided first by rules of construction established by the legislature itself.both code of civil procedure section and civil code section provide words giving a joint authority to three or more public officers or other persons are construed as giving such authority to a majority of them,unless it is otherwise expressed in the act giving authority.see also,subd.same.the california supreme court long ago described this as a necessary rule,and established by the general authorities jacobs board of supervisors cal.the board of supervisors of a general law county is composed of five members,subd.a.thus,section,subdivision b grants the authority to establish employee compensation to a collective body of more than three board of section,subdivision b does not otherwise express that the power granted shall be exercised by other than a majority.the cited statutes would thus seem to compel the conclusion that the term governing body in section,subdivision b means a majority of the governing body.
this conclusion is bolstered by california case law.more than years ago,in people hecht cal,our supreme court elaborated on the power enjoyed by a majority of a collective legislative body if a majority possesses all the authority of the whole,then such majority must be competent to its exercise.for all practical purposes the majority becomes the full board.it is the all the authority conferred upon the whole id.at,italics added accord,mcquillin,municipal corporations ed.council meetings,fn.omitted the act of a majority of a board at a meeting duly held is the act of the body.more recently,division one of this district explained that if a board is composed of five members three of such members constitute a majority capable and competent to exercise the authority of the whole board.ursino superior court d.accord,delegation of authority,ops.cal.since a majority of the governing body possesses all of the authority of the whole and effectively becomes the full board people hecht,supra,cal.at,section,subdivision b allocation to the governing body of the power to establish employee compensation must be read as allocating that power to a majority of the governing body.
california statutory law provides additional support for this reading.the firmly established common law rule is that legislative action is only valid if it has been approved by a majority of the members elected.martinez,local government law processes of governance.this rule finds specific expression in the government code provisions relating to the boards of supervisors of general law counties.under government code section,n o act of the board shall be valid or binding unless a majority of all members concur therein.italics added.in addition,under the ralph brown act,government code section et,action taken means a collective decision made by a majority of the members of a legislative body,italics added.the legislature has therefore determined that only a majority of a county board of supervisors has the power to pass valid or binding legislation.
the common law and statutory rules requiring that legislative bodies act only by majority vote reflect the deeply embedded principle of majority rule in a democratic society martinez,local government law,supra,to.in legislative bodies,the principle of majority rule is of the very essence it is in fact the basis upon which popular largely rests.mason,manual of legislative procedure vote required,ch,see also madison,the federalist cooke ed describing majority rule as the republican principle,which enables the majority to defeat a minority views by regular vote.simply put,in a representative democracy such as ours,a simple majority vote is a formal requirement in our system for giving policies legal effect and legitimacy.roberts chemerinsky,entrenchment of ordinary legislation a reply to professors posner and vermeule,cal.
the foregoing discussion makes clear that section interferes with the constitutional authority of governing bodies to set county employee compensation under section,subdivision b,because the statute permits less than a majority of the governing body to set employee compensation by making the arbitrators decision final and binding upon the county.section,subdivision b provides that the arbitration panel decision will become final and binding unless the governing body acts in accordance with subdivision c,subd.b.subdivision c of that section permits the governing body to veto the arbitration panel decision only by a unanimous vote of all of the body members,subd.c.therefore,the terms of the statute empower a minority of a board of supervisors to make the arbitrators decision binding on the county,even if the majority of that body disagrees.
as we explained above see part,ante,the setting of employee compensation is a legislative act that is part of the governing body budgetary process.thus,the statute purports to authorize the adoption of a legislative the imposition of binding contractual obligations upon a county and its if a majority or supermajority of the democratically elected representatives of the people rejects the arbitration panel decision because three members must concur in order to act vote,supra,ops.cal.at,the votes of one or two members of a governing body simply can not be construed as an act of the governing body itself.see,price tennant community services dist.d.it is nonsensical to talk about a quorum or majority of one.
the anomalous nature of section procedure becomes even more apparent when we compare it to the usual manner in which the compensation of county employees is established.ordinarily under the mmba,an mou between a public agency and a public employee organization becomes binding only if it is affirmatively approved by the governing body of the local agency.see bagley city of manhattan beach cal d,reflect s the legislative decision that the ultimate determinations are to be made by the governing body itself glendale city employees,city of glendale cal d,only the governing body favorable determination engenders a binding agreement.in contrast,the statute before us does not require a favorable determination by the county governing body.instead,it provides that at the conclusion of the period,the arbitration panel decision shall be binding on the parties unless rejected by a unanimous vote of all members of the governing body,subds.b,c.this means that the arbitrators decision will become binding where there is no legislative action at all.the decision also becomes binding if it receives an unfavorable determination from the majority of the governing body,so long as at least one member of the body either votes to accept the decision or does not vote.
as our supreme court has observed,local governments function both as employers and as democratic organs of government.seal beach,supra,cal d at.the court has upheld the legislature regulation of public employee labor relations where the burden on the local government democratic functions is minimal.ibid.by permitting a minority of a county governing body to impose binding obligations on a county,it is plain that section imposes far more than a minimal burden on the democratic functions of local government.it therefore can not be viewed as a mere procedural regulation of county labor relations.see riverside,supra,cal th at,d.it is instead substantive,in that it impinges substantially on the authority of local governing bodies to provide for the compensation of their employees,and it therefore conflicts with the constitution reservation of this power to local governments.id.at,d.
in sum,as we have explained above,the term governing body in section,subdivision b can only refer to a majority of the governing body.thus,a statute that permits less than a majority of the governing body to establish the compensation of county employees can not be squared with the governing body constitutional authority to provide for county employee compensation.we therefore agree with the county that section violates article xi,section,subdivision b of the california constitution.
section,subdivision c is not analogous to a supermajority requirement.
sclea seeks support from constitutional and statutory provisions requiring a supermajority for the passage of legislation,but these do not assist its argument.see,cal,art.iv,subd.d requiring vote of legislature for passage of urgency statutes art.iv,subd.a requiring vote of legislature to override governor veto art.xiii,requiring vote of legislature to authorize county boards of supervisors to exempt certain real property from taxation art.xiiia,requiring vote of legislature to increase state taxes art.xviii,requiring vote of legislature to propose amendments or revisions to constitution code civ,requiring vote of board of supervisors for certain uses of county property acquired by eminent domain,requiring unanimous vote of board of supervisors to convey property to city,requiring vote of board of supervisors to change budget after public hearing pub.contract code requiring vote for alteration of public works contract.all of the provisions cited demand a heightened majority for passage of certain acts of a legislative body.when such supermajority requirements are imposed,governmental action is conditioned upon the ability of its proponents to secure the support of more than a bare majority.westbrook mihaly cal d,italics added,overruled on another ground as stated in los angeles county transportation com.richmond cal d.by limiting the power of a simple majority of the body to change the status quo through the passage of legislation,supermajority requirements afford minorities power to preserve the status quo.westbrook mihaly,supra,cal d at,italics added.the intent of such a requirement is to deter the action to which it applies,since it conditions such action on a degree of consensus unusual in our pluralistic society.citation.los angeles county transportation com.richmond,supra,cal d at,italics added see gordon lance,d supermajority rules make it more difficult for some kinds of governmental action to be taken.
section,in contrast,does not require a supermajority of the governing body to change the status quo through the adoption of legislation it permits a minority of the governing body to perform a legislative act.section imposes a unanimous vote requirement on local governing bodies not to approve their own measures,but to block the action of a wholly separate body in other words,under section,a minority of the governing body can force a change in the status quo by making the arbitration panel decision binding.thus,as we have seen,a legislative measure will be adopted,and the county taxpayers will be bound by the decision of an unelected arbitration panel,if a single member of the local governing body either votes to accept the arbitrators decision or simply does not vote,subds.b,c.thus,section purports to permit the performance of a legislative setting of county employee a minority of the governing body.properly viewed,section,subdivision c is thus not a supermajority requirement at all.it is a provision for minority rule.
sclea policy arguments are unpersuasive.
in its supplemental brief,sclea contends that the inclusion of the unanimous vote requirement in section,subdivision c was intended as a balance on the local governing body power of unilateral implementation under government code section.sclea contends that the arbitration process would be meaningless if governing bodies could reject the arbitrators decision by a simple majority vote,and the union advances a number of policy arguments in support of the unanimity requirement.sclea arguments are unpersuasive.
first,whether the legislature intended the unanimous vote requirement as a balance or check upon a local governing body power of unilateral implementation is not directly relevant to the question before us.we are here asked to decide whether section comports with the powers reserved to county governments under article xi of the california constitution.the county constitutional argument does not challenge the motives and goals of the legislature as good or bad.it simply challenges whether the power exists under the constitution to do that which was done or is proposed to be done.howard jarvis taxpayers fresno metropolitan projects authority th,d howard jarvis.whatever the legislature goals may have been,we are called upon to address only the much narrower question of the statute constitutionality.id.at,d.
second,we can not agree with sclea argument that allowing a simple majority of a governing body to reject an arbitration panel decision makes the arbitration process meaningless.such an argument proves too much.one might just as well argue that the requirement of the mmba is meaningless because the governing body retains the ultimate authority to refuse to agree on any particular issue in the negotiations,claremont police officers city of claremont cal th,d.
finally,we reject sclea arguments in support of the unanimous vote requirement.sclea contends that the unanimity requirement ensures that section et is not used offensively against employee organizations.we are frankly puzzled by this argument,because the decision to invoke the procedures of section et rests entirely in the hands of the employee organization.section,subdivision a allows only the employee organization,not the public agency,to request interest arbitration,subd.a the employee organization may,by written notification to the employer,request that their differences be submitted to an arbitration panel,italics added zerger,et,california public sector labor relations impasse resolution,only an employee organization may request interest arbitration.we therefore fail to see how a local government could ever use the procedure offensively against an employee organization.
sclea also expresses the view that without a unanimity requirement,the cost and effort required for an employee organization to challenge a governing body conduct during negotiations would substantially increase.sclea cites no authority for this argument,but it appears to be premised on the assumption that an employee organization will be forced to submit to arbitration to exhaust its administrative remedies before bringing an unfair labor practice charge.we are unable to evaluate this argument,because sclea has failed to support it with proper authority.see cal.rules of court,rule a b.in any event,as stated previously,our only task is to determine whether section et passes constitutional muster.concerns regarding the possible financial consequences of the statutory procedure are more properly addressed to the legislature.
severability 
raising an argument it did not make below,sclea contends that if we determine the unanimous vote requirement renders section et unconstitutional,we may avoid invalidating the statute by severing the word unanimous from section,subdivision c.assuming that this argument is properly before us,we disagree.
initially we observe that section et contains no severability clause,although the absence of such a clause is not conclusive.legislature eu cal d.to be severable,the invalid provision must be grammatically,functionally,and volitionally separable.mcmahan city and county of san francisco th,d.assuming the word unanimous is grammatically and functionally separable from the remainder of the statute,it is far from clear that it is volitionally separable,because we can not be certain that the legislature would have enacted the measure without the unanimous vote requirement.see barlow davis th,d.a senate bill analysis refers specifically to the unanimous vote requirement under the arguments in support of the legislation.com.on public employment retirement,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july.furthermore,the legislature adopted the bill over the specific objections of local governments to the unanimous vote requirement.id.at.opponents of the legislation contended that a unanimous decision of the board of supervisors or city council is nearly impossible to achieve and question ed whether it will survive subsequent constitutional challenges on the same basis that sb was found unconstitutional.id.at.we can not say with confidence that senate bill would have been adopted in the absence of this provision.mcmahan city and county of san francisco,supra,th at,d.we therefore conclude that the word unanimous may not be severed from the remainder of the legislation.
iii.section et.impermissibly delegates to the arbitration panel the power to interfere with county money and to perform municipal functions.
although our conclusion that section et violates section,subdivision b would ordinarily be sufficient to resolve the matter before us,we will nevertheless consider the county arguments under section,subdivision a.in riverside,the supreme court admonished that we must view the two provisions as a whole and not in isolation.riverside,supra,cal th at,fn,d.like the supreme court,we will therefore also examine the constitutionality of section et under section,subdivision a.riverside,at,d.
the county claims that the statute violates section,subdivision a in four ways.first,it interferes with county money because the arbitration panel may potentially require the county to pay higher salaries than it chooses.second,the statute allows the arbitration panel to perform the municipal function of determining compensation for county employees.third,the unanimous vote requirement of section,subdivision c interferes with the majority voting process of the county board of supervisors.fourth,because the decision of the arbitration panel becomes binding after five days under section,subdivision b unless the board of supervisors rejects it by unanimous vote of all the members,the statute interferes with the board ability to comply with the requirements of the ralph brown act,government code section et.
sclea responds by arguing that there can be no violation of section,subdivision a because under the statute the governing body power to perform municipal functions is not delegated at all.in sclea view,section et does not transfer any power to enact decisions to the arbitration panel,because the panel decision does not have the force and effect of law until such time as the governing body chooses to accept the panel decision.indeed,sclea goes so far as to claim that the statute does not require the county to take any action it does not choose to take.
we agree with the county first two arguments.we conclude that section et impermissibly delegates to the arbitration panel the power to interfere with county money and to perform the municipal function of setting the compensation of county employees.we therefore need not reach the county remaining contentions.
history and purpose of section,subdivision a 
section,subdivision a originated as article xi,section,of the constitution of.grodin,et,the california state constitution.it was intended primarily to prevent the legislature from interfering in the financial affairs of local governments,but its prohibitions extend to other forms of interference as well.people ex rel.younger county of el dorado cal d.it was also directed at preventing the legislature from creating special commissions that would assume authority over local functions,such as the operation of a city fire department,municipal waterworks,or public enterprises such as parks and streets.see howard jarvis,supra,th at,d.as we explain below,the authority section et grants to the arbitration panel to set the terms and conditions of employment for county employees is inimical to the purposes of section,subdivision a,because such power intrudes significantly upon the functions of local government.see taylor crane cal d.
b.the legislature has delegated the county powers to a private body.
we first confront sclea argument that the county power to perform municipal functions has not been delegated at all.this argument is belied by the language of the statute itself.see howard jarvis,supra,th at,d rejecting argument that authority established by legislature did not levy tax where authority enabling statute specifically provided for levying and collection of tax by authority.the statute unequivocally places the authority to decide disputed compensation issues in the hands of the arbitration panel at the behest of the employee organization,subd.a,subd.b the arbitration panel shall decide on the disputed issues,italics added.moreover,at the conclusion of a period after its issuance,the arbitration panel decision shall be binding on all parties,and,if specified by the arbitration panel,be incorporated into and made a part of any existing memorandum of understanding as defined in section of the government code,subd.b.in riverside,the supreme court concluded that these provisions constituted a legislative delegation of local authority to a private body.riverside,supra,cal th at,d.
c.the governing body power to reject the arbitration panel decision does not cure the unconstitutional delegation.
the remaining question is whether the employer opportunity to reject the arbitration panel decision under section,subdivision c through a unanimous vote of all members of the governing body somehow means that a delegation has not occurred.see howard jarvis,supra,th at,d.we find this case analogous to howard jarvis.there,the court held that the fact that the legislature had conditioned the delegation of taxing power to the fresno metropolitan projects authority on voter approval did not make the delegation an act of the voters rather than an act of the legislature,at,d the act of the legislature is subject to ratification by the people.it remains,nonetheless,the act of the legislature bayside timber board of supervisors d.unconstitutional delegation of authority to adopt forest practice rules not cured by statutory amendment permitting counties to adopt more stringent regulations.
similarly,the mere fact that the arbitration panel decision will not become binding if the county board of supervisors is able to muster the necessary unanimous vote to reject it does not mean that no delegation has occurred.the decision of the arbitration panel is in no sense an act of the governing body.indeed,the statute does not require the governing body to ratify the arbitrators decision before it becomes binding.the decision can become binding without any legislative action at all.see,subd.b decision shall be binding unless governing body acts to reject it.the decision will become binding even if a majority or supermajority of the governing body votes to reject it,if either one member vote
