plaintiff da loc nguyen appeals from the trial court order granting the motion of his former employer,defendant applied medical resources corporation,to compel arbitration based on an arbitration clause contained in his employment application.the court ordered plaintiff to submit his individual claims to arbitration and struck all class and representative claims except for the representative private attorney general act paga cause of action.
plaintiff contends the order is immediately appealable based on the death knell doctrine,which makes an order terminating class allegations but allowing individual claims to continue immediately appealable.he argues munoz chipotle mexican grill,th munoz,which held that the death knell doctrine is inapplicable where a paga cause of action remains,was wrongly decided and should not be followed.we disagree but nevertheless treat the appeal as a petition for writ of mandate.
as to the merits of the appeal,plaintiff asserts the court erred in finding the arbitration clause was not unconscionable,severing the cost provision,and dismissing the class claims with prejudice.we reject all but the last argument.based on the recent case of sandquist lebo automotive cal th sandquist,on which we have received supplemental briefing from the parties,the trial court erred in dismissing the class claims because whether the arbitration provision contemplated class arbitration was a question for the arbitrator to decide.
we shall issue a peremptory writ of mandate commanding the trial court to vacate that portion of its order dismissing the class claims to allow the arbitrator to decide whether the arbitration clause permits arbitration on a basis.in all other respects,the peremptory writ challenging the order compelling arbitration is denied.we grant plaintiff request for judicial notice of the american arbitration association aaa employment arbitration rules and mediation procedures,amended and effective june,employment arbitration rules and mediation procedures,amended and effective november,and supplemental rules for class arbitrations.
facts and procedural background 
defendant manufactures surgical products and sells or distributes them nationwide.after plaintiff completed a job application,defendant hired him to work in the production line of its surgical products.
the application consisted of five pages.the first three pages asked for general information such as address,phone number,education and work history.the last two pages instructed the applicant in all capital letters to please read carefully,initial each of four paragraph s and sign below.plaintiff signed the application after initialing all four of the paragraphs,including the third one,which states i hereby agree to submit to binding arbitration all disputes and claims arising out of or relating to the submission of this application.i further agree,in the event that i am hired by the company,that all disputes that can not be resolved by informal internal resolution which might arise out of or relate to my employment with the company,whether during or after that employment,will be submitted to binding arbitration.i agree that such arbitration shall be conducted under the rules of the aaa.this application contains the entire agreement between the parties with regard to dispute resolution,and there are no other agreements as to dispute resolution,either oral or written.however,the company and i shall each pay of the costs and expenses of such arbitration,and each of us shall separately pay our counsel fees and expenses.the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys fees,costs,and expenses.the arbitration shall be held in orange county,california.it shall be governed by california law without regard to california statutes,rules and cases.
in,plaintiff brought a putative class action against defendant,asserting causes of action under the labor code,the unlawful competition law,and paga.the action sought unpaid overtime,meal and rest period compensation,penalties,plus injunctive and other equitable relief.
counsel for both parties met on multiple occasions to discuss a potential stipulation to submit the claims to arbitration and stay the paga cause of action.defendant offered to pay for the costs of arbitration,including the initiation fees and compensation for the arbitrator,effectively agreeing to strike the cost splitting provision.plaintiff rejected it.
defendant moved to compel arbitration of the individual claims,strike the class allegations,and stay the paga cause of action.plaintiff opposed the motion.
the trial court granted the motion,ordering plaintiff individual claims to arbitration,striking or dismissing the class action allegations with prejudice,and directed defendant to pay all costs of the arbitration other than those that plaintiff would necessarily pay in a court proceeding.in doing so,it found the contract was still a contract even if it may be one of adhesion because plaintiff was required to sign it in order to obtain employment plaintiff was not credible in claiming he was not fluent in speaking or reading english,as he states in his application he has english as a special skill or talent,checked the appropriate boxes on the application which require such an understanding,and is a civil engineer trained in australia the failure to attach or provide the aaa rules may make the application procedurally unconscionable but not substantial ly oppressive as i t would seem unlikely that a civil engineer,with six years of college,could not traverse the internet to find such rules a nd,even if the application is procedurally unconscionable,it is not substantively unconscionable the costs provision was easily severable and did not permeate the application with substantive unconscionablity and nothing in the arbitration provision indicated class actions or representative claims were included and the words used did not relate or arise out of other employees employment.
discussiona.appealability 
an order compelling arbitration is not appealable.garcia superior court th.although r eview of such an order ordinarily must await appeal from a final judgment entered after arbitration,when warranted by the circumstances,immediate review of an order granting a motion to compel arbitration may be obtained by a petition for writ of mandate.ibid.where appropriate,it is also attainable under the death knell doctrine,which provides that an order which allows a plaintiff to pursue individual claims,but prevents the plaintiff from maintaining the claims as a class action,is immediately appealable because it effectively r ings the death knell for the class claims.citations.appealability under the death knell doctrine requires an order that amounts to a de facto final judgment for absent plaintiffs,under circumstances where the persistence of viable but perhaps de minimis individual plaintiff claims creates a risk no formal final judgment will ever be entered.miranda,supra,th at.
the death knell doctrine does not apply in this case.o rders that only limit the scope of a class or the number of claims available to it are not similarly tantamount to dismissal and do not qualify for immediate appeal under the death knell doctrine only an order that entirely terminates class claims is appealable.in re baycol cases i ii cal th,italics added baycol.although the only class claim has been dismissed,the representative paga claim remains and plaintiff does not contend there are any putative class members who are not also aggrieved employees for purposes of the paga claim.accordingly,the order does not appear to constitute a de facto final judgment for absent plaintiffs the putative class employees under paga because their paga claims remain pending.young remx,th,young.that distinguishes this case from franco athens disposal,th,cited by plaintiff in his reply brief,where the order compelling arbitration terminated all class claims,effectively limiting the arbitration to the plaintiff claims.italics omitted.
in any event,because of the remaining paga claim,plaintiff has not established the second rationale for the death knell doctrine that the persistence of viable but perhaps de minimis individual plaintiff claims creates a risk no formal final judgment will ever be entered.young,supra,th at.young found munoz instructive on this issue.in munoz,the plaintiff appealed from an order denying class certification under the death knell doctrine.munoz,supra,th at.munoz dismissed the appeal,concluding the potential paga penalties incentivized the plaintiff to continue with the litigation,thus eliminating any death knell effect.id.at.given the potential for recovery of significant civil penalties if the paga claims are successful,as well as attorney fees and costs,plaintiffs have ample financial incentive to pursue the remaining representative claims under the paga and,thereafter,pursue their appeal from the trial court order denying class certification.denial of class certification where the paga claims remain in the trial court would not have the legal effect of a final judgment munoz,at accord,young,at.
plaintiff contends munoz was wrongly decided and should not be followed.we disagree.
contrary to plaintiff claim,munoz did not set forth a financial incentive rule that conflicts with baycol.as young explained,t he focus of the death knell doctrine is whether plaintiff has a sufficient incentive to proceed and here,as in munoz,the paga claim provides that incentive.young,supra,th at.plaintiff is correct that baycol stated,i f an order terminates class claims,but individual claims persist,the order terminating class claims is immediately appealable under death knell doctrine.baycol,supra,cal th at.but the order here did not entirely terminate all class claims as required by baycol for an order to be appealable.id.at.the action remained with respect to the issues related to,and the rights of the putative class members under,the paga cause of action,notwithstanding plaintiff claims to the contrary.
plaintiff maintains a paga claim belong s to the state,not the putative class members,who should not be required to await the outcome of plaintiff case in order to appeal an order that is final to them because as to them the action has terminated.we disagree.i f an employee plaintiff prevails in an action under the act for civil penalties by proving that the employer has committed a labor code violation,the defendant employer will be bound by the resulting judgment.nonparty employees may then,by invoking collateral estoppel,use the judgment against the employer to obtain remedies other than civil penalties for the same labor code violations.if the employer had prevailed,however,the nonparty employees,because they were not given notice of the action or afforded any opportunity to be heard,would not be bound by the judgment as to remedies other than civil penalties.arias superior court cal th.
plaintiff final concern is that the putative class members must appeal now or forever lose the right to appeal.but baycol rejected such an argument and held the death knell doctrine did not apply where there was no risk that an individual plaintiff may lack incentive to pursue his individual claims to judgment,thereby foreclosing any possible appellate review of class issues.baycol,supra,cal th at.
plaintiff requests that we treat the appeal as a petition for writ of mandate.w rit review of orders compelling arbitration is proper in at least two circumstances if the matters ordered arbitrated fall clearly outside the scope of the arbitration agreement or if the arbitration would appear to be unduly time consuming or expensive.zembsch superior court th.in this case,writ review is proper in order to avoid an arbitration based on erroneous rulings of law,which may result in needless delay and expense.
in elijahjuan superior court th elijahjuan,the court conclude d that issuance of the writ is warranted in this unusual case.the issue of arbitrability in this case is one of law and has been fully briefed.citation.additionally,the record is adequate to consider the issues,and there is no indication the trial court would be more than a nominal party.citation.if we were to dismiss the appeal,the ultimate reversal of the order would be inevitable,and would follow the substantial expense of completing an arbitration.citations.to dismiss the appeal and require the parties to proceed to arbitration of nonarbitral claims would be unnecessarily dilatory and circuitous.id.at.
a similar unusual or exceptional situation exists here in light of sandquist,supra,cal th,which held that under california contract law,whether an arbitration clause contemplated arbitration of class actions as well as individual claims may be for the arbitrator to decide rather than the trial court depending on the language used.if the arbitration provision in this case required the arbitrator to decide whether the clause included class arbitration,the trial court error in deciding the issue itself would be reversible per se.but in order to reach that question,it must first be determined the arbitration clause was valid and enforceable.to dismiss the appeal and allow the parties to arbitrate only plaintiff individual claims merely to have the resulting order vacated in light of sandquist would waste time and resources.writ review is thus appropriate.
applicability of the federal arbitration act faa 
at the outset,we address defendant contention the arbitration agreement is governed by the federal arbitration act faa.defendant is correct.
the faa reflects a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration,and the fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of contract.at t mobility llc concepcion,d.its main purpose is to ensur e that private arbitration agreements are enforced according to their terms and it preempts any state law rule that stand s as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the faa objectives.carbajal cwpsc,th,carbajal.
the faa applies to any contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce that contains an arbitration provision.citations.t he phrase involving commerce in the faa is the functional equivalent of the term affecting commerce,which is a term of art that ordinarily signals the broadest permissible exercise of congress commerce clause power.citations.t he united states supreme court has identified three categories of activity that congress may regulate under the commerce power the channels of interstate commerce,the instrumentalities of interstate commerce and persons or things in interstate commerce,and those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce.citations.the party asserting faa preemption bears the burden to present evidence establishing a contract with the arbitration provision affects one of these three categories of activity,and failure to do so renders the faa inapplicable.carbajal,supra,th at.
here,defendant presented the declaration of its counsel,cynthia bonner.bonner attested that defendant designs and manufactures surgical products,which it sells and distributes worldwide,and that plaintiff worked on the production line for those products.plaintiff presented no contrary evidence and in fact failed to address the issue at all.the uncontroverted evidence thus shows plaintiff employment with defendant bears on interstate commerce such that it falls within the scope of the faa.
unconscionability 
unconscionability refers to an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other party.citation.as that formulation implicitly recognizes,the doctrine of unconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element,the former focusing on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,the latter on overly harsh or results.baltazar forever,cal th,balazar.the doctrine applies to arbitration agreements,even those governed by the faa.carbajal,supra,th at.
t here are degrees of procedural unconscionability.at one end of the spectrum are contracts that have been freely negotiated by roughly equal parties,in which there is no procedural unconscionability contracts of adhesion that involve surprise or other sharp practices lie on the other end of the spectrum.citation.ordinary contracts of adhesion,although they are indispensable facts of modern life that are generally enforced citation,contain a degree of procedural unconscionability even without any notable surprises,and bear within them the clear danger of oppression and overreaching.citation.citation.we have instructed that courts must be particularly attuned to this danger in the employment setting,where economic pressure exerted by employers on all but the most employees may be particularly acute.balazar,supra,th at.
both procedural and substantive unconscionability must be present for the court to refuse to enforce a contract under the doctrine of unconscionability although they need not be present in the same degree.baltazar,supra,cal th at.essentially,the court applies a sliding scale to the determination t he more substantively oppressive the contract term,the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable,and vice versa.pinnacle museum tower pinnacle market development us,llc cal th,pinnacle.
the ultimate issue in every case is whether the terms of the contract are sufficiently unfair,in view of all relevant circumstances,that a court should withhold enforcement.sanchez valencia holding,llc cal th,see baltazar,supra,cal th at c ommerce depends on the enforceability,in most instances,of a duly executed written contract a party can not avoid a contractual obligation merely by complaining that the deal,in retrospect,was unfair or a bad bargain.
the trial court unconscionability determination,absent conflicting extrinsic evidence,is question of law subject to de novo review.pinnacle,supra,cal th at.however,where an unconscionability determination is based upon the trial court resolution of conflicts in the evidence,or on the factual inferences which may be drawn therefrom,we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the court determination and review those aspects of the determination for substantial evidence.lhotka geographic expeditions,th,lhotka.in keeping with california strong public policy in favor of arbitration,any doubts regarding the validity of an arbitration agreement are resolved in favor of arbitration.ibid.
procedural unconscionability 
plaintiff contends the arbitration clause was procedurally unconscionable to a strong degree because it was an adhesion contract offered on a basis with no opportunity for negotiation,compounded by the failures to attach the aaa rules or explain either the application or the meaning of the word arbitration.we disagree.
defendant acknowledges the arbitration clause was presented as a contract of adhesion in the employment context.the employment application and its arbitration provision therefore contain at least some degree of procedural unconscionability carbajal,supra,th at.but that alone establish es only a modest degree of procedural unconscionability.id.at.
carbajal,however,determined the level of unconscionability in that case rose to a moderate level because the agreement requires carbajal to arbitrate her claims in accordance with the rules of the aaa without identifying which of aaa nearly different sets of active rules will apply.before requiring carbajal to sign the agreement,cw painting did not provide carbajal a copy of the rules it thought would govern,tell her where she could find a copy of the rules,offer to explain the arbitration provision,or give her an opportunity to review any rules.carbajal,supra,th at,fn.omitted.plaintiff highlights carbajal in his reply brief.
but a month after carbajal was published,our supreme court in baltazar,supra,cal th,rejected a similar claim.baltazar began by noting that t he adhesive nature of the employment contract requires us to be particularly attuned to the plaintiff claim of unconscionability citation,but we do not subject the contract to the same degree of scrutiny as c ontracts of adhesion that involve surprise or other sharp practices citation.id.at.plaintiff here does not claim he was lied to or otherwise manipulated into signing the application.ibid.
the plaintiff in baltazar argue d that a somewhat greater degree of procedural unconscionability warrant ed closer scrutiny of the substantive fairness of the agreement terms because forever did not provide baltazar with a copy of the aaa rules for arbitration of employment disputes,which,by the terms of the arbitration agreement,govern any arbitration between the parties.baltazar relies on trivedi curexo technology th,as does the plaintiff in this case,which notes that n umerous cases have held that the failure to provide a copy of the arbitration rules to which the employee would be bound supported a finding of procedural unconscionability.citation.but in trivedi itself and in each of the court of appeal decisions cited therein,the plaintiff unconscionability claim depended in some manner on the arbitration rules in question.citations.these cases thus stand for the proposition that courts will more closely scrutinize the substantive unconscionability of terms that were artfully hidden by the simple expedient of incorporating them by reference rather than including them in or attaching them to the arbitration agreement.citation.baltazar argument accordingly might have force if her unconscionability challenge concerned some element of the aaa rules of which she had been unaware when she signed the arbitration agreement.but her challenge to the enforcement of the agreement has nothing to do with the aaa rules her challenge concerns only matters that were clearly delineated in the agreement she signed.forever failure to attach the aaa rules therefore does not affect our consideration of baltazar claims of substantive unconscionability.baltazar,supra,th at.
the same applies here.plaintiff does not claim anything was hidden in the aaa rules.rather,she contests only matters related to the agreement itself.therefore,following baltazar,the failure to attach the applicable aaa rules did not increase the procedural unconscionability of the application or its arbitration provision.
neither did the mere failure to explain the meaning of the word arbitration.in carbajal,we found the procedural unconscionability had rise n to a moderate level based on several factors,one of which was that defendant had not offer ed to explain the arbitration provision.carbajal,supra,th at.all the other reasons related to the defendant conduct in not identifying,providing,informing her where to find,or giving her an opportunity to read,the applicable aaa rules.ibid.carmona lincoln millennium car wash,th,carmona,cited by plaintiff,is similar,finding a moderate degree of procedural unconscionability where the defendant did not provide the applicable aaa rules,an explanation of the meaning of arbitration,or,as to one plaintiff,much time to review the multipage employment agreement.
as to these cases,baltazar removed the nonprovision or nonattachment of the aaa rules as a basis for increasing the procedural unconscionablity level,leaving only the failure to explain the meaning of arbitration.but simply because a provision within a contract of adhesion is not read or understood by the nondrafting party does not justify a refusal to enforce it.the term may only be denied enforcement if it is also substantively unreasonable.gutierrez autowest,th.
in carmona,w hat elevate d that case to a high degree of procedural unconscionability wa s the element of surprise regarding a key clause,the enforceability clause the car wash companies hid the enforceability clause and the entire confidentiality subagreement by failing to translate that portion of the agreement into spanish.esteban and matute casco could not read english,yet the car wash companies provided the enforceability clause in english only.the car wash companies evidently knew plaintiffs required spanish translations because they provided some translation.the record does not reveal why the car wash companies did not translate the entirety of the employment agreement.in sum,with both oppression and surprise present,there is no question the arbitration agreement was procedurally unconscionable.carmona,supra,th at.
here,in contrast,the trial court specifically found p laintiff assertion that he is not fluent in speaking or reading english is not credible,as he indicates otherwise in his application,attesting to the fact that he has english as a special skill or talent.he checked the appropriate boxes on the application which require such an understanding,and as he is a civil engineer trained in australia.
we disregard plaintiff claims to the contrary because w e must resolve all conflicts in the evidence and draw every reasonable inference to support the trial court ruling.citation.because neither side requested a statement of decision,we also must presume the court made all necessary findings supported by substantial evidence.carbajal,supra,th at,fn.the court may have been mistaken in finding plaintiff was a civil engineer,as his application shows he had only an associate degree and not a bachelor degree,but that is irrelevant.the point was that plaintiff knew enough english to obtain both an associate degree and go through four years at a university in australia,whether or not he had only been in the united states for a few months,with this being his first job.
for the above reasons,we are not persuaded by plaintiff factual distinctions of this case from roman superior court th roman.here,the degree of procedural unconscionability of the arbitration clause is not high,as in carmona.nor does it rise to the level of moderate given that the failure to explain the meaning of arbitration was only one out of several factors considered by both carbajal and carmona that leaves the degree of procedural unconscionability of the arbitration clause at modest.see carbajal,supra,th at.
substantive unconscionability 
plaintiff argues the arbitration clause is substantively unconscionable because it lacks mutuality,requires him to pay arbitration fees,gives defendant a free peek at his claims,and fails to satisfy the requirements of armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th armendariz.we are not persuaded.
plaintiff contends the arbitration clause lacks mutuality,referencing the sentences beginning with the word i,i hereby agree to submit to binding arbitration i further agree that all disputes which might arise out of or related to my employment with the company will be submitted to binding arbitration i agree that such arbitration shall be conducted under the rules of the aaa.according to him,such language requires only him but not defendant to submit to binding arbitration.we disagree.
one of the issues upon which review was granted in baltazar was whether an arbitration clause in an employment application that provides i agree to submit to binding arbitration all disputes and claims arising out of the submission of this application unenforceable as substantively unconscionable for lack of mutuality,or does the language create a mutual agreement to arbitrate all such disputes see roman,supra,th.baltazar forever,review granted.
baltazar did not explicitly answer this question.see baltazar,supra,cal th at primary question before us is whether a clause stating that,in the event a claim proceeds to arbitration,the parties are authorized to seek preliminary injunctive relief in the superior court renders the arbitration agreement unconscionable,and therefore unenforceable,because it unreasonably favors the employer.but it did address the plaintiff argument the arbitration agreement at issue is unfairly because it lists only employee claims as examples of the types of claims that are subject to arbitration.id.at.baltazar disagreed,stating the arbitration agreement at issue here makes clear that the parties mutually agree to arbitrate all claims that is,any claim or action arising out of or in any way related to the hire,employment,remuneration,separation or termination of employee.that provision clearly covers claims an employer might bring as well as those an employee might bring.id.at.
the arbitration clause in this case similarly provides for arbitration of all disputes and claims arising out of or relating to the submission of the application and all disputes which might arise out of or relate to my employment with the company.under baltazar,such language created a mutual agreement to arbitrate all employment related disputes.baltazar,supra,cal th at.
baltazar is not entirely dispositive,however,because the agreement there apparently provide d that the parties mutually agree to arbitrate.baltazar,supra,cal th at.nevertheless the opinion provides guidance and follows the reasoning of those appellate courts that have rejected plaintiff argument that the language used in the arbitration clause lacks mutuality,and thus,is substantively unconscionable.see tiri lucky chances,th,agreement requir ing arbitration for any and all differences legal disputes whether by or against the employee or employer shows nearly unqualified mutuality,and it is far more than the modicum of bilaterality required by our state supreme court in employment arbitration agreements roman,supra,th at rejecting a holding that the mere inclusion of the words i agree by one party in an otherwise mutual arbitration provision destroys the bilateral nature of the agreement.
in roman,supra,th,the employee signed a mandatory predispute agreement containing an arbitration clause that provided i agree,in the event i am hired by the company,that all disputes and claims that might arise out of my employment with the company will be submitted to binding arbitration.id.at.the employee argued that the i agree language manifested only a unilateral obligation to arbitrate.roman disagreed absent some indicia in the agreement that arbitration is limited to the employee claims against the employer,the use of the i agree language in an arbitration clause that expressly covers all disputes creates a mutual agreement to arbitrate all claims arising out of the applicant employment.ibid.
we also decline to find that the mere inclusion of the words i agree by one party in an otherwise mutual arbitration provision destroys the bilateral nature of the agreement.roman,supra,th at.by agreeing that all disputes and claims arising out of or relating to the submission of the application and all disputes that can not be resolved by informal internal resolution which might arise out of or relate to my employment with the company,plaintiff was doing no more than acknowledging that all disputes between him and defendant would be resolved through binding arbitration.no separate signature was required by defendant,as it was the company that set binding arbitration of all disputes as a condition of plaintiff employment.in short,there was a mutual obligation to arbitrate any and all issues.
plaintiff urges us not to follow roman because it was wrongly decided,never explained its reasons,erroneously distinguished higgins superior court th higgins,and should not have considered the public policy favoring arbitration where the i agree language was not ambiguous.according to plaintiff,the better rule is set forth in higgins,which found unconscionable a unilateral obligation to arbitrate where arbitration clause included both i agree language and allowed defendant to retain right to pursue certain legal remedies.id.at.
the other cases cited by plaintiff are to the same effect.municipal resources consultants th,lack of mutuality found where arbitration provision reserved right of the employer to file an injunction against the employee while requiring the employee to submit to arbitration for a ny claim arising out of or relating to this agreement,or the breach thereof,or your employment by employer,or the termination of your employment,italics omitted dunham environmental chemical,no.wl,at employment agreement required the employee to arbitrate all disputes incidental to employment while the employer retain ed the right to pursue any remedy available to it under the law should the employee violate the trade secrets agreement.here,in contrast,the arbitration clause did not contain any similar language reserving to defendant the right to pursue legal remedies.
in zullo superior court th,on which plaintiff also relies,the court found the arbitration policy where it expressly applies to any dispute arising out of the termination because disputes arising out of the termination of an employee are the very claims that are virtually certain to be filed against,not by the employer and add ed a nonexclusive list of the statutes and laws to which it applies,all of which are of equal employment and nondiscrimination laws.id.at.according to zullo,employees bring actions under these laws.ibid.but in baltazar,the court rejected a similar contention that an arbitration agreement lacks mutuality where it lists only employee claims as examples of the types of claims that are subject to arbitration.baltazar,supra,cal th at.we need not discuss zullo continued viability in light of baltazar,however,because the arbitration provision in this case did not list any particular claims to which it applied.rather,it applied to all disputes and claims.
free peek at plaintiff claims 
we also disagree with plaintiff contention that the arbitration provision is substantively unconscionable because it provides defendant a free peek at his claims before arbitration.the bilateral nature of the dispute resolution procedure distinguishes the parties agreement from the employment contract analyzed in nyulassy lockheed martin th nyulassy,on which plaintiff relies.in nyulassy,the agreement required only the plaintiff to arbitrate his employment claims against his employer the employer claims against the plaintiff arising out of the employment contract were not subject to the arbitration agreement.id.at.the court stated the employment agreement in addition to compelling plaintiff to arbitrate all of his disputes with defendant requires him to submit to discussions with his supervisors in advance of,and as a condition precedent to,having his dispute resolved through binding arbitration.while on its face,this provision may present a laudable mechanism for resolving employment disputes informally,it connotes a less benign goal.given the unilateral nature of the arbitration agreement,requiring plaintiff to submit to an dispute resolution mechanism,one without a neutral mediator suggests that defendant would receive a free peek at plaintiff case,thereby obtaining an advantage if and when plaintiff were to later demand arbitration.id.at.
but the arbitration provision here,aside from being bilateral,states that all disputes that can not be resolved by informal internal resolution will be submitted to binding arbitration.the provision does not require disputes be resolved through informal internal resolution,which is not defined in the application,and nothing limits such informal internal resolution to claims brought by the plaintiff unlike the cases cited by plaintiff.see nyulassy,supra,th at mckinney bonilla.july,wqh cab wl,pokorny quixstar,cir.see also carmona,supra,th at unilateral free peek provision contributed to substantive unconscionability.
the arbitration agreement in serpa california surety investigations,th is similar to the one here.it provided that if the dispute can not be resolved through informal internal efforts,i will submit the claim to binding arbitration.id.at.the court found informal internal efforts are not defined in the agreement or the handbook,and there is no reasonable basis to infer the agreement requires anything other than some informal notice of a grievance before proceeding to arbitration.this case is thus far different from the provisions in nyulassy,which the court found unacceptable primarily because it was yet another mechanism in an agreement permeated by unilateral provisions favoring the employer.citation.moreover,to the extent the cited language is anything other than precatory,a requirement that internal grievance procedures be exhausted before proceeding to arbitration is both reasonable and laudable in an agreement containing a mutual obligation to arbitrate.it plainly does not shock the conscience so as to vitiate the arbitration agreement.ibid.nor does the arbitration provision in this case.
payment of arbitration fees 
plaintiff asserts the arbitration provision is substantively unconscionable because it requires him to pay half the costs of the arbitration without considering his ability to do so and misinforms him he had to pay all his own attorney fees w hen an employer imposes mandatory arbitration as a condition of employment,the arbitration agreement or arbitration process can not generally require the employee to bear any type of expense that the employee would not be required to bear if he or she were free to bring the action in court.armendariz,supra,cal th at.recognizing this,the trial court ordered defendant to pay all costs of the arbitration other than those that plaintiff would necessarily pay in a court proceeding.it found t he issue of the costs provision is not a substantial issue and is a term easily severable as it does not permeate the application with substantive unconscionability.
defendant maintains the requirement can not be severed because it is permeated with unconcionability by lacking mutuality,giving defendant a free peek at his claims,and failing to comply with armendariz requirements.we have already rejected plaintiff first two claims.as we shall discuss in the next section,his last contention lacks merit as well.
we review the trial court ruling on severance of an unconscionable provision for abuse of discretion.lhotka,supra,th at.absent the provision,we ascertain no other possibly substantively unconscionable provision in the arbitration clause.see armendariz,supra,cal th at if the illegality is collateral to the main purpose of the contract,and the illegal provision can be extirpated from the contract by means of severance or restriction,then such severance and restriction are appropriate lane francis capital management,llc th,lane finding unconscionable provision severable where arbitration agreement was not permeated with unconscionability.the trial court thus did not abuse its discretion in severing it.
armendariz 
as an independent ground,plaintiff argues the arbitration clause fails to satisfy the five minimum requirements set forth by armendariz for a valid arbitration agreement.under armendariz,an arbitration agreement is lawful if it provides for neutral arbitrators,provides for more than minimal discovery,requires a written award,provides for all of the types of relief that would otherwise be available in court,and does not require employees to pay either unreasonable costs or any arbitrators fees or expenses as a condition of access to the arbitration forum.armendariz,supra,cal th at.the arbitration provision here fulfilled these conditions by incorporating by reference the aaa rules,specifically,and,respectively.lane,supra,th at like any other contract,an arbitration agreement may incorporate other documents by reference see fittante palm springs motors,th,arbitration clause satisfied the armendariz requirements by incorporating the arbitration rules of the faa and the procedures of the california arbitration act.
dismissal of class claims 
plaintiff contends the court erred in dismissing the class claims with prejudice.we agree.under sandquist,supra,cal th,the determination of who decides whether the arbitration agreement permits or prohibits classwide arbitration,a court or the arbitrator is in the first instance a matter of agreement,with the parties agreement subject to interpretation under state contract law.id.at.interpreting an arbitration agreement containing language similar to that used in this case,sandquist concluded that u nder state law,these parties arbitration agreement allocates the decision to the arbitrator.ibid.according to the court,t he remedy when an issue has erroneously been addressed by a court rather than an arbitrator is to remand with instructions that the correct decision maker consider the issue anew.citations.t he parties have not yet obtained the arbitration decision that their contracts foresee citation remanding enforc es the parties arbitration agreements according to their terms citation.id.at.
sandquist rejected the defendant argument that state law requires harmless error review in all cases before rev
