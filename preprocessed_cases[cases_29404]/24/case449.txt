an arbitration panel ordered citigroup global markets to pay debra bacon.citigroup moved the district court to vacate the award,and the district court obliged on the basis that the arbitrators had manifestly disregarded the law.on appeal,we consider whether manifest disregard of the law remains a valid ground for vacatur of an arbitration award in the light of the supreme court recent decision in hall street associates,mattel,d we conclude that hall street restricts the grounds for vacatur to those set forth in of the federal arbitration act faa or act,et,and consequently,manifest disregard of the law is no longer an independent ground for vacating arbitration awards under the faa.hall street effectively overrules our previous authority to the contrary,so we must vacate the district court judgment and remand for reconsideration in accord with the exclusivity of the statutory grounds.
debra bacon quarrel with citigroup began in when she discovered that her husband had withdrawn funds from her citigroup individual retirement accounts without her permission.by forging her signature,he made five withdrawals totaling.as soon as bacon discovered the unauthorized withdrawals,she notified citigroup.
in,bacon submitted a claim in arbitration against citigroup seeking reimbursement for the unauthorized withdrawals.the arbitration panel granted bacon in damages and in attorneys fees.citing of the faa,citigroup made an application to the district court requesting vacatur of the award.
the district granted the motion to vacate,holding that the award was made in manifest disregard of the law.the court based its holding on three grounds bacon was not harmed by the withdrawals because her husband used the money for her benefit and subsequently promised to pay her back bacon claims were barred by texas law,which permits such claims only if the customer reports the unauthorized transaction within thirty days of the withdrawal and texas law requires apportionment among the liable parties,which,in this case,includes bacon husband.

although hall street clearly has the effect of further restricting the role of federal courts in the arbitration process,there is nothing revolutionary about its holding.
even before the enactment of the united states arbitration act in courts of equity would set aside an arbitration award only in narrowly defined circumstances.burchell marsh,how.karthaus ferrer,pet.if the arbitration award was within the submission,and contain ed the honest decision of the arbitrators,after a full and fair hearing of the parties,a court of equity would not set it aside for error,either in law or fact.burchell,at.this deference was appropriate because a submission document executed by both parties and presented to the arbitrators in order to outline the dispute and the desired arbitration a valid and enforceable contract.district of columbia bailey.thus,a provision in the submission agreement requiring the parties to abide by the arbitrator decision made the arbitration award binding.even when a submission agreement did not contain an express agreement to adhere to the decision of the arbitrators,courts implied such an agreement and enforced the awards as binding.see smith morse,wall.the law implies an agreement to abide the result of an arbitration from the fact of submission.although arbitration was binding and final,awards could be set aside in the following circumstances where the arbitrators engaged in fraud,corruption,or improper conduct where the arbitrators failed to decide all of the issues submitted where the arbitrators exceeded their powers by deciding issues not submitted and where the award was not certain,final,and mutual.see burchell,at and carnochan christie,and.these limited grounds are akin to the provisions of of the faa.
importantly,awards were affirmed even if based upon error in law or fact.burchell,at.a contrary course would be a substitution of the judgment of the chancellor in place of the judges chosen by the parties,and would make an award the commencement,not the end,of litigation.id.burchell also cautioned against assuming improper conduct from mere error we are all too prone,perhaps,to impute either weakness of intellect or corrupt motives to those who differ with us in opinion.id.at.the supreme court has continued to emphasize the importance of respecting the arbitration process.in hall street,the court explained permitting vacatur and modification of arbitration awards on more expansive grounds opens the door to the legal and evidentiary appeals that can rende r informal arbitration merely a prelude to a more cumbersome and judicial review process,and bring arbitration theory to grief in process.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted alteration in hall street.
in short,strictly confining the perimeter of federal court review of arbitration awards is a widely accepted practice that runs throughout arbitration its early common law and equity days to the present.
congress embraced this notion that arbitration awards should generally be upheld barring some sort of procedural injustice,and and of the faa enumerate the circumstances under which an award may be vacated,modified,or corrected when the action is one brought under the act.under,courts are permitted to vacate an arbitration award 
where the award was procured by corruption,fraud,or undue means 
where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators,or either of them 
where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing,upon sufficient cause shown,or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced or 
where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,final,and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.
as we have earlier noted,the supreme court in hall street has recently addressed the extent to which courts may vacate or modify the work of arbitrators on grounds beyond those found in and.in their agreement to arbitrate,the hall street parties agreed contractually to give the district court the authority to vacate or modify the award on grounds that were not provided in and.the agreement was negotiated during the litigation of the case and was entered as an order by the district court.it required the district court to vacate,modify or correct any award i where the arbitrator findings of facts are not supported by substantial evidence,or ii where the arbitrator conclusions of law are erroneous.hall street.at.after arbitration,the district court vacated the award for legal error.ultimately,the ninth circuit held that the terms controlling judicial review were unenforceable and ordered the arbitration award reinstated.the supreme court then granted certiorari to decide whether the grounds for vacatur and modification provided by and of the faa are exclusive.id.at.the petitioner argued that the agreement to expand the court review beyond the specific provisions of the statute should be respected because arbitration is a creature of contract,and the faa is motivated,first and foremost,by a congressional desire to enforce agreements into which parties ha ve entered.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted alterations in hall street.the court rejected this argument.
the supreme court observed that of the faa,which states that upon the application for an order confirming an arbitration award the court must grant such an order unless the award is vacated,modified,or corrected as prescribed in sections and,suggests that judicial review is constrained by the statute.there is nothing malleable about must grant,which unequivocally tells courts to grant confirmation in all cases,except when one of the prescribed exceptions applies.id.at.
hall street also found that the act legislative history indicated that congress intended the statutory grounds for vacatur and modification to be the exclusive means for setting aside or changing an arbitration award challenged under the faa.in a brief submitted to the house and senate subcommittees of the committees on the judiciary,one of the primary drafters of the act said,the grounds for vacating,modifying,or correcting an award are limited.if the award meets a condition of,then and then only the award may be vacated if there was an error under,then and then only it may be modified or corrected id.at citing arbitration of interstate commercial disputes,joint hearings before the subcommittees of the committees on the judiciary on and,additions and omissions in hall street.
based both on the text and on the legislative history,hall street concluded that and provide the exclusive regimes for review under the faa.the court reiterated this holding several times we hold that the statutory grounds are exclusive we agree with the ninth circuit that they are exclusive we now hold that and respectively provide the faa exclusive grounds for expedited vacatur and modification in holding that and provide exclusive regimes for the review provided by the statute hall street.at.this rule,hall street determined,is consistent with the national policy favoring arbitration with just the limited review needed to maintain arbitration essential virtue of resolving disputes straightaway.id.at.
before we leave hall street,we must point out that the petitioner,citing wilko swan,argued that the widespread judicial recognition of manifest disregard of the law as a nonstatutory ground for vacatur suggests that and are not exclusive.hall street.at.they argued that if this judicial expansion is permissible,then the instant contractual expansion similarly should be accepted.the supreme court,however,questioned whether wilko should even be read as creating an independent ground for vacatur.id.at.that issue,hall street observed,was not before the court in wilko,and wilko language,upon which the circuit courts have based the standard,is vague.the hall street court speculated and concluded 
maybe the term manifest disregard was meant to name a new ground for review,but maybe it merely referred to the grounds collectively,rather than adding to them.or,as some courts have thought,manifest disregard may have been shorthand for a or a,the subsections authorizing vacatur when the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct or exceeded their powers.we,when speaking as a court,have merely taken the wilko language as we found it,without embellishment,and now that its meaning is implicated,we see no reason to accord it the significance that the petitioner urges.
id.citations omitted emphasis added.in short,hall street rejected manifest disregard as an independent ground for vacatur,and stood by its clearly and repeatedly stated holding,as noted in the earlier paragraph,that and provide the exclusive bases for vacatur and modification of an arbitration award under the faa.
it is certainly true that over the years this circuit,like most other circuits ultimately came to recognize manifest disregard of the law as a nonstatutory basis for vacatur.see,kergosien,at prestige ford ford dealer computer,cir.even so,manifest disregard of the law was defined as a standard difficult to satisfy.manifest disregard of the law 
means more than error or misunderstanding with respect to the law.the error must have been obvious and capable of being readily and instantly perceived by the average person qualified to serve as an arbitrator.moreover the term disregard implies that the arbitrator appreciates the existence of a clearly governing principle but decides to ignore or pay no attention to it.

our circuit did not accept manifest disregard of the law as a nonstatutory ground for vacatur with immediate confidence and certainty.compare mcilroy painewebber,cir declining to adopt manifest disregard,or any other standard,as an addendum to section,with williams,at.indeed,manifest disregard of the law does not have a compelling origin as a ground for vacatur.its modest debut occurs in a vague phrase found in wilko swan the interpretations of law by the arbitrators in contrast to manifest disregard are not subject,in the federal courts,to judicial review for error in interpretation.at.that is all wilko said about it.
thus,it is not surprising that the lower courts initially grappled with the uncertain implications of this clause.see,prof l planning,cir passenger chesapeake and ohio ry,cir we share the reservations recently expressed by the second circuit as to whether the wilko dictum was actually intended to add manifest disregard of the law to the statutory grounds for vacating an award in.stavborg metal converters,cir san martine compania de navegacion,saguenay terminals,cir frankly,the supreme court use of the words manifest disregard,has caused us trouble here.uncertain about the propriety of vacating an award for manifest disregard of the law,some courts avoided the issue by assuming,without deciding,that it was a valid ground for vacatur,but declining to vacate the award nonetheless.see,at we need not decide that issue today because even if we were to accept such a ground,has failed to make any showing that the arbitrators acted in manifest disregard of the law stroh container delphi,cir we need not decide,however,whether to adopt any of these exceptions including manifest disregard since,under any one of them,the award must nevertheless be affirmed.msp collaborative developers fidelity deposit of,cir parsons whittemore overseas societe generale de du papier rakta,cir passenger,at assuming without deciding that in an appropriate case an arbitration award may be vacated for a manifest disregard of applicable law,this is clearly not such a case.some circuits continued to maintain the exclusivity of the statutory grounds,in the face of wilko,for decades.see,robbins day,cir.however,despite its uncertain genesis,most circuits eventually accepted manifest disregard of the law as a valid extrastatutory ground for vacatur.see note,above.
we were among the very last to adopt manifest disregard.after wilko,three of our opinions iterated our viewpoint that the statutory grounds are exclusive.see mcilroy,at perez,welch,cir forsythe int l,gibbs oil of,cir judicial review of a commercial arbitration award is limited to sections and of the federal arbitration act.but in williams cigna,nearly fifty years after wilko,we finally embraced manifest disregard as a nonstatutory ground for vacating arbitration awards.at.we concluded that the departure from precedent was necessary and justified in the light of the supreme court opinion in first options of chicago,kaplan,which cited and wilko for the proposition that courts will set arbitration awards aside only in very unusual circumstances,d.
the question before us now is whether,under the faa,manifest disregard of the law remains valid,as an independent ground for vacatur,after hall street.the answer seems clear.hall street unequivocally held that the statutory grounds are the exclusive means for vacatur under the faa.our case law defines manifest disregard of the law as a nonstatutory ground for vacatur.see kergosien,at prestige ford,at harris parker coll.of chiropractic,cir.thus,to the extent that manifest disregard of the law constitutes a nonstatutory ground for vacatur,it is no longer a basis for vacating awards under the faa.
four other circuits have considered this issue.the first circuit,in dictum and with little discussion,concluded that hall street abolished manifest disregard of the law as a ground for vacatur see united parcel,cir we acknowledge the supreme court recent holding in hall street,mattel that manifest disregard of the law is not a valid ground for vacating or modifying an arbitral award in cases brought under the faa.citations omitted.the sixth circuit,in an unpublished opinion,reached the opposite conclusion by narrowly construing the holding of hall street to apply only to contractual expansions
