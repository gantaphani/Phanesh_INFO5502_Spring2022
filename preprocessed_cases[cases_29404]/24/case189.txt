on this appeal,we consider whether parties inclusion in an arbitration agreement of a general statement that each will bear the expenses of its own arbitrator and its own attorneys deprives the arbitration panel of authority to award such expenses as a sanction against a party whom the panel determines failed to arbitrate in good faith.we conclude that it does not and,accordingly,reverse the judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york lewis kaplan,judge,entered on february,insofar as it vacated that part of an arbitration award requiring respondent emc national life company emc,successor in interest to national travelers life company national travelers,to pay such fees to petitioner reliastar life insurance of new york reliastar.we remand the case so that the district court may enter a new judgment confirming the arbitration award in all respects.
factual background 
a.the agreement to arbitrate 
in december,national travelers and reliastar entered into two separate but related coinsurance agreements,one pertaining to certain reliastar insurance policies in force as of january,and the other pertaining to certain reliastar policies to be issued on or after that date.because the agreements have identical terms and conditions,for purposes of this appeal we refer to them collectively as the coinsurance agreements.
article x of the coinsurance agreements governed the parties agreement to arbitrate.it reads in relevant part as follows 
appointment of arbitrators.in the event of any disputes or differences arising hereafter between the parties with reference to any transaction under or relating in any way to this agreement as to which agreement between the parties hereto can not be reached,the same shall be decided by arbitration.three arbitrators shall decide any dispute or difference 
decision.the arbitrators shall consider customary and standard practices in the life or health reinsurance business,as applicable to the dispute.they shall decide by a majority vote of the arbitrators.there shall be no appeal from their written decision.judgment may be entered on the decision of the arbitrators by any court having jurisdiction.
expenses of arbitration.each party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator whether selected by that party,or by the other party pursuant to the procedures set out in section and related outside attorneys fees,and shall jointly and equally bear with the other party the expenses of the third arbitrator.
applicable law.any arbitration instituted pursuant to this article shall be held in new york,new york,or another site mutually agreed upon by the parties and the laws of the state of new york and to the extent applicable,the federal arbitration act,shall govern the interpretation and application of this agreement.
the particular focus of this appeal is section.
b.the arbitration award 
when various disputes arose between the,national travelers initiated arbitration proceedings seeking a declaration that the coinsurance agreements had been terminated and approval for a proposed terminal accounting.reliastar opposed both national travelers claim of termination and its proposed method for conducting a terminal accounting.
following discovery,in may,an arbitration panel conducted a hearing.on august,the panel entered an interim award,finding that the coinsurance agreements remained in force between the parties and directing national travelers to pay reliastar more than million past due under that agreement.the panel directed the parties to meet to resolve issues related to the resumption of their relationship under the coinsurance agreements.further,in paragraph of the award,a majority of the panel,without explanation,awarded reliastar attorney and arbitrator fees and costs.
the parties complied with all aspects of the award,except for that part granting reliastar fees and costs,which they agreed national travelers could submit for reconsideration to the panel and,if necessary,challenge in court.after further briefing on the issue of fees and costs,the arbitration panel entered a final award on october.a majority of the panel awarded reliastar fees for its attorneys and arbitrator in the amount of,costs of,as well as interest,explaining that it viewed the conduct of national travelers in the arbitration as lacking good faith.
c.the district court proceedings 
on october,reliastar petitioned the district court to confirm the final arbitration award,and on november,national travelers filed a to vacate the award to the extent it granted reliastar fees and costs.national travelers argued that the arbitration panel had exceeded its authority in awarding fees and costs in light of section of the coinsurance agreements,which obligates each party to bear the expense of its own arbitrator and related outside attorneys fees.the district court agreed and,accordingly,vacated that part of the final award requiring national travelers to pay reliastar attorney and arbitrator fees before confirming it in all other respects.

ii.discussion 
standard of review 
in considering a challenge to a district court decision to vacate a portion of an arbitration award,we review its legal rulings de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.see banco de seguros del estado mut.marine office,cir.
the law is clear that because arbitration is a matter of contract,a party can not be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed to so submit.painewebber bybyk,cir.the scope of an arbitrator authority thus generally depends on the intention of the parties to an arbitration,and is determined by the agreement or submission.synergy gas sasso,cir internal quotation marks omitted.section a of the federal arbitration act allows courts to vacate an arbitral award where the arbitrators exceeded their powers.a.we have,however,consistently accorded the narrowest of readings to this provision of law,banco de seguros del estado mut.marine office,at internal quotation marks omitted,in order to facilitate the purpose underlying arbitration to provide parties with efficient dispute resolution,thereby obviating the need for protracted litigation,see,amicizia societa navegazione chilean nitrate iodine sales,cir t he court function in confirming or vacating an arbitration award is severely limited.if it were otherwise,the ostensible purpose for resort to arbitration,avoidance of litigation,would be frustrated.
thus,in considering a section b challenge,t he principal question for the reviewing court is whether the arbitrator award draws its essence from the agreement to arbitrate,since the arbitrator is not free merely to dispense his own brand of industrial justice.concourse assocs.fishman,cir internal quotation marks omitted.if the answer to this question is yes,however,the scope of the court review of the award itself is limited.notably,we do not consider whether the arbitrators correctly decided the issue.banco de seguros del estado mut.marine office,at internal quotation marks omitted.if the parties agreed to submit an issue for arbitration,we will uphold a challenged award as long as the arbitrator offers a barely colorable justification for the outcome reached.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority,a court conviction that the arbitrator has committed serious error in resolving the disputed issue does not suffice to overturn his decision.united paperworkers int l union misco,d accord concourse assocs.fishman,at.
applying these principles to this case,we consider only whether,in light of the parties agreement to arbitrate,the arbitrators were authorized to sanction bad faith conduct by awarding attorney and arbitrator fees.we do does respondent ask us whether the arbitrators correctly identified bad faith conduct or whether the amount of fees awarded was an appropriate sanction for that conduct.
b.the parties broad agreement to arbitrate conferred on the arbitrators the equitable authority to sanction a party bad faith conduct 
where an arbitration clause is broad,arbitrators have the discretion to order such remedies as they deem appropriate.see banco de seguros del estado mut.marine office,at.this is because it is not the role of the courts to undermine the comprehensive grant of authority to arbitrators by prohibiting them from fashioning awards or remedies to ensure a meaningful final award.id.concluding that arbitrators did not exceed their authority by requiring foreign reinsurer to post security see also martin domke,domke on commercial arbitration ed.limited only by the broad concepts of equity and justice,the arbitrator has a plethora of remedies,both legal and equitable,to choose from in structuring a remedy.
consistent with this principle,we here clarify that a broad arbitration clause,such as the one in this case,see coinsurance agreements,confers inherent authority on arbitrators to sanction a party that participates in the arbitration in bad faith and that such a sanction may include an award of attorney or arbitrator fees this conclusion finds support in synergy gas sasso,wherein this court ruled that,after an arbitrator ordered the reinstatement of a discharged employee with backpay,the arbitrator did not exceed his authority in further awarding the employee union attorney fees.in so holding,we noted that a rbitrators have occasionally awarded attorney fees in circumstances where one party had acted in bad faith and that such fees fairly compensated the party for costs incurred as a result of such actions.id.at.in that case,we specifically observed that if synergy had not acted in bad faith,then the employee brown would have been reinstated more than six years ago and the attorney fees would not have been incurred.id.at.accordingly,we concluded that such an award of attorney fees did not contravene new york public policy against punitive arbitration awards because the fees were compensatory,not penal,in nature and,thus,an appropriate form of damages granted to the aggrieved party see id.
the ninth circuit has also rejected a challenge to an arbitration award of attorney fees,recognizing a bad faith exception to the general american rule that each party bears its own attorney fees.see todd shipyards cunard line,cir.the court explained federal law takes an expansive view of arbitrator authority to decide disputes and fashion remedies in light of the broad power of arbitrators to fashion appropriate remedies and the accepted bad faith conduct exception to the american rule,we hold that it was within the power of the arbitration panel in this case to award attorneys fees.see also marshall duke,cir noting that parties raised no jurisdictional challenge to attorney fee award,but observing that,i n any event,the arbitrators have the power to award attorney fees pursuant to the bad faith exception to the american rule that each party bears its own attorney fees.
emc submits that this case is distinguishable because the agreement at issue in todd shipyards cunard line,specifically integrated rule of the commercial rules of the american arbitration association,which states that t he arbitrator may grant any remedy or relief which the arbitrator deems just and equitable within the scope of the agreement of the parties.at quoting rule.we do not,however,consider a reference to rule to be essential where,as in this case,the parties arbitration clause applies broadly to every dispute arising under their agreement,see coinsurance agreements,and where the arbitrators find that a party did not arbitrate in good faith,see domke on commercial arbitration as a general rule,each party to an arbitration must bear its own attorney fees associated with an arbitration action or the enforcement of an arbitration award.nevertheless,the federal arbitration act grant s wide authority to the arbitrator to determine entitlement to attorney fees under some circumstances,the prevailing party may recover attorney fees if the parties provide for the remedy of attorney fees in their arbitration agreement or if authorized by a statute,or if justified by circumstances in which the losing party acted in bad faith.emphasis added.indeed,the underlying purposes of arbitration,efficient and swift resolution of disputes without protracted litigation,could not be achieved but for good faith arbitration by the parties.consequently,sanctions,including attorney fees,are appropriately viewed as a remedy within an arbitrator authority to effect the goals of arbitration.
section of the parties agreement did not limit the arbitrators authority to award attorney and arbitrator fees as a sanction for bad faith conduct 
while a broad arbitration clause affords arbitrators considerable discretion to award such remedies as they deem appropriate,they may not exceed the power granted to them by the contract itself.banco de seguros del estado mut.marine office,at.emc does not contend that section of the agreement to arbitrate is not sufficiently broad to authorize the arbitrators to sanction bad faith conduct.rather,its position has consistently been that section limits that sanction authority to exclude awards of attorney or arbitrator fees.we conclude that this is not a proper construction of section.
in interpreting a contract under new york law,words and phrases should be given their plain meaning.lasalle bank ass nomura asset capital,cir internal quotation marks omitted.section simply states the general american rule that each party will bear its own attorney fees and extends the principle to apply also to the fee of the arbitrator selected by each party.thus,section is fairly understood to reflect the parties agreement as to how fees are to be borne,regardless of the arbitration outcome,in the expected context of good faith dealings.see thyroff nationwide mut.ins,cir holding that,under new york law,a covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implicit in every contract.nothing in the section,however,signals the parties intent to limit the arbitrators inherent authority to sanction bad faith participation in the arbitration.certainly,nothing in article x generally,or section specifically,references bad faith or sanction remedies.accordingly,we have no basis for thinking that the parties to this agreement ever considered the question of whether to limit the arbitrators authority to sanction bad faith conduct.in contrast,they did expressly confer comprehensive arbitral authority in section.in light of that conferral,we conclude that section is properly construed to reflect the parties agreement that the arbitrators may not factor attorney or arbitrator fees into awards that result from the parties expected good faith arbitration of a dispute.the section does not signal the parties intent to limit the conferral of comprehensive authority by precluding an award of attorney or arbitrator fees when a party bad faith dealings create a recognized exception to the american rule.
emc asserts that such a reading of section is contrary to new york principles of contract interpretation.it submits that,because the american rule would apply by default even in the absence of section,reading the section as a simple articulation of the american rule would render it superfluous.see galli metz,cir noting that u nder new york law,an interpretation of a contract that has the effect of rendering at least one clause superfluous or meaningless is not preferred and will be avoided if possible internal quotation marks omitted.we are not persuaded.parties to commercial arbitration agreements may choose explicitly to reference the american rule for any number of reasons unrelated to the scope of the arbitrators sanction authority.for example,some arbitrators may not be attorneys and,thus,may be unfamiliar with the american rule.still other arbitrators may come from jurisdictions that employ the english rule where the prevailing party fees are routinely paid by an unsuccessful opponent.
precisely because the agreement in this case conferred broad authority on the arbitrators,because inherent in such authority is the power to sanction bad faith conduct,and because bad faith is a exception to the american rule for attorney fees,we conclude that the simple statement of that rule in section is insufficient by itself to swallow the exception as sophisticated commercial entities,the parties were certainly capable of stating clearly any intent to exclude attorney and arbitrator fees from the broad range of sanctions generally available to arbitrators upon an identification of bad faith.thus,our holding today should not be understood to preclude parties who wish to limit the scope of an arbitrator sanction authority to exclude attorney fees or arbitrator awards from doing so.we require only that they explicitly and clearly state that intent as part of their agreement to arbitrate.
iii.conclusion 
to summarize,we conclude 
that the parties agreement to arbitrate in this case was sufficiently broad to confer equitable authority on the arbitrators to sanction a party bad faith participation in the arbitration 
that an arbitrator identification of bad faith gives rise to an exception to the generally applicable american rule that each party bears its own attorney fees and 
that the statement of the american rule in section of the parties agreement is properly construed to limit the arbitrators authority to award attorney and arbitrator fees only where the parties participate in the arbitration in good faith a more explicit statement would be necessary to manifest any intent to override the exception to the american rule and to preclude the arbitrators from awarding attorney and arbitrator fees as a sanction for bad faith conduct.
accordingly,the judgment of the district court is reversed in part insofar as it vacates the award of attorney and arbitrator fees and the case is remanded with directions that the district court enter judgment confirming the arbitration award in all respects.
this court has apparently never decided a case raising the precisely identical issue presented by the instant appeal.nevertheless,the general principle which i believe should govern our decision here is pellucid v acatur of an arbitral award is appropriate only if the arbitral award contradicts an express and unambiguous term of the contract between the parties or if the award so far departs from the terms of the agreement that it is not even arguably derived from the contract.westerbeke daihatsu motor,cir.
i believe that the majority has disregarded this principle and in so doing fails to acknowledge that the arbitral award at issue here plainly contradicts an express and unambiguous term of the contract entered into by reliastar and emc.specifically,the arbitral award could not properly include an award of attorney fees to reliastar,even if that award was based upon the arbitral panel reasonable conclusion that emc should be sanctioned for bad faith conduct during the arbitration proceedings,because the contract between reliastar and emc divested the arbitral panel of any authority to make an award of attorney fees.thus,i believe that this portion of the award was in excess of the arbitrator authority and should be vacated pursuant to section a of the federal arbitration act faa,a.i must therefore respectfully dissent.
arbitration is of course a matter of contract and,as the supreme court has recently reaffirmed,parties are free to design many features of arbitration by contract,including the way arbitrators are chosen,what their qualifications should be,which issues are arbitrable,along with procedure and choice of substantive law.hall,llc mattel,d thus,t here is no federal policy favoring arbitration under a certain set of procedural rules the federal policy is simply to ensure the enforceability,according to their terms,of agreements to arbitrate.volt info.sciences,bd.of trustees of leland stanford junior,d.
the parties here chose to arbitrate under a set of procedural rules,including the following rule set forth in section of the reinsurance contract each party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrator and related outside attorneys fees,and shall jointly and equally bear with the other party the expenses of the third arbitrator.the majority terms this a general statement.opinion at.this characterization implies that section admits of certain exceptions.it does not it is unqualified.the majority also speaks of the proper construction of section.opinion at.but section is no more susceptible to construction than is article ii,section i of the constitution which provides that no person shall be eligible to be president who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years.i therefore think that the district court was merely declaring the obvious in stating that section is clear as a bell.reliastar life ins.of emc life ins,d.
given the clarity of the meaning of section,the proper disposition of the instant appeal seems to me to be close to.as recently stated by a district court of our circuit in a labor arbitration case,an arbitral panel authority to fashion relief is bounded by the intent of the parties whose contract created the arbitral panel 
an arbitrator authority to settle disputes under a collective bargaining agreement is contractual in nature,and is limited to the powers that the agreement confers.leed architectural,united steelworkers of,local,cir.the arbitrator may not impose a remedy which directly contradicts the express language of the collective bargaining agreement.id.quoting bruno,united food and commercial workers int l union,local,cir.

thus,just as a private agreement may vest authority in an arbitrator,so may it deprive an arbitrator of that authority.hoeft mvl group,cir,overruled on other grounds by hall street.at.we have therefore repeatedly held that arbitrators can not award forms of relief which are plainly in contradiction with the authority afforded them under the contract between the parties,even when the relief appears to be in furtherance of the arbitrator reasonable notion of what fairness or good sense requires.see,porzig dresdner,kleinwort,benson,north america,llc,cir arbitration panel had no authority to fashion award of attorney fees which required attorney to reimburse his client because attorney was not a party to arbitration agreement concourse assocs.fishman,cir where arbitration agreement clearly provided that employee could be terminated for just cause,arbitrator had no authority to fashion an alternative remedy which directed that employee be reinstated for probationary period katz feinberg,cir per curiam in case involving sale of firm,arbitral panel erred in computing firm value where parties sale agreement explicitly afforded firm accountants with sole and final authority to assess its value united states am.soc y of composers,authors and publishers,cir arbitral panel could not set new rate of payment to composers of advertising jingles because nothing in the parties contract gives an arbitration panel authority to modify any rule or regulation if a rule is found by an arbitration panel to be arbitrary,it may declare such rule void thus,the panel authority was exhausted after it declared the rule void.harry hoffman printing,graphic communications int l union,local,cir arbitral panel erred in relying upon the concept of elementary due process in holding that workers must be afforded notice before dismissal because n either section nor of the parties contract,the only provisions discussed by the panel in concluding that notice was necessary,provide for such a broad concept as due process marine pollution,local,int l of teamsters,chauffeurs,warehousemen and helpers of america,cir in the instant case,the arbitrator breached his responsibility to the parties by importing his notions of equity into the arbitration proceeding.his award was not drawn from the contract but from his concern that transit mix drivers be allowed some opportunity for employment while their own employer restructured i
