in a contractual arbitration,a neutral arbitrator must disclose all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed neutral arbitrator would be able to be impartial.code civ,subd.a.in this writ proceeding arising out of a petition to compel the appointment of a neutral arbitrator,the issue is whether the required disclosure must be made at the time the trial court proposes five individuals for the parties consideration,or when the arbitrator is notified in writing that he has been selected by the parties or appointed by the court.as did the trial court,we conclude that disclosure is not required until the arbitrator is actually selected by the parties or appointed by the court and notified as required by section,subdivision b.

discussion 
parties to an arbitration agreement may select the method by which the arbitrator is appointed,but if they fail to do so the court,on petition of a party to the arbitration agreement,shall appoint the arbitrator.when the court agrees that an arbitrator should be appointed,it must nominate five persons from lists of persons supplied jointly by the parties to the arbitration or obtained from a governmental agency concerned with arbitration or private disinterested association concerned with arbitration.the parties to the agreement who seek arbitration and against whom arbitration is sought may within five days of receipt of notice of the nominees from the court jointly select the arbitrator whether or not the arbitrator is among the nominees.if the parties fail to select an arbitrator within the period,the court shall appoint the arbitrator from the nominees.ibid.
regardless of the manner in which the arbitrator is selected,he is required by section to make certain disclosures.a in any arbitration pursuant to an arbitration agreement,when a person is to serve as a neutral arbitrator,the proposed neutral arbitrator shall disclose all matters that could cause a person aware of the facts to reasonably entertain a doubt that the proposed neutral arbitrator would be able to be impartial b subject only to the disclosure requirements of law,the proposed neutral arbitrator shall disclose all matters required to be disclosed pursuant to this section to all parties in writing within calendar days of service of notice of the proposed nomination or appointment,subds.a,b,emphasis added.
the trial court found that section means what it the disclosure obligation is triggered when a person is to serve as a neutral arbitrator,subd.a and must be satisfied within calendar days of service of notice of the proposed nomination or appointment,subd.b.jakks challenges this interpretation,contending disclosure is required at the time the court nominate s five persons at the beginning of the process.for the reasons explained below,jakks is wrong.
several similar terms are used throughout the arbitration statutes,and some of the same words are used to mean different things.in context,the statutes nevertheless make sense.
these are the rules for selecting an arbitrator.when the parties to an arbitration agreement can not agree on an arbitrator,section provides that the court,on petition of a party to the arbitration agreement,shall appoint the arbitrator.emphasis added.when the court determines the petition should be granted,it must nominate five persons from lists supplied by the parties or others,after which the parties may jointly select one of the nominees or someone else or,if they fail to agree,the court must appoint the arbitrator from the nominees,emphasis added.

these are the rules governing disqualification.a proposed neutral arbitrator is disqualified if he fails to timely make the required disclosures,subd.a,emphasis added.if the proposed neutral arbitrator timely makes the required disclosures,he is subject to a peremptory challenge by each party,subds.b,b,and to disqualification for cause,subds.c,d.
read together,it is clear that the court duty to nominate five persons to be considered by the parties obligates the court to propose five individuals,not select or appoint any one of them as the actual arbitrator.if the parties remain deadlocked,the court must then appoint the arbitrator from the nominees.ibid emphasis added.from the arbitrator perspective,his disclosure obligations are not triggered until a determination is made that he is to serve as a neutral arbitrator,subd.a and he has received written notice of his proposed nomination by the parties or appointment by the court,subd.b,emphasis added quite plainly,the trial court proposal nomination of possible arbitrators is done without notice to the candidates and before any one of them is selected nominated by the parties or appointed by the court.the fact that nominate is used one way in section and another in section does not change the plain meaning of the two statutes.see black law dict.ed,to nominate is to name,designate by name,appoint,or propose for election or appointment webster new internat.dict.nominate means the act of submitting a name,or the act of appointing,or the state of being nominated consumer advocacy group,exxon mobil th,d.
