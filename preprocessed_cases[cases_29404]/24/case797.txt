background 
from to,mcgrann worked as a research analyst and institutional salesperson for the investment bank of wessels,arnold and henderson wessels in minneapolis,minnesota.during his tenure at wessels,mcgrann sales territory included boston and new york.in,mcgrann earned in,he earned.in his performance review,mcgrann was characterized as professional,trusted,intelligent,and one of wessels top salespersons.
in the fall of,fac senior vice president and director of institutional equity sales contacted mcgrann and two other salespersons at wessels to discuss employment with fac.during negotiations,mcgrann estimated the revenues he might generate if he joined fac institutional equity sales division.in march,fac offered employment to mcgrann and the other two wessels employees.in an agreement dated march,fac hired mcgrann as managing director of fac institutional equity sales department under the following terms 
we have agreed to pay you a base salary at the rate of per year for calendar years and to the extent you remain employed by us.generally,bonuses are based on your contribution,the performance of the firm as a whole and other important factors within our sole discretion.however,we have agreed to pay you a bonus of not less than for and for.such bonuses will be payable on february of the following year or on such other date as bonuses are paid,and only if you remain employed by us at such times.
we have agreed to give you a loan of the loan,which will be forgiven in two equal annual installments during the employment period provided that you remain employed by us on such dates.

if fac terminates your employment for any reason other than cause as defined below prior to the second anniversary of your employment you will i receive the balance of your unpaid base salary and shall be vested in the restricted stock and the contribution,in each case as though you had been employed for two full years,ii be forgiven the loan in full and iii receive or have already received the bonus for the year 
this letter agreement shall be subject to,governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of new york without regard to its choice of law principles 
in november,fac tried to renegotiate the terms of the agreement,asking mcgrann to rip up his compensation guarantees.mcgrann responded,we all negotiated in good faith and all of a sudden fac want s us to give these up six months later no.we not interested in that.within a week,fac terminated the employment of one of the three wessels employees who had moved to fac.the day after that termination,fac summoned mcgrann to a meeting,informing him his account package is under review.at the meeting,fac changed mcgrann coverage territory.mcgrann responded he was willing to make the change if he could help the firm.fac then sought concessions on mcgrann guaranteed compensation,saying,you should do the honorable thing and offer to make concessions to fac.mcgrann responded,we all negotiated in good faith.fac replied,honorable men make honorable gestures.although mcgrann refused to concede his compensation guarantees,fac nonetheless reassured mcgrann that fac wished to retain him.
on april,fac again approached mcgrann about his compensation,informing mcgrann that fac was coming after his contractual guarantees.fac asked mcgrann,will you tear up your guarantee on your cash bonus if you tear that up,you can keep the restricted stock and deferred comp,but just give back the.the next day,fac bluntly said to mcgrann,we want to honor your employment contract but your production has sucked.to the point,fac said,if you do give up your guarantees,fac ca control what might happen.in response to fac request to renegotiate,mcgrann stated,at this point i am not willing to cut up my contract.i took a ton of risk coming here.fac answered,ok.that your choice,but now it all about business.it not personal.
on may,fac sent mcgrann a letter stating he had not substantially performed his duties and his production ha d been extremely disappointing.the letter threatened a for cause termination of employment if mcgrann did not cure all of his performance deficiencies,which could only be accomplished if mcgrann generated of revenue per month for three months.fac top producer had achieved only of revenue in any given month.despite the tall order,mcgrann increased the intensity of his work to meet fac new demands.
on october,fac terminated mcgrann employment,contending the termination was for cause because mcgrann failed to perform his duties.fac simply determined it was worth the risk to fire mcgrann for cause.when seeking employment after the termination,mcgrann informed potential employers fac terminated his employment for cause due to his inability to meet production requirements.mcgrann believes his duty to inform potential employers of his for cause termination caused him to lose leverage in the employment process,as he was not able to negotiate from a position of strength.
because the parties were associated with the national association of securities dealers,nasd,mcgrann sought arbitration before an nasd dispute resolution panel.over the course of eleven days,mcgrann and fac presented their claims to an arbitration panel.the panel arbitration award provided the following case summary 
mcgrann asserted the following causes of action against fac breach of contract,violation of minnesota stat,and violations of nasd rules.the causes of action related to mcgrann allegation that fac breached its employment contract with him after unilaterally imposing additional performance obligations.mcgrann further alleged that fac stated false and defamatory reasons for his departure and has not honored the guaranteed bonuses and incentives as set forth in the march,employment contract.
mcgrann initially sought unspecified damages.at the hearing,mcgrann sought in compensatory damages,as well as costs,attorney fees,interest,punitive damages and equitable relief.mcgrann attorney presented the following argument to the panel fac breached the contract.they do get the benefit of a contract that they did adhere to.mcgrann worked of the year.at a minimum he is entitled to of his bonus.and we believe,but for this breach,he would have finished the year and earned his entire.
fac denied mcgrann allegations,asserted a number of affirmative defenses,and counterclaimed for breach of contract,fraud,misrepresentation,fraudulent inducement,negligence,negligent misrepresentation and violation of nasd rules.at the hearing,fac sought in compensatory damages,as well as interest,attorney fees,punitive damages,costs and equitable relief.fac presented the arbitration panel an exhibit outlining fac theory regarding the alternate for cause and no cause termination scenarios as of october,the termination date.according to fac,if the arbitration panel found fac terminated mcgrann employment for cause,then mcgrann owed fac plus interest.on the other hand,fac contended,if the arbitration panel found fac terminated mcgrann employment without cause,then the maximum fac owed mcgrann was.according to fac,the agreement limited mcgrann damages for termination without cause to,which included in unpaid salary in restricted stock and in deferred compensation.
on march,the arbitration panel issued its award.the arbitration panel found in mcgrann favor,and awarded him in compensatory damages,interest on that amount,in attorney fees under minnesota statutes section,and for filing fees.the arbitration panel also found no evidence supported fac fraud claim,and that claim was made only for the purpose of coercing mcgrann.
seeking confirmation of the arbitration award,mcgrann filed suit in minnesota state court,and fac removed the case to federal court.fac moved to vacate,in part,the award based on the no cause termination provision.claiming the arbitration panel failed to follow the parties agreement,manifestly disregarded the law,and acted irrationally in delivering its award,fac asked the district court to reduce the award to.
the district court confirmed the arbitration award,finding there is no evidence to support the claim that the arbitrators disregarded the law t he defendant also fail ed to illustrate irrationality in the award such that this court should disregard its conclusions.rejecting fac argument the agreement limited the damages the arbitration panel could award,the district court concluded 
t here no evidence to support fac argument that the arbitrators were restricted simply to that agreement in returning their awarded damages.the panel is not bound by fac own interpretation of its letter agreement.the agreement makes no provision for any contractual damages t here was evidence from which the arbitration panel could have found that fac did breach the letter agreement when they fired mcgrann and falsely styled it as for cause.in that case the arbitration panel could have awarded damages resulting simply from the breach alone.
citing united industrial syndicate,western auto supply,cir,the district court noted the arbitration award could have been based on the general proposition that breach of contract damages are measured by placing the nonbreaching party in the position it would have been but for that breach.however,the district court quickly recognized,it not for this court to conjecture on the basis which the arbitral panel reached.finally,the district court noted 
mcgrann also produced evidence that his termination did cause damages beyond his lost compensation,and that might have included damages for defamation the arbitrators may have considered mcgrann difficulty in securing new employment in their award.having then a number of possible bases,this court can not find that the determination by the arbitral panel was either in disregard of the law or irrational.
fac appeals the district court confirmation of the entire arbitration award.fac contends the arbitration panel exceeded their powers and foisted their interpretation upon an unambiguous contract provision,and also crafted an irrational award that failed to draw its essence from the plain language of the parties agreement.in essence,fac argues its interpretation of the agreement compensation guarantees,when analyzed under either the for cause or no cause termination provisions,is the only reasonable interpretation of what fac deems to be an unambiguous agreement.because the arbitration later the district not agree with fac interpretation,fac contends we must reverse the district court,vacate the arbitration award,and remand with instructions to confirm the arbitration award only in the amount of.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
when reviewing a district court order confirming an arbitration award,we review de novo questions of law,but we accept the district court factual findings unless clearly erroneous.schoch infousa,cir.although we review de novo the district court legal conclusions,we provide an extraordinary level of deference to the underlying arbitration award.id.citation omitted.courts have absolutely no authority to reconsider the merits of an arbitration award,even when the parties allege the award rests on factual errors or on a misinterpretation of the underlying contract.see also gas boise cascade,cir acknowledging contract interpretation is left to the arbitrator.even though an arbitrator may interpret ambiguous language in a contract without fear of judicial intervention,the arbitrator may not disregard or modify unambiguous contract provisions.gas,at.the bottom line is w e will confirm the arbitrator award even if we are convinced that the arbitrator committed serious error,so long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority.schoch,at citations and quotations omitted.
although arbitrators have broad authority,their decisions are subject to limited judicial review.id.the federal arbitration act faa sets forth specific reasons for vacating an arbitration award.see a including corruption,fraud,or undue means in the procurement of the award,or evident partiality or corruption,misconduct,or ultra vires acts by the arbitrators.for instance,a district court may vacate an arbitrator award if the arbitrator exceeded his or her powers.a.the reasons for vacating an arbitration award are not limited to the reasons listed in the faa,however.
in addition to the faa expressed reasons for vacating arbitration awards,our court has recognized two additional,but extremely narrow,reasons for vacating arbitration awards.schoch,at citation omitted.first,a court can vacate an arbitration award if it is completely irrational,which means it fails to draw its essence from the agreement.id.citation omitted.an arbitration award draws its essence from the agreement if the award is derived from the agreement,viewed in light of the agreement language and context,as well as other indications of the parties intention.id.second,a court can vacate an arbitration award if it evidence s a manifest disregard for the law.id.alteration in original citation omitted.an award manifests disregard for the law when an arbitrator clearly identifies the applicable,governing law,but then ignores it.id.
no grounds to vacate arbitration award 
fac contends the plain language of the no cause termination provision provide s mcgrann could not receive his bonus unless employed by fac on february.fac specifically argues,no provision of the agreement allows fac to pay or mcgrann to receive a share of his bonus.according to the plain language of the agreement,the bonus would not be paid unless fac employed mcgrann on february.fac certainly tried to persuade the arbitration panel with this argument,but the arbitration panel rejected it.fac then reprised its views onto the district court,which rejected fac contention only fac possessed the proper interpretation of the agreement.we,too,reject fac argument,concluding the arbitration panel was not bound by fac contract interpretation argument.
the first reason to reject fac argument is the arbitration panel was not bound by fac interpretation of the agreement,because the agreement was not so simplistically drawn to be free from ambiguity.although fac proposed mcgrann was entitled to his bonus only if he was employed by fac on february,reasonable,it is not the only plausible interpretation.
the agreement specifically referenced fac discretion when it came to awarding bonuses to employees generally,bonuses are based on your contribution,the performance of the firm as a whole and other important factors within our sole discretion.fac did not have unbridled discretion,however,when it came to mcgrann bonuses.instead,the agreement guaranteed mcgrann bonuses to the following extent we have agreed to pay you a bonus of not less than for and for.such bonuses will be payable on february of the following year or on such other date as bonuses are paid,and only if you remain employed by us at such times.
there is no doubt the agreement guaranteed the payment of the bonus in full if mcgrann was employed on february.however,the agreement arguably is ambiguous as to payment if mcgrann were not employed on february.a plausible interpretation is the agreement payment date provision,which follows the bonus guarantee,simply referred to when payment would occur.for example,if mcgrann were not employed on the payment date whether that be february
