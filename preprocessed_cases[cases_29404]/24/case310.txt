opinion of the court 
nationwide mutual fire insurance company nationwide appeals the order of the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania granting appellee george hamilton,hamilton summary judgment and dismissing nationwide motion to compel arbitration.nationwide challenges the district court determination that it was collaterally estopped from seeking enforcement of a contractual arbitration clause because of a previous state court lawsuit to which nationwide was not a party,and it further challenges the district court conclusion that,irrespective of estoppel,the federal action was duplicative of a pending action in state court and warranted abstention pursuant to doctrine laid down by the supreme court in colorado river water conservation district united states,d.we conclude that the previous state court ruling does not preclude nationwide,who was a nonparty and did not otherwise have its interests represented before the state court,from seeking to enforce the arbitration provision of its agreement with hamilton.we further conclude that the kind of extraordinary circumstances warranting abstention under colorado river are not present here.we will therefore reverse and remand to the district court to consider the merits of nationwide petition to compel arbitration.
background 
nationwide issued a single policy of liability insurance to hamilton which provided hamilton with coverage from january,to january.during the policy period,hamilton,an installer of commercial and industrial insulation,received claims for injuries allegedly caused by products it had installed.in,hamilton and nationwide,along with other carriers,including pennsylvania manufacturers association insurance company pma,entered into an interim claim handling and settlement agreement the settlement agreement or agreement.the settlement agreement concerned the administration and allocation of defense and indemnity resources for claims under the various insurers policies.under the agreement,an insurer obligation to pay defense and indemnity costs continued until it could establish that it had exhausted its policy limits.upon proof of exhaustion,that insurer was released by hamilton and discharged from further obligation,and any remaining costs were allocated proportionally among the remaining insurers.it is undisputed that the settlement agreement included a minimum term and that,following the expiration of the term,the agreement could be terminated as to all parties by the withdrawal of any one party,so long as written notice,delivered by certified mail,was provided to all parties days in advance of the termination date.
nationwide participated in the settlement agreement until early,when it claimed to have exhausted its policy limits and provided proof of exhaustion to both hamilton and its fellow carriers on may,hamilton stated that it was willing to accept the evidence of exhaustion supplied by nationwide.while the parties dispute whether nationwide was then released from any obligation to defend or indemnify hamilton,it is undisputed that nationwide did not participate in hamilton defense or pay further indemnification after 
in addition to setting the insurers obligations with regard to indemnity and defense,the settlement agreement included an arbitration clause providing that the parties agree that any and all disputes arising out of,or relating to this agreement,or breach thereof,shall be decided by nonjudicial arbitration which shall be binding on the parties sic in accordance with,section.notice of the demand for arbitration shall be served in writing upon all other parties to this agreement.
on january,pma filed a complaint the pma action in the court of common pleas of allegheny county,pennsylvania,seeking a declaratory judgment against hamilton and several insurers other than nationwide.pma contended that it had exhausted its policy limits under various umbrella policies it had written for hamilton and that it therefore had no further obligation to hamilton.five days later,pma served hamilton with an arbitration demand under the settlement agreement.pma did not serve nationwide with a copy of the arbitration demand,as required under the terms of the settlement agreement.hamilton rejected the demand on march.in addition to declining the arbitration demand,hamilton responded to pma complaint in the court of common pleas.it filed a new matter and counterclaim against pma,asserting various claims for breach of contract and bad faith and arguing that pma had a duty to defend and indemnify it for asbestos related claims under pma primary policy,which was subject to the settlement agreement,and other umbrella policies which were not subject to the settlement agreement.pma filed preliminary objections to the counterclaims before the court of common pleas,contending that the counterclaims were controlled by the settlement agreement and should be dismissed in light of the arbitration clause.
three years later,on may,the court of common pleas issued an order sustaining pma objections,but the court stated that it would vacate its order and overrule the preliminary objections if within ten days hamilton sends a notice of withdrawal from the settlement a greement.the court further stated that 
i agree with hamilton if hamilton is saying that it is not required to arbitrate pursuant to paragraph of the settlement agreement if it elects to terminate the agreement at this time.
however,i disagree with hamilton if hamilton is taking the position that it is not bound by the arbitration clause even though it chooses not to terminate the agreement.it can not use some portions of the agreement and disassociate itself from other portions of the agreement.
app.on may,hamilton responded by sending to nationwide and the other settlement agreement signatories notice of its intent to withdraw from the agreement.the court of common pleas then,on june,granted hamilton motion to vacate and overruled pma objections to the counterclaims.the court june order,vacating its may order,did not state a basis for the vacatur nor did it recognize that,at a minimum,the settlement agreement required days written notice for a withdrawal to be effective.
in addition to the suit initiated by pma,a second hamilton insurer,ace property casualty ace,though it was not a party to the settlement agreement,also filed an action the ace action against hamilton and other insurers seeking declaratory relief regarding its duty to defend and indemnify hamilton.again,nationwide was not made a party.the ace action was filed in the court of common pleas of philadelphia county on december,a year after the pma action began.in response to a defense motion,the court in philadelphia transferred the case to the court of common pleas in allegheny county on july.the ace action has since been coordinated with the pma action and both cases remain pending 
on june,a defendant in the ace action filed a complaint against nationwide,marking the first time that nationwide became a party in either the ace or pma actions nationwide filed its answer to the complaint on august.on september,hamilton filed an answer,new matter counterclaim and crossclaims.there were still no causes of action asserted by hamilton against nationwide.
on october,hamilton tendered new claims to nationwide and other insurers seeking indemnity and defense.the claims were hamilton first against nationwide in the more than ten years since nationwide had asserted exhaustion of its policy limits under the release and discharge provision of the settlement agreement.on february,hamilton filed amended crossclaims in the ace action,including,for the first time,allegations against nationwide.in its reply to hamilton amended crossclaims,nationwide raised the arbitration provision of the settlement agreement as an affirmative defense but has not otherwise presented the arbitration issue to the state court.however,pursuant to the settlement agreement,nationwide served hamilton with an arbitration demand on april.hamilton denied the demand,and nationwide then filed this action in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania to compel arbitration.soon thereafter,hamilton moved to dismiss or for summary judgment,and,on november,the district court granted the summary judgment motion.
in granting hamilton motion,the district court determined that,as a result of a ruling by the court of common pleas in the pma action,nationwide was collaterally estopped from invoking the arbitration clause in the settlement agreement.the court reasoned that nationwide was in privity with pma and shared an identity of interest in enforcing the arbitration agreement.app.as an alternative basis for its ruling,the district court cited the colorado river abstention doctrine,finding that the state and federal proceedings were parallel and that exceptional circumstances warranting abstention were present,despite the strong federal policy in favor of upholding arbitration agreements and the general rule that the faa does not favor abstention.app.nationwide timely appealed the district court order,contesting the court rulings on both collateral estoppel and abstention 
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction under.we have jurisdiction under.we exercise plenary review over a district court decision regarding collateral estoppel.see prusky reliastar life ins,cir citation omitted.in reviewing a decision to abstain under the colorado river doctrine,we exercise plenary review over legal questions,including the determination of whether the proceedings in state and federal court are properly considered parallel.see ryan johnson,cir.if the proceedings are parallel,we review for abuse of discretion a district court decision to abstain although,to the extent the district court evaluated a factor based on an erroneous view of the law,it necessarily abused it discretion and appellate review becomes plenary.id.
iii.discussion 
the district court decided that there is a sufficient identity of interests between nationwide and pma that pma can be said to have adequately represented nationwide in the pma action and that,accordingly,the two insurers are in privity for estoppel purposes.nationwide understandably takes exception to that ruling,and we agree that estoppel was inappropriate.nationwide and pma were not in privity because pma was not nationwide legal representative,nor do the two companies have any other relationship warranting the conclusion that they were in privity.indeed,at the time of the state court ruling in the pma action,nationwide interests were not even adverse to hamilton and so can not rightly be said to have been aligned with pma 
nationwide also objects to the district court conclusion that abstention pursuant to the colorado river doctrine provides an independent basis for dismissal.again,we agree and conclude that the district court erred in determining that the instant case presents extraordinary circumstances that warrant abstention.because the question of abstention is jurisdictional and would dispose of the matter in its entirety,we address it first.
abstention 
the colorado river doctrine allows a federal court to abstain,either by staying or dismissing a pending federal action,when there is a parallel ongoing state court proceeding.see colorado river water conservation district united states,d.the doctrine is to be narrowly applied in light of the general principle that federal courts have a strict duty to exercise the jurisdiction that is conferred upon them by congress.quackenbush allstate ins,d see also colorado river,at.the doctrine of abstention,under which a district court may decline to exercise or postpone the exercise of its jurisdiction,is an extraordinary and narrow exception to the duty of a district court to adjudicate a controversy properly before it.internal quotation omitted.whether abstention is appropriate is a inquiry.the initial question is whether there is a parallel state proceeding that raises substantially identical claims and nearly identical allegations and issues.yang tsui,cir internal quotation and citation omitted.if the proceedings are parallel,courts then look to a test to determine whether extraordinary circumstances meriting abstention are present.spring city american bldgs,cir.we need not take up the parallel action analysis here because,even presuming parallelism,this action does not present the type of circumstances warranting abstention.
in determining whether an action presents extraordinary circumstances we consider six factors in an in rem case,which court first assumed jurisdiction over the property the inconvenience of the federal forum the desirability of avoiding piecemeal litigation the order in which jurisdiction was obtained whether federal or state law controls and whether the state court will adequately protect the interests of the parties.spring city,at no one factor is determinative a carefully considered judgment taking into account both the obligation to exercise jurisdiction and the combination of factors counseling against that exercise is required.colorado river,at.the balancing of factors is heavily weighted in favor of the exercise of jurisdiction.moses cone memorial hosp.mercury constr,d.
of primary importance with regard to this case are the third and fourth factors.as the parties concede,the first two factors are irrelevant,as this is not an in rem action and the federal forum is convenient for both parties.the fifth and sixth factors also carry little weight here.the fifth factor is relatively neutral,given that the federal arbitration act the faa governs the enforceability of the arbitration clause but a choice of law clause provides that pennsylvania law governs the settlement agreement.the sixth factor does not significantly inform the analysis because the faa grants concurrent jurisdiction to federal and state courts and thus expressly contemplates the state court as an adequate forum for adjudication.see spring,at t he question whether parties interests are protected is only relevant when they are not that is,when the state court is adequate,this factor carries little weight.quoting ryan,at.
the third and fourth factors,however,weigh heavily against abstention.the third factor,the desirability of avoiding piecemeal litigation,was b y far the most important factor in the colorado river decision itself.moses cone,at.by definition,it is an inquiry into whether avoiding piecemeal litigation is a priority contemplated by the statute,regulation,or other authority at issue.spring,at third factor satisfied only where the law in question evinces a strong federal policy against such litigation.in this instance,rather than containing a strong policy against piecemeal litigation,the faa has a policy in favor of it,at least to the extent necessary to preserve arbitration rights,as the supreme court made clear in moses cone.the court considered whether abstention was appropriate when there was a federal action to compel arbitration under a contract at the same time that there was a state court action seeking a declaration that there was no contractual right to arbitration.at.the state court case also contained disputes between the federal defendant and a third party,a fact which the defendants claimed militated in favor of abstention due to the potential for piecemeal adjudications.id.the supreme court rejected that argument,concluding that 
it is true that if plaintiff obtains an arbitration order for its dispute,the defendant will be forced to resolve these related disputes in different forums.that misfortune,however,is not the result of any choice between the federal and state courts it occurs because the relevant federal law requires piecemeal resolution when necessary to give effect to an arbitration agreement.under the arbitration act,an arbitration agreement must be enforced notwithstanding the presence of other persons who are parties to the underlying dispute but not to the arbitration agreement.
id.at.emphasis added.the circumstances presented in moses cone are analogous to those before us.while not all parties in the ace action are covered by the arbitration agreement between nationwide and hamilton,and enforcement of the arbitration agreement may result in separate adjudications,that is an insufficient basis for the district court to decline jurisdiction.because the faa requires piecemeal litigation where necessary,irrespective of any concomitant decline in judicial efficiency,this critical factor weighs against abstention.
the fourth factor,the order in which jurisdiction was obtained,also counsels against abstention.although the pma and ace actions were both filed prior to nationwide initiation of this suit,we must consider more than which action was filed first.see moses cone,at.defendants first filed argument gives too mechanical a reading to the priority element of the colorado river balance.the comparative progress made in the state cases and this one also needs to be considered.id.at.although there has been significant progress in the state cases with regard to hamilton crossclaims against nationwide and the other insurers,consideration of the arbitration issue is not so far advanced.it has been raised only in nationwide response to the crossclaims and has not otherwise been litigated before the court of common pleas.on this record,it does not appear that there will be much,if any,duplicative judicial effort in allowing the arbitration issue to proceed in the federal forum where the parties have already been litigating it.see moses cone,at.observing that because the parties had submitted extensive briefing on the arbitrability issue,i t is readily apparent that if the district court had denied the stay,it doubtless could and should have gone on to decide the arbitrability point in very short order.
on balance,the relevant factors weigh against abstention.
collateral 
because the district court had jurisdiction and should have exercised it,the question becomes whether collateral estoppel applies against nationwide demand for arbitration.there is no dispute that pennsylvania law on collateral estoppel governs in this diversity action.see semtek int l lockheed martin,d holding that the preclusion law to be applied is that of the state in which the federal diversity court sits.under pennsylvania law,the following conditions must be satisfied for collateral estoppel to bar a subsequent claim the issue decided in the prior case must be identical to the one presented in the later case there was a final judgment on the merits in the prior action t he party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party to the prior action,or is in privity with a party to the prior action and t he party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior action.rue,the parties agree,as do we,that pennsylvania law is not inconsistent with federal decisions on collateral estoppel and privity,and we therefore consider our own precedent to be persuasive in addressing collateral estoppel questions arising under pennsylvania law.first options of chicago,kaplan,state law requirements for res judicata and privity are not inconsistent with the federal law applied by the court of appeals for the third circuit.
collateral estoppel operates to bar successive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually litigated and resolved in a valid court determination.new hampshire maine,d.prohibiting parties from going to court again after they have had a full opportunity to litigate guards against the expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits,conserves judicial resources,and fosters reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibility of inconsistent decisions.montana united states,d.estoppel,however,is limited by the due process principle that a judgment or decree among parties to a lawsuit resolves issues as among them,but it does not conclude the rights of strangers to those proceedings.richards jefferson county,d citation omitted.thus there is generally a bar against applying collateral estoppel to those who were not parties in the prior litigation.
a exception to that bar exists when the nonparty is in privity with someone who was a party to the prior suit.richards,at.while simply stated,the exception can prove difficult in application because,as pennsylvania courts have noted,p rivity is a term which the courts have never been able to define satisfactorily.ammon mccloskey.indeed,the efforts at definition have been notably circular for example,privity has traditionally been understood as referring to the existence of a substantive legal relationship,such as by contract,from which it was deemed appropriate to bind one of the contracting parties to the results of the other party participation in litigation.taylor.at.sometimes privity is referred to as a mutual or successive right or interest in the same property.see greenway ctr.essex ins,cir.over time,the definition of privity has loosened to the point that the word is now used as a way to express the conclusion that nonparty preclusion collateral estoppel is appropriate on any ground.taylor.at.during the course of that definitional loosening,the term virtual representation,employed here by the district court,has come into usage.
under the virtual representation version of privity,a nonparty may be estopped in a second action where a party acted as the virtual representative of the,meaning that there is such an identification of interest between the two as to represent the same legal right.collins,at citations omitted caselaw from courts within our circuit has provided conflicting statements regarding virtual representation as an exception to the bar against nonparty collateral estoppel.compare first options.at stating that while some courts have required that a prior legal relationship exist between the party and nonparty,r ather than requiring the legal obligation or accountability in all circumstances,however,the cases are better read as indicating that such a relationship is but one factor that will push mere sharing of parallel interests,into privity for res judicata or collateral estoppel purposes with collins dupont de nemours,cir virtual representation does not mean merely that someone in the suit serves the interests of the person outside the suit.it requires a relationship by which the party in the suit is the legally designated representative of the a legal relationship is not only a sufficient condition for privity,it is also a necessary one.but,as collins indicates,our own precedent has been to require a preexisting legal relationship between those contending over privity,before lifting the bar against collateral estoppel.the scope of privity,while largely freed from the very constrictive common law mutuality anchor,remains small.collins,at.
that approach was recently vindicated when the supreme court considered the soundness of the virtual representation doctrine and the meaning of the term privity.in taylor sturgell.the court considered a decision by the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit that precluded taylor from filing a suit under the freedom of information act.the basis of the court of appeals decision was that a third party,with whom taylor had no legal relationship,had previously filed an unsuccessful suit on the same theory and facts advanced by taylor.id.at.the circuit concluded that the third party was taylor virtual representative in the prior action.in rejecting that conclusion,the supreme court stated emphatically that w e disapprove the doctrine of preclusion by virtual representation.id.the court specifically rejected the argument,advanced by appellees and adopted by the district court in this case,that preclusion exists where the relationship between a party and a is close enough to bring the second litigant within the judgment.id.at.application of such a standard would require a diffuse balancing test at odds with the preferred constrained approach to nonparty preclusion.id.at in addition,such a liberal virtual privity doctrine would defy the limitations on nonparty preclusion established by the requirement that the party adequately represent the interests of the nonparty.id.citing richards,at.
accordingly,in line with taylor,and for the reasons articulated therein,we reject the notion of virtual representation as an exception to nonparty
