electrolux home products electrolux appeals the district court denial of its motion for summary judgment on a claim to vacate an industrial arbitration award.electrolux also appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the on a claim for enforcement of the arbitration award.we affirm.
factual background 
electrolux owns and operates a production facility in webster city,iowa.the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america the union and the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america,local local collectively the uaw are the collective bargaining unit representatives for the hourly workers at the iowa facility.this case involves an arbitrator interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement the agreement between uaw and electrolux and application of the agreement to a collective bargaining unit employee,deborah cook.
under the agreement,electrolux has the right to terminate employees for cause.also,the agreement provides,attendance related disciplinary action shall be in line with the provisions of the plant attendance policy.the agreement further provides that electrolux 
s hall establish and publish a family and medical leave of absence policy consistent with the provisions of the family and medical leave act of fmla.the company may,from time to time,amend the policy,but under no circumstances shall an employee receive less benefits than those provided under the family and medical leave act of.
electrolux has such a policy under which employees are required to document their absences 
any leave forms not returned within the required time frame,incomplete or improperly completed leave forms,or leave requests which are denied,could result in the loss of attendance points and employees could be subject to other applicable contractual language regarding unexcused absences from work.
any eligible employee applying for fmla leave must obtain a form from human resources.
if circumstances occur where the employee can not reasonably provide the required thirty day notice,the employee must notify human resources as soon as possible.the employee must obtain the required form and return the completed document as soon as reasonably possible.
attendance points refer to credits in a system that electrolux established as its attendance policy.under the attendance policy,an employee starts with eight attendance points.the employee earns points for sufficient periods without unexcused absences and loses points for unexcused absences.absences that qualify under the provisions of the fmla are excused and do not result in a loss of attendance points.it has been a practice at the iowa facility to presume that absences of three or more consecutive days involve situations that qualify under the fmla.also,it has been a practice at the facility to demand medical certification to explain absences from work for periods of less than three days.it is undisputed that it is cause for termination if an employee uses all of his or her attendance points.
electrolux fired deborah cook on august,for exhausting all eight of her attendance points.cook does not dispute earlier determinations related to the loss of her first seven points.she disputes only the decision to subtract an attendance point for a absence on july.we discuss that day,her subsequent attempts to document her absence,and,to a limited extent,her medical history.
cook left work early on july,after telling her supervisor that her stomach hurt and after receiving permission to leave.her regular physician could not see her that day.on august,after her regular work shift,she was able to see a physician assistant in nearby fort dodge,iowa.she reported nausea to the physician assistant who diagnosed her with gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd and prescribed a proton pump inhibitor.the physician assistant was neither designated nor approved by electrolux to make fmla determinations,but the physician assistant was,in fact,qualified under the fmla.the physician assistant refused cook request to certify the ailment as incapacitating or as protected by the fmla.when representatives from electrolux contacted the physician assistant after august,the physician assistant said that she would not recognize the event as an fmla occurrence.
on august,electrolux terminated cook employment because she had not submitted a leave form certifying the absence as an fmla occurrence.cook asked for more time so that she could see her regular doctor,but electrolux denied her request.cook claims that she contacted the department of labor and was told that she could obtain a second opinion.she also claims that she contacted her regular doctor office and was told by someone at that office not her regular doctor that her doctor could see her in the future but that he would not override another person decision 
on august,a nurse practitioner in gowrie,iowa,examined cook.the nurse practitioner was neither designated nor approved by electrolux to make fmla determinations,but the nurse practitioner was,in fact,qualified under the fmla.cook did not tell the nurse practitioner that she had been examined by,or received a prescription from,the physician assistant three days earlier.cook also did not tell the nurse practitioner that the physician assistant had refused to certify the july absence.the nurse practitioner wrote cook a prescription for a different proton pump inhibitor and filled out an fmla leave form.on the form,in response to the question,d escribe the medical facts which support your certification,including a brief statement as to how the medical facts meet the criteria of one of these categories of fmla qualifying conditions,the nurse practitioner answered,chronic gastritis including episodes of acute epigastric pain.this condition may cause episodic absence due to the illness.in response to the question,i f medical leave is required for the employee absence from work because of the employee own condition including absences due to pregnancy or a chronic condition,is the employee unable to perform any kind of work,the nurse practitioner answered,during times of acute onset of symptoms,employee unable to work.
cook offered these papers from the nurse practitioner to electrolux.the company told her that it did not have to accept documentation provided from a health care provider who was not her treating physician and who saw her that many days after the absence.
cook then filed a grievance under the collective bargaining agreement.it was undisputed that the collective bargaining agreement mandated arbitration of the grievance.an arbitration hearing took place on july.at the hearing,the physician assistant who had treated cook testified that,on july,cook was not incapacitated,did not suffer from a serious health condition within the meaning of the fmla,and did not qualify for fmla leave.the nurse practitioner who treated cook also testified.she stated that she had not examined cook until days later and could not state under oath that cook had been incapacitated on july.the nurse practitioner stated that cook had not told her of the prior examination by,and attempt to obtain certification from,the physician assistant.
the arbitrator questioned the nurse practitioner about gerd.the nurse practitioner stated that gerd is basically heartburn and that cook reported severe epigastric pain.the arbitrator questioned the nurse practitioner about whether there would be any way to test the severity of the pain,whether the pain could be severe enough to be incapacitating,and whether treatment with medicines could or would work.the nurse practitioner explained that there is no real way to test or verify the level of pain.the nurse practitioner also answered that it possible that treatment by medicines would work and permit someone with gerd to avoid seeing a physician.she also stated that she made her diagnosis and prescribed medicine based on cook complaints and that she would have treated cook the same way if cook had visited her earlier.
relevant to the issues presented in this case are the following facts from cook medical history.in july,a physician diagnosed co
