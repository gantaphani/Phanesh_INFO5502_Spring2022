on may,plaintiffs,the nasdaq omx group,and the nasdaq stock market llc collectively nasdaq,conducted the initial public offering ipo for facebook.the ipo was one of the largest in history,with million shares of facebook common stock offered at per share,for a total value of over billion.in conducting the offering,nasdaq encountered and addressed various problems,prompting a number of subsequent actions,including disciplinary proceedings by the securities and exchange commission sec,see order instituting admin.cease and desist proceeding,sec release,wl,at may,sec release,and changes to nasdaq rules.among the latter is a new rule subsection establishing a voluntary procedure for nasdaq members injured in the facebook ipo to seek compensation.see order granting approval of a proposed rule change to amend rule limitation of liability,sec release,sec release.defendant ubs securities,llc ubs chose not to pursue that avenue for relief,instead initiating an arbitration proceeding against nasdaq seeking indemnification for injuries sustained in the facebook ipo,as well as damages for breach of contract,breach of an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing,and gross negligence.
nasdaq initiated this declaratory judgment action to preclude ubs from pursuing arbitration.ubs now appeals from a preliminary injunction to that effect,entered on june,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york robert sweet,judge.see nasdaq omx,ubs sec.llc,d.in seeking vacatur of the injunction,ubs contends that the district court erred in exercising federal question jurisdiction in a case presenting only state law claims determining that the arbitrability of ubs claims is a question for decision by the court,rather than an arbitrator and concluding that ubs claims are not subject to arbitration.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we identify no error in these rulings and,therefore,affirm the challenged preliminary injunction.our colleague,judge straub,dissents from the ruling as to federal jurisdiction and,thus,does not reach the other two issues.
background 
a.the facebook ipo 
nasdaq is a,organization sro registered as a national securities exchange under section of the securities exchange act of exchange act.see.it operates one of the largest national securities exchanges,executing approximately of equity securities transactions every day.sec release,wl,at.ubs is a registered and investment adviser,as well as a member of the nasdaq exchange.
on may,nasdaq was scheduled to conduct the facebook ipo.the initial eastern standard start time of was delayed approximately one half hour,largely due to technical difficulties that nasdaq encountered with the ipo cross,the computerized system that typically launches ipo trading by matching buy and sell orders to determine the opening price.see id.at.at,nasdaq switched to a backup failover system that completed the ipo cross,whereupon c ontinuous trading in facebook shares then commenced on nasdaq and other exchanges.id.at.
the delayed start in trading had certain adverse effects,two of particular relevance here.first,over orders entered between and were not included in the completed ipo cross.see id.at.these orders were dealt with in various ways,including some being cancelled by nasdaq and others being released into the market at see id.second,certain trade confirmation messages for orders placed before were not transmitted,as a result of which some nasdaq members were not able to determine whether their orders had been included in the cross and,therefore did not know what position they held in facebook securities.id.at.despite suggestions that it halt trading in the facebook ipo,nasdaq did not do so.see id.at 
nasdaq rules 
in conducting securities trading generally,including the facebook ipo specifically,nasdaq operated pursuant to certain internal rules mandated by federal law.some background as to nasdaq internal rules is helpful to our discussion of issues raised on this appeal 
exchange act mandates with respect to internal rules 
in order to register as an exchange,federal law requires an sro such as nasdaq to demonstrate to the sec that its internal operating rules satisfy the requirements of the exchange act and all federal rules and regulations thereunder.see b c.the exchange act specifically requires that a registered exchange rules be designed 
to promote just and equitable principles of trade,to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating,clearing,settling,processing information with respect to,and facilitating transactions in securities,to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system,and,in general,to protect investors and the public interest.
id.b emphasis added.the highlighted requirement is of particular significance to this case.
with certain exceptions not relevant here,an exchange must secure sec approval for every proposed rule or rule change according to a detailed statutory procedure that provides for public notice and comment,possible hearings,and agency findings.see id.b,b.the exchange act also provides for the sec itself to abrogate,add to,or delete from an exchange rules in specified circumstances.see c.
the act makes an exchange compliance with its own rules a requirement of federal law,see id.g,and rule violations can result in sec revocation of an sro registration,censure,or other sanctions,see id.h.the act further requires an exchange to enforce its members compliance with the exchange act,sec regulations,and the exchange internal rules.see id.b.moreover,it precludes parties from contracting around,or otherwise waiving compliance with,exchange rules.see id.a.
sec sanctions nasdaq for rules violations in connection with the facebook ipo 
the sec conducted an investigation into nasdaq handling of the facebook ipo,which resulted in the agency sanctioning nasdaq for violating the exchange act by not complying with its own rules.notably,the sec found nasdaq not to have complied with nasdaq rule c,which mandates that trading commence immediately after an ipo display only period and limits extension of the display period to specified circumstances found not to have been present in the facebook ipo.see sec release,wl,at.the sec also found nasdaq not to have complied with its own rule a by failing to adhere to its specified priority with respect to approximately orders placed before completion of the facebook ipo cross.see id.at,the sec further identified an exchange act violation insofar as nasdaq rules did not permit nasdaq to assume an error position in its own account,an action that,in connection with the facebook ipo,yielded nasdaq a profit of approximately million.see id.
to address these and other concerns,nasdaq agreed,inter alia,to amend rule and to make certain technical changes to its ipo cross system.see id.at.the sec endorsed these remedial proposals but,nevertheless,sanctioned nasdaq by,inter alia,censuring the exchange,ordering it to cease and desist from violating the exchange act requirement that an exchange adhere to its own rules,and imposing a million civil penalty.see id.at.
c.the parties services agreement 
nasdaq and ubs are parties to a bilateral services agreement,several sections of which are relevant here 
section.b of the services agreement,entitled indemnification,is the basis for ubs underlying claim for breach of contract and indemnification.it states as follows 
nasdaq omx shall be liable to,indemnify against,and hold subscriber,ubs,its employees,directors,and other agents harmless from,any and all claims or losses as those terms are defined herein imposed on,incurred by or asserted against ubs,its employees,directors,and other agents to the extent that the claims and losses result from acts or omissions of nasdaq omx,its employees,directors,agents or associated persons or from the receipt or use of ubs data including representations about ubs data by nasdaq omx,its employees,directors,or agents 
the referenced claims or losses are defined in section.g of the services agreement as follows 
any and all liabilities,obligations,losses,damages,penalties,claims,actions,suits,judgments,and reasonable costs and expenses of whatever nature,whether incurred by or issued against an indemnified party,including without limitation i indirect,special,punitive,consequential,or incidental loss or damage including,but not limited to,trading losses,loss of anticipated profits,loss by reason of shutdown in operation or increased expenses of operation,or other indirect loss or damage and ii reasonable administrative costs,litigation costs,and auditors and attorneys fees,both and outside counsel,and related disbursements.
ubs demand for arbitration derives from section of the services agreement,entitled arbitration,which states in relevant part 
except as may be provided in the nasdaq omx requirements,all claims,disputes,controversies,and other matters in question between the parties to this agreement and the parties employees,directors,agents and associated persons arising out of,or relating to this agreement,or to the breach hereof,shall be settled by final binding arbitration in accordance with this agreement and the following procedure or such other procedures as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties.
except as otherwise provided herein or by agreement of the parties,any arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association or in accordance with such other rules and procedures as are agreed to by the parties.
d.the arbitration proceeding shall be held in the city of new york,unless otherwise agreed by the parties.the decision rendered through arbitration shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto and judgment may be entered in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
the nasdaq omx requirements,referenced in the opening qualifying phrase of the arbitration provision,are defined at the outset of the services agreement,in section.a,as follows 
i the rules,regulations,interpretations,decisions,opinions,orders and other requirements of the securities and exchange commission sec ii the applicable rules,regulations,disciplinary decisions,and rule interpretations of organizations iii nasdaq omx operating procedures,specifications,requirements,and other documentation that is regulatory or technical in nature including,but not limited to,user guides iv all other applicable laws,statutes,rules,regulations,orders,decisions,interpretations,opinions,and other requirements,whether promulgated by the united states or any other applicable jurisdiction including in the area of intellectual property and v the successors,as they may exist at the time,of the components of the nasdaq omx requirements.
further noteworthy is section of the services agreement,which states that i n the event of any conflict between the provisions of the services agreement,the attachments,or the nasdaq omx requirements,the order of preference shall be the nasdaq omx requirements,the attachments,and the services agreement.
procedural history 
ubs demands arbitration 
on march,ubs filed a demand for arbitration against nasdaq with the american arbitration association aaa.see demand for arbitration and statement of claims demand.the page demand asserts that ubs dispute with nasdaq originates in the exchange catastrophic mismanagement of the facebook ipo.demand.specifically,ubs alleges that nasdaq was not up to the task of handling such a large,high demand ipo i ts systems buckled under the strain,and proved incapable of completing the ipo cross.id.as a result,nasdaq not only was forced repeatedly to delay the open of trading in facebook stock,but also decided to conceal from the market why it was doing so,and that it was switching to a risky and untested alternative system,thereby preventing customers from evaluating how that system might affect their own.id.moreover,because the alternative system impaired nasdaq ability to confirm executed trades,market participants were left in the dark for more than two hours as to the state of tens of thousands of trades,so that c haos and mass confusion ensued throughout the market.id.
based on these allegations,ubs charges nasdaq with violat ing its primary obligation to the investing public and to entities such as ubs to operate a fair and orderly market.id.ubs asserts that how nasdaq should have responsibly met this obligation was by delaying or halting trading.id.
ubs also alleges that it was grossly negligent for nasdaq to depart from proven software in conducting such a large ipo and to continue trading with new and inadequately tested solutions,without advising market participants of what was happening or what actions it was taking so they could evaluate the potential consequences for themselves,their systems and take appropriate action in response.id.
as to its own injuries,ubs asserts that nasdaq failure to provide prompt execution records prevented ubs own computers from confirming what orders had been executed,resulting in ubs placement of duplicate orders or its acceptance of cancellations for purchases that had,in fact,been made.see id.as a result,ubs unintentionally amassed a net long position of approximately million facebook shares by the end of the trading day,and ultimately incurred losses in excess of million.id.
ubs seeks to recover these losses from nasdaq based on the indemnification provision of the parties services agreement,nasdaq breach of contract in refusing ubs indemnification demand,nasdaq breach of the services agreement implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in failing to declare certain ubs transactions clearly erroneous under nasdaq rule,and nasdaq gross negligence in using insufficiently tested and inadequate systems to conduct the facebook ipo.see id.
nasdaq declaratory judgment action 
in lieu of an answer to ubs demand for arbitration,on april,nasdaq filed this action in the southern district of new york seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.on april,nasdaq moved preliminarily to enjoin ubs from proceeding with arbitration.ubs promptly to dismiss nasdaq complaint and opposed the preliminary injunction motion.
on june,the district court granted nasdaq motion for a preliminary injunction and denied ubs to dismiss.see nasdaq omx,ubs sec.llc,d at.ubs timely filed this appeal.
ii.discussion 
title a affords appellate jurisdiction to review the grant of a preliminary injunction.our standard of review is abuse of discretion,which we will identify only when the grant of equitable relief rests on an error of law or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or otherwise can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.evergreen ass city of new york,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.ubs urges us to identify abuse of discretion here based on the district court purported legal errors in exercising jurisdiction in a case raising only state law claims between nondiverse parties,deciding the arbitrability of ubs claims itself rather than leaving that issue to an arbitrator,and concluding that ubs claims are not arbitrable.we are not persuaded for reasons we discuss in turn.
subject matter jurisdiction 
federal jurisdiction over state law claims 
we review a district court challenged determination of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.see cutrone mortg.registration,cir.in doing so,we are mindful of the fundamental precept that federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and lack the power to disregard such limits as have been imposed by the constitution or congress.durant,nichols,houston,hodgson,cortese costa,dupont,cir quoting owen equip.erection kroger,d.where,as here,there is no diversity of citizenship between the parties,we look to whether the case aris es under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states to determine whether federal jurisdiction is properly exercised.see fracasse people united bank,cir.
it is long settled law that a cause of action arises under federal law only when the plaintiff complaint raises issues of federal law.metropolitan life ins.taylor,d.nevertheless,in a declaratory judgment action such as this one,which seeks a ruling establishing plaintiff nonliability on the defendant claim for arbitration,a complaint is to be tested,for purposes of the complaint rule,as if the party whose adverse action the declaratory judgment plaintiff apprehends had initiated a lawsuit against the declaratory judgment plaintiff.garanti finansal kiralama aqua marine trading,cir internal quotation marks omitted.under this conceptual realign ment,we analyze the parties claims as they would appear in a coercive suit.id.at.accordingly,here,we must look to ubs underlying demand for arbitration to determine the nature of the claims at issue.
ubs demand does not assert any claims created by federal law so as to admit federal jurisdiction most directly on the principle articulated by justice holmes in american well works layne bowler,that a suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.see gunn minton,d noting that case m ost directly arises under federal law when federal law creates the cause of action asserted,a rule of inclusion that accounts for the vast bulk of suits that arise under federal law and admits of only extremely rare exceptions.rather,ubs seeks to arbitrate claims for breach of contract,indemnification,breach of implied duties of good faith and fair dealing,and gross negligence created by new york state law.this,however,does not necessarily preclude the exercise of federal jurisdiction.
as we have frequently observed,t he doctrine,a corollary to the complaint rule,prevents a plaintiff from avoiding federal jurisdiction by framing in terms of state law a complaint the real nature of which is federal,or by omitting to plead necessary federal questions in a complaint.marcus v.at t,cir internal quotation marks omitted accord romano kazacos,cir.moreover,even in the absence of artful pleading,federal jurisdiction may properly be exercised over a special and small category of actual state claims that present significant,disputed issues of federal law.gunn minton.at.at issue in this case is whether ubs state law claims fall within this special and small category so as to admit federal question jurisdiction.
the category,which dates back nearly years in supreme court precedent,is rooted in the commonsense notion that a federal court ought to be able to hear claims recognized under state law that nonetheless turn on substantial questions of federal law,and thus justify resort to the experience,solicitude,and hope of uniformity that a federal forum offers on federal issues.grable sons metal,darue eng g,d citing hopkins walker,and classic example of smith kansas city title trust.still,the supreme court has been sparing in recognizing state law claims fitting this criterion.see fallon,manning,meltzer,shapiro,hart and wechsler the federal courts and the federal system hart wechsler ed observing that court has explicitly upheld federal jurisdiction in absence of federal cause of action only four times,citing grable sons metal,darue eng g,at,and city of chicago int l college of surgeons,d,in addition to smith and hopkins.indeed,delineating the parameters of federal jurisdiction in such circumstances has presented a constant challenge.see gunn minton.at describing supreme court efforts to bring order to this unruly doctrine merrell dow pharms.thompson,d referencing problem created by presence of a federal issue in a cause of action quoting textile workers lincoln mills,frankfurter,dissenting.this,in turn,has engendered persistent skepticism as to the value of the endeavor.see grable sons metal,darue eng g,at thomas,concurring signaling openness to reconsideration of whether federal question jurisdiction should be limited to cases in which federal law creates cause of action because j urisdictional rules should be clear and w hatever the virtues of the smith standard,it is anything but clear smith kansas city title trust,at holmes,dissenting i t seems to me that a suit can not be said to arise under any other law than that which creates the cause of action.see also hart and wechsler observing that justice holmes cause of action test is simpler and clearer and while excluding cases like smith or grable,it avoids the need in a much larger number of cases to engage in what can be a refined and uncertain analysis.
this background properly signals caution in identifying the narrow category of state claims over which federal jurisdiction may be exercised.it does not,however,absolve federal courts of the duty to exercise jurisdiction when they identify state claims falling within that limited sphere.to facilitate such identification,the supreme court has pronounced a determinative test 
f ederal jurisdiction over a state law claim will lie if a federal issue is necessarily raised,actually disputed,substantial,and capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the balance approved by congress.where all four of these requirements are met jurisdiction is proper because there is a serious federal interest in claiming the advantages thought to be inherent in a federal forum,which can be vindicated without disrupting congress intended division of labor between state and federal courts.
gunn minton.at quoting grable sons metal,darue eng g,at accord fracasse people united bank,at.
applying this gunn grable test here,we conclude that the district court correctly exercised federal question jurisdiction in this case.indeed,while that conclusion only requires us to identify federal question jurisdiction over one of ubs state law claims,see providing for supplemental jurisdiction over claims related to one giving rise to original jurisdiction franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation trust,d stating that,if either of two causes of action comes within original jurisdiction of federal courts,removal was proper as to whole case,for reasons discussed in the next section,we conclude that federal question jurisdiction applies to all four of ubs state claims.
applying the gunn grable test to ubs claims 
a.the presence of a necessarily raised and actually disputed federal issue 
in determining whether ubs four state law claims against nasdaq raise a federal issue,we begin by considering the duty underlying each claim.it is the violation of a duty that would trigger any contract right to indemnification,or support tort claims for negligence or a failure of good faith and fair dealing in the circumstances presented.see aegis ins,world trade,cir stating that,under new york law,negligence claim depends on the existence of a duty on defendant part as to plaintiff internal citation omitted havana cent.llc lunney pub,dep t observing that if there is no contractual obligation to perform an act,the failure to perform the act can not be a breach of the contract citing restatement second of contracts b defining breach of contract as of a duty when performance is due thyroff nationwide mut.ins,cir recognizing that implied duty of good faith and fair dealing claim requires an obligation that may be presumed to have been intended by the parties to the underlying contract.
ubs arbitration demand makes plain that a singular duty underlies all four of its state law claims nasdaq duty to operate a fair and orderly market.an exchange is required to operate a fair and orderly market.this is its primary obligation to the investing public and to entities such as ubs.nasdaq violated this obligation.demand.
the duty ubs identifies indeed,the very language it employs derives directly from federal law.in the exchange act,congress makes plain that maintenance of fair and orderly markets is the animating goal of federal securities law.a c.toward this end,and as detailed in part,supra,the exchange act requires,as a specific condition of registration as a national exchange,that an sro satisfactorily demonstrate to the sec that its internal operating rules remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system.id.b the act further makes an exchange compliance with its rules a mandate of federal law,see,g,and provides for violators to be sanctioned,see,d,f,h.thus,whether a registered securities exchange such as nasdaq has violated its federally prescribed duty to operate a fair and orderly exchange necessarily raises a disputed question of federal law.
moreover,that federal law question can only be answered by considering another how nasdaq duty to operate a fair and orderly market a duty sourced in the exchange act,amplified by sec regulations,and implemented through sec approved nasdaq rules applies in the context of an ipo generally,and particularly with respect to the facebook ipo.thus,even if,as our dissenting colleague judge straub observes,there is no dispute here as to the existence of a federal duty,see dissenting,post at,there is certainly a dispute as to the violation of that duty,particularly in causing ubs injuries.resolution of that dispute will require construction of a federal statute,rules promulgated pursuant to the statute mandates,and the statute implementation by the in short,it is the propriety of nasdaq actions,as prescribed under federal law,that is at the heart of ubs allegations.alessio stock,cir 
in reporting on its inquiry into nasdaq compliance with the exchange act in conducting the facebook ipo,the sec stated that w hen initiating an ipo,an exchange has an obligation to ensure that its systems,processes and contingency planning are robust and adequate to manage the ipo without disruption to the market,and that it complies with all rules regarding,among other things,order price and time priority.sec release,wl,at.these are the very obligations that ubs charges nasdaq with failing to meet in violating its duty to provide a fair and orderly market for the facebook ipo.see supra part discussing ubs demand allegations.thus,although ubs claims for relief may invoke state law of contract and tort,the duty on which these claims their particular scope as it pertains to ubs in participating in the facebook ipo necessarily raises disputed issues of federal securities law.
for example,in pursuing its claim for indemnification and breach of contract for failure to indemnify collectively indemnification claims,ubs submits that the parties services agreement obligates nasdaq to compensate ubs for losses sustained as a result of technical errors in conducting the facebook ipo,including nasdaq failure timely and accurately to fill and confirm orders.see demand.but the services agreement does not itself specify how nasdaq was to fill and confirm orders or otherwise conduct an ipo.those obligations are delineated in nasdaq own rules,notably,rules limit up limit down plan and trading halts and halt and imbalance cross,which prescribe how nasdaq was to conduct an ipo cross,to fill orders,to provide disclosures,and to make decisions regarding initiating,halting,and resuming trading.the services agreement incorporates nasdaq rules by reference,see services agreement,but nasdaq duties to promulgate those rules and then to adhere to them were dictated by federal law,see b mandating exchanges to promulgate rules consistent with the requirements of the exchange act,g requiring exchange compliance with own rules.thus,ubs indemnification claims are reasonably understood to seek compensation for losses allegedly caused by nasdaq violation of its federal law duties to operate fair and orderly markets and to adhere to its own internal rules ensuring such operation.as such,the claims necessarily raise disputed issues of federal law 
the same conclusion obtains as to ubs claim for breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing,insofar as nasdaq failed to cancel certain ubs trades placed during the facebook ipo.although pleaded by reference to new york law,the claim is premised on nasdaq rule.see demand,a,repeatedly referencing rule.
rule authorizes nasdaq to cancel any transaction deemed clearly erroneous.a party seeking cancellation must submit a written complaint within minutes of the time at which the erroneous transaction was executed.see rule a a i.alternatively,nasdaq,in its discretion,may consider cancellation requests received up to minutes after execution of an erroneous transaction.see rule a a iii.
ubs alleges that,on the day of the facebook ipo,it provided nasdaq with notice of certain erroneous transactions.to the extent its request for cancellation was untimely,ubs charges that it was nasdaq own conduct that deprived it of the rule benefit,thereby breaching the duty of good faith and fair dealing implicit in the services agreement incorporation of rule by failing to inform ubs or the market of its system malfunctions in a timely manner,nasdaq denied ubs the opportunity to provide notice of clearly erroneous trades in a manner consistent with nasdaq rule,and thus denied it the benefit of that provision.demand.
ubs good faith and fair dealing claim thus necessarily raises disputed questions as to nasdaq obligations under rule,not only generally,but in the particular circumstances where nasdaq has allegedly violated its exchange act duty to provide a fair and orderly market for securities trading.thus,this claim also necessarily presents a disputed issue of federal law.
finally,ubs charges nasdaq with gross negligence insofar as it employed unprecedented,untested,and inadequate systems and procedures to conduct the facebook ipo.see demand.as earlier noted,an essential element of a negligence claim is the existence of a duty owed by defendant to plaintiff.see aegis ins,world trade,at.the source of the duty nasdaq owed its members and the investing public in conducting an ipo is federal law.see alessio stock,at observing that source of exchange duty to monitor compliance with federal securities law and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder is found in federal law,namely,in the exchange act emphasis in original sec release,wl,at summarizing exchange obligations under federal law when initiating an ipo.insofar as the parties dispute whether nasdaq breached its duty to ubs in conducting the facebook ipo,the negligence claim thus also necessarily raises disputed issues of federal law 
in sum,ubs claims against nasdaq necessarily raise multiple disputed issues of federal law,including the contours of nasdaq federal duty to maintain a fair and orderly market,the scope of that duty,and whether the failure of nasdaq systems during the facebook ipo amounted to a breach of that duty.accordingly,we deem this prong of the gunn grable test satisfied and we turn to the next requirement substantiality.
substantiality 
the exercise of federal jurisdiction over state law claims demands not only a contested federal issue,but a substantial one.grable sons metal,darue eng g,at.substantiality ensures a serious federal interest in claiming the advantages thought to be inherent in a federal forum.id.consistent with this objective,it is not enough that the federal issue be significant to the particular parties in the immediate suit rather,substantiality looks to the importance of the issue to the federal system as a whole.gunn minton.at accord fracasse people united bank,at.we here conclude that the disputed federal issue in this case whether nasdaq violated its exchange act obligation to provide a fair and orderly market in conducting an ipo is sufficiently significant to the development of a uniform body of federal securities regulation to satisfy the requirement of importance to the federal system as a whole.
in reaching this conclusion,we begin with language in the exchange act stating congress express finding that t he securities markets are an important national asset which must be preserved and strengthened.a a.the central role stock exchanges play in the national system of securities markets is beyond question 
stock exchanges perform an important function in the economic life of this country.they serve,first of all,as an indispensable mechanism through which corporate securities can be bought and sold.to corporate enterprise such a market mechanism is a fundamental element in facilitating the successful marshaling of large aggregations of funds that would otherwise be extremely difficult of access.to the public the exchanges are an investment channel which promises ready convertibility of stock holdings into cash.the importance of these functions in dollar terms is vast moreover,because trading on the exchanges,in addition to establishing the price level of listed securities,affects securities prices in general,and because such transactions are often regarded as an indicator of our national economic health,the significance of the exchanges in our economy can not be measured only in terms of the dollar volume of trading.
silver stock,d.the sec recently reiterated this point national securities exchanges are critical components of the national market system,which provides the foundation for investor confidence in the integrity and stability of the united states capital markets.sec release,wl,at.thus,while exchanges are organizations,their is not independent.federal law imposes specific preconditions to,ongoing requirements for,and oversight of,the operations of registered exchanges in furtherance of the strong national interest in preserv ing and strengthen ing the operation of national securities markets.a a.
even if the importance of stock exchanges and securities markets to the national economy does not necessarily render every federal question pertaining thereto sufficiently substantial to satisfy this prong of gunn grable analysis,it is noteworthy here that the sec statement was made,not generally,but in the specific context of assessing the very federal issue disputed in this case,namely,whether nasdaq,in conducting one of the largest ipos in the nation history,had complied with mandates of the exchange act,including mandates that it operate a fair and orderly market and adhere to its own rules.this strongly signals the substantial importance of these federal issues,not simply to the parties in this action,but to the development of uniform federal securities regulation,and thus to the federal system as a whole.gunn minton.at 
ubs urges otherwise,citing barbara new york stock exchange,cir.in there holding that a disputed issue about an exchange compliance with an internal rule was not sufficiently substantial to support federal jurisdiction over state claims,this court observed that such rules are essentially contractual in nature,and are thus interpreted pursuant to ordinary principles of contract law,an area in which the federal courts have no special expertise.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.ubs suggests,and judge straub appears to agree,see dissenting,post at,that this pronouncement categorically precludes identifying exchange rules disputes as substantial federal issues.this not only overreads barbara,but also fails to heed supreme court precedent disavowing categorical assessments of federal jurisdiction over state law claims.
as to barbara,we first note that this court there recognized that state law claims turning on an exchange compliance with its internal rules do raise disputed questions of federal law it was at the next step of analysis that barbara concluded that the particular federal questions raised in that case were insufficiently substantial,important to the federal system as a whole,to support the exercise of federal jurisdiction.see at.
second,the source of barbara observation about the contractual nature of securities rules,merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith georgiadis,cir,is worth noting.in merrill lynch,this court had to decide which of two agreements controlled an arbitration dispute the general arbitration provision in the american stock exchange constitution or the parties more specific customer agreement pertaining to arbitration.viewing both agreements as contractual,this court concluded that federal arbitration law,see,required that the more specific customer agreement control.this case presents us with no comparable separate agreement between the parties much less one subject to a unique statutory mandate,such as federal arbitration law that might afford ubs rights distinct from those reflected in nasdaq rules for satisfying the market requirements of the exchange act.
barbara made no mention of these circumstances in applying merrill lynch analogy of exchange rules to contracts even in the absence of a statutory conflict.nor did it have occasion to consider or discuss the fact that,unlike most contracts between private parties,exchange rules are subject to sec approval.this is hardly surprising given that the particular rules dispute at issue in barbara was of trifling significance to the overall system of federal securities regulation,especially in comparison to the far more important question of whether nasdaq breached its duty to maintain a fair and orderly market in the facebook ipo a point discussed further in the next paragraph in fact,however,the ordinary principle of contract law that looks only to the intent of private contractors to construe their agreements,see goldman white plains ctr.for nursing care,llc,is not so simply applied to sec approved rules,particularly rules intended to effect the exchange act prescribed duty to provide fair and orderly markets the point at issue here.while nasdaq and ubs here incorporated nasdaq rules into their own services agreement,federal law did not permit them to do otherwise or to agree on a different rule construction within the services agreement than that recognized by the sec.see a precluding parties from contracting around exchange rules services agreement,providing that nasdaq omx requirements,which include all nasdaq rules,shall have preference over any conflicting agreement provisions.thus,exchange act mandates for nasdaq rules,the sec particular role in approving nasdaq rules,its authority itself to change those rules,its responsibility for overseeing nasdaq compliance with the rules,and its power to discipline nasdaq for rules violations as it did with respect to the facebook ipo here at issue all indicate that nasdaq rules are part of a more complex scheme implicating greater federal interests than that presented by most private party agreements,even those that borrow federal standards to resolve state law contract claims.see alessio stock,at the comprehensive scheme of statutes and regulations designed to police the securities industry is indicative of a strong federal interest.internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,the contractual nature of exchange exchange rules does not,by itself,mean that all rule disputes raise insubstantial questions of federal law.rather,substantiality depends on a careful assessment of how the rule dispute affects the federal system as a whole.see generally fracasse people united bank,at concluding that disputed issue under fair labor standards act was insubstantial where plaintiffs referenced federal law for public policy considerations and not as basis for their claims.
this brings us to our third,and most important point in distinguishing this case from barbara the context of the rules disputes in these two cases.the dispute in barbara pertained to an exchange action,allegedly in violation of the exchange rules,in provisionally barring a floor clerk from the trading floor while disciplinary proceedings were pending against him,and then in refusing to lift the ban even after all disciplinary charges against the clerk were dismissed.see barbara stock,at.
without belittling the importance of either the maintenance of discipline among marketplace personnel,or of an exchange adherence to its disciplinary rules,the parties dispute in barbara did not implicate one of the most fundamental functions of a national securities exchange.sec release,wl,at.in contrast,ubs claims here,whether sounding in contract or in tort,charge nasdaq with violating the core duty of a federally registered sro under the exchange act to provide a fair and orderly market for a public stock offering.the sec emphasized the importance of that duty to the overall system of federal securities regulation when it observed in connection with nasdaq conduct of the facebook ipo,t he orderly initiation of secondary market trading after an ipo is one of the most fundamental functions of a national securities exchange,and affects not only the market for those individual companies but also investor confidence in the market as a whole.sec release,wl,at.indeed,there can be no doubt as to that conclusion given that nasdaq alleged failure to provide a fair and orderly market was in the context of one of the largest public stock of offerings in history involving million shares valued at billion.in short,ubs does not charge nasdaq with violating its exchange act duty to provide a fair and orderly market for a small or discrete number of securities transactions rather it charges a massive failure of nasdaq systems.thus,the federal question raised by ubs claims as to nasdaq performance of its critical,federally mandated duty can not be deemed less than substantial 
that conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the particular nasdaq actions faulted by ubs in starting and stopping trading,cancelling trades,and informing the public of its actions implicate exchange powers that have been deemed.dl capital,llc nasdaq stock,cir listing among such powers nasdaq regulatory decisions to suspend trading,resume trading,or cancel trades and noting that even choice of when and how to announce those decisions was consistent with nasdaq powers as an sro emphasis in original internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.to be sure,this does not equate this case to those presenting disputes as to the validity of actual governmental action.see grable sons metal,darue eng g,at approving exercise of federal jurisdiction over state claims where validity of irs action was central to dispute smith kansas city title trust,at identifying federal jurisdiction over state law claim that required decision on constitutional validity of federal bond issuance.nevertheless,where,as here,ubs state law claims already present a substantial dispute of federal law insofar as they charge nasdaq with violating its exchange act duty to provide a fair and orderly market for the facebook ipo,the fact that ubs attributes that violation to nasdaq malfeasance in performing powers conferred on it by the exchange act reinforces our substantiality conclusion.
further,characteristics that in some cases have signaled against substantiality,the retrospective nature of a claim,the propriety of resolving the federal dispute in a state forum,and the absence of a federal remedy do not support that conclusion here.see gunn minton.at referencing retrospective nature of claim and state ability to resolve dispute at issue without threatening uniformity of federal law as factors that might signal lack of substantiality merrell dow pharms.thompson,at construing congress decision not to provide federal remedy for violation of federal law as tantamount to conclusion that presence of claimed violation in state cause of action is insufficiently substantial to confer federal question jurisdiction.to the contrary,resolution of the disputed federal law issue here would likely have prospective consequences for the operation of national securities exchanges,particularly in conducting ipos.further,as discussed in the next section addressing the balance prong of the gunn grable test,see infra part,congress has attempted to place disputes alleging violations of federal securities law obligations exclusively in a federal forum.finally,since merrell dow pharmaceuticals thompson,the supreme court has clarified that the absence of a federal cause of action is a factor relevant to,but not dispositive of,the question of whether a federal law dispute raised by a state law claim can properly be deemed substantial.see grable sons metal,darue eng g,at.
in short,ubs can not urge that barbara or any other case establishes a categorical rule for assessing substantiality because the supreme court has ruled that the concept is not susceptible to analysis.rather,substantiality must be determined based on a careful,judgment.see id.at see also gully first bank in meridian.cardozo,observing that substantiality assessment requires something of that accommodation of judgment to kaleidoscopic situations which characterizes the law in its treatment of problems of causation accord greenblatt delta plumbing heating,cir referencing need for court to make principled,pragmatic distinctions in assessing substantiality internal quotations omitted.
because the category of cases admitting federal jurisdiction over state law claims is special and small,gunn minton.at,it is to be expected that,after such careful,consideration,most federal law questions raised in connection with state law claims will not be deemed substantial,see,at greenblatt delta plumbing heating,at gully first bank in meridian,at.but the federal law dispute in this case whether nasdaq violated its duty to provide a fair and orderly market for the facebook of a different sort 
as already explained,that duty is not simply coincidental to ubs state law claims it is the duty on which the claims rest.thus,this case is not at all akin to gunn in which the supreme court ruled that a federal patent law question arising in the context of a state malpractice action was not sufficiently substantial to support federal jurisdiction over the malpractice action.see.at.not only was the patent question in gunn derivative rather than direct it was also merely hypothetical because of the backward looking nature of the claim.see id.at noting that state court would,at most,consider what would have happened in prior federal proceeding if argument had been made.there is nothing indirect or hypothetical in ubs claim that nasdaq failed in its primary duty to provide a fair and orderly market for the facebook ipo.moreover,the strong federal interest in an exchange performance of that duty is evident from the exchange act specific identification of fair and orderly markets as an animating object of that legislation,see a c,and from its provision conditioning national exchange registration on a demonstration of and subsequent compliance with internal rules that promote fair and orderly markets,see,g,d f,h see also alessio stock,at stating that issues requiring interpretation and application of federal securities laws and related statutory and regulatory requirements are areas of undisputed strong federal interest friedlander troutman,sanders,lockerman ashmore,cir the comprehensive scheme of statutes and regulations designed to police the securities industry is indicative of a strong federal interest.the sec has recognized that the need for fair and orderly markets is greatest when a stock offering is being made to the investing public.nasdaq alleged violation of its duty to provide a fair and orderly market arises in just that context,indeed,in connection with one of the largest public offerings of securities in the nation history.such circumstances compel the conclusion that ubs state law claims raise substantial,disputed federal important to the federal system as a whole.
federal state balance 
the final gunn grable factor is concerned with the appropriate balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.gunn minton.at quoting grable sons metal,darue eng g,at.here,this factor strongly supports federal jurisdiction.far from threatening the balance envisioned by congress in this area,the exercise of federal jurisdiction here comports with congress expressed preference for alleged violations of the exchange act,and of rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,to be litigated in a federal forum.see a providing federal courts with exclusive jurisdiction of violations of exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder,and of all suits in equity and actions at law brought to enforce any liability or duty created by exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder.
indeed,among our sister circuits,the fifth and ninth have concluded that certain disputes involving state law claims against sros confer exclusive federal jurisdiction under.see sacks dietrich,cir concluding that,though plaintiff pleaded only state law causes of action and did not name as defendant sro or sro employees,liability turns on interpretation of rules that are approved by the sec and whose violations are subject to exclusive federal jurisdiction,citing sparta surgical ass of sec.dealers,cir holding that although plaintiff theories are posited as state law claims,they are founded on the defendants conduct in suspending trading and the offering,the propriety of which must be exclusively determined by federal law and therefore provided for exclusive jurisdiction in federal court hawkins ass of sec.dealers,cir concluding that plaintiff claims against sro of breach of duty,conspiracy to deny relief,and failure to supervise,though carefully articulated in terms of state law,are actions at law seeking to enforce liabilities or duties created by federal securities laws which are governed exclusively by federal courts pursuant to.
in barbara,we declined to adopt such a broad reading of.see at holding that federal jurisdiction over state claims could not be premised on because that statute refers to claims created by the exchange act and rules promulgated thereunder,not to claims created by state law.see also karsner lothian,concluding that sec approval of national association of securities dealers nasd rules did not bring all rules questions within grant of exclusive federal jurisdiction ford hamilton investments,cir holding that dispute about arbitration compliance with nasd rules did not give rise to federal question jurisdiction based on sec approval of rules,particularly where claim did not allege violation of securities laws or seek to enforce any duty created by such laws.we need not revisit that conclusion here.at this step of the gunn grable barbara it suffices for us to identify the jurisdiction grant of as a signal that we will not upset the appropriate balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities by exercising federal jurisdiction in this case,where state claims necessarily raise a disputed issue about nasdaq compliance with its exchange act duty to have provided a fair and orderly market for the facebook ipo.see alessio stock,at noting that exclusive jurisdiction grant of signals recognition of strong federal interest in regulation of securities industry and exchanges.indeed,that conclusion is only reinforced where,as here,a party efforts to have that federal law duty assessed by reference to state law principles,good faith,fair dealing,negligence could undermine congress expectations for uniformity in an exchange performance of specified exchange act duties.gunn minton.at observing that state court hypothetical assessment of how patent issue might have been resolved in prior federal proceeding did not upset balance favoring uniform body of patent law because it would result neither in a binding ruling of federal law nor a conflicting ruling of state law.
in sum,upon conducting the analysis prescribed by gunn grable,we conclude that ubs state claims against nasdaq necessarily raise disputed issues of federal law of significant interest to the federal system as a whole,and that the adjudication of state claims presenting such disputes in the federal courts would not disrupt any balance envisioned by congress.see grable sons metal,darue eng g,at.accordingly,we conclude that the district court correctly exercised federal jurisdiction here.
arbitrability 
who decides arbitrability 
ubs contends that,even if the district court properly exercised jurisdiction in this case,it erred in concluding that it,rather than an arbitrator,should decide whether ubs claims are subject to arbitration.see nasdaq omx,ubs sec.llc,d at.we review this issue de novo,see contec remote solution,cir,and we conclude that the district court correctly identified arbitrability as a question for the court to decide in this case.
the law generally treats arbitrability as an issue for judicial determination unless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise.howsam dean witter reynolds,d internal quotation marks and brackets omitted accord vrg linhas aereas matlinpatterson global opportunities partners ii,cir.ubs and nasdaq made no such alternative provision here.rather,their services agreement is silent as to who should decide arbitrability.
we have found the clear and unmistakable provision satisfied where a broad arbitration clause expressly commits all disputes to arbitration,concluding that all disputes necessarily includes disputes as to arbitrability.see paynewebber bybyk,cir.but we have not reached the same conclusion where a broad arbitration clause is subject to a qualifying provision that at least arguably covers the present dispute.see katz feinberg,cir.in such circumstances,we have identified ambiguity as to the parties intent to have questions of arbitrability which would include whether a dispute falls within or outside the scope of the qualifier decided by an arbitrator.see id.here,the broad arbitration clause in the parties services agreement is subject to qualification except as may be provided in the nasdaq omx requirements,all claims,disputes,controversies and other matters in question between the parties to this agreement shall be settled by final and binding arbitration.services agreement.a,emphasis added.as explained in the next section of this opinion,one of the provisions of the nasdaq omx requirements at least arguably immunizes nasdaq from liability for the type of claim asserted by ubs,making it far from clear and unmistakable that the services agreement provides ubs with an arbitrable claim.thus,we can not conclude that ubs and nasdaq clearly and unmistakably committed questions of arbitrability to an arbitrator rather than the court.
in urging otherwise,ubs submits that the services agreement quoted provision is irrelevant because nasdaq never adopted the referenced limiting requirements.this misapprehends the relevant standard.the services agreement need not clearly remove the question of arbitrability from arbitration in order for that question to be one for judicial determination.rather,ubs must point to a clear and unmistakable expression of the parties intent to submit arbitrability disputes to arbitration.see howsam dean witter reynolds,at.ubs can not carry that burden by pointing to a broad arbitration clause that the parties subjected to a provision.
ubs nevertheless maintains that any ambiguity as to the parties intent respecting resolution of questions of arbitrability is eliminated by the services agreement incorporation of aaa rules,which provide for arbitrability to be decided by the arbitrator.see services agreement.b,except as otherwise provided herein or by agreement of the parties,any arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association or in accordance with such other rules and procedures as are agreed to by the parties.aaa commercial arbitration rules mediation procedures,r,the arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction,including any objections with respect to the existence,scope,or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.
in fact,the services agreement does not clearly and unmistakably direct that questions of arbitrability be decided by aaa rules rather,it provides for aaa rules to apply to such arbitrations as may arise under the agreement.as noted,section.a of the services agreement carves out certain issues from arbitration,a circumstance that thus delays application of aaa rules until a decision is made as to whether a question does or does not fall within the intended scope of arbitration,in short,until arbitrability is decided.thus,this case is not akin to those in which we have construed the incorporation of aaa rules into an agreement with a broad arbitration clause to signal the parties clear and unmistakable intent to submit arbitrability disputes to arbitration.see,contec remote solution,at zachariou manios,dep t holding that reference to aaa rules in conjunction with narrow arbitration provision does not constitute clear and unmistakable evidence of intent to have arbitrator decide arbitrability.
accordingly,we conclude that the district court correctly determined that it should resolve the arbitrability of ubs claims rather than commit that question to an arbitrator.
arbitrability of ubs claims 
insofar as ubs challenges the district court determination that its claims against nasdaq are not arbitrable,our review is de novo.see specht netscape commc ns,cir.two questions are relevant to determining arbitrability whether the parties have entered into a valid agreement to arbitrate,and,if so,whether the dispute at issue comes within the scope of the arbitration agreement.in re am.express fin.advisors sec,cir.neither ubs nor nasdaq disputes the validity of their agreement to arbitrate thus,the sole issue on appeal is whether that agreement reaches ubs claims.
in deciding that question,we are mindful that federal and state policies favoring arbitration,see compucredit greenwood,d sutherland ernst young llp,cir matter of brady williams capital,noting strong state policy favoring arbitration agreements,give rise to an important presumption that any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues be resolved in favor of arbitration,telenor mobile commc ns as storm llc,cir internal quotation marks omitted.at the same time,however,we recognize the overarching principle that arbitration is a matter of contract,american express italian colors,d,and that it is the language of the contract that defines the scope of disputes subject to arbitration,eeoc waffle house,d.thus,parties may be compelled to arbitrate disputes but only those disputes that they have contracted to submit to arbitration.first options of,kaplan,d see stolt nielsen animalfeeds int l,d observing that courts and arbitrators must not lose sight of the purpose of the exercise to give effect to the intent of the parties bell cendant,cir a rbitration is a creature of contract,and a person may only be compelled to arbitrate a dispute to the extent that he has agreed to do so.matter of salvano merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,holding with respect to contractual agreement regarding arbitration,that court role is limited to interpretation and enforcement of the terms agreed to by the parties.
in this case,the services agreement states the parties intent to submit all disputes to arbitration except as provided in the nasdaq omx requirements.services agreement.a.the agreement defines nasdaq omx requirements to include nasdaq rules and rule interpretations.see id.
the nasdaq rule pertinent here is rule,which generally precludes nasdaq members from seeking compensation for losses attributable to the exchange handling of securities transactions 
except as provided for in paragraph b below,nasdaq and its affiliates shall not be liable for any losses,damages,or other claims arising out of the nasdaq market center or its use.any losses,damages,or other claims,related to a failure of the nasdaq market center to deliver,display,transmit,execute,compare,submit for clearance and settlement,adjust,retain priority for,or otherwise correctly process an order,message,or other data entered into,or created by,the nasdaq market center shall be absorbed by the member,or the member sponsoring the customer,that entered the order,message,or other data into the nasdaq market center.
rule a.because the parties subjected their otherwise broad arbitration agreement to the limitations imposed by nasdaq rules,we conclude that there could not have been any intent to arbitrate claims precluded by rule a.
ubs disputes that its claims against nasdaq fall within the preclusive language of rule a.the argument is defeated by the plain language of the rule,which reaches any losses,damages,or other claims arising out of the nasdaq market center or its use,except as provided in subparagraph b.as earlier noted,all of ubs claims allegedly derive from its use of the purportedly malfunctioning nasdaq market center to participate in the facebook ipo.moreover,ubs claims that as a result of nasdaq market failures,nasdaq did not correctly process ubs facebook orders in that it did not provide timely notice of confirmation.rule a specifically identifies losses attributable to nasdaq failure correctly to process an order as ones that must be absorbed by the exchange member.thus,we conclude that ubs claims fall within rule a 
ubs nevertheless argues that because rule does not explicitly preclude arbitration,a court can not conclude that the parties did not intend to arbitrate ubs claims.ubs cites no authority for the proposition that an affirmative rejection of arbitration is required to demonstrate a lack of intent to arbitrate.in any event,such a requirement is particularly unwarranted here where the agreed limit on arbitration is a rule that precludes not simply arbitration of a claim,but the claim itself.in such circumstances,the question of arbitrability depends on whether the challenged claims do or do not fall within the limiting rule preclusion.ubs claims fall within the preclusive language of rule a and,thus,are not arbitrable.
that conclusion finds further support in the single rule b exception relevant here subsection b,a provision specifically addressed to facebook ipo losses.proposed by nasdaq and approved by the sec in march,rule b establishes a voluntary accommodation program for certain member claims arising from the facebook ipo.sec release.at.toward that end,it provides a process for claims of injury resulting from the nasdaq halt and imbalance cross process in connection with the initial public offering of facebook,including any delay in delivering of confirmations of orders.rule b.the new subsection prescribes,inter alia,how losses will be measured,the requirements for submitting a claim,the evaluator of the claim,the priority in which claims will be paid,and the maximum total program payment million.see rule b a g.
the need to amend rule and to secure sec approval for the amendment to afford nasdaq members some compensation for losses incurred in the facebook ipo reinforces the conclusion that when ubs and nasdaq agreed to subject the arbitration clause in their services agreement to the limitations of rule a,they signaled that it was not their intent to arbitrate claims precluded by that rule.
in urging otherwise,ubs emphasizes that participation in the rule b accommodation program is voluntary and that both the sec and nasdaq acknowledged that members were free to forego the program and pursue alternative remedies.see sec release.at a member is free to elect not to submit a claim for compensation under the accommodation program and choose instead to pursue other remedies.nasdaq ltr.to sec,at,members that would prefer not to release nasdaq and instead to attempt to pursue claims against it,notwithstanding the otherwise applicable provisions of rule and other potential defenses,are obviously free to do so.these statements were issued in response to certain concerns raised during the rule public comment period about the program liability release requirement.see rule b h.these statements do not identify what claims members might alternatively pursue,much less suggest that members can pursue claims foreclosed by rule a except as provided in a b exception.
in any event,our concern here is not to identify what,if any,alternative judicial remedies a nasdaq member might pursue against that exchange in connection with the facebook ipo.nor is it to discern what defenses nasdaq might raise to such claims.our singular purpose is to discern the scope of a broad arbitration provision that is specifically limited by,among other things,nasdaq rules.because rule a specifically disallows member claims against nasdaq for losses sustained in trading securities on that exchange,we conclude that the parties did not intend to submit such foreclosed claims to binding arbitration.the only rule exception applicable here rule b does not support a different conclusion.thus,like the district court,we conclude that ubs claims against nasdaq are not subject to arbitration.
because we thus identify no merit in any of ubs challenges to the preliminary injunction entered against it in this case,we hereby affirm that injunction.
iii.conclusion 
to summarize,we conclude as follows 
federal jurisdiction is properly exercised in this case because,although ubs challenged arbitration demand against nasdaq asserts only claims created by state law,a the claims necessarily raise actually disputed issues of federal securities law,b those issues are of substantial importance to the federal system as a whole,and c the exercise of federal jurisdiction in these circumstances will not disrupt any balance approved by congress.
the district court properly decided the question of arbitrability because the parties never clearly and unmistakably expressed an intent to submit that question to arbitration,and such an intent can not be inferred where,as here,a broad arbitration clause contains a provision that,at least arguably,covers the instant dispute.
ubs claims against nasdaq are not subject to arbitration because they fall within the preclusive language of nasdaq rule a,and the parties specifically agreed that their arbitration agreement was subject to limitations identified in,among other things,nasdaq rules.
the order of the district court preliminarily enjoining ubs from pursuing arbitration against nasdaq is hereby affirmed,and the case is remanded to the district court for such further proceedings as are warranted consistent with this opinion.
sixteen billion dollars.over four hundred million shares.facebook.the nature of this case sways the majority analysis.it is true that the facebook ipo was news.but it simply can not be true that every time a case involves a famous company or a dollar ipo,federal courts have jurisdiction.
by exercising federal question jurisdiction over state law claims that are premised on the internal rules of a private corporation,the court extends federal court jurisdiction far beyond its permissible bounds.the majority expansion of our jurisdiction flies in the face of the dictates of this circuit and the supreme court urging restraint.i therefore respectfully dissent.
discussion 
this case is about ubs state law claims against nasdaq stemming from facebook ipo.the majority contends that we have jurisdiction because the state law claims are premised on the contention that nasdaq breached its exchange act duty to maintain a fair and orderly market by violating its own internal rules.this conclusion runs afoul of nearly every grable gunn requirement.there is no actually disputed federal issue,to the extent one exists,it is not substantial,and exercising jurisdiction disrupts the balance approved by congress.
first,nasdaq is a,company.it is not the sec and its rules are not federal regulations or federal law.in fact,we have explicitly held that the rules of a stock exchange are contractual in nature and within the province of state law.the only arguably federal issue present is a broad duty found in the exchange act and that duty is not actually disputed.
second,ubs state law claims do not present a substantial federal question.in drawing the contrary conclusion,the majority ignores or misapplies controlling case law from the supreme court and this circuit.we have held that state law claims premised on violations of the rules of a stock exchange do not give rise to a substantial federal issue.the majority holding renders our case law incoherent.
moreover,supreme court precedent independently forecloses the exercise of federal jurisdiction.substantial does not mean large or significant as the majority suggests.rather,it means that the issue is important to federal jurisprudence.the court has repeatedly admonished that federal courts may entertain this extremely rare exception only in cases that pose a discrete question of law as to the construction or validity of a federal statute or the constitution.see gunn minton,d.that kind of issue is not present here.
finally,exercising jurisdiction here would upset congressional intent as to the balance of responsibility.i disagree with the majority that congress decision to grant federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over exchange act violations suggests a similar intent to grant jurisdiction over stock exchange rule violations.in fact,i believe it suggests the opposite.
the majority uncabined holding could lead to a tremendous number of cases being pulled into federal court a possibility that should give us pause.see grable sons metal,darue eng g,d.the majority offers no response to this concern other than a conclusory assertion that this shift to federal court will not occur.
for these reasons,i would reverse the decision of the district court and dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.
ubs state law claims present no actually disputed federal issue.
grable and gunn require a federal issue to be actually disputed.the majority identifies two different,though related,issues underlying ubs claims whether nasdaq violated its own rules and whether nasdaq violated its exchange act duty to maintain a fair and orderly market.but nasdaq rules are not federal and the exchange act is not actually in dispute.
nasdaq rules are not federal.
the rules at issue the rules of a stock exchange are matters of state law.we held as much in barbara new york stock exchange,where we stated t he rules of a securities exchange are contractual in nature,and are thus interpreted pursuant to ordinary principles of contract law,an area in which the federal courts have no special expertise,cir internal citation omitted.we then reaffirmed our holding that stock exchange rules are contractual in alessio new york stock exchange,cir.the majority does not challenge or reject our holding that the rules of a stock exchange are creatures of state law.
the majority opinion strongly implies that because nasdaq is subject to heavy federal regulation,its internal rules are sufficiently federal to sustain federal question jurisdiction.see opinion op.at.but nasdaq is a,company.see what is nasdaq available at.it is not a federal agency,nor are its rules federal law or federal regulations.indeed,the primary responsibility for promulgating and enforcing the rules of a stock exchange lies with the stock exchange itself.see united states solomon,cir quoting silver new york stock,d.the federal government acts only as a backstop,bolstering the exchanges traditional process of.see also united states stein,d,the stock exchanges had rules and disciplinary mechanisms to enforce them even before the securities exchange act of brought the industry under federal regulation.
moreover,simply because an industry is subject to heavy federal regulation does not elevate it to the status of a government entity,nor are its internal rules elevated to the status of federal law.in desiderio national association of securities dealers,we considered a case involving the national association of securities dealers nasd the precursor to nasdaq and concluded that the fact that a business entity is subject to extensive and detailed state regulation does not convert that organization actions into those of the state,cir quotation marks omitted.we noted further that a organization,like the nasd,is a private actor,not a state actor.it is a private corporation that receives no federal or state funding.its creation was not mandated by statute,nor does the government appoint its members or serve on any nasd board or committee.id.we need not exercise this extraordinary type of federal question jurisdiction over state law claims that implicate only the internal rules of a private corporation in a regulated industry.
b.the exchange act is not actually disputed.
the only arguably federal element present in these state law claims the duty to maintain a fair and orderly market is not actually in dispute.unlike in grable where the parties argued for competing interpretations of a federal statute or gunn where one party argued that a patent law exception applied to his lease and the other party argued that it did not,no party here disputes the existence,validity,or construction of this exchange act duty.see gunn.at the federal issue is also actually disputed here indeed,on the merits,it is the central point of dispute.grable,at t he meaning of the federal statute is actually in dispute it appears to be the only legal or factual issue contested in the case.nor does any party argue that any nasdaq rule is inconsistent with the exchange act.
the majority opinion does not challenge this point.the only actually disputed issues identified by the majority opinion are issues concerning the application of nasdaq rules to the circumstances of the facebook ipo.see op.at.although the exchange act provides the backdrop for applying the nasdaq rules,the exchange act itself is not at issue in this litigation.we are therefore required to decline to exercise federal question jurisdiction over these state law claims.
ii.ubs state law claims present no substantial federal issue.
grable and gunn also require the federal issue to be substantial.but this is exactly the sort of case that we and the supreme court have held does not present a sufficiently substantial federal question.our precedent specifically forecloses the majority holding that violations of the rules of a stock exchange present a substantial federal issue.the majority strained attempt to distinguish those cases is unconvincing.
moreover,the majority misunderstands,and thus misapplies,the controlling cases from the supreme court.supreme court precedent permits federal courts to exercise federal question jurisdiction absent a federal cause of action only when the embedded federal issue is a pure question of law as to the construction or validity of a federal statute or the constitution.this case presents no such issue.to the contrary,the majority argument that a substantial federal issue exists where a duty from federal law is implicated in a state law claim has been specifically rejected by the supreme court.
a.our precedent forecloses the exercise of federal question jurisdiction here.
our own precedent proscribes the exercise of federal question jurisdiction over state law claims arising from alleged violations of the rules of a stock exchange even in cases where those rules implicate the core duties of a stock exchange.
barbara new york stock exchange,is fatal to the majority holding.in barbara,we declined to exercise federal question jurisdiction over state law claims arising from alleged violations of the rules of a stock exchange.the facts of barbara are as follows the sec initiated an investigation into alleged misconduct by barbara,a floor clerk at the new york stock exchange,and his employer,a securities brokerage firm.at.after the sec filed disciplinary charges against barbara,the nyse barred barbara from working on the floor of the nyse pending a formal hearing.id.at.despite the eventual reversal of the charges against him,the nyse enforcement division continued to bar barbara from working on the nyse floor,causing him to leave the securities industry.id.
barbara brought numerous state law claims against the nyse.id.those claims,we assumed in the opinion,were contingent on proving that the nyse violated its own rules.id.at.nevertheless,we held that the federal issue presented was insufficiently substantial to generate federal question jurisdiction over barbara state law claims.id.at.
ubs state law claims premised on nasdaq violating its own rules are also insufficiently substantial.the majority attempts to distinguish barbara by arguing that there is no separate agreement between the parties that might afford ubs rights distinct from those reflected in nasdaq rules barbara had no occasion to consider or discuss the fact that,unlike most contracts between private parties,exchange rules are subject to sec approval and unlike barbara claims,ubs claims charge nasdaq with violating the core duty of a federally registered sro under the exchange act.see op.at.
i am not persuaded.
the existence or absence of a separate agreement is irrelevant here.
the majority first argues that barbara observation that stock exchange rules are contractual derives from a case in which this court had to decide which of two agreements controlled an arbitration dispute the general arbitration provision in the american stock exchange constitution or the parties more specific customer agreement pertaining to arbitration.op.at citing merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith georgiadis,cir.in our case,the majority notes,there is no comparable separate agreement between the parties.op.at.
i do not understand how this is relevant.the salient conclusion in merrill lynch is that we view ed both agreements as contractual.op.at.the presence of the second agreement is irrelevant to the conclusion that the constitution is contractual in nature.moreover,in barbara,there was no comparable separate agreement and yet we had no trouble declining to exercise federal jurisdiction.barbara conclusion that stock exchange rules are contractual is not the only significant aspect of the decision.its holding is also important,and barbara held that federal jurisdiction does not extend to state law claims premised on the violation of a stock exchange rule.those are just the kind of claims that are before us today.
barbara explicitly considered the role of the sec.
far from having no occasion to consider or discuss the fact that,unlike most contracts between private parties,exchange rules are subject to sec approval,op.at,the barbara court explicitly acknowledged that the rules of a stock exchange are subject to sec approval,and that the exchange act requires that these disciplinary proceedings be conducted in compliance both with the act and with the exchange rules and regulations.id.at.we noted further that n otice of any final disciplinary sanction imposed by the exchange must be provided to the sec,and the imposition of a sanction is subject to review by the sec on its own motion or at the instance of an aggrieved party.id.citing d.it is therefore inaccurate to read barbara as failing to consider the role of the sec in approving and enforcing stock exchange rules.
both this case and barbara implicate a core duty of a stock exchange.
finally,the majority primary argument is that the parties dispute in barbara did not implicate one of the most fundamental functions of a national securities exchange.op.at quotation marks omitted.indeed,the majority characterizes the dispute in barbara as trifling.op.at.this contention is inaccurate.although the majority attempts to downplay the importance of the circumstances in barbara,that case involved one of the most fundamental functions of a stock exchange the duty to discipline stock exchange members and associated persons in order to protect the investing public.indeed,the allegations of misconduct against barbara were no mere administrative or technical matter.rather,barbara and one of his employers a securities brokerage firm were alleged to have improperly executed trades for the clients of a different brokerage firm.see barbara proposed am.compl.
as an employee of a brokerage firm that was a member of the new york stock exchange,barbara was of the class of persons whose conduct is regulated by the exchange pursuant to its duties under the exchange act.barbara,at.he was therefore disciplined pursuant to c and d as a person associated with a member of the new york stock exchange.see barbara,at see also barbara new york stock,cv arr wl,at noting that the disciplinary actions taken against barbara were clearly authorized by the securities exchange act and by exchange rules and citing c and d.
the discipline of national securities exchange members and persons associated with members is a core function of an exchange and is specifically provided for in the exchange act.see,c and d.the purpose of such discipline is to protect investors and maintain an orderly market.for example,the exchange act provides that a national securities exchange may bar or condition the association of a natural person with a member if that person has engaged in acts or practices inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.c b ii.and an exchange may summarily limit or prohibit any person with respect to access to services offered by the exchange if the exchange determines that such person can not be permitted to continue to have such access with safety to investors,creditors,members,or the exchange.d.
the discipline of members and associated persons is grounded in the duty of a stock exchange to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and the public interest.b.therefore,the provisions governing member discipline are equally grounded in the overarching duty to maintain a fair and orderly market.a c.
indeed,under the majority reasoning,barbara is a stronger case for exercising federal jurisdiction than the one before us.whereas the exchange act provision governing national securities exchanges is silent on any duty specifically concerning the administration of a public offering,the provision specifically and repeatedly provides for the discipline of exchange members and the barring of from membership.see c and d.
of the eight requirements that must be satisfied before a securities exchange can be registered,two concern member discipline.see b and.before the sec will register a national securities exchange,it must determine that t he rules of the exchange provide that members and persons associated with its members shall be appropriately disciplined for violation of the provisions of this chapter,the rules or regulations thereunder,or the rules of the exchange,by expulsion,suspension,limitation of activities,functions,and operations,fine,censure,being suspended or barred from being associated with a member,or any other fitting sanction.see b see also b providing that the sec will register a national securities exchange only if it first determines that the rules of the exchange provide for a fair procedure for disciplining members.
thus,while the duty to administrate a fair public offering is certainly important,the exchange act does not indicate that such a duty is any more important than the general duty of a securities exchange to administrate securities trading.and the exchange act itself places far more specific emphasis on the duty of a securities exchange to discipline members for unethical or illegal conduct.
there is therefore no distinction between this case and barbara.both involve state law claims premised upon possible violations of stock exchange rules and both involve rules governing a core function of the stock exchange as set forth in the exchange act.the duty to properly manage an ipo and the duty to discipline members and associated persons are both critical,federally mandated duties.see op.at.but we have held that stock exchange rules implicating such duties are insufficient by themselves to generate federal question jurisdiction.
alessio new york stock exchange does not support the majority position.
nothing in alessio new york stock exchange,cir changes our conclusion in barbara that the rules of a stock exchange alone are insufficient to exercise federal jurisdiction.indeed,in alessio we reiterated that the internal rules of a stock exchange should be examined in accordance with well settled principles of contract interpretation a task uniquely within the province of state law.at.we did not distinguish barbara from alessio on the ground that some stock exchange rules give rise to federal question jurisdiction and others do not.we distinguished barbara on the ground that alessio alleged more than the violation of stock exchange rules.he alleged that the stock exchange violated the federal securities laws themselves.see id.in contrast,here,the federal interest is more substantial because alessio complaint does not simply challenge the propriety of disciplinary proceedings conducted by the nyse rather,an examination of the allegations contained in the complaint establishes that alessio suit is rooted in violations of federal law.no such allegation is made here.
thus,under barbara,the federal issue is not substantial.
supreme court precedent independently forecloses the exercise of federal question jurisdiction over ubs state law claims.
even without considering barbara,i would reach the same conclusion.the majority opinion misunderstands the meaning of substantial in the grable gunn context.substantial means,not necessarily large or significant,but important to federal jurisprudence,the collective body of federal case law.grable gunn jurisdiction must therefore be exercised only over state law claims that implicate a federal issue that is a pure question of law concerning the validity or construction of a federal statute or the constitution.
supreme court precedent also holds that state law claims incorporating a standard derive d directly from federal law,see op.at,as here,are insufficiently substantial to generate federal question jurisdiction.the majority dismisses this contrary precedent.
grable gunn jurisdiction can be exercised only over state law claims that turn on the construction of a federal statute or the constitution.
as the majority opinion acknowledges,the exercise of federal question jurisdiction in the absence of a federal cause of action is extremely rare.see op.at.the supreme court has approved of the exercise of such jurisdiction in only four cases.those cases,and others where jurisdiction has been declined,demonstrate that substantial in the gunn grable context is a term of art.the majority opinion misinterprets substantial to mean large or significant.see,op.at arguing that this case presents a substantial issue because it was in the context of one of the largest public stock offerings in history involving million shares valued at billion.in this context,substantial means important to federal jurisprudence.
supreme court precedent generally divides issues into two categories.pure questions of law that involve the construction or validity of a federal statute or the constitution may be substantial enough to warrant federal jurisdiction.each of the four cases where the supreme court approved this kind of jurisdiction shared that key and necessary hallmark 
grable sons metal,darue eng g,d federal question jurisdiction existed where the meaning of a federal tax provision specifically,what constituted adequate notice pursuant to b was in dispute.the court noted that t he meaning of the federal tax provision is an important issue of federal law that sensibly belongs in a federal court and that this issue of federal law appears to be the only legal or factual issue contested in the case.
city of chicago int l coll.of surgeons,federal question jurisdiction existed where plaintiffs claimed that a city ordinance was facially unconstitutional in violation of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.
smith kansas city title trust,federal question jurisdiction existed because the decision depends upon the determination of the constitutional validity of an act of congress which is directly drawn in question specifically,whether congress had acted unconstitutionally in issuing certain bonds.
hopkins walker.federal question jurisdiction existed where the determination of the plaintiffs rights requires a construction of the federal mining laws under which the proceedings resulting in the patent were had,and a decision of what,according to those laws,passed by the patent,and what,if anything,was excepted and remained open to location.
in contrast,the court has explicitly and repeatedly admonished that federal courts should not exercise federal question jurisdiction over state law claims if the federal issue is not a pure question of law,but is and.gunn.at such and effects are not sufficient to establish federal arising under jurisdiction.quotation marks omitted.
for example,in empire healthchoice assurance,mcveigh,d,the court reviewed a reimbursement claim brought by an insurance carrier pursuant to a health care contract authorized by the federal employees health benefits act.the supreme court affirmed our holding that the federal court did not have federal subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.in doing so,the court distinguished grable,noting that the federal issue embedded in the reimbursement claim was and,rather than the nearly pure issue of law presented in grable.id.at.the court also relied on the fact that the federal issue in grable was one that could be settled once and for all and thereafter would govern numerous tax sale cases.id.at.
we have echoed this limitation on the exercise of grable gunn jurisdiction.see fracasse people united bank,cir declining to exercise federal question jurisdiction over state law claims based on public policy articulated in the flsa because t he flsa needs no interpretation in connection with the state tort claims that have been pled congregation machna shalva zichron zvi dovid dep t of,app x,cir declining to exercise federal question jurisdiction over a state law claim because the determination at issue here is a application of the regulations to the plaintiff that does not implicate the validity of the regulations themselves.
there is no dispute that the arguably federal issue in this case is not a pure question of law,but rather a question of how stock exchange rules should be applied to the unique facts of the facebook ipo.the majority opinion acknowledges as much.see op.at noting that the key question here is how nasdaq duty to operate a fair and orderly market applies in the context of an ipo generally,and particularly with respect to the facebook ipo.all of the potentially disputed issues identified by the majority involve the application of this duty to the specific context of the facebook ipo.for example,the majority argues that this litigation may require a court to determine whether nasdaq should have cancelled certain ubs trades placed during the facebook ipo pursuant to nasdaq rule.see op.at.the majority also contends that a court may have to determine whether nasdaq properly adhered to rules and governing how nasdaq is required to fill orders,provide disclosures,and make decisions regarding initiating,halting,and resuming trading during the facebook ipo.see op.at.
the question of how nasdaq rules should have been applied to a specific ipo is exactly the sort of and question that the supreme court has repeatedly held does not give rise to this rare type of federal question jurisdiction.not only does this case present only legal issues,the legal issues at stake do not involve the construction or validity of a federal statute or the constitution.this litigation requires only the application of the rules of a stock exchange,which notwithstanding the majority attempt to elevate such rules to federal status we have repeatedly held are in nature.
the incorporation of a federal statutory standard into a state law claim is insufficiently substantial to generate federal question jurisdiction.
the incorporation into a state law claim of the exchange act general duty to provide a fair and orderly market is insufficiently substantial to trigger federal question jurisdiction.
in merrell dow pharmaceuticals,thompson,the supreme court rejected an analogous attempt to generate federal question jurisdiction by incorporating a federal statutory standard into a state law claim,d.there,the supreme court examined a product liability claim against a drug manufacturer.as an element of one of their state law claims,plaintiffs alleged that the drug was misbranded in violation of the federal food,drug,and cosmetic act,and that this violation created a rebuttable presumption of negligence.id.at.the supreme court concluded that the presence of a claimed violation of the statute as an element of a state cause of action is insufficiently substantial to confer jurisdiction.id.at.in grable,the court reiterated this conclusion,pointing out that if the federal labeling standard without a federal cause of action could get a state claim into federal court,so could any other federal standard without a federal cause of action.at emphasis added.
this case presents an even more tenuous link to the underlying federal standard.the majority opinion argues that a violation of a stock exchange rule which is in turn premised on a duty found in the exchange act will be a required element of ubs state law claims.see op.at.in merrell dow,the federal issue incorporated into the state law claim was an alleged violation of a federal statute itself.id.at.that federal issue was nevertheless deemed to be insufficiently substantial.id.at.the case before us does not present a more substantial issue than that in merrell dow,let alone one sufficiently substantial to generate federal question jurisdiction.
in short,i would conclude that there is no substantial federal question presented under barbara,merrell dow,and the other supreme court precedent in this area.
iii.exercise of federal question jurisdiction over ubs state law claims will upset congressional intent as to the balance of responsibility.
finally,this case violates the grable gunn requirement that the case must be capable of being resolved in a federal court without upsetting the balance approved by congress.
the majority argument that the exercise of federal jurisdiction here comports with congress expressed preference for alleged violations of the exchange act,and of the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be litigated in a federal forum,is an implausible reading of the exchange act.see op.at.in fact,congress conferral of exclusive federal court jurisdiction for violations of the exchange act cuts against the majority argument.congress understood the distinction between violations of federal law and violations of the rules of a stock exchange,and made a deliberate choice to confer exclusive federal court jurisdiction on claims involving the former and not to confer such jurisdiction on claims involving the latter.
rather,congress intended that any federal interest implicated in violations of stock exchange rules be vindicated through direct sec enforcement action.it is curious to suggest that congress intended that federal interests be vindicated through the indirect means of state law claims that only tangentially implicate federal law.
the majority also fails to adequately address a key concern of this requirement that permitting traditional state law causes of action,like breach of contract and negligence,into federal court will result in the undesired shift of a tremendous number of cases from forums into federal court.see grable,at.
congress did not intend for state law claims premised solely on violations of the rules of a stock exchange to be litigated in federal court.
the majority reliance on the exclusive jurisdiction provision in the exchange act as an indication of congressional intent is unpersuasive.the exchange act and the rules and regulations thereunder do not include or refer to the rules of a stock exchange.where congress wished to refer to the rules of a national securities exchange,it specifically referred to them.compare providing for exclusive federal court jurisdiction for violations of violations of this chapter or the rules and regulations thereunder with a voiding any provision allowing waiver of compliance with any provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder,or of any rule of a organization emphasis added see also,a providing that the sec may investigate whether any person has violated or is violating any provision of this chapter,the rules or regulations thereunder,the rules of a national securities exchange or registered securities association of which such person is a member or a person associated emphasis added.
based on the plain text of the statute,we have held that the exclusive jurisdiction provision of the exchange act does not confer such jurisdiction on claims based on the rules of a stock exchange we think that the quoted language plainly refers to claims created by the act or by rules promulgated thereunder,but not to claims created by state law.barbara,at.in so holding,we foreclosed the contrary determinations of the fifth and ninth circuits that the majority oddly chooses to discuss before conceding that we declined to adopt such a broad reading of.see op.at.
despite acknowledging our contrary precedent,the majority identif ies the jurisdiction grant of as a signal that we will not upset the appropriate balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities by exercising federal jurisdiction in this case.see op.at.in a conclusory fashion,the majority simply extends principles that apply to federal statutes and regulations to the rules of a stock exchange,without acknowledging that congress and this court have found there to be a meaningful distinction between the two.the boundaries of federal jurisdiction are not limitless,and congress and this court have drawn that boundary between claims arising from a federal statute or regulation and those arising from the rules of a stock exchange.
finally,as was made clear in merrell dow and reiterated in grable,the best expression of congress forum pre
