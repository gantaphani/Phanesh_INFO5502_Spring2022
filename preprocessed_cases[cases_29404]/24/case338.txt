citgo asphalt refining company appeals the district court confirmation of a labor arbitrator decision that citgo zero tolerance drug abuse policy is unreasonable.for the reasons that follow,we will reverse.
citgo asphalt refining company carco is a new jersey partnership involved in the oil refining industry.citgo petroleum corporation citgo,is the majority partner of carco.in december,citgo announced that it was going to implement a new uniform national substance abuse policy,which included a zero tolerance policy the policy,at all of its petroleum refining facilities in the nation.the policy was thereafter implemented at more than sixty locations.local of the paper,chemical and energy workers international union pace challenged the policy after it was implemented at carco asphalt plant in savannah,and the challenge proceeded to arbitration.the arbitrator ruled that the policy was proper,valid and reasonable in all respects,and issued an opinion and award denying the union grievance in its entirety.the policy was also challenged at carco asphalt plant in paulsboro,new jersey,where the hourly workers are represented by pace local.there,local argued that the new zero tolerance policy changed the existing policy as follows 
under the old policy,urine tests for drugs were given during the annual physical,with the individuals to be given their physical exams and receiving a written questionnaire a week or two before the physical notifying them that they were going to be scheduled for their physical and requiring them to respond to the questionnaires.they were given one or two days advance notice of the annual physical after they had completed the questionnaire.other than this drug testing as part of the annual physical,there was not random testing.under the new policy,random testing is done immediately after receiving notice.
under the old policy,conduct could not be a violation,but it is under the new policy.
under the old policy c ause,suspicion or technical performance problems or occurrence of an accident or incident or safety violation could trigger a drug test as part of the annual physical.under the new policy,drug testing can be done without any of these prerequisites.
under the old policy,employees who tested positive during an annual physical were given an opportunity for rehabilitation,a second chance.but,under the new policy,no employee is given a opportunity unless they come forward and admit their drug use prior to any positive drug test,called.
local br.at.
local challenged the new policy by filing two grievances.one alleged an improper implementation of a new drug and alcohol policy.that grievance claimed that carco violated the controlling collective bargaining agreement cba by not bargaining over the new policy and that the policy violated a provision of the cba dealing with future bargaining.the other grievance alleged that the company implemented a drug and alcohol policy that is totally unreasonable.
the grievances proceeded to arbitration after the parties agreed upon the following submission 
did citgo violate article xxx of the labor agreement by improperly implementing its national substance abuse policy at the paulsboro facility on october.if not,was the policy unreasonable 
at the arbitration hearing,the parties stipulated that the management rights clause article iii and the future bargaining clause article xxx in the then current cba were identical to those contained in every cba that had been in effect at paulsboro since.article iii,the management rights clause provides,in applicable part,as follows 
except to the extent expressly abridged by an express and specific provision of this agreement,the company reserves and retains all of its common law or other rights to manage the business as such rights existed prior to the execution of this or any other previous agreement with the union or any other union.the rights of management which are not abridged by this agreement,shall include,but are not limited to make and enforce rules for the maintenance of discipline and safety,and to suspend,discharge,or otherwise discipline employees for just cause.the listing of specific rights in this agreement is not intended to be nor shall it be restrictive of or a waiver of any of the rights of management not listed and specifically surrendered herein,whether or not such rights have been exercised by the company in the past.
article xxv of the cba,entitled grievance procedure and arbitration,provides,in relevant part,as follows 
grievances are defined as alleged violations of express and specific provisions of this agreement occurring during the term of this agreement or any renewal or extension thereof neither the union nor an employee shall use or attempt to use the grievance procedure as a means of changing,amending,modifying,supplementing or otherwise altering in any respect whatsoever this agreement or any part thereof.
the union and the company both agree that the submission to the arbitrator shall be based on the original written grievance submitted in the grievance procedure 
the power and authority of the arbitrator shall be strictly limited to determining the meaning and interpretation of the explicit terms of this agreement as herein expressly set forth.the arbitrator shall not have authority to add or to subtract from or modify any of said terms,or to limit or impair any common law or other right of the company,or to establish or change any wage or rate of pay the parties agree that the power and jurisdiction of any arbitrator chosen hereunder shall be limited to deciding whether there has been a violation of a provision of this agreement.the arbitrator shall not substitute his judgment for that of the company in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion.the arbitrator shall not be empowered,and shall have no jurisdiction,to base his award on any alleged practices or oral understandings which are not incorporated in writing in this agreement 
article xxx,the future bargaining clause,provides 
the parties acknowledge that,during the negotiations which resulted in this agreement and any attachments hereto,each had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject not removed from the area of collective bargaining and therefore each waives the right to further bargaining on any subject not covered or covered under this agreement and any attachments hereto during the term hereof.
the parties also stipulated that 
the paulsboro refinery is a hazardous work environment that can explode and poses a potential threat to workers,the environment,and to the public at large.
the bargaining unit positions affected by the drug testing policy are safety sensitive as defined in department of transportation regulations.
the duties of the bargaining unit employees are such that their attempts to perform while in a state of drug impairment may pose a threat to,to the workplace,to the environment,and to the public at large.
all employees management and bargaining unit employees alike at paulsboro play a critical role in both preventing accidents and minimizing the effects of accidents.
the speed in responding to a dangerous condition is critical to limiting potential damage and injury.
in addition,owen haynes,a carco employee for years and local president for approximately years,testified that paulsboro is a potentially dangerous work environment,and mike drager,the manager of the paulsboro facility,testified about toxic and deadly gases at the refinery.
citgo contends that the only evidence local offered to support its grievance that the policy was unreasonable was the testimony of eric hamilton,the president of the pace local at a company called motiva,and the testimony of timothy koladi,the chairman of the union grievance committee at sun oil.both men testified that the substance abuse policies at their respective facilities included random drug testing.they also testified that the motiva and sun oil policies are virtually identical to the citgo policy except for citgo zero tolerance provision.
hamilton testified as follows regarding the policy at motiva 
there are people in the bargaining unit and only two people have ever been disciplined in two years.
motiva never requested a zero tolerance program.
motiva safety record,unlike citgo,is just industry standard.
motiva,like citgo,needed a standardized policy.
the policy was adopted by consensus,not through negotiations.
both employees disciplined under motiva policy were repeat offenders.both violated the policy a second time after not being disciplined for an initial violation,and both were detected by random testing.
as to the policy at sun,oil,koladi testified 
there are employees in one bargaining unit and employees in the other.
that in the ten years since,only four to six employees have been disciplined under the policy and they too were all second offenders,after having been given a first chance without discipline.
john deleon,citgo manager of human resources and labor relations,testified in defense of citgo policy and explained the steps citgo took in designing its national substance abuse policy.deleon testified that citgo reviewed the practices of other companies in the industry and patterned much of its policy after the omnibus transportation employee testing act of,et.deleon also explained that,because a uniform policy was needed,all aspects of the program including random testing,zero tolerance,apply to all employees,from the president of citgo down.he further explained that the policy was implemented nationwide,including all facilities where there was union representation,and that he did not know of a major refinery that did not have random testing.according to deleon,tosco,marathon and exxon,three major companies in the industry,also had zero tolerance substance abuse polices.deleon testimony was unrebutted.
during his testimony,deleon gave specific reasons for a zero tolerance provision.he testified that citgo safety record is the best in the industry,a fact not challenged by local,and that citgo wanted to maintain its record.he explained that,in citgo judgment,offering a second chance sends a message to employees that it okay to do drugs until you get caught t hat was a very strong feeling,deleon also explained that the zero tolerance policy does not apply if an employee comes forward and identifies as a person with a substance abuse problem.he also explained that citgo medical director was on the team that designed the program,and added that the only union in the country that had challenged the program was the union at the savannah,georgia,asphalt plant.as noted,the savannah arbitration resulted in an award which found that the citgo policy was reasonable in all respects.the president of local testified that the savannah plant is virtually identical to the paulsboro facility.
the arbitrator found no contractual breach by citgo with respect to its unilateral adoption and implementation of a substance abuse program in.he also found that the mandatory,random testing procedure was both proper and reasonable.however,he sustained the local challenge to the zero tolerance policy.the arbitrator ruled that part of the policy was unreasonable.he explained 
t here can be no serious quarrel with the right of a company in this type of industry to make certain that safety concerns are paramount and should be adequately addressed indeed,it was recited that citgo has the best safety record in the industry and wants to keep it that way.i therefore will not seek to disturb that record.however,there are specific areas of the policy that are troubling to me 
while the union argued that mandatory random testing should be declared unreasonable,the arbitrator can not agree with that position.having said that,i do nevertheless understand and appreciate the union argument with respect to employees who test positive as the result of random testing not being given a second chance under the policy.the facts reveal that this is contrary to the policies in place at the motiva refinery in delaware city,delaware,and at the sun refinery in marcus hook.while the arbitrator fully acknowledges that the best safety record in the industry is obviously a legitimate objective for any company,it has not been shown to my satisfaction that permitting an employee to have a second chance would be inconsistent with that goal.that being so,the arbitrator agrees with the union that the policy,without giving a second chance for rehabilitation,is unreasonable to that extent and to that extent only.this is especially so where the dot regulations permit second chance or rehabilitation opportunities.i therefore find that the policy should be modified in that regard.
thus,t he arbitrator sustained the policy as written except where it does not permit a sic employee or rehabilitation opportunities.app.at.the arbitrator held that the policy including carco right to conduct random drug testing,was reasonable,except for the zero tolerance provision 
ii.district court proceedings 
carco filed a complaint in the district court challenging the arbitration opinion and award carco alleged that the arbitrator exceeded the power and authority given to him by the parties rendered an award which did not draw its essence from the labor agreement ignored the plain language imposing limitations on his authority rendered an award which was not totally supported by the record and failed to apply the standard of review set forth in the cba.local filed an answer and counterclaim to enforce the award in its entirety.in time,for summary judgment were filed and the district court thereafter entered an order granting local motion for confirmation of the award in its entirety.this appeal followed.the arbitrator rejection of the zero tolerance provision of the policy is the only issue on appeal.
iii.standard of review 
we exercise plenary review of the district court confirmation of a labor arbitration award and apply the same standard the district court should have applied.exxon shipping exxon seamen union,cir exxon iii.
courts play a very limited role in reviewing the decision of an arbitrator appointed pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement.united paperworkers international union,misco,d.when the parties include an arbitration clause in their cba,they choose to have disputes concerning constructions of the contract resolved by an arbitrator.grace and local union,international union of the united rubber,cork,linoleum and plastic workers of america,d.consequently,we are not authorized to reconsider the merits of an award even though the parties may allege that the award rests on errors of fact or on misinterpretation of the contract.united paperworkers union misco,at.this follows from the fact that the arbitrator judgment was bargained for by the parties.united steelworkers of america american manufacturing,d.judicial review of labor arbitrators decisions would annul the bargain of the parties for an arbitrator construction of their cba and replace it with the court construction.stroehmann bakeries,local,international brotherhood of teamsters,cir citing united steelworkers of america enterprise wheel and car,d.
therefore,we do not review an arbitrator award for legal error.exxon iii,at.a s long as the arbitrator award draws its essence from the cba and is not merely the arbitrator own brand of industrial justice,the award is legitimate.misco.at citation and internal quotations omitted.o nly where there is a manifest disregard of the agreement,totally unsupported by the principles of contract construction and the law of the shop,may a reviewing court disturb the award.exxon iii,at citations and internal quotations omitted.accordingly,the award stands even if the court finds the basis for it to be ambiguous or disagrees with its conclusions under the law.stroehmann bakeries,local,at citation omitted.
therefore,a court can only vacate an arbitrator award if it is entirely unsupported by the record or if it reflects a manifest disregard of the agreement.exxon iii,at citation and internal quotations omitted.an arbitrator decision need be neither wise nor internally consistent.id.at.the decision is subject to a standard of only minimal rationality.id.
it follows that a reviewing court must defer to the arbitrator factual finding
