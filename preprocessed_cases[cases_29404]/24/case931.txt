this appeal raises interesting questions about the relationship between the primary jurisdiction of the national labor relations board nlrb or the board to determine representational disputes and the scope of arbitration under a construction industry collective bargaining agreement that,together with a broad arbitration clause,also contains a provision about determining majority representation.the underlying dispute involves whether the union appropriately established that it represented a majority of the employees before the expiration of the agreement,so as to qualify for recognition under section a of the national labor relations act nlra or the act.if it did so,it would enjoy a presumption of majority status giving rise to an obligation on the part of the employers to bargain for a new contract with the union.
the union takes the position that it did establish majority status,while the employers say it did not.after originally filing a charge with the nlrb,the union ultimately filed this action to compel arbitration of the dispute in district court.the employers now take the position that the issue is properly before the nlrb,where the administrative law judge alj ruled that the charges should be dismissed.the case remains pending on appeal before the board.
under our circuit law,the legal issue here is whether the dispute is primarily representational or contractual.see serv.employees int l union,local vincent med,cir.a primarily contractual dispute would potentially be arbitrable,whereas a primarily representational dispute would not be.because we conclude that this particular dispute is principally representational,we affirm the district court decision dismissing the action on the ground that the dispute falls within the primary jurisdiction of the nlrb.
statutory background 
at issue in this case is whether the union was the bargaining agent for the employees pursuant to f or a of the nlra at the time the collective bargaining agreement expired.section a of the act establishes that a union selected by a majority of employees in a bargaining unit shall be the employees exclusive bargaining representative.a.once a union has achieved a majority status,an employer obligation to bargain with the union continues beyond the term of any particular collective bargaining agreement.this is the result of board policy.see levitz furniture of the pacific,nlrb.
in most industries,it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to bargain with a union that does not have majority support,or for an employer to promise a union that it will require prospective employees to join the union as a condition of employment.nlrb local union,d.the construction industry,however,operates under its own set of statutory rules.in,congress recognized that the nature of the industry hiring often precluded unionization pursuant to a,and responded by adding f to the nlra.see f todd jim mcneff,cir.section f provides that employers may enter into a prehire agreement requiring union membership as a condition of employment,notwithstanding the union lack of majority status.todd,at.though it is easier for unions to organize under f,it is board policy that unions formed under that provision do not enjoy a presumption of majority status once the collective bargaining agreement expires at that point in time,the f relationship is terminable by either party.john deklewa sons,nlrb,enforced sub nom.iron workers local nlrb,cir madison indus,nlrb.
because of the more tenuous nature of representation under f,some unions that initially organize under that provision attempt to convert to a majority status,and the board has held that an employer may contractually agree to voluntary recognition on the basis of the union showing of majority support.staunton fuel material,nlrb,madison,nlrb at.the parties dispute in this case whether the union was successful in effectuating such a conversion before the contract expired.
factual background 
defendants are four nevada contractors engaged in commercial and industrial r flooring,freeman carpet service,fcs flooring,and flooring solutions of nevada,collectively,the employers.the employers and plaintiff international union of painters and allied trades,district council,local the union operated for several years under the auspices of a common collective bargaining agreement the agreement or cba governed by f.that agreement,effective february,through january,established a mechanism through which the union representation pursuant to f could be changed to one governed by a.
the parties agreement,at article,provides that the employer will recognize the union if it has majority status and will permit a card check conducted by a third party to determine whether the union has achieved majority status.article of the cba provides 
the employer hereby recognizes the union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent of employees classified herein the employer agrees that if a majority of its employees authorize the union to represent them in collective bargaining,the employer will recognize the union as the nlra section a majority collective bargaining agent for all employees performing work within the jurisdiction of this agreement.the employer agrees furthermore upon demand by the union to submit to a third party card check to determine the majority status of the union.any disputes concerning this provision shall be resolved by expedited arbitration under the terms of this agreement.
a card check is a voluntary method for determining whether a union enjoys majority status without resort to a election.see john higgins,the developing labor law ed.in a typical card check procedure,the union collects signature cards from employees designating the union as their bargaining representative.hotel employees,rest.employees union,local marriott,cir.once the union collects cards from a majority of employees and presents them to the employer,generally a mutually agreeable neutral party verifies the cards for authenticity.id.
in addition to the card check provision,article of the agreement establishes a general grievance and arbitration procedure.article creates a joint committee that is charged with hearing disputes and grievance s that may arise out of the application or interpretation of the agreement in the first instance,and also provides for arbitration where a decision can not be reached in committee.
two months before the parties f agreement was due to expire,the union notified the employers that it wished to bargain for a new contract.in part because they were not all represented by the same counsel,the employers reacted differently to the union bargaining request.fsi steadfastly refused to negotiate at all with the union,announcing that it did not want to enter into a new agreement.the other three r flooring,freeman carpet service,and fcs flooring,with the union but failed to reach an agreement.the union then announced to all the employers its intention to conduct a card check in accordance with article of the agreement,prior to the expiration of the contract.all of the employers refused to recognize the union as representing an employee majority,and they continue to maintain they have no duty to bargain.
with respect to fsi,the union requested that the parties hold a card check on january.fsi responded that it was not available on that date.on january,the day before the agreement was set to expire,the union faxed fsi a letter informing the company that the union was scheduling the card check for noon that day at a local church,by father menchaca,a third party selected by the union.no fsi representative appeared at the card check,and menchaca conducted the check and reported that twenty of fsi employees had signed the authorization cards.in the card check,menchaca compared the signatures on union authorization cards to the names of employees listed on the most recent remittance report submitted by fsi to the union.menchaca did not compare the employees signatures on the cards to other signature samples,as required by the board decision in cascade general,nlrb.nor did he utilize the formula,a formula that governs which construction employees are eligible to participate in card check procedures unless the parties stipulate not to use it.see signet testing laboratories,nlrb.the formula provides that,in addition to employees on the payroll immediately preceding an election,employees who have worked a certain number of days in the two year period preceding an election are eligible to participate.
following the card check,the union president,jack mallory,personally delivered copies of the card check results to fsi along with a email to fsi vice president,bryan price,asking him to meet with mallory the following day,january,for contract negotiations.price indicated he could not meet at that time.on the,the day of the collective bargaining agreement expiration,the union,in its purported capacity as the a collective bargaining representative,sent a letter to fsi proposing available bargaining dates.fsi did not respond and maintains that it has no duty to bargain with the union following the expiration of the agreement.
the remaining three employers were all represented by the same attorney and all initially bargained with the union to enter into a new contract.as of january,however,the parties were unable to reach an agreement.the parties met for a sixth session on january,at which time the union announced its intention to conduct a card check.the attorney for the three employers objected to the card check on the grounds that the remittance reports that the union intended to use were not current,his clients had not participated in the selection of the neutral,and at least two employees had complained about the union misinforming them of the purpose of the cards.the attorney threatened to walk out of the negotiations if the card check proceeded,and although the union stated that it would proceed with the card check regardless of the attorney presence,the employers and their attorney left.
a third party selected by the union,maria castillo couch,proceeded to conduct the card check.she compared the names on the cards with the names listed on the remittance reports and concluded that a majority of employees from each of the three employers agreed to representation by the union.couch then signed a card check certification to that effect.couch,like menchaca,did not verify the signatures or use the formula.
the union then sent a letter dated january,notifying the three employers of the results of the card check and suggesting dates for negotiations.following the collective bargaining agreement expiration,these employers have met with the union but have refused to accept the card check results.
thus,all four of the employers refused to accept the card check and refused to recognize the union as representing a majority of employees so as to give rise to any duty to bargain under a of the nlra.
procedural background 
in february,the union filed unfair labor practice charges with the nlrb against the four employers.at that time,neither the union nor the employers had suggested pursuing grievance and arbitration procedures concerning the card check.the board general counsel brought charges against the employers and the case proceeded to trial before an alj.the charge against the employers was they had refused to comply with article card check provision and had thereby unlawfully refused to bargain.the alj found for the employers,holding in essence that the union could not rely on the card check results because it had not followed article further agreement to arbitrate disputes when the union and the employers failed to agree on the card check procedures.the union appeal of the alj decision to the board is still pending.after the alj issued her decision in september,the union filed this action in united states district court seeking an order compelling arbitration.the issues the union identified for arbitration were w hether the union established its status as the majority representative under a pursuant to the terms of the contract if so,what is the appropriate remedy 
the district court granted the employers motions for summary judgment,denied the union motion to compel arbitration,and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.the court found that the issue the union proposed for arbitration was primarily representational and thus fell within the primary jurisdiction of the nlrb.the union appeals the district court dismissal to this court.
the fundamental issue is whether the parties are required to arbitrate their disagreement over whether the employers have a duty to bargain.whether the employers have a duty to bargain in turn depends on whether the union established it represented a majority of employees in accord with article of the agreement.

the supreme court has long supported arbitration of labor disputes involving disagreements over the interpretation of collective bargaining agreements,beginning with the famous steelworkers trilogy.see united steelworkers american,united steelworkers warrior gulf navigation,d united steelworkers enterprise wheel car,d.in the trilogy,the supreme court resolved several related issues concerning enforcement of arbitration clauses and awards,in each case finding in favor of arbitrability.in american manufacturing,the supreme court held that when the parties have negotiated an arbitration clause,the function of the enforcing court is limited to determining whether the party seeking arbitration is making a claim which on its face is governed by the contract.at.in warrior gulf,the court considered the scope of arbitrability,and held that all questions on which parties disagree come within the scope of arbitration unless specifically excluded,instructing that d oubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.at.finally,in enterprise wheel,the court contemplated judicial review of arbitral awards,and established a very deferential standard,holding that a reviewing court should not refuse to enforce an award merely because it would read the collective bargaining agreement differently than the arbitrator.at.the orientation first articulated in the steelworkers trilogy continues to be a foundational principle of our labor law.see john higgins,the developing labor law ed.
at the same time,the supreme court has long recognized that where a dispute involves allegations that an employer has committed an unfair labor practice,the board exercises primary jurisdiction,and the federal courts must defer to its exclusive competence.san diego.trades council garmon,d see also commc workers beck,d kaiser steel mullins,d the board is vested with primary jurisdiction to determine what is or is not an unfair labor practice.garner teamsters.the doctrine of primary jurisdiction stems from congress statutory delegation of duties to the board,including the responsibility to interpret the nlra in the first instance,and to investigate and adjudicate petitions for relief under the act.see garner,at see also.
this court has applied the doctrine of primary jurisdiction in declining to consider representational disputes that the nlra commits to the board expertise.see,local int l woodworkers of america ketchikan pulp,cir finding designation of an exclusive bargaining agent and the definition of an appropriate bargaining unit within primary jurisdiction of the board united ass of journeymen valley eng rs,cir declining to exercise jurisdiction under where issue of illegal doublebreasting already decided by the nlrb.
