the question presented in this appeal is whether an employee can invalidate a waiver provision in an arbitration agreement when that waiver removes the financial incentive for her to pursue a claim under the fair labor standards act of flsa,et.in light of the supervening decision of the supreme court in american express italian colors restaurant,we answer that question in the negative,and reverse the contrary decision of the united states district court for the southern district of new york kimba wood,judge.
ernst young e y appeals from an order of the district court denying its rule b motion to dismiss or stay the proceedings,and to compel arbitration pursuant to the federal arbitration act,et.e y seeks to dismiss or stay this putative class action brought by its former employee,stephanie sutherland,on behalf of herself and others similarly situated to recover overtime wages pursuant to the flsa,and the new york department of labor minimum wage order,regs.tit,promulgated pursuant to the new york labor law nyll,et 
the district court denied e y motion to compel arbitration because it found that the underlying waiver provision in the arbitration agreement between e y and sutherland was unenforceable pursuant to our decision in in re american express merchants litigation,cir amex i.in that case,we invalidated a waiver provision in an arbitration agreement because the plaintiffs had shown that they would incur prohibitive costs if compelled to arbitrate under the class action waiver,and enforcing the arbitration agreement would deprive them of substantive rights under the federal antitrust statutes.id.at.but amex i and the subsequent decisions that followed in our circuit are no longer good in light of the supreme court recent decision in american express italian colors restaurant,which held that plaintiffs could not invalidate a waiver of class arbitration under the effective vindication doctrine by showing that they ha d no economic incentive to pursue their antitrust claims individually in arbitration.id.at see id.at but the fact that it is not worth the expense involved in proving a statutory remedy does not constitute the elimination of the right to pursue that remedy.
because italian colors abrogated the district court basis for invaliding the waiver provision in this case,we conclude that the district court erred in denying e y motion to compel arbitration.accordingly,we reverse the district court march,order and remand the cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
sutherland was employed by e y from september through december.during her tenure at e y,she worked as a staff and later as a staff audit employee.most of her responsibilities involved training and low level clerical work.joint app x.sutherland was compensated by e y on a salary only basis,which meant that she was paid a fixed salary of per year,regardless of how many hours she worked.as relevant here,because sutherland was a salary only employee,she did not receive any additional compensation for working overtime,more than hours per week.id.at.sutherland alleges that she regularly worked in excess of hours in a work week,often to hours in one week.id.at.
when sutherland accepted her offer of employment with e y,she signed a offer letter.that offer letter stated,inter alia,that if an employment related dispute arises between you and the firm,it will be subject to mandatory under the terms of the firm alternative dispute resolution program,known as the common ground program,a copy of which is attached.id.at emphasis omitted.sutherland also signed a confidentiality agreement,which listed the terms of the alternative dispute resolution policy and stated 
i further agree that any dispute,controversy or claim as defined in the e y common ground dispute resolution program attached arising between myself and the firm will be submitted first to mediation and,if mediation is unsuccessful,then to binding arbitration in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in,which describes the firm common ground dispute resolution program.i acknowledge that i have read and understand the e y common ground dispute resolution program and that i shall abide by it.
as noted,a copy of the e y common ground dispute resolution program arbitration agreement was attached to the offer letter and the confidentiality agreement.as relevant here,the arbitration agreement specifically states that c laims based on federal statutes such as the fair labor standards act,c laims based on state statutes and local ordinances,including state and local laws,and c laims concerning wages,salary,and incentive compensation programs are subject to the terms of the arbitration agreement.id.at.the terms of the arbitration agreement also include the following two relevant provisions neither the firm nor an employee will be able to sue in court in connection with a covered dispute,id.emphasis omitted and covered disputes pertaining to different e mployees will be heard in separate proceedings,id.at 
despite the terms of the arbitration agreement,which the parties agree bars both civil lawsuits and any class or collective proceedings in the arbitration,sutherland br,sutherland filed this putative class action against e y to recover,inter alia,hours of unpaid overtime wages,amounting to.in particular,sutherland claimed that e y had wrongfully classified her as exempt from the overtime requirements of the flsa and the nyll.
after sutherland filed her putative class action,e y filed a motion to dismiss,or stay the proceedings,and to compel arbitration of sutherland claims on an individual basis in accordance with the terms of the arbitration agreement.sutherland responded by arguing that the entire provision requiring individual arbitration was unenforceable because the requirement that she arbitrate her claims individually,rather than collectively,prevented her from effectively vindicating her rights under the flsa and the nyll.in particular,she argued that the costs and fees associated with prosecuting her claims on an individual basis would dwarf her potential recovery of less than in support of this argument,sutherland filed an uncontested estimate that her attorney fees during arbitration would be and that her costs would exceed.she also claimed that expert testimony would be necessary and would cost at least.in sum,she argued that to effectively vindicate her claims in an individual arbitration,she would be required to expend approximately to recover less than.
the district court was persuaded by sutherland arguments and,on march,denied e y motion to dismiss,or stay the proceedings,and to compel arbitration on an individual basis.in doing so,the district court relied in large part on our analysis in amex i,which invalidated a provision barring class actions in the antitrust context where plaintiffs demonstrated that they would be unable to vindicate their statutory rights if that provision was enforced.see sutherland ernst young llp,d.specifically,the district court stated that e nforcement of the class waiver provision in this case would effectively ban all proceedings by sutherland against e y,id.at,because of the nature of her,claim,id.at.
on march,e y moved for reconsideration of the district court march,order in light of the supreme court subsequent decision in at t mobility llc concepcion.the district court denied that motion on january,concluding,inter alia,that sutherland,unlike the plaintiffs in concepcion,is not able to vindicate her rights absent a collective action.sutherland ernst young llp,d.
this appeal now presents the following question may an employee invalidate a waiver provision in an arbitration agreement when that waiver removes the financial incentive for her to pursue her flsa claim
