after we decided two earlier appeals related to the disputes noted here,plaintiffs kirk evans evans,kirk evans,kse development,and the kirk and laurie evans trust now appeal from a judgment entered after confirmation of an arbitrator award.they also appeal from orders compelling arbitration,denying a petition to vacate or modify an arbitration award this is not appealable but can be reviewed on appeal from the judgment associates th,d,and denying and striking requests for trial de novo.they contend the arbitrator acted in excess of his powers and committed misconduct and that the order compelling arbitration was improper.we disagree with all of these assertions and affirm the judgment.
defendants centerstone development company,a california corporation centerstone,ernest castro,harold woods,harri keto,centerstone carlsbad,llc,a california limited liability company,centerstone cerritos,llc,and beaumont holdings filed a motion for sanctions,arguing that plaintiffs briefs violated the rules of court and their appeal was frivolous.we agree with both contentions and grant the motion.we publish this opinion because this case presents a prime example of a frivolous appeal and of flagrant violations of the rules pertaining to appeals.we also publish this opinion to discourage parties to arbitration agreements from frivolously seeking judicial review of matters not cognizable in our courts.
centerstone,a real estate development company,was owned by evans,castro,and woods,with evans acting as president.after disputes arose among the principals,evans was ousted.in august,the parties entered into a written settlement agreement resolving litigation among them.
the agreement contained an arbitration provision that stated disputes would be decided by arbitration conducted by the judicial arbitration and mediation services jams using its streamlined rules discovery was to be governed by code of civil procedure section as determined by the retired judge hearing the matter.the settlement agreement also contained a confidentiality provision,which stated that the parties shall not discuss,reveal,or disclose to any third party,other than their lawyers or accountants on a need to know basis,any of the facts,circumstances,or disputes leading up to the litigation and shall keep the terms and conditions of this agreement strictly confidential,unless otherwise compelled under law,or as may be needed to defend against or prosecute any litigation.
at the time centerstone terminated evans,it also discontinued using the services of two brokers,joann ulvan and william geller brokers,who subsequently sued defendants.defendants contended plaintiffs provided information to the brokers,in violation of the confidentiality provision in the settlement agreement,to support the brokers lawsuit against defendants.defendants initiated arbitration proceedings against plaintiffs for breach of the agreement and sought damages that could exceed.
thereafter,jams sent the lawyers for the parties a letter confirming the commencement of arbitration.it included a copy of its streamlined rules and a list of three proposed arbitrators.the parties were advised that if they could not agree on an arbitrator,they should each strike a name from the list and rank the other two in order of preference.defendants selected judge smith as their first preference.evans himself called,and faxed jams advising he wanted judge ryan to act as arbitrator.jams telephoned plaintiffs attorney to explain that,since judge ryan was not one of the three arbitrators on the list,the parties had to agree to her or plaintiffs had to use the strike list.plaintiffs attorney never responded,and in may judge smith was assigned as the arbitrator.
when jams notified the parties of the selection,it also sent a disclosure statement,revealing it had found no matters where judge smith had acted as an arbitrator in any cases involving the parties or their counsel.the notice also gave the parties days to disqualify judge smith neither side did so.
part of the settlement agreement required defendants to pay certain sums to plaintiffs.in december,alleging defendants had breached the agreement,plaintiffs filed an action in the superior court to compel payment or rescind the agreement.defendants then filed a motion to compel arbitration pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement,which the court granted.although defendant keto was not a party to the settlement agreement,he agreed to have the claims against him also submitted to arbitration.
the arbitration of all the claims occurred during september and written closing briefs were all filed by october.the arbitrator issued his preliminary award on november,finding that plaintiffs had breached the confidentiality provision and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the settlement agreement by disclosing information to the brokers.he awarded defendants almost million,which constituted the amount of attorney fees and costs they had spent defending the brokers action.
the award also found plaintiffs were entitled to an offset of for monies defendants had withheld once plaintiffs breached the settlement agreement.it reserved jurisdiction to determine accrued interest on the offset funds owed to plaintiffs,to determine the amount of attorney fees and costs to be awarded to defendants,including time for additional briefing,and to correct clerical errors and issue a final award.
on november,plaintiffs filed a motion to reopen or for reconsideration,which the arbitrator denied.in late november,defendants made a motion for attorney fees and costs.on december,the last documents regarding this motion were filed.
on february,the arbitrator issued his final award,which set out the amount of attorney fees awarded to defendants but otherwise was essentially identical to the preliminary award.it again reserved jurisdiction for days to determine the amount of interest and to correct clerical errors.
on march,plaintiffs filed motions for new trial in the superior court as to their action against defendants.while we found nothing in the record,we assume the motions were denied.a few days later,they applied to the arbitrator to modify the final arbitration award to insert the amount of interest on the accrued monies owed to them.another few days thereafter,plaintiffs filed another motion before the arbitrator to reopen the arbitration,which was again denied.on march,they filed an opposition to defendants application as to the amount of interest.
on march,plaintiffs sent a letter to the arbitrator objecting to the award on the grounds it was not complete because it still required a calculation of interest owed to them,and therefore was not final.they argued the streamlined rules required the award be rendered days after the hearing was completed.
on march,the arbitrator issued his corrected and supplemental final award,which included the specific sum of accrued interest.defendants then filed a petition to confirm the award.plaintiffs filed opposition to the petition,a petition to vacate the award,and requests for trial de novo.the court granted defendants motion to strike the requests and confirmed the award it denied the motion to vacate.plaintiffs then made a motion for a new trial and to vacate or modify the judgment.the trial court denied this motion as well.
discussion 
introduction 
public policy supports minimal judicial participation in arbitration proceedings.moncharsh heily blase cal th,d,moncharsh.courts do not review arbitration awards for factual or legal errors jones humanscale th,d,including sufficiency of the evidence or reasoning of the arbitrator moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.when a court does review an award,it draws all reasonable inferences to support the decision and displays substantial deference towards the arbitrator determination of his or her contractual authority.citations.jones humanscale,supra,th at,d.
the arbitrator did not act in excess of his powers.
one of the limited bases on which an arbitration award may be vacated is when an arbitrator exceeded his powers and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision code civ,subd.a all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise stated.scattered throughout their briefs,plaintiffs make several claims,apparently,although not clearly,on grounds the arbitrator acted in excess of his powers.none of them have merit.
streamlined rules 
a theme underlying several of plaintiffs arguments is the applicability of the jams streamlined rules.plaintiffs contend the version of the rules in effect at the time the settlement agreement was signed apply.we disagree.
preliminarily we note that,despite their heavy reliance on the version of the rules,plaintiffs never clearly gave a record reference to enable us to review them.all of their direct citations were to the version,even though they constantly argued those did not apply.the one reference to the rules they did give was buried in the brief and so oblique as to be meaningless.although not required to conduct a search del real city of riverside th,d,we were faced with the challenge of sorting through over pages of transcripts in volumes to locate the version in order to be able to address plaintiffs arguments.
plaintiffs maintain that,at the time they entered into the settlement agreement,they specifically relied on the version of the streamlined rules because they limited damages to.there is no basis for this claim.plaintiffs set out testimony from the arbitration purportedly in support of this contention but fail to provide any record references.we decline the implied invitation that we review the pages of the arbitration transcript to find such testimony.in addition,statements in evans declaration in support of plaintiffs motion to vacate two pages out of the almost cited do not substantiate their claim because the trial court sustained defendants objection to them.
the rules themselves demonstrate the frivolous nature of the plaintiffs contention.rule of the rules states that jams may amend these rules without notice.the rules in effect on the date of the commencement of an arbitration will apply unless the parties have specified that another version of the rules will apply.contrary to plaintiffs argument,the settlement agreement does not refer to any version of the rules.thus,even assuming plaintiffs were relying on the version,those rules themselves plainly advised them that different rules could be in effect when and if an arbitration took place.the arbitrator did not exceed his powers by using the later rules.
the award is not in excess of jurisdiction.
plaintiffs contend the award to defendants was in excess of the purported jurisdictional limit of the arbitrator.but this is based on their unfounded claim that the settlement agreement required use of the version of the jams streamlined rules.rule of the streamlined rules states that they apply to binding arbitrations where the parties have agreed to use them,or,in the absence of such agreement,no disputed claim or counterclaim exceeds a plain reading of this language shows the amount of damages is not limited where,as here,the parties merely agreed to use the streamlined rules.plaintiffs assertion that,because the damages exceeded,neither their claims nor those of defendants were subject to arbitration under the settlement agreement is without merit.
binding arbitration 
plaintiffs assert the arbitrator failed to make a necessary finding,that the arbitration was binding.presumably,although not stated,plaintiffs refer to their complaint,which was ordered to arbitration under the settlement agreement.however,both the settlement agreement and rule of the streamlined rules state the arbitration was to be binding.thus this was not an issue before the arbitrator.nevertheless,the award also states that the matter was submitted to binding arbitration pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement.and,in confirming the award,the trial court concurred.moreover,the general rule is that parties to a private arbitration impliedly agree that the arbitrator decision will be both binding and final.moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.there is no error here.
timely award 
nor are we persuaded by plaintiffs argument the arbitrator final award was not timely and he thus lost jurisdiction.plaintiffs rely on the streamlined rules that state the final award should be served within days after the hearing closes.the hearing closed on october and the arbitrator rendered a preliminary award on november.in that award he reserved jurisdiction to determine interest and attorney fees and correct clerical errors.
the record reveals that even if the award was late,which we do not decide,plaintiffs waived any objection to the timing.jams rule a states that when a party believes the rules have been violated,he or she must promptly object in writing or the objection will be deemed waived.in addition,section provides that a party waives a timeliness objection unless he gives the arbitrators written notice of his objection prior to the service of a signed copy of the award on him.
plaintiffs objection was made after service of the final award and only a few days before service of the corrected final award.plaintiffs did not object within the period after the interim award or days after the final award,both of which reserved jurisdiction to amend the award.in fact,plaintiffs impliedly,if not explicitly,accepted the award,treating it as timely,by filing motions to correct the award,an opposition to defendants motion,a motion to reopen,and a motion for reconsideration.
although rule a of the streamlined rules provides for an award to be issued within days after the hearing closes,it also allows for a longer period for good cause.plaintiffs conduct and the issues requiring further decision support a finding there was good cause for delay.the arbitrator had the right to reserve jurisdiction to determine attorney fees and interest.hightower superior court th,d.he also had the power to amend the award any time before it was confirmed so long as it was consistent with other findings on the merits of the controversy and did not prejudice a party.delaney dahl th,d.here,inserting the amount of attorney fees and interest was appropriate.
in britz,food dairy th,d,after he had reserved jurisdiction to do so,the arbitrator amended a final award to insert the exact amount of attorney fees.on appeal,plaintiff contended the arbitrator had lost jurisdiction to correct the award since it was done more than days after close of the hearing.the court disagreed,stating that the correction was a timely modification of the final order,correcting the form of the attorney fees and costs award.id.at,d.
we also reject plaintiffs complaint that the final award was improper because it was faxed and not served by mail.section states that service may be personal,by mail,or as provided in the agreement.the streamlined rules provide service may be made by mail italics added they do not require it.
litigation privilege 
plaintiffs contend the arbitrator did not rule on their defense that evans testimony in a deposition in the brokers case against defendants was protected by the litigation privilege civil code section,subdivision b and thus could not be the basis for a finding that he breached the confidentiality provisions or the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the settlement agreement.in the first place,even if the arbitrator did fail to address this issue,it is entirely within his powers under the arbitration agreement and not reviewable on appeal.moncharsh,supra,cal th at,d.
furthermore,plaintiffs raise this issue in a footnote in the introduction to the opening brief.this is a violation of court rules that require arguments to be contained in discrete sections with headings summarizing the point.cal.rules of court,rule a b.we do not have to consider issues discussed only in a footnote.roberts lomanto th,d 
moreover,as defendants point out,plaintiffs waived this issue by failing to raise it in the trial court.even after this specific warning about the deficiency of their argument contained in their brief,plaintiffs were unable to show they had brought up the issue in the trial court.the best they could do was point to a single page in their petition to vacate the award,which they inaccurately characterize as more precise,among other places.they did not direct us to any other place,if there was any,and we refuse to search through pages of transcripts to determine whether we can improve on plaintiffs argument.del real city of riverside,supra,th at,d 
and the cited page is inadequate.plaintiffs have not shown they made any argument in the petition to vacate or any other motion or petition filed in the trial court where they raised this issue for consideration.their record reference is to an argument contained in a footnote in an arbitration brief attached as an exhibit to the petition to vacate.this was not sufficient to request a ruling from the trial court or to preserve the issue for appeal.britz,food dairy,supra,th at,d trial court must review de novo any claim of arbitrator misconduct if issue properly raised robinson grossman th,d issues not raised at trial not reviewable on appeal.
answer to complaint 
plaintiffs fault defendants failure to file an answer to their complaint,in violation of the streamlined rules.they claim that since there was no written waiver of the rules,the arbitrator had no authority to consider defendants defenses.plaintiffs fail to point to anything in the record showing they objected to the lack of an answer jams rules a or that they were in any way surprised or prejudiced by defendants evidence or legal theories offered in opposition to the complaint.they waived any claim on this ground.
the arbitrator was not biased and did not commit any misconduct.
another ground for vacating an arbitration award is where a party rights were substantially prejudiced by misconduct of a neutral arbitrator,subd.a.none of the several claims plaintiffs make on this basis has merit.
disclosure and disqualification 
plaintiffs maintain the arbitrator failed to make required disclosures under section.specifically,they complain that although he made initial disclosures that he had no relationships with parties to the arbitration and their attorneys,the disclosures were not complete.plaintiffs fail to apprise us what conflict there was that required the arbitrator to make a disclosure,and therefore they have waived this claim.people stanley cal th,d.we again decline the opportunity to search the record to determine if they advised the trial court in this regard.
in addition,plaintiffs contend that once their complaint was ordered to arbitration,the arbitrator did not make disclosures as to defendant keto and other additional parties named as defendants,and defendants new lawyers.section,subdivision a requires an arbitrator to disclose anything that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of those facts to believe the arbitrator would not be impartial.contrary to plaintiffs claim,there is no requirement in either the code of civil procedure or the ethics standards for neutral arbitrators in contractual arbitration cal.rules of court,div.vi to disclose the lack of any such information,what plaintiffs call nondisclosures.
under section,subdivision a,if an arbitrator fails to make required disclosures under section,he must be disqualified if a party serves a notice of disqualification within days after any disclosure was due.here,plaintiffs did not serve a notice of disqualification.pursuant to section,subdivision c,plaintiffs failure to timely serve the notice waives disqualification unless the arbitrator makes a material omission or misrepresentation in his disclosure.
plaintiffs complain that because the arbitrator did not disclose the lack of any conflicts,they had no way of knowing whether there were any.but w hether an award is tainted by bias because an arbitrator failed to disclose a particular relationship is a factual determination made by the court reviewing the award.citation.the party claiming bias bears the burden of establishing facts supporting its position.citation.the test is objective,whether the relationship would create an impression of bias in the mind of a reasonable person.citation.reed mutual service th,d.
plaintiffs fail to point to anything in the record to show any bias based on failure to disclose.they rely merely on lack of disclosure without telling us what the arbitrator should have disclosed other than a disclosure that there was nothing to disclose.azteca construction,adr consulting,th,d,which plaintiffs cite,is inapt.there,the proposed arbitrator disclosed several relationships that potentially affected his neutrality.one of the parties timely filed a notice of disqualification on that basis.the arbitrator should have disqualified himself under section,subdivision b,which provides for disqualification under those circumstances,but failed to do so.such was not the case here.
the same is true for plaintiffs related claim about karla adams,a jams employee.adams was temporarily assigned to act as the arbitrator case manager.when jams learned adams former husband had previously worked for one of the parties,it assigned a different case manager and notified the parties.based on the jams administrative notes for the arbitration,it appears adams was assigned to the matter for less than one month and made only one entry during a nonactive period at the time the parties were waiting for the trial court ruling on the motion to compel arbitration of plaintiffs complaint.
within a week after jams sent the notice,plaintiffs lawyer sent a letter to jams containing a request to appoint another arbitrator.less than one week later,jams reconfirmed that judge smith would act as the arbitrator.
rule j of the jams streamlined rules provides that a t any time during the arbitration process,a party may challenge the continued service of an arbitrator for cause based upon information that was not available to the parties at the time the arbitrator was selected jams shall make the final determination on such challenge,and that decision shall be final.here,jams made its decision to keep judge smith as the arbitrator.the burden is on plaintiffs to show bias,and nothing in the record supports it.adams was only briefly assigned to the matter,and there is not a shred of evidence she had any influence on the arbitration proceedings at all.
in connection with these arguments,plaintiffs also attack the initial selection of judge smith as the arbitrator.however,their unilateral request for judge ryan and their failure to strike a name from the list of potential arbitrators were not in accordance with the procedure set out by the jams rules.and after jams notified plaintiffs counsel of the deficiency,he did not respond.
plaintiffs claim,without benefit of record references,that they were not represented by counsel at the time they received the original strike list from jams is irrelevant and not borne out by the record.moreover,although plaintiffs assert defendants agreed to judge ryan by failing to object to their request,nothing in the record shows a copy was sent to defendants.finally,once judge smith was appointed,plaintiffs did not object.there is no basis for vacating the award based on the selection of the arbitrator or the disclosure and disqualification process.
rulings and conduct of the arbitration 
plaintiffs challenge the arbitrator rulings on discovery and admission of evidence during the proceedings.although not clearly stated,we presume plaintiffs contend this is some kind of misconduct on the part of the arbitrator,subd.a.they complain,again without record references,that the arbitrator quashed subpoenas duces tecum whereby they were seeking financial records related to funds withheld by defendants and the accrued interest on those funds.in quashing the subpoenas,the arbitrator ruled the documents sought were not relevant because there was no issue as to the amount of funds.
here,the settlement agreement provided for discovery pursuant to section.under that section,arbitrators have great latitude and discretion when ruling on discovery matters,subd.b alexander blue cross of california th,d where discovery allowed by arbitration agreement,arbitrator does not exceed power even if discovery rulings incorrect.even had the arbitrator ruling been incorrect,which we do not and can not d
