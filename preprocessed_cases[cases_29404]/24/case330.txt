opinion of the court 
margaret uprichard,who received an arbitration award of plus prejudgment interest to be paid by her former employer appellee pfizer,appeals from the portion of the district court order requiring that she sign pfizer settlement and release agreement as a condition to enforcement of the arbitration award.at issue is whether a district court can impose such a requirement in the context of a.a proceeding.
in the late,uprichard was employed by the company as director of clinical research.merged with pfizer in the spring of,and uprichard title was changed from director of clinical research to local clinical leader.dissatisfied with her new position,uprichard submitted a constructive termination eligibility form,claiming a substantive change in job duties,and a request for severance benefits pursuant to enhanced severance plan esp.
a panel of three arbitrators of the american arbitration association found that uprichard had suffered constructive termination and directed pfizer to pay her severance benefits in the amount of.the arbitration award imposed no restrictions or conditions on the payment of the award,nor did it discuss the requirement of any settlement or waiver agreement.although the arbitration panel retained jurisdiction for days for purposes of resolving any dispute regarding esp benefits due under this award,app.at,neither party sought to have the award modified in any respect.
in march of,pfizer filed suit in the united states district court for the district of new jersey seeking to have the arbitration award vacated,claiming that the arbitration panel awarded relief that exceeded the authority afforded to it by the esp and the parties,and that such relief reflected manifest disregard for the law,the evidence and the intent of the esp drafters.app.at.pfizer did not include in its complaint a request to modify the arbitration award to include a requirement that uprichard sign a settlement or waiver agreement.
by order dated september,the district court i denied pfizer motion to vacate arbitration award,ii allowed uprichard to confirm arbitration award,iii denied uprichard for award of attorneys fees,iv dismissed pfizer verified complaint with prejudice,and v ordered that judgment be entered in favor of uprichard in the amount of plus interest from december.the district court did not discuss or require any settlement or waiver agreement as a condition of payment.
following the september,order,the parties stipulated that the amount of prejudgment interest to be paid to uprichard was.in a letter dated october,uprichard informed pfizer that she would not proceed with an appeal of the denial of her request for attorneys fees and would,upon receipt of payment of the arbitration award and prejudgment interest,sign and deliver an agreement that judgment had been satisfied.
by letter dated october,pfizer sent uprichard a prepared copy of its settlement and release agreement,which included confidentiality and requirements.moreover,the agreement provided that should uprichard violate either of these provisions,she would be required to repay to pfizer,as liquidated damages,all the money paid to her pursuant to the arbitration award the disputed provisions pfizer demanded that uprichard sign the settlement and release agreement,prepared by pfizer,as a condition to receiving her arbitrated award.following several telephone conversations between the parties discussing the disputed provisions,counsel for uprichard sent a letter to pfizer dated november,stating that although uprichard was willing to execute a release of any and all remaining claims she may have against pfizer in order to expedite payment of the judgment she obtained,app.at,she was not willing to sign the specific release proposed by pfizer because she claimed that it contained a number of provisions that went well beyond a general release id.uprichard attached to the november,letter,a signed and notarized general release,containing none of the disputed provisions.in subsequent correspondence,pfizer refused to accept the release offered by uprichard.
when it became clear that no agreement would be reached on the voluntary payment of the severance award,on march,uprichard filed a motion pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a to correct judgment with the district court to include the interest previously agreed upon.the docket entry accompanying the september,order inadvertently failed to reflect the district court grant of interest in uprichard favor,stating only judgment entered in the sum of in favor of deft margaret uprichard and agst pltf pfizer,app.at.although pfizer did not dispute uprichard entitlement to interest,it did claim in response that uprichard was required by the esp to sign a standard release form acceptable to pfizer as a condition to receiving her arbitrated award.
both parties consented to have a magistrate judge hear the matter pursuant to c,a hearing was held on april.by order dated april,the magistrate judge corrected the docket sheet to include in prejudgment interest,and imposed the requirement that uprichard sign pfizer settlement and release agreement as a condition to receiving her money judgment.the second paragraph of that order states 
the court finds the release form required by the plaintiff prior to the payout of monies to the defendant is objectively reasonable.plaintiff shall not be required to pay over any monies to the defendant until such time as that release has been signed.
uprichard filed a timely notice of appeal from the magistrate judge order,arguing that because the settlement agreement requirement was addressed in the context of a.a motion to correct judgment,the magistrate judge exceeded his authority by substantively amending the september,order of the district court.
jurisdiction 
the district court had diversity jurisdiction under pfizer argues that we lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal because the notice of appeal was untimely.specifically,pfizer claims that uprichard obligation to sign pfizer settlement and release agreement was inherent in the district court september,order confirming the arbitration award,and therefore,that the period to appeal this obligation,under fed,began to run as of september.thus,according to pfizer,uprichard may,notice of appeal,although styled as an appeal from the magistrate judge april,order,was actually an appeal from the district court september,order,and therefore untimely.we reject this argument.
pfizer claim that the settlement agreement requirement was inherent in the district court september order finds no basis in the record or relevant case law.neither the december,arbitration award nor the september,order of the district court,confirming the arbitration award,contained any reference to a settlement and release agreement,much less required that one be signed as a condition to obtaining the award.pfizer cites no case law even suggesting that a finding of substantive right namely the requirement of a settlement agreement is made implicit or inherent in a court holding when the court neither addresses the issue or was even aware of its existence.
furthermore,uprichard was provided a copy pfizer settlement agreement for the first time,by letter dated october,two weeks after the district court september order,and it is undisputed that the settlement agreement issue was adjudicated for the first time in connection with uprichard rule a motion to correct judgment 
therefore,we hold that uprichard notice of appeal is from the magistrate judge april,order,and not from the district court september,order because this notice of appeal was filed within thirty days of the magistrate judge order,it was timely and we have jurisdiction under c 
b.did the magistrate judge april,order exceed his authority 
ordinarily,we review a district court decision to grant or deny a.a motion for an abuse of discretion.perez cucci,cir we review the denial of the city rule a motion to determine whether the trial court action was arbitrary,fanciful or clearly unreasonable.otherwise stated the city must show that no reasonable person would concur in the trial court assessment of the issue under
