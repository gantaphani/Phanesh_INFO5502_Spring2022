a subscriber to services offered by a satellite television programming company filed a class action lawsuit against the company,alleging it covertly degraded some of its high definition television transmissions.the company moved to compel arbitration under the arbitration clause in its customer agreement with the subscriber,which prohibited class litigation of claims in arbitration.the trial court denied the motion and the company timely appealed.we affirm the trial court order refusing to compel arbitration because the prohibition on class litigation in the arbitration clause is unconscionable and unenforceable.
factual and procedural background 
directv broadcasts satellite television programming to homes.phillip cohen began receiving basic services from directv in february.with his first bill he received the customer agreement then in effect.although that agreement contained no arbitration clause,its change of terms clause allowed directv to unilaterally modify the agreement.two months later,along with his april,monthly bill,cohen received an amended customer agreement containing an arbitration clause.
approximately six years later,in july,cohen upgraded to directv high definition television hdtv programming,which provides better image quality than its standard programming.directv customers were required to pay additional monthly fees of and buy additional equipment costing,in some cases,more than.
cohen asserts that,in september,directv degraded some of its hdtv channels by switching them to a lower,resolution five channels were affected,hdnet movies,hdtv pay per view,bravohd,and showtime hd.directv also reduced bandwidth on some channels 
a month later,in october,directv sent cohen a revision to its customer agreement the revision included changes to the arbitration clause which prohibited the joinder or class litigation of claims in arbitration 
cohen filed a suit against directv in november.in his first cause of action,cohen alleged violation of the california consumers legal remedies act clra,et he alleged directv violated the clra and damaged its hdtv customers by broadcasting a signal,contrary to its advertisements.cohen sought damages for the costs of equipment and monthly subscription fees,restitution,an injunction preventing directv from representing its channels as hdtv,punitive damages,and reasonable attorney fees.in a second cause of action under business and professions code section,cohen alleged directv conduct constituted unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business practices,and sought an injunction and restitution.
directv moved to compel arbitration cohen opposition argued the arbitration clause was unenforceable because directv unilateral addition of an arbitration clause in april did not result in a binding agreement to arbitrate,and the ban on class litigation of claims in arbitration was unconscionable.the trial court denied directv motion,concluding the arbitration clause was procedurally and substantively unconscionable,against public policy and unenforceable.specifically,the court found,inter alia 
the arbitration clause was procedurally unconscionable because directv unilaterally inserted the original arbitration clause in its customer agreement in april,notifying cohen by including the amended agreement with his monthly bill,and informing him he could accept it or cancel his service.citing badie bank of america th,d,the court concluded directv added an entirely new term,not addressed in or contemplated by the original customer agreement,and that an arbitration clause included in a bill stuffer was not a legitimate method to revoke cohen constitutional right to a jury trial 
the arbitration clause was substantively unconscionable under principles announced in discover bank superior court cal th,d,discover bank,which held that a class action waiver in a consumer contract of adhesion was,under the circumstances of that case,unconscionable and unenforceable.
directv filed a timely appeal from the trial court order.
discussion 
we agree with the trial court that the provision in the arbitration clause prohibiting class or representative claims in arbitration class action waiver is unconscionable and unenforceable.because directv customer agreement expressly prohibits the severance of the class action waiver from the remainder of the arbitration clause,the entire arbitration clause is unenforceable.
we begin our analysis with the principles announced by the supreme court in discover bank,supra,cal th,d.before turning to that case,however,several preliminary comments on matters raised by the parties are in order.
first,directv argues at length that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to rule on the enforceability of the class action waiver,because it found that cohen did not agree to the arbitration clause that directv unilaterally added to cohen customer agreement in.according to directv,because the court in effect concluded no agreement to arbitrate was formed in the first instance,it should have ended its analysis and denied directv motion to compel arbitration on that basis.the court further ruling on the unenforceability of the class action waiver was an advisory opinion on a hypothetical issue in a dispute,and for that reason should be reversed by this court.we find directv argument both puzzling and without legal basis.it is perplexing because directv contends the trial court was wrong to find no agreement to arbitrate was formed,and asks this court to hold the parties did agree to arbitrate their disputes.if they did agree to arbitrate,the enforceability of the clause,including its class action waiver,would necessarily be directly at issue.moreover,the trial court did not analyze the matter in terms of whether a contract to arbitrate was formed in the first instance.rather,it expressly found that the agreement was procedurally unconscionable because of directv unilateral insertion of the original arbitration clause in a bill stuffer.in any event,there is no legal merit to the claim that the enforceability of the class action waiver is a purely hypothetical and dispute.the issue was directly presented to the trial court in cohen opposition to directv motion to compel arbitration.directv can not seek enforcement of an arbitration clause with a class action waiver and at the same time contend the court has no jurisdiction to rule on the enforceability of that clause.nothing was hypothetical about the trial court ruling.
second,the validity and unconscionability of an arbitration agreement are matters of law subject to de novo review where,as here,no material facts are in dispute.fittante palm springs motors,th,d.moreover,if a trial court order is correct on any applicable theory of law,the order will be affirmed regardless of the basis for the trial court conclusion,as we review the correctness of the order,not the reasons given for the order.estate of beard th,d.because we conclude the class action waiver is unenforceable,and because it can not be severed from the arbitration clause,we need not and do not decide whether the parties formed a valid agreement to arbitrate in,when directv first amended its customer agreement to include an arbitration clause,or whether cohen effectively ratified the arbitration clause by continuing to use directv programming services for the ensuing seven years 
we turn now to the principles governing the enforceability of the class action waiver in directv customer agreement,as established in discover bank,and then apply those principles to this case.
discover bank superior court 
in discover bank,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court began its analysis by reviewing the justifications for class action lawsuits and the important role of class action remedies under california law in deterring and redressing wrongdoing,beginning years ago with justice mosk opinion in vasquez superior court cal d,and concluding with the supreme court endorsement of classwide arbitration in keating superior court cal d,authorizing classwide arbitration in a case where the arbitration clause was silent on the issue discover bank,supra,cal th at,d.the court then turned to the question whether a class action waiver might be unenforceable as contrary to public policy or unconscionable,and quoted at length from a court of appeal case involving an arbitration clause and a class action waiver virtually identical id.at,d,to the waiver before the court in discover bank 
the class action waiver provision is clearly meant to prevent customers from seeking redress for relatively small amounts of money fully aware that few customers will go to the time and trouble of suing in small claims court,the bank has instead sought to create for itself virtual immunity from class or representative actions despite their potential merit,while suffering no similar detriment to its own rights.the clause is not only harsh and unfair to bank customers who might be owed a relatively small sum of money,but it also serves as a disincentive for the bank to avoid the type of conduct that might lead to class action litigation in the first place.by imposing this clause on its customers,the bank has essentially granted itself a license to push the boundaries of good business practices to their furthest limits,fully aware that relatively few,if any,customers will seek legal remedies,and that any remedies obtained will only pertain to that single customer without collateral estoppel effect this is not only substantively unconscionable,it violates public policy by granting the bank a get out of jail free card while compromising important consumer rights.discover bank,supra,cal th at,d,quoting szetela discover bank th,d szetela.
turning to the dispute before it,discover bank recapitulated the principles of unconscionability,noting its procedural and substantive elements.the procedural element focuses on oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,and generally takes the form of a contract of adhesion.discover bank,supra,cal th at,d.the substantive element focuses on overly harsh or results,with substantively unconscionable terms generally described as unfairly,citation omitted.the court then agree d that at least some class action waivers in consumer contracts are unconscionable under california law.the court explained that 
when a consumer is given an amendment to a customer agreement in the form of a bill stuffer that he would be deemed to accept if he did not close his account,an element of procedural unconscionability is present.ibid.
while adhesive contracts are generally enforced,class action waivers found in those contracts may also be substantively unconscionable inasmuch as they may operate effectively as exculpatory contract clauses that are contrary to public policy.id.at,d.
class action waivers are not,in the abstract,exculpatory clauses.however,because damages in consumer cases are often small,and because the wrongful exaction of a dollar from each of millions of customers will result in a handsome profit,the class action is often the only effective way to halt and redress such exploitation.id.at,d,citation omitted.
class action waivers are indisputably,as credit card companies typically do not sue their customers in class action lawsuits,quoting szetela,supra,th at,d.
such,exculpatory contracts in a contract of adhesion,at least to the extent they operate to insulate a party from liability that otherwise would be imposed under california law,are generally unconscionable.id.at,d.
the court summarized 
we do not hold that all class action waivers are necessarily unconscionable.but when the waiver is found in a consumer contract of adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages,and when it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money,then,at least to the extent the obligation at issue is governed by california law,the waiver becomes in practice the exemption of the party from responsibility for its own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another.under these circumstances,such waivers are unconscionable under california law and should not be enforced.discover bank,supra,cal th at,d.
application of discover bank principles to the class action waiver in directv customer agreement.
discover bank elucidated a set of circumstances under which class action waivers are unconscionable and unenforceable.while it did not hold that all class action waivers are necessarily unconscionable,neither did it hold that class action waivers are unconscionable only in the circumstances it described.the question for this court is how closely directv class action waiver approximates the circumstances described in discover bank and,to the extent the circumstances are different,whether they nonetheless require a conclusion the class action waiver is unconscionable.
the circumstances surrounding directv class action waiver provision are comparable to those described in discover bank.
we conclude that the class action waiver found in directv customer agreement meets the indicia identified in discover bank,such that the waiver in practice has the potential effect of exempti ng directv from responsibility for its own fraud,or willful injury to the person or property of another.discover bank,supra,cal th at,d,quoting.
first,directv customer agreement is a consumer contract of adhesion.discover bank,supra,cal th at,d.as in discover bank,cohen was given an amendment to his customer agreement in the form of a bill stuffer id.at,d.likewise,he was deemed to accept it if he did not close his account ibid.
second,customer agreements with television programming providers,like other consumer contracts of adhesion,necessarily occur in a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages discover bank,supra,cal th at,d.the fees for the services cohen asserts are compromised or degraded by directv are a month.directv customer agreements,like the cardholder contracts in discover bank or other contracts under which consumers are provided with continuing services for monthly fees,are replete with examples of fees in small amounts,where potential disputes between the provider and the customer would necessarily involve small amounts of damages ibid.
directv asserts that the individual stakes are higher in this case,because the damages cohen alleged included,in addition to the monthly fee,the cost for the decoder box the consumer must purchase in order to receive directv high definition expense amounting,in some instances,to more than.we are not persuaded that this additional element of damages in any way affects the foundational premise that directv class action waiver occurs in a setting where disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages.while is not an insignificant sum,many consumers of services such as those offered by directv may not view that amount as sufficient to warrant individual litigation,and certainly it is not sufficient to obtain legal assistance in prosecuting the claim.discover bank,supra,cal th at,d,citations omitted.in short,the class action device remains,in our view,the only practicable way for consumers of services such as directv to deter and redress wrongdoing of the type cohen alleges.damages that may or may not exceed do not take directv class action waiver outside a setting in which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages id.at,d.
third,a class action waiver is unconscionable under discover bank indicia when,along with the two criteria discussed above,it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money discover bank,supra,cal th at,d.in this case,cohen alleged directv,after representing its package would provide astonishing picture clarity consistent with specified standards and bandwidth,reduced its hdtv transmission quality by percent to levels.directv points out cohen alleged no hidden charges or undisclosed costs,and his complaint showed he noticed the drastic reduction of image quality according to dir
