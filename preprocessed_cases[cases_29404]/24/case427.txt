appellants friedman,american bankers insurance company of florida,and american bankers life assurance company of florida collectively friedman brought an action against appellee james dunlap under the federal arbitration act,see west,to compel arbitration of dunlap state court claims against friedman.the district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the amount in controversy did not satisfy the threshold for federal diversity jurisdiction.see a west supp.we agree this action should be dismissed on jurisdictional grounds,but on slightly different reasoning.
james dunlap financed a ring for purchase in the amount of from friedman,a jewelry company.dunlap alleges that as part of the transaction he was required to sign a retail installment contract that included,without dunlap knowledge,additional charges for credit life,credit disability property insurance,and that these insurance products were provided by american bankers insurance company of florida abicf and american bankers life assurance company of florida ablacf.he filed an action in west virginia state court against friedman,four employees of friedman,and these insurance companies,alleging various claims under state law and seeking actual and punitive damages 
the retail installment contract contained an arbitration clause that purported to eliminate punitive damages 
alternative dispute resolution all disputes,controversies or claims of any kind or nature between buyer and seller,arising out of or in connection with the sale of goods financed or refinanced pursuant to the terms of this agreement,or with respect to negotiation of,inducement to enter into,construction of,performance of,enforcement of,or breach of,effort to collect the debt evidenced by,the applicability of the arbitration clause in,or the validity of this agreement shall be resolved by arbitration in the state in which this agreement is entered into in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association,and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof no arbitrator may make an award of punitive damages.
based on this arbitration clause,the defendants in the west virginia state court action moved for the state court to order arbitration.dunlap contended that he never agreed to the arbitration provision in the installment sales contract.the defendants urged the state court to order arbitration based,at least in part,on the federal arbitration act.
while that motion and dunlap underlying claims were pending in state court,friedman brought this action in district court to compel arbitration of dunlap claims pursuant to the federal arbitration act.see.dunlap raised in federal court the same defense to the arbitration clause that he raised in state court,and the parties agree that the federal arbitration act applies in both the state and federal actions.
dunlap moved to dismiss friedman federal action to compel arbitration for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,arguing that the action did not meet the amount in controversy requirement for federal jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship.see a the district court granted dunlap motion and dismissed the action to compel arbitration.focusing on the bar to punitive damages contained in the arbitration clause,the district court concluded that the arbitrator would be limited to awarding an amount for actual damages and statutory penalties.the district court found that the possible award that might reasonably result from arbitration,were the petition granted,will not exceed eight thousand dollars.thus,the district court held that friedman,abicf and ablacf failed to bring forward competent proof to satisfy their burden that the amount in controversy with regard to dunlap claims,which might reasonably be awarded in the arbitration that they seek,exceeds.less than two weeks after the district court entered its order of dismissal,the west virginia state court granted friedman motion to compel arbitration.friedman,abicf and ablacf now appeal the district court dismissal of the action to compel arbitration under the federal arbitration act.
the district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the amount in controversy failed to reach the threshold to federal court.we also conclude that federal jurisdiction is lacking,but we need not reach the amount in controversy issue in coming to this conclusion inasmuch as another jurisdictional defect exists 
despite getting in state court what it is now seeking in federal order that dunlap underlying claims be submitted to still insists that we can and should permit his federal lawsuit to continue.indeed,friedman argued to the state court that it was required by the federal arbitration act to enforce the arbitration clause and order the parties to arbitration on dunlap claims,which is all that friedman argues in federal court friedman argues that the federal action should continue because dunlap has appealed the state court order to arbitrate to the west virginia supreme court of appeals.in other words,friedman is hedging its bets it wants a federal order compelling arbitration at the ready in case the west virginia supreme court of appeals decides that dunlap claims are not subject to arbitration and reverses the decision of the lower state court.
that is not something we can do under the doctrine.although the doctrine was not discussed by the parties,it too is a jurisdictional doctrine that may be raised by the court sua sponte,see jordahl democratic party of,cir,and may be considered for the first time on appeal,see plyler moore,cir.because the doctrine is jurisdictional,we are obliged to address it before proceeding further in our analysis.see stanton district of columbia court of appeals,because it is jurisdictional,we first consider the doctrine emphasis added neal wilson,cir explaining that to the extent that any portion of the complaint survived the jurisdictional bar of the doctrine,the district court correctly ruled that younger abstention was warranted.
the doctrine generally prohibits lower federal courts from reviewing state court decisions rather,jurisdiction to review such decisions lies exclusively with superior state courts and,ultimately,the united states supreme court.plyler,at.under the doctrine,lower federal courts may not consider either issues actually presented to and decided by a state court or constitutional claims that are inextricably intertwined with questions ruled upon by a state court.id.internal quotation marks omitted.federal courts are divested of jurisdiction where entertaining the federal claim should be the equivalent of an appellate review of the state court order.jordahl,at alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.applies when the federal action essentially amounts to nothing more than an attempt to seek review of the state court decision by a lower federal court.plyler,at.thus,when a party sues in federal district court to readjudicate the same issues decided in the state court proceedings,that action is in essence an attempt to obtain direct review of the state court decision in contravention of.brown root,at.the label attached to the federal court action will rarely,if ever,be important,since a party that is seeking in federal court to readjudicate an issue decided in state court is unlikely to say so.
the doctrine is premised largely upon a,which t he doctrine interprets as ordinarily barring direct review in the lower federal courts of a decision reached by the highest state court.asarco,kadish,d emphasis added.however,we view the doctrine to also preclude review of adjudications by lower state courts as well.see jordahl,at t he doctrine precludes not only review of adjudications of the state highest court,but also the decisions of its lower courts.thus,the fact that the decision of a state court is winding its way through the state appellate system does not subject it to federal review in the meantime.see id.at the doctrine is in no way dependent upon the temporal procedural posture of the state court judgment.
