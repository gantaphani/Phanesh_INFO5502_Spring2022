introduction 
health net of california,and health net,collectively health net appeal from an order denying their motion to compel arbitration of a complaint brought against them by eva robertson robertson,a health net plan subscriber.we conclude the trial court correctly denied the motion finding that health net failed to comply with health and safety code section,which requires arbitration clauses in health care plans to be prominently displayed,and to be placed immediately before the signature line provided for the subscriber signature on the enrollment form,subds.b d.accordingly,we affirm the court order.
factual and procedural background 
health net issued a health services agreement to the bay area chamber of commerce effective january.this coverage was made available to members of various bay area chambers of commerce,including the danville chamber of commerce,to which robertson belonged.on november,robertson enrolled in the plan.however,shortly after enrolling robertson received a memorandum from the chamber indicating that her health plan was being cancelled.
in response to the cancellation,robertson filed a lawsuit against health net claiming breach of contract,breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,fraud,unfair competition,and violation of the consumer legal remedies act,et before answering robertson complaint,health net filed a motion to compel arbitration.according to health net,robertson agreed to binding arbitration as the sole method for resolving any disputes between herself and the health plan provider.
to support its motion,health net attached a copy of robertson enrollment form,which included the claimed arbitration agreement the agreement is located on the second page of the enrollment form and is contained within a section entitled acceptance of coverage.it is the third paragraph within that section,and is only separated from the other paragraphs by a bolded subheading entitled arbitration agreement and an extra space added before and after the first and last sentences.other than the subheading,the entire agreement is printed in the same font and size as every other paragraph of that section.
additionally,three other paragraphs follow the text of the arbitration agreement on the enrollment form.the first consists of a notice concerning california prohibition against requiring hiv testing as a condition of obtaining insurance.the second is an advisement concerning the penalties for presentation of fraudulent claims.the last paragraph,located directly before the signature line,informs the enrollee that by signing the form he or she acknowledges having read and understood all of the plan agreements,including the binding arbitration agreement a copy of the second page of a blank health net enrollment form is attached to this opinion as appendix 
robertson opposed the motion to compel arbitration,claiming that health net agreement was unenforceable because it did not comply with section was unconscionable and unlawfully required robertson to submit certain statutory claim to arbitration.
on june,the san francisco county superior court issued an order denying health net motion to compel arbitration.the trial court ruled that health net arbitration clause was unenforceable because it failed to meet two of the mandatory display requirements set forth in section first,the agreement failed to comply with section,subdivision d,which requires a health plan to display its arbitration agreement immediately before the signature line provided for the enrollee on the enrollment form.in this regard,the court noted and it is true that the disclosure is before the signature line but it not immediately before the signature line,it close.
second,the court held that health net did not comply with section,subdivision b,which requires a health plan to prominently display its arbitration agreement on the plan enrollment form.the court found that health net arbitration agreement did not stand out the disclosure is not prominently displayed.you can hardly read it.it there,i concede that but it in the same type,same everything.it simply runs with all the other boilerplate there.later during the hearing,the court observed that the agreement was simply one part of an unending flow of typography t he arbitration agreement is simply part of an unending flow of typography.it does stand out.in fact,one way to do it is just give that to somebody at a slight distance where they ca quite read it and say which part is sticking out.you ca.virtually,it undistinguishable.
it is from this order that health net filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
there is no uniform standard of review for evaluating an order denying a motion to compel arbitration.norcal mutual ins.newton th,d norcal.if the court order is based on a decision of fact,then we adopt a substantial evidence standard.see,craig brown root,th,d finding substantial evidence that parties had in fact reached agreement to arbitrate and thus court order compelling arbitration was affirmed see also engineers architects community development th,d.alternatively,if the court denial rests solely on a decision of law,then a de novo standard of review is employed.see,norcal,supra,at,d ordering parties to arbitrate after independently coming to legal conclusion that parties dispute was covered by arbitration agreement see also metalclad ventana environmental organizational partnership th,d.in this case,the denial was based solely on the court conclusion that health net arbitration agreement failed to comply with two of the mandatory display requirements of section and was thus unenforceable.
accordingly,we review the superior court order de novo.see whaley sony computer entertainment america,th,d.it is well settled that the interpretation and application of a statutory scheme presents a pure question of law and is subject to independent review by the courts of appeal.city of san diego dunkl th,d.under this standard,we undertake our own interpretation of the determinative statute and assess any claims raised by the parties completely anew.
interpretation of section,subdivision d 
when interpreting the meaning of a statute our primary goal is to determine and effectuate the legislature intent.in re marriage of bonds cal th,d,d statutes.to ascertain this intent we look first to the words used in the statute,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.trope katz cal th,d,in re marriage of hobdy th,d under the plain meaning rule,courts seek to give the words employed by the legislature their usual and ordinary meaning.we do so because the legislature is presumed to have meant exactly what it said.in re dannenberg cal th,d.only when the words of a statute are inherently ambiguous or there appears to be some other reason to depart from the plain meaning rule when using the plain meaning rule would lead to absurd results will we look to other indicia of legislative intent.wilcox birtwhistle cal th,d,d,supra,statutes,at,see also singer,statutes and statutory construction ed.literal interpretation,at.
section,subdivision d directs a health plan to place its arbitration agreement immediately before the signature line provided for the individual enrolling in the health care service plan.it is hard to imagine that the legislature directive to health care plan providers could have been clearer.in plain and ordinary language,immediately before means that the arbitration agreement must be typed in directly before the signature line provided for the individual on the enrollment form without any intervening language.
this plain meaning interpretation is consistent with the most authoritative and recognized published english language dictionaries.for example,the venerable oxford english dictionary defines immediately as w ithout intermediary,intervening agency,or medium by direct agency in direct or proximate connexion or relation so as to concern,interest,or affect directly,or intimately directly.as of,furthermore,the american heritage dictionary college ed,the dictionary commonly issued to members of this court,defines it as.without delay.with no intermediary directly.not surprisingly,several other diction
