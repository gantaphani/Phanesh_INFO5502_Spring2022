the expedited appeal in this diversity case concerns an million surety bond issued by american home assurance american home to secure performance under a construction contract pursuant to which bechtel power bechtel is building an innovative facility for the owner,choctaw generation limited partnership choctaw.provisional acceptance of the facility has been long delayed for reasons that are the subject of a good faith dispute bechtel attributes the delay to force majeure choctaw disagrees,and is claiming liquidated damages in an ongoing arbitration proceeding with bechtel pursuant to the arbitration clause of the construction contract.to obtain payment of the liquidated damages pending the outcome of the arbitration,choctaw drew down in full a million letter of credit that the construction contract required bechtel to post.the present dispute has to do with choctaw pursuant to a provision of the construction american home as surety replenish the letter of credit as necessary until the full million is drawn down to fund the rapidly accruing liquidated damages.
after the million was drawn down and choctaw replenishment demand was made and rejected by american home,choctaw commenced this action seeking a preliminary injunction to compel serial replenishment of the letter of credit by american home.the united states district court for the southern district of new york cote,j,acting with extraordinary expedition and thoroughness,conducted a hearing and issued a seventy page ruling from the bench.the district court 
a mandated that american home replenish the letter of credit on the ground in a nutshell that the construction contract required replenishment by the surety notwithstanding the existence of a good faith dispute between builder and owner concerning whether liquidated damages are payable 
b refused to order choctaw to arbitrate its surety dispute with american home,on the ground that the surety contract signed by american home does not contain an arbitration clause and that american home did not sign the construction contract which does and 
c denied a stay.
after a panel of this court likewise denied american home motion for a stay,bechtel as principal replenished the letter of credit.
as of the date of oral argument,almost all of the million had been drawn down,and it was anticipated that the whole million would be drawn down shortly.this expedited appeal,however,is saved from mootness by the availability of an order directing that choctaw make repayment,which would affect american home rights and duties as surety.
among the defenses to this action asserted by american home is that the present dispute is subject to arbitration.the surety contract contains no arbitration clause so the decisive question on this appeal is whether surety american home can compel choctaw to arbitrate the present controversy over the surety contract under or by virtue of the arbitration clause of the construction contract to which choctaw is a signatory and american home is not.we conclude that this controversy is arbitrable because choctaw agreed that controversies that are unable to be resolved pursuant to the construction contract shall be settled by arbitration,and because under our case law choctaw,as signatory,is estopped from avoiding arbitration with a when the issues the nonsignatory is seeking to resolve in arbitration are intertwined with the agreement that the estopped party has signed.cogeneration.partnership,smith cogeneration int l,cir,american arbitration ass n,cir.we further conclude that arbitration is not foreclosed by a term of the construction contract that allows the remedy of specific performance,and reject choctaw argument that this term authorizes it to seek specific remedies in court notwithstanding the arbitration clause.
we therefore do not reach the many substantive and procedural issues addressed in the district court careful and comprehensive opinion.we vacate that judgment solely to clear the way for rulings on the merits in arbitration,and we remand for the framing of an order directing arbitration.
bechtel and choctaw entered into a series of contracts,dated june,referred to collectively hereinafter as the construction contract,under which bechtel agreed to provide engineering,procurement and construction services to choctaw.in certain stated respects,bechtel performance under the construction contract was secured by a performance and payment bond bond issued by american home.the bond contains no arbitration clause,but the construction contract,which does,is referred to in the bond and made a part of the bond as if fully set forth therein.the arbitration clause in the construction contract provides in article that i f any dispute arises on matters concerning this contract,either party may initiate the dispute resolution procedures of this article by notice.the word party is a defined term that includes only choctaw and bechtel.the article procedures provide that disputes that remain unresolved after mandatory negotiations are to be resolved by binding arbitration subject to the construction industry rules of the american arbitration association aaa,with each party selecting one arbitrator and the third selected by the two or if necessary,in accordance with procedures of the aaa.the procedural wording is set forth in the margin 
there are other provisions of the construction contract in dispute between and among the parties,and there are disputes concerning the structure and architecture of the construction contract as a whole that may bear upon the merits of these controversies.
american home argued in the district court that choctaw claims against it were subject to arbitration on two theories a under the bond,because the bond incorporates by reference the terms of the construction contract,including the arbitration clause and b under the construction contract,because choctaw as signatory is estopped from avoiding arbitration of a dispute with a such as american home where the has a close relationship with the parties bound to arbitrate,where the dispute concerns that relationship,and where the dispute is closely linked to a dispute that is subject to arbitration in the underlying contract.appellant brief at.
as to choctaw duty to arbitrate a under the bond,the district court ruled that,e ven as incorporated into the b ond,the contract arbitration clause still pertains solely to disputes between choctaw and bechtel because the contract wording compels arbitration only between the parties,a contractually defined term that does not include american home.we do not review judge cote conclusion on this point,because we decide this appeal on the ground that arbitration is mandated under b the alternative theory of arbitrability pressed by american home.
as to choctaw obligation to arbitrate with american home under the construction contract,the district court ruled that a party such as choctaw can not be estopped from denying the existence of an arbitration clause to which it is a signatory where no such clause exists.this sound observation seemingly misapprehends the precise argument advanced by american home.
in,at,this court classified five theories,including estoppel,under which a signatory can compel a to of them applicable here because among other things in this case it is the that seeks to invoke the arbitration clause.as added,however,s everal courts of appeal have recognized an alternative estoppel theory requiring arbitration between a signatory and nonsignatory.citations omitted.at.those courts looked to the relationships of persons,wrongs and issues,in particular whether the claims that the nonsignatory sought to arbitrate were intimately founded in and intertwined with the underlying contract obligations.at quoting sunkist soft drinks,sunkist growers,cir mcbro planning dev.triangle constr,cir.in this way,the circuits have been willing to estop a signatory from avoiding arbitration with a nonsignatory when the issues the nonsignatory is seeking to resolve in arbitration are intertwined with the agreement that the estopped party has signed.id.at.the fact scenario in offered no occasion to apply or reject this principle,because the claims in were not integrally related to the contract containing the arbitration clause.id.
in a later case,however,this court did apply that reasoning to compel a party that signed a contract containing an arbitration clause to arbitrate with a.thus in,at,after reprising the analysis in,we carefully reviewed the relationship among the parties,the contracts they signed or did not,and the issues that had arisen,to arrive at the conclusion that the controversy was arbitrable at the behest of the.we think that the present controversy is of the kind that justified arbitration in,but that such a conclusion requires careful justification.
the controversy between choctaw and american home under the bond could hardly be more closely bound to the dispute now in arbitration between choctaw and bechtel under the construction contract.the surety contract incorporates by reference the underlying construction contract.and the present dispute concerns the duty to replenish a letter of credit maintained under the construction contract,and requires a ruling as to whether that duty is independent of certain others in the context of the construction contract as a whole.
the tight relatedness of the parties,contracts and controversies is easily demonstrated by a necessarily tedious review of the contract terms in dispute between and among the parties,and the parties competing analyses of them.the underlying dispute between bechtel and choctaw entitlement to liquidated now in the early stages of arbitration,and entails the construing of a dozen provisions of the construction contract.the immediate dispute in this action between choctaw and american whether choctaw can compel immediate replenishment of the letter of credit to fund the liquidated upon many of the same provisions.the disputed provisions of the construction contract are set forth in the appendix to this opinion.
the construction contract requires bechtel to post a letter of credit,which choctaw can draw upon for among other things liquidated damages,and provides for initial funding,to be augmented over time,and to be replenished within days of any draw.
choctaw concedes that a good faith dispute exists as to whether the delays in provisional acceptance of the power plant are attributable to force majeure,but argues that liquidated damages are accruing nevertheless.that is because the original contract date for provisional acceptance has passed,and though the contract gives bechtel a right to tender a change order for more time,the contract provides that choctaw has no obligation to accept the change order.
having thus established to its satisfaction that liquidated damages are accruing,choctaw invoked its contract right to draw on the letter of credit for payment,bechtel contract obligation to replenish the letter of credit days after it is drawn down,and american home duty under the bond to replenish if bechtel fails to do so.according to choctaw,bechtel is adequately and expressly protected because any draw thus made in error is subject to refund at a stipulated rate of interest.thus,according to choctaw,the bond operates inter alia to pay liquidated damages pendente lite in order to protect choctaw credit and cover its losses to suppliers and others,and does not depend on any ultimate determination concerning force majeure.
american home presumably bechtel position in the that since choctaw and bechtel have stipulated that there is a bona fide dispute as to whether the delay in provisional acceptance is being caused by force majeure,there is no duty to replenish the letter of credit.the sections of the construction contract that american home invokes provide a that to the extent delay is caused by force majeure,bechtel shall give choctaw written notice of the onset date,and t he project schedule shall be extended on a basis,and b that bechtel unremedied failure to pay required payments is an event of default only if such payments are not the subject of a good faith dispute pursuant to the arbitration clause.in short,it is american home and presumably bechtel position that choctaw drawing down of the letter of credit was an act in breach of the construction contract that the draw down therefore can trigger no enforceable contract right to replenishment that would merely facilitate choctaw further breaches and that the approximately million already drawn down should be promptly refunded with interest.
in short,the controversy presented on this appeal is linked textually to the construction contract,and its merits are bound up with the dispute now being arbitrated between choctaw and bechtel.moreover,as a result of the district court injunction,and this court refusal to stay it,replenishment has already occurred in whole or in overwhelming part.the bone of contention now has become whether choctaw should return funds it has drawn down with interest,as provided in section of the construction contract.additionally,bechtel elected to fund the replenishment itself as principal rather than allow american home to do so in compliance with the district court injunction.
so the present controversy over who shall hold funds is essentially an aspect of the same controversy now in arbitration between the two signatories to the construction contract.because the operation of the injunction has altered matters in such a way as to reinforce and draw closer the linkage between the litigated controversy and the construction contract,we need not decide whether the district court erred in refusing to order arbitration it is enough for us to rule that an order of arbitration is now clearly appropriate.
choctaw argued in the district court that its claim in this home specific performance of a duty to replenish the letter of credit if bechtel defaults on its duty to do in any event not arbitrable because section of the construction contract provides that in the event of a breach,the party,at its discretion,may take one or more of the following actions 
proceed against the defaulting party pursuant to article the arbitration clause 
seek specific performance of the defaulting party obligations under this contract to the extent permitted by law or 
terminate this contract.
emphasis added.
choctaw argues that this wording allows it to elect specific performance in a court of law,and breaks any linkage between the dispute on appeal and its contract obligation to arbitrate.the district court agreed,reasoning that there would be no point to section if all it did was single out one form of relief that would in any event be available in arbitration.
american home demonstrates that there is good reason for section within the context of arbitration to assure that specific performance is a remedy available to the arbitrators.article provides that a rbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the construction industry rules of the american arbitration association other than as specifically modified herein.those rules in turn empower the arbitral panel to grant any remedy or relief deemed just and equitable and within the scope of the agreement of the parties,including but not limited to,equitable relief and specific performance.rule emphasis added.choctaw reads rule to say that specific performance is a remedy already expressly granted but we think that prudent lawyers could read rule as uncertain on this point,and in need of unambiguous contractual reenforcement.
in any event,the district court reading would seem to place beyond the scope of arbitration the election by a party asserting default to terminate the contract altogether,a reading that essentially nullifies the otherwise broad gauge and detailed arbitration clause.we thus conclude that section is not an obstacle to arbitration in this case.presumably,that is something for the arbitrators to determine if it is found to bear on the controversy.
finally,choctaw argues that the provisions of the construction contract can not mitigate american home obligation to replenish because the construction contract provides that it is not for the benefit of any third party.the meaning and effect of that provision as well we leave to the arbitrators,except to o
