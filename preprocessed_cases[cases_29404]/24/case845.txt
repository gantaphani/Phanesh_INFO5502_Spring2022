in may,marken gannon applied for employment with circuit city stores,in ellisville,missouri.as a prerequisite to her employment,circuit city presented gannon with its dispute resolution agreement for her to sign.the agreement provided that gannon agreed to settle all claims against circuit city exclusively through binding arbitration.the agreement advised her to familiarize herself with the rules and procedures under the agreement prior to signing.terms in bold type informed gannon that the agreement affected her legal rights and that she might want to seek legal advice before signing.it also stated that she could withdraw her consent up to three days after signing the agreement and specified how she could effectuate a withdrawal.gannon signed the agreement and circuit city hired her.
after approximately one year of employment,circuit city terminated gannon.following her discharge,gannon filed charges with the equal employment opportunity commission and the missouri commission on human rights alleging that during her employment with circuit city she had encountered sexual harassment,a hostile work environment,sex discrimination,and retaliation.upon receiving her letters from both agencies,she brought suit in federal court.circuit city responded by filing a motion to dismiss the case and to compel arbitration based on the arbitration agreement gannon had signed.the district court declined to compel arbitration.it determined that the entire agreement was unenforceable because it contained an invalid clause that limited punitive damages circuit city filed a motion for reconsideration,arguing that it no longer enforced the punitive damages clause and that another provision in the agreement served to automatically strike terms judicially determined to be unenforceable.the district court denied the motion and circuit city appeals on appeal,circuit city does not challenge the ruling that the clause is unenforceable,but argues that the clause should be severed and gannon should be compelled to arbitrate her claims under the remaining terms of the agreement.
congress enacted the federal arbitration act faa,to reverse the longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration agreements and to place arbitration agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.gilmer lane,d.the faa declares that written agreements to resolve disputes through arbitration are valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.the effect of the faa was to create a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability,applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the act.moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d.in circuit city stores,adams,d,the supreme court held that the faa provisions apply to arbitration agreements covering claims.id.at.holding that in the employment context only contracts of employment of transportation workers are exempted from the faa coverage.the faa therefore governs gannon arbitration agreement with circuit city and we undertake our review keeping in mind that the faa evinces a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.moses cone mem l,at.
our role in determining whether a court should compel arbitration is limited.we must determine simply whether the parties have entered a valid agreement to arbitrate and,if so,whether the existing dispute falls under the coverage of the agreement.larry united super,werries,cir keymer mgmt.recruiters int l,cir.once we conclude that the parties have reached such an agreement,the faa compels judicial enforcement of the arbitration agreement.
we review the district court interpretation of the arbitration agreement de novo,lyster ryan family steak houses,cir,and we look to missouri contract law to interpret the validity of the agreement.id.at.
the parties agree that they entered into an agreement to settle disputes through binding arbitration and that their agreement covers the present dispute.they contest,however,the validity of the agreement following the district court conclusion that one provision within the agreement was invalid.circuit city contends that,under the terms of the arbitration agreement and missouri contract law,the invalid clause should be struck and gannon should be compelled to arbitrate her claims in accordance with the remaining terms of the agreement.gannon argues that the invalid provision renders the entire agreement unenforceable as a matter of public policy.
the primary rule in the interpretation of a contract under missouri law is to ascertain the intention of the parties and to give effect to that intention.speedie food mart,taylor.when the contract is unambiguous,the intent of the parties should be determined from the instrument alone.marshall pyramid dev.rule of the circuit city arbitration agreement specifically states the intent of the parties in the event a provision within the agreement is found invalid.it provides that,i n the event that any of these dispute resolution rules and procedures agreed upon by the parties is held to be in conflict with a mandatory provision of applicable law,the conflicting rule or procedure shall be modified automatically to comply.it also states that i n the event of an automatic modification with respect to a particular rule or procedure,the remainder of these rules and procedures shall not be affected.the terms of rule express an unambiguous intent by the parties to sever any terms determined to be invalid and to allow all claims to proceed to arbitration under the remaining provisions of the agreement.
even if the parties had not recorded their intentions in the severability provision,missouri contract law declares severance to be proper in this instance.with respect to contracts which contain a forbidden or invalid provision,our supreme court at an early date declared the general rule to be,that if the good be mixed with the bad,it shall nevertheless stand,provided a separation can be made.kisling mfa mut.ins,quoting koontz hannibal sav.ins.the essence of the contract between circuit city and gannon is an agreement to settle their employment disputes through binding arbitration.the clause represents only one aspect of their agreement and can be severed without disturbing the primary intent of the parties to arbitrate their disputes.w here one provision in a contract,which does not constitute its main or essential feature or purpose,is void but is clearly separable and severable from the other parts which are relied upon,such other parts are not affected by the invalid provision,and may be enforced as if no such provision had been incorporated in the contract.schibi miller.
gannon argues that concerns override these contractual rules and require that we hold the entire arbitration agreement unenforceable although missouri common law ordinarily allows the severance of invalid terms,gannon relies on a narrow exception that prohibits severance where there is some vice,such as fraud,or some unlawful act which is condemned by public policy or the common law and avoids all parts of the transaction because all are alike infected.id.quoting koontz,at.she asserts that allowing severance of an invalid provision within an arbitration agreement falls within this exception.according to gannon,employers will be emboldened to include improper terms because employees will be forced either to arbitrate under the unfair terms or to go to court to get them removed from the agreement.gannon claims that because severance provides employers with such an improper incentive,we must therefore hold the entire agreement unenforceable to discourage such behavior.
we disagree.the inclusion of the clause does not infect the agreement with any type of defect that requires us to invalidate the entire contract.we recogni
