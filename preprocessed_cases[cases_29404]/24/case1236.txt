seventeen months and more than attorney hours after plaintiff julio oregel oregel filed a class action against his former employer,defendant pacpizza,llc pacpizza,pacpizza petitioned to compel arbitration of oregel claims.the trial court denied the petition,finding pacpizza waived its right to enforce a purported arbitration agreement between the two parties.pacpizza appeals,primarily contending the court erred in denying the petition,and also asserting two other claimed errors.we conclude the petition was properly denied,a conclusion that moots pacpizza remaining arguments.we thus affirm.
background 
preliminary observation 
we begin with an observation that,as the appellant,pacpizza was tasked with providing in its opening brief a summary of all evidence in the record that is material to the issues raised on appeal.cal.rules of court,rule a c foreman clark fallon cal d.this,it failed to do.pacpizza sets forth a chronology of pertinent events underlying appeal that suggests little transpired in the months between oregel filing of his complaint and pacpizza filing of its petition to compel arbitration.among other things,pacpizza has omitted any discussion of the extensive class discovery it conducted an omission that is nothing short of brazen given the trial court finding that oregel was prejudiced by the discovery the parties conducted on his class allegations during the lengthy period of time pacpizza delayed in seeking arbitration.
what follows is a chronology of what actually transpired.
oregel job application 
on july,oregel submitted a written application for a job as a delivery driver at pacpizza pizza hut restaurant in el cerrito.at the bottom of the application was a section titled,agreement,followed by five paragraphs in small font,estimated by oregel to be point font,an estimate pacpizza does not dispute indeed,one that we believe may overstate the size of the font.the fifth paragraph,titled agreement to arbitrate,stated because of the delay and expense of the court system,pizza hut and i agree to use confidential binding arbitration,instead of going to court,for any claims that arise between me and pizza hut,its related companies,their current or former employees.without limitation,such claims would include any concerning compensation,employment including,but not limited to,any claims concerning sexual harassment or discrimination,or termination of employment.before arbitration,i agree i first to present any such claims in full written detail to pizza hut ii next,to complete any pizza hut internal review process and iii finally,to complete any external administrative remedy such as with the equal employment opportunity commission.in any arbitration,the then prevailing employment dispute resolution rules of the american arbitration association will apply,except that pizza hut will pay the arbitrator fees,and pizza hut will pay that portion of the arbitration filing fee in excess of the similar court filing fee had i gone to court.oregel signature followed 
oregel complaint and first amended complaint 
oregel was apparently hired and worked as a delivery driver for some time.but on june,he filed a class action against pacpizza.the complaint alleged that pacpizza failed to fully reimburse delivery drivers for necessary expenses associated with using their personal vehicles to deliver pizza on pacpizza behalf.it asserted two causes of action,one for failure to reimburse expenses in violation of labor code section,the other for violation of california unfair competition law bus,et.and it sought compensatory and special damages,injunctive relief,disgorgement,attorney fees,and costs.
on july,pacpizza answered,generally denying oregel allegations.it also asserted affirmative defenses,none of which alleged the existence of an agreement to arbitrate the dispute.
the court held case management conferences on september,and february.at the second conference,the parties agreed to a discovery schedule,and the court set september,as the deadline for oregel to file his anticipated motion for class certification.the parties subsequently stipulated to a complete briefing schedule on the motion,with pacpizza opposition due november and the motion to be heard on december.pacpizza was silent on its intent to arbitrate oregel claims at both conferences and throughout discussions concerning the discovery and briefing schedules.
on march,oregel filed a first amended complaint in which he reasserted his original two causes of action and added a third cause of action under the private attorneys general act of,subd.a paga.to the relief sought in his original complaint,oregel added civil penalties pursuant to labor code section.
pacpizza answered oregel first amended complaint three days later,once again denying his allegations and asserting affirmative defenses again,none of which alleged the existence of an agreement to arbitrate the dispute.
the parties conduct extensive class discovery 
meanwhile,in september,discovery commenced with oregel propounding written discovery,much of which related to class certification issues.pacpizza objected to a special interrogatory seeking the identities of putative class members,forcing oregel to move to compel production of the information.the court ordered pacpizza to produce the putative class members identities.at no time during the discovery dispute did pacpizza suggest class discovery was unwarranted because it intended to arbitrate oregel claims.
on november,pacpizza served responses to oregel outstanding written discovery and produced responsive documents.significantly,oregel special interrogatory and asked,respectively,if you contend this action is affected by an arbitration agreement,state all facts supporting such contention,and if you contend this action is affected by an arbitration agreement,identify all documents supporting such contention.in response to both,pacpizza stated plaintiff julio oregel signed an arbitration agreement on july,wherein he agreed to arbitrate all claims,including all employment related claims between he,pizza hut and all of pizza hut related companies,which includes pacpizza.although pacpizza appended oregel job application to its responses,it gave no indication that it intended to seek enforcement of the arbitration agreement.
the parties continued discovery for the next months.as to some of the particulars,on november,pacpizza propounded written discovery requests,in response to which oregel provided written responses and produced documents.much of the discovery pacpizza propounded pertained to oregel class allegations.by way of example,its special interrogatories asked oregel to i dentify all dates on which each putative class member incurred business expenses that defendant failed to fully reimburse to each respective putative class member and to s tate the amount of money that you claim is owed to each putative class member for defendant alleged failure to fully reimburse each respective putative class member business expenses.pacpizza asked oregel to produce a ll documents that support your contention that defendant did not fully reimburse the expenses incurred by each putative class members when each made deliveries for defendant and a ll documents that you used to calculate the amount of business expenses defendant failed to reimburse to putative class members 
in april,pacpizza propounded additional written discovery,and in may,june,and september,pacpizza served substantive responses to oregel second,third,and fourth sets of discovery requests.
in summer,oregel deposed pacpizza director of finance alan fuss and employee collin day,both designated by pacpizza as its persons most knowledgeable regarding specific topics,including class issues.oregel also deposed pacpizza president brian thompson and audit department head william likens on subjects,as well as a representative from pacpizza outside computer vendor.
on september,pacpizza deposed oregel.during the deposition,counsel for pacpizza asked general questions regarding the job application oregel signed,including whether he understood it contained an arbitration agreement.oregel responded,no to that question.
on september,pacpizza served a motion to compel discovery of questionnaires putative class members had submitted to oregel counsel.although oregel initially opposed the motion,the parties reached a resolution with the assistance of a facilitator,and he ultimately produced copies of certain questionnaires.
oregel motion forclass certification 
on september,oregel filed his motion for class certification.it was supported by declarations of his counsel eric grover appending pages of supporting evidence,putative class members,statistical consultant richard drogin,and oregel himself.
on october,the parties stipulated to a modification of the briefing schedule on oregel motion to allow pacpizza time to depose the putative class members who had submitted declarations.the stipulation extended the due dates for pacpizza opposition originally due november to december and oregel reply to january,and continued the hearing on the motion to january.when the parties were working out the modified briefing and hearing schedule,pacpizza never mentioned that a petition to compel arbitration was imminent.
between october and november,pacpizza deposed putative class members.three of those depositions took place on november and,which,as will be seen,was the same day and the day after pacpizza petitioned to compel arbitration.oregel counsel spent more than hours of attorney time on those putative class member depositions alone.
pacpizza petition to compel arbitration 
on november,months after oregel filed his complaint and despite all that had occurred in the litigation pacpizza counsel sent a letter to oregel counsel demanding arbitration of oregel claims.oregel counsel promptly rejected the demand,advising,that train left the station a long time ago.we have been actively litigating the case in court for well over a year,including law and motion practice,written discovery and many depositions,including the dozens of depositions your firm has taken over the past few weeks.
four days later,pacpizza filed a petition to compel arbitration,stay the proceedings,and dismiss oregel class allegations and paga claim the petition.filed in support of the petition was oregel job application,among other documents.
the court denies pacpizza request for a stay of the proceeding 
on december,pacpizza applied ex parte for a stay of the proceeding pending decision on the petition or,alternatively,for an order shortening time to hear a motion for a stay.the honorable david flinn denied ex parte relief on the grounds that a noticed motion was required and pacpizza had not presented any basis for shortening time on a motion.
pacpizza opposition to oregel motion for class certification 
in the absence of a stay,on december,pacpizza filed opposition to oregel motion for class certification,an opposition supported by four declarations and more than pages of exhibits.
oregel opposition to pacpizza petition 
on december,oregel filed opposition to pacpizza petition.he argued that pacpizza waived any right to arbitration,the arbitration agreement was unconscionable and unenforceable,the agreement allowed class and representative arbitration,and the paga claim should not be sent to arbitration.in support of his opposition,oregel submitted a declaration of his counsel grover.in addition to detailing the exhaustive discovery the parties had conducted since the june filing of oregel complaint,grover testified that he and other attorneys in his office had spent more than hours working on this case.the lodestar associated with those hours exceeds well over.all of those hours were spent performing tasks related to getting the class certification motion on file and preparing for and defending depositions of putative class members who filed declarations in support of class certification he further testified that his firm had incurred costs exceeding.
the court issues a tentative ruling denying pacpizza petition 
on january,judge flinn issued a detailed tentative ruling denying pacpizza petition,finding by clear and convincing evidence that it had waived its right to arbitrate oregel claims.he explained his reasoning as follows 
in sobremonte superior court th sobremonte,the court of appeal referred to the following factors in determining waiver,a court can consider whether the party actions are inconsistent with the right to arbitrate whether the litigation machinery has been substantially invoked and the parties were well into preparation of a lawsuit before the party notified the opposing party of an intent to arbitrate whether a party either requested arbitration enforcement close to the trial date or delayed for a long period before seeking a stay whether a defendant seeking arbitration filed a counterclaim without asking for a stay of the proceedings whether important intervening steps,taking advantage of judicial discovery procedures not available in arbitration had taken place and whether the delay affected,misled,or prejudiced the opposing party.approved by the supreme court in agnes medical center pacificare of california cal th.
this action was filed on june,and the petition to compel arbitration was not filed until november,more than months later.in the interim period the moving party defendant substantially invoked litigation machinery in many regards.indeed,on september,defendant posted jury fees with a demand for a jury trial.this certainly would lead any plaintiff to believe that he or she had to fully prepare for a full trial.case management conferences were held on september,and february,and in neither instance did defendant suggest that it would seek to have the matter transferred to arbitration.at the latter conference the parties agreed to a discovery schedule and thereafter they commenced discovery.the schedule called for plaintiff to prepare and file a motion to certify the action as a class action on or before september,and discovery proceeded at a pace to accomplish that.a very extensive motion was then prepared.opposition was due on november but a stipulation was reached extending that deadline to december.
the only reasonable conclusion to be reached is that during its preparation of an opposition to class certification the defendant made a strategy decision that its position would be strong in an arbitration setting.defendant fully overlooks the extensive prejudice to the plaintiff in having to do class certification discovery and prepare an extensive motion for certification,both of which would not play any part in an arbitration proceeding.
the court will deny the petition without prejudice.in the event that class certification should not occur in the action,the court will consider the possibility that arbitration may be appropriate and not prejudice the plaintiff.
hearing on pacpizza petition to compel arbitration 
pacpizza petition came on for hearing on january,before judge flinn.he opened the hearing by observing,looks like an awful clear waiver to me.i mean i have read a lot of cases out of the appellate courts about waiving arbitration.and i had a lot of cases,a lot of facts.i got to say you are the first one that posted jury fees and then came in and said i want arbitration.this,judge flinn continued,sends a message to your opponent that,despite the fact that you got an arbitration clause,you see the case as staying in the courts.and he goes out and does the work.
counsel for pacpizza argued against a finding of waiver,contending oregel had not demonstrated he had suffered actual prejudice,since merely incurring the cost of litigation was insufficient.after further argument about prejudice and waiver,judge flinn denied the petition,stating 
t he fact of the matter is that i find the idea that a party with an arbitration clause,clearly the one that wanted the arbitration clause,that drafted the contract,can go into litigation and keep an option open there is none of these cases i have read that said option is a good idea.
and my problem with the agnes and the concept that you are talking about is the idea that you are really stating.and i simply would believe it if one told me,oh,no,we knew all along we were going to do this.i think it our society is just really deprived of benefits if we say in our judicial process you can make one side have to defend the case as a court case all the way up to the point where you exercise this,quote,option to ask for arbitration.
and i just do think that option is intended.i do think those cases talk about an option.
i finding in this case that the conduct of pacpizza was to keep it as an option and by asking for a jury and then doing all the work,and so i find prejudice.
oregel ex parte application to delay entry of judge flinn order denying the petition 
following the hearing,the parties submitted competing proposed orders.before judge flinn signed an order,however,oregel filed an ex parte application requesting that he not enter an order until oregel class certification motion then set for hearing on january was heard.the application was based on the prejudice and irreparable harm that he and the putative class members will suffer if pacpizza is permitted to interrupt the class certification proceedings with an immediate appeal to sic the order denying pacpizza frivolous petition to compel arbitration filed months after the case was first filed.as oregel reasoned,if pacpizza is allowed to file its appeal before a ruling is issued on the class certification motion and the appeal is denied as is surely the case,then the parties will have to wait one to two years to have the fully briefed certification motion heard.then,if the motion for class certification is denied,another one to two years will pass before the parties know whether or not the case will proceed as a class action.it makes far more sense to deal with any appeals all at once.either both orders will be the subject of an appeal if class certification is denied or,if certification is granted,the parties will at least know that the case will proceed as a class action if the appeal of the order denying the petition to compel is denied.
the application was considered by the honorable george spanos,who agreed with oregel and granted it b ased on the facts presented and the interests of justice 
pacpizza motion for reconsideration 
on march,pacpizza moved for reconsideration of judge spanos order.pacpizza noted that the class certification motion had been continued to april,and it had been deprived of its right to appeal judge flinn denial of its petition since january it further explained that at the ex parte hearing,it had requested an opportunity for full briefing,a request judge spanos denied for lack of sufficient time,given that the class certification motion was then set to be heard on january.according to pacpizza,there was now time for full briefing,since the class certification motion had been continued to april.
oregel opposed the motion as untimely,moot and without merit,and the court set the motion for hearing on the same day as oregel class certification motion which,the court noted,effectively moot ed pacpizza request that the court revisit judge spanos order.
the court grants oregel motion for class certification and enters orders on pacpizza petition and motion for reconsideration 
oregel class certification motion came on for hearing on april,before the honorable steven austin.following argument,judge austin granted the motion,noting that pacpizza motion for reconsideration was thus moot.
on may,judge austin entered an order denying pacpizza petition.to the language contained in judge flinn tentative ruling,judge austin order added the following paragraph defendant conduct has also prejudiced plaintiff due to the expenditure of time and expense that could have been avoided if defendant had filed its petition to compel individual arbitration early in the litigation.any potential or benefits of arbitration have been lost due to defendant delay that forced plaintiff to fully work up the case to prepare it for class certification.sobremonte,supra,th at.
judge austin also entered orders granting oregel motion for class certification and denying as moot pacpizza motion for reconsideration of judge spanos order.
pacpizza timely appeals from the denial of its petition.
discussion 
standard of review 
we begin with a discussion of the applicable standard of review,a standard on which the parties do not agree.
pacpizza suggests we are to review the order denying its petition de novo.in support,it quotes richards ernst and young cir,as follows where,as here,the concern is whether the undisputed facts of defendant pretrial participation in the litigation satisfy the standard of waiver,the question of waiver of arbitration is one of law which we review de novo.
oregel submits that we are to review the order for an abuse of discretion.as he would have it,an order denying arbitration commonly is reviewed for abuse of discretion.generally,the determination of waiver is a question of fact,and the trial court finding,if supported by sufficient evidence,is binding on the appellate court.de novo review applies only where the trial court denial of a petition to arbitrate presents a pure question of law.here,the trial court made the factual determination that,based on the evidence presented,pacpizza waived any right to arbitrate that may have existed.the trial court found that pacpizza delay in bringing its petition was a strategic decision made only after pacpizza had reviewed oregel class certification motion and was in the process of deposing the putative class member declarants and preparing the opposition.pacpizza disputes that finding along with the trial court other factual findings supporting its waiver determination.abuse of discretion,therefore,is the appropriate standard of review.
in reply,pacpizza concedes there is no bright line rule,quoting the following passage in avery integrated healthcare holdings,th,there is no uniform standard of review for evaluating an order denying a motion to compel arbitration.citation.if the court order is based on a decision of fact,then we adopt a substantial evidence standard.citation.alternatively,if the court denial rests solely on a decision of law,then a de novo standard of review is employed.citations.pacpizza then insists the de novo standard applies here,because there was no dispute that a valid,enforceable arbitration agreement exists 
our supreme court addressed this question in agnes medical center pacificare of california cal th,providing a succinct summary we find instructive here generally,the determination of waiver of the right to arbitrate is a question of fact,and the trial court finding,if supported by sufficient evidence,is binding on the appellate court.citations.when,however,the facts are undisputed and only one inference may reasonably be drawn,the issue is one of law and the reviewing court is not bound by the trial court ruling.citation.id.at.
certainly pacpizza has not shown that judge flinn abused his discretion.and certainly his decision is supported by substantial evidence.but even were we to agree with pacpizza that a de novo standard applies,that the essential underlying facts are not in dispute and only one inference may reasonably be drawn,we would conclude that that one inference fully supports judge flinn ruling.
the law governing waiver of an arbitration agreement 
the enforcement of a contractual arbitration provision is governed by code of civil procedure section,which provides in pertinent part on petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy,the court shall order the petitioner and respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists,unless it determines that a the right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner california law reflects a strong policy favoring arbitration agreements and requires close judicial scrutiny of waiver claims,and the party seeking to establish a waiver bears a heavy burden of proof.agnes,supra,cal th at engalla permanente medical group,cal th.waiver will not be lightly inferred,and any doubts regarding waiver should be resolved in favor of arbitration.agnes,supra,at.
no single test defines the conduct that will constitute waiver of an arbitration right.rather,courts look to a number of factors to determine whether waiver has occurred.agnes,supra,cal th at.in agnes,the supreme court confirmed that a court may consider the following six factors in assessing a waiver claim whether the party actions are inconsistent with the right to arbitrate whether the litigation machinery has been substantially invoked and the parties were well into preparation of a lawsuit before the party notified the opposing party of an intent to arbitrate whether a party either requested arbitration enforcement close to the trial date or delayed for a long period before seeking a stay whether a defendant seeking arbitration filed a counterclaim without asking for a stay of proceedings whether important intervening steps,taking advantage of judicial discovery procedures not available in arbitration had taken place and whether the delay affected,misled,or prejudiced the opposing party.citation.id.at see also sobremonte superior court,supra,th at.
the trial court properly denied pacpizza petition 
before delving into the question of whether pacpizza waived its right to arbitrate oregel claims,we address pacpizza assertion that oregel conceded the existence of a valid arbitration agreement.we see nothing in the record evidencing such a concession and,indeed,oregel expressly does not concede that the purported arbitration agreement would have been valid or enforceable but for pacpizza waiver.contrary to pacpizza representation,oregel opposition to the petition was not based exclusively on a waiver claim he also argued the agreement was unconscionable and unenforceable.judge flinn made no finding on the validity of the arbitration agreement,ruling only on the issue of waiver.like judge flinn,we do not address the validity of the agreement because even assuming a valid arbitration agreement,we conclude that oregel satisfied his burden of establishing waiver.
turning to the six factors enumerated in agnes,one factor the fourth one is clearly inapplicable here,as pacpizza did not file a.the five remaining factors all support a waiver finding.
in the months between oregel initiation of it class action and pacpizza assertion of the arbitration agreement,pacpizza engaged in substantial conduct inconsistent with its claimed right to arbitrate.an agreement to arbitrate is an affirmative defense to claims asserted in a lawsuit.ross blanchard d.despite this,pacpizza filed two answers in which it failed to assert the existence of an arbitration agreement as an affirmative defense.see guess,superior court th,guess at a minimum,the failure to plead arbitration as an affirmative defense is an act inconsistent with the later assertion of a right to arbitrate.early in the litigation,pacpizza paid jury fees and demanded a jury trial,which judge flinn rightly found would lead any plaintiff to believe that he or she had to fully prepare for a full trial.pacpizza objects that it was obligated to pay jury fees before the first case management conference,lest it waive its right to a jury.code civ.it certainly would not have been imprudent for pacpizza to preserve its right to a jury trial in the event its petition proved unsuccessful,had it done so while making known its intent to seek arbitration.it was the act of preserving its jury rights while remaining silent on the arbitration agreement that was inconsistent with a right to arbitrate.
pacpizza also attended two case management conferences.at the second,the court established a schedule for the completion of discovery and oregel filing of his class certification motion.at both conferences,pacpizza was silent about its intent to arbitrate oregel claims.it later stipulated to a modification of that schedule,again maintaining its silence on arbitration.
beyond all that,pacpizza acted inconsistently with its purported right to arbitrate by actively participating in discovery pertaining to oregel class claims.not only did it respond to oregel discovery,but it also propounded its own discovery requests,many of which sought information regarding oregel class allegations.pacpizza produced multiple deponents who were questioned on class issues,and it also deposed oregel and putative class members.while conducting class discovery,never once did pacpizza object that the discovery was improper because it intended to seek arbitration of oregel claims.
it is also significant that in its november,responses to oregel special interrogatories,pacpizza represented that there existed a valid arbitration agreement between the parties,attaching oregel job application to its responses.but pacpizza did not then seek enforcement of that agreement.rather,a full year went by during which time pacpizza participated in class discovery before it demanded that oregel submit his claims to arbitration.
despite of all this,pacpizza disputes it acted inconsistently with its right to arbitrate oregel claims.this is so,it contends,because it believed it would have been futile to seek enforcement of the arbitration agreement given the state of the law at the time.pacpizza is correct that a court may find a party has not acted inconsistently with its right to arbitrate if the party delayed seeking to enforce an arbitration agreement during a time when that agreement would have been considered unenforceable under existing law.iskanian cls transportation los angeles,llc cal th,iskanian.pacpizza is incorrect,however,that the futility rule had any applicability here.
by way of background,in discover bank superior court cal th,the california supreme court held that a class action waiver in a consumer arbitration agreement was unconscionable,and thus unenforceable,where the disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages,and when it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money this was followed two years later by its opinion in gentry superior court cal th gentry,in which it extended a similar rationale to a class action waiver in an employment arbitration agreement.
in at t mobility concepcion.concepcion,the united states supreme court abrogated the rule established in discover bank,holding that the federal arbitration act faa preempts state laws that interfere with the fundamental attributes of arbitration.concepcion,supra,at.while concepcion expressly overruled discover bank,it made no mention of gentry.concepcion,supra,at.
in june,the california supreme court decided iskanian,supra,cal th,which,like gentry,involved an employment arbitration agreement that contained a class action,as well as representative action waiver.the court held that concepcion abrogated gentry and that the class action waiver was valid.id.at.it also held that an employer can not compel waiver of paga claims because a paga claim in the employment context is a dispute between the state and the employer and thus falls outside the faa coverage.id.at pp.
against this background,pacpizza claims that after concepcion but before iskanian,there was uncertainty in the law regarding whether a court would enforce the arbitration agreement in oregel job application and order individual arbitration of his wage and hour claims pacpizza reasons that because concepcion expressly overruled discover bank but did not specifically address gentry,concepcion did not provide desired clarity to california employers with respect to employment arbitration agreements.instead,california had to wait for the june california supreme court ruling in iskanian for that clarification.pacpizza theory is fatally flawed,however,for one simple reason the line of cases on which it relies,discover bank,gentry,concepcion,and iskanian all involved the enforceability of arbitration agreements containing express class action waivers.the arbitration provision in oregel job application did not contain a class action waiver.thus,concepcion was irrelevant to the arbitration agreement at issue here,and the california supreme court decision in iskanian whether an affirmance or rev
