the chase manhattan private bank switzerland appeals the district court order to arbitrate claims brought against it by painewebber incorporated painewebber,contending that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over it.we agree,and vacate the district court order.
facts and proceedings 
this dispute had its genesis in when painewebber,a financial services firm specializing in private wealth management,approached,a swiss bank,to secure its services for painewebber customers.after protracted negotiations,the parties entered into an agreement in june whereby painewebber would refer its customers who wished to house their assets in a swiss bank to the referral agreement.under the referral agreement,a painewebber customer would open a custodial account at,which would in turn open an omnibus brokerage account at painewebber.painewebber would then execute transactions for the customer in the omnibus account.most importantly for the instant case,the referral agreement provides 
any dispute between and painewebber which can not be resolved by good faith negotiations shall be submitted to the appropriate arbitrator or court in the united states.
not long after negotiating the referral agreement,painewebber referred the lerma family of mexico to.a company controlled by the lermas opened an account with,and enrique ernesto perusquia perusquia,then a painewebber vice president,was designated by the lermas as the independent asset manager of their account.opened an omnibus account at painewebber pursuant to the referral agreement and executed a painewebber trading authorization form.
the documents gave painewebber no authority to trade options in the omnibus account.nevertheless,approximately nine months after opened the omnibus account,at least one such transaction was executed in the account.painewebber belatedly sought retroactive approval by requesting its signature on a form contract entitled client option agreement and qualification form the option agreement.in fine print on the form,the option agreement contained the following boilerplate arbitration clause 
i agree and by carrying an account for me you agree,that any and all controversies which may arise between you and me concerning any account,transaction,dispute or the construction,performance,or breach of this or any other agreement whether entered into prior,on or subsequent to the date shall be determined by arbitration.any arbitration under this agreement shall be held under and pursuant to and be governed by the new york exchange,or the national association of securities dealers.i may also select any other national securities exchange arbitration forum upon which painewebber is legally required to arbitrate the controversy with me,including,where applicable,the municipal securities rule making board.such arbitration shall be governed by the rules of the organization convening the panel.i may elect in the first instance the arbitration forum.
over the course of one month,signed three such option agreements,each containing the identical arbitration clause sent a signed option agreement dated march,to painewebber with a transmittal cover letter stating that this document is only valid on a temporary basis.letter also informed painewebber that if it would like to just trade options on this account or others,we will need to modify the legal doc sic which is the referral agreement.signed another option agreement on march,again with a notation that the option agreement would be valid until april,only.
did not grant painewebber general authority to trade options in the omnibus account until may,the may authorization.in the may authorization,the parties drew a line through the phrase in the form agreement providing that options transactions would be conducted in accordance with painewebber standard terms and conditions,and typed in its place a provision directing that such transactions be conducted according to the referral agreement.
in december,the lermas instituted arbitration to resolve a claim against painewebber,perusquia,and lehman brothers perusquia former employer before the national association of securities dealers the nasd.the lermas alleged that perusquia,acting first as the employee of lehman brothers and then as the employee of painewebber,defrauded them of more than million dollars.the lermas claim advanced multiple theories of liability including fraud,conversion,forgery,theft,breach of fiduciary duty,churning,violation of state and federal securities laws,and breach of contract.painewebber and the lermas agreed to stay the nasd arbitration for months while they attempted to sort out the complex relationships and transactions at issue.
in may,painewebber answered the lermas claim,filed a against lehman brothers,and asserted claims against and ubs ag,another swiss bank.painewebber claims against arose out of perusquia purchase for the lermas of more than million dollars worth of shares in northern orion exploration northern orion,a gold mining company.painewebber contends,inter alia,that perusquia acted outside the scope of his employment in transacting the northern orion purchases for the lermas,and that painewebber relied on representations in permitting perusquia to execute the transactions,in turn,informed painewebber in writing on two occasions that it did not believe that the claims were arbitrable,but if they nevertheless proved to be arbitrable,would elect to arbitrate in new york city before the new york stock exchange the nyse.
in june,a rapid series of steps was instituted by painewebber and the lermas.first,painewebber and the lermas agreed to place the nasd arbitration on inactive status almost immediately thereafter,the lermas initiated an arbitration before the nyse against painewebber,perusquia,and lehman brothers based on the same allegations and theories of liability advanced before the nasd and,in its equally immediate response filed june,painewebber denied all liability and asserted claims against seeking contribution for any liability resulting from the lermas allegations that the northern orion purchases were unauthorized and unsuitable.in the final step of the series,painewebber requested the nyse to set the arbitration hearing in houston,texas.a mere six days later,the nyse granted painewebber request not objected to by the lermas to hold the arbitration in houston.
promptly filed a petition in new york state court seeking to stay arbitration of the claims.asserted that it had not agreed to arbitrate these claims alternatively,that if such claims were arbitrable,they should be arbitrated in new york city.
august,was a busy day for painewebber.on that day,painewebber as defendant,removed suit to the southern district of new york,filed a motion in that court to transfer suit to the southern district of texas,and as plaintiff,filed the instant action in the southern district of texas where it was assigned to the honorable lynn hughes.objected to the transfer of its new york suit on the ground,inter alia,that the southern district of texas lacked jurisdiction over.likewise,moved to dismiss the suit that painewebber filed in texas as the plaintiff the case here on appeal for lack of personal jurisdiction,or,in the alternative,to transfer this case to the southern district of new york.
instead,judge hughes ordered to arbitrate the claims after concluding that is within this court jurisdiction because it agreed to arbitrate in the united states,it elected arbitration through the exchange,and the exchange sent the arbitration to houston,where painewebber has begun to add as a third party defendant.judge hughes did not specify which of the numerous agreements between the parties was the basis for his ruling that elected arbitration through the exchange.
on the very same day that judge hughes signed the order to compel arbitration in houston,the district court in new york,over the objection of,granted painewebber motion to transfer new york suit to the houston division of the southern district of texas,where it was assigned to the honorable melinda harmon.after its suit was transferred to the southern district of texas,filed a motion to retransfer the case to new york.painewebber opposed the motion and also filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that the judgment rendered by judge hughes works as a res judicata bar to suit even though it had been filed in new york before painewebber suit was filed in judge hughes court.responded by filing a for a stay of all proceedings in judge harmon court pending this appeal from judge hughes ruling,or in the alternative,requesting that she decide transfer motion first.to date,all the motions before judge harmon are pending.
after judge hughes entered the arbitration order in the instant case,timely filed a notice of appeal and sought a stay pending appeal.judge hughes denied the stay,after which sought a stay from this court.we too denied the stay,and this appeal followed.
analysisa.standard of review 
we review the district court jurisdictional determinations de novo we also review the district court grant of a motion to compel arbitration de novo 
personal jurisdiction 
as an initial matter,we note that our analysis is complicated by the interrelatedness of the jurisdictional and substantive issues in this case.painewebber asks us to affirm the district court ruling that impliedly consented to the district court jurisdiction by entering into an agreement to arbitrate before the nyse.we obviously can not do so,however,without initially ascertaining that agreed to arbitrate these claims in the first place on appeal,painewebber urges us to consider two additional bases for the court jurisdiction over that do not depend on the existence of a valid arbitration agreement between the parties.we will begin,therefore,by discussing these alternative grounds for jurisdiction.
submission to jurisdiction by conduct as a plaintiff 
painewebber contends that has submitted to the jurisdiction of the southern district of texas by its conduct as a plaintiff in the suit currently pending before judge harmon.painewebber relies on the rule that parties who choose to litigate actively on the merits thereby surrender any jurisdictional objections but that rule has no application to the facts of this case.
to reiterate,commenced its suit in state court in new york,painewebber removed to federal court transfer to texas on the ground that the southern district of texas lacked jurisdiction.following transfer to the southern district of texas after its objection to transfer was overruled,specially appeared for the limited purpose of asking judge harmon to retransfer the case to new york,pointing out that it had opposed transfer from new york on the ground that the southern district of texas has no personal jurisdiction over.when painewebber filed a motion in judge harmon court for summary judgment on grounds of res judicata after judge hughes had entered the order to arbitrate,did not respond on the merits,but filed a for a stay of the motion and all proceedings in judge harmon court pending this appeal.when viewed in the light of these facts,painewebber contention that has submitted to the jurisdiction of the southern district of texas by actively litigating the merits of the arbitrability issue before judge harmon is not merely misleading but is flatly contradicted by the record in that case 
it is no wonder,then,that the cases cited by painewebber are inapposite.this is not a case in which the party seeking to avoid the court jurisdiction has chosen to commence the action or a related action in the very forum in which it is contesting personal jurisdiction neither is this a case in which the party contesting jurisdiction has asserted counterclaims for affirmative relief and this is not a case in which a party has litigated extensively on the merits before making any jurisdictional objections in short,neither the law nor the facts justify the exercise of jurisdiction over on the basis of its conduct in its suit before judge harmon.
submission to jurisdiction by conduct as a defendant 
painewebber also contends that has submitted to the jurisdiction of the southern district of texas by its conduct in the instant case.more specifically,painewebber argues that has waived any objection to personal jurisdiction by seeking the affirmative relief of a stay pending appeal and an injunction to prevent painewebber from proceeding with arbitration of the claims during the pendency of this appeal.
painewebber is right that a party may waive any jurisdictional objections if its conduct does not reflect a continuing objection to the power of the court to act over the defendant person.painewebber is also right that when a party seeks affirmative relief from a court,it normally submits itself to the jurisdiction of the court with respect to the adjudication of claims arising from the same subject matter.but painewebber is dead wrong in suggesting that,by making a motion based on the defense of personal jurisdiction,has thereby submitted to the court jurisdiction.
timely and properly asserted its jurisdictional objection by making a threshold motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.it has asserted no counterclaims and engaged in no practice.it premised its motion for a stay and an injunction pending appeal on the argument that an improper exercise of personal jurisdiction over constitutes irreparable injury as a matter of law as a violation of due process.try as we might,we can not see how such actions manifest anything but a continuing objection to the district court exercise of personal jurisdiction over.
not surprisingly,painewebber does not cite,and we have not found,a single case holding that a motion for a stay pending appeal waives an objection to personal jurisdiction.neither have we found even one case that supports painewebber contention that a defendant submits to the jurisdiction of a court by seeking to enjoin further legal proceedings on the ground that to require participation in such proceedings in the absence of personal jurisdiction would violate due process.indeed,merely to state this argument is to refute it.
inasmuch as,in this circuit,the filing of a counterclaim,or claim does not,without more,waive an objection to personal jurisdiction we can not fathom how a motion premised on a jurisdictional objection could simultaneously operate as a waiver of that very objection.accordingly,we reject out of hand painewebber argument that,by its conduct in either lawsuit,has submitted to the district court exercise of personal jurisdiction.
implied consent to jurisdiction 
the sole remaining ground urged by painewebber for the district court exercise of personal jurisdiction over is implied consent.because the requirement of personal jurisdiction is a waivable right,there are a variety of legal arrangements by which a litigant may give express or implied consent to the personal jurisdiction of the court.an agreement to arbitrate is one such legal arrangement by which a litigant may impliedly consent to personal jurisdiction 
the second circuit,for example,has long held that a party who expressly agrees to arbitrate in one state has impliedly consented to the jurisdiction of the courts in that state,on the theory that only that state courts have jurisdiction to compel arbitration in that state extending this reasoning,one line of new york cases holds that arbitration clauses that identify an organization before which arbitration may be held,without expressly designating the specific geographic location for the arbitration,may be deemed to imply the parties consent to the jurisdiction of courts in the state where the arbitral organization is based under the logic of these cases,parties who agree to arbitrate before the nyse or the nasd have impliedly consented to the jurisdiction of courts in new york,where those organizations are based 
the district court extended this reasoning even further by ruling that is within this court jurisdiction because it agreed to arbitrate in the united states,it elected arbitration through the exchange,and the exchange sent the arbitration to houston,where painewebber has begun to add as a third party defendant.insists,however,that as it never agreed to arbitrate painewebber claims in the first place,its consent to jurisdiction can
