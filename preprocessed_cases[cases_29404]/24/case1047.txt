this case involves a contract dispute over payment of royalties for a patented invention.the parties to the contract differed as to the meaning of a contractual term and,pursuant to the agreement,arbitrated their dispute.after a hearing,the arbitrator found for defendant gorelick and awarded million.plaintiff mactec,filed an application in district court to vacate the arbitration award pursuant to the federal arbitration act,faa.along with that application,mactec filed a declaratory judgment action on the grounds that the arbitrator interpretation of the disputed contractual term constituted illegal patent misuse.in separate orders,the district court denied the application to vacate and dismissed the declaratory judgment action.mactec appealed both decisions to this court,and we consolidated the appeals for a hearing before a single panel.
as a matter of first impression in this circuit,we conclude that a clause in an arbitration agreement that forecloses judicial review of an arbitration award beyond the district court level is enforceable.due to the presence of such a clause in the instant arbitration agreement,we hold that we lack jurisdiction over mactec appeal from the district court denial of the application to vacate the arbitration award and dismiss the case.
regarding mactec appeal from the dismissal of its declaratory judgment action,we conclude that the doctrine of res judicata bars the suit and we affirm the district court dismissal.
background 
factual.development and assignment of the novocs technology 
while a professor at stanford university,steven gorelick gorelick and one of his colleagues,haim gvritzman gvritzman,developed a new method for removing volatile organic contaminants from groundwater the novocs technology.what was unique about this technology is that it was designed to remove the contaminants in situ,or while the water was still underground,by using processes known as vapor stripping and gas pumping.
in,gorelick and gvritzman assigned any right,title,and interest,in the novocs technology to stanford,including the right to seek a patent.in return for their assignment,gorelick and grivtzman each received a share of net royalty income,with the remaining royalty going to the university.stanford subsequently applied for,and received,a patent for the novocs technology and has owned that patent ever since.
in,gorelick formed a company called novocs,novocs with the intention of developing profitable wells that used the novocs technology.to that end,novocs obtained an exclusive license from stanford to use the patented technology in exchange for a series of annual royalties.gorelick was the sole shareholder and manager of novocs.
in,gorelick sold all of his shares in novocs to a company called eg g,pursuant to a stock purchase agreement.in return for the stock,eg g agreed to pay gorelick an payment of just under million.in addition,eg g agreed to give gorelick installment payments of percent of future revenue derived from licenses or of the novocs technology and for each well eg g drilled using the novocs technology.by acquiring all of gorelick stock,eg g became the exclusive license holder of stanford patent and thereby assumed novocs obligations to pay royalties to the university.the stock purchase agreement provided that all disputes arising under the agreement would be governed by california law and would be subject to arbitration.two aspects of the stock purchase agreement are particularly relevant to this appeal first,the agreement specifically excluded from the scope of arbitrable issues any disputes relating to patent invalidity or infringement.second,the agreement provided that any judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator would be final and nonappealable.
entrance of mactec and subsequent 
in,eg g agreed to sell certain of its assets to mactec,mactec including its stock in novocs and,by implication,novocs license to stanford patent over the novocs technology.in a separate written instrument,mactec became the to the stock purchase agreement between eg g and gorelick,expressly assuming all of eg g payment obligations to stanford and gorelick.
in,mactec,through one of its llc subsidiaries,began using a different method of in situ groundwater treatment in some of its wells,known as ubv technology because the novocs and ubv technologies overlapped,mactec was unsure as to whether the use of the ubv technology would trigger the royalty obligation to gorelick it had assumed in the stock purchase agreement.as a result,mactec approached gorelick with the intention of the royalty payments.
the parties eventually agreed in writing to reduce gorelick royalty payment to for each remediation well that was installed by the llc.for remediation wells not installed by the llc,but rather by another entity under the mactec umbrella,gorelick would continue to receive his original payment.the term remediation well is defined in the document as any hole that i has been dug,drilled,or otherwise installed,or ii which existed and has been converted in use,and that is employed or intended for the partial or complete removal treatment of subsurface contaminants.nowhere in the written agreement did mactec condition gorelick payment on a given well use of novocs or ubv technology.
royalty payment dispute 
for the next two years,gorelick received occasional payments from mactec,ranging from to.gorelick received the final payment on november.one month later,gorelick learned from stanford that mactec had canceled its licensing agreement for the novocs technology.gorelick then called executives at mactec who stated that since their relationship with stanford had terminated,they no longer had royalty obligations to gorelick.
gorelick responded that his agreement with mactec was a separate legal obligation which he expected mactec to honor.in addition,gorelick asked mactec for specific information regarding remediation wells for which he was entitled to receive payment because he felt that there had been inadequate reporting throughout the whole process.mactec did not provide the requested information,and instead alleged that the novocs technology had caused the company as much as million in damages.
ii.procedural history.
on august,gorelick filed a demand for arbitration to recover payments under the stock purchase agreement.during discovery,gorelick became aware of a number of wells that mactec drilled but for which it never paid him royalties under the contract.these wells eventually became the central issue in the controversy.mactec maintained that these wells were drilled using only technology,not the novocs or ubv technology.as a result,it argued that it was not required to pay gorelick the royalty payments.gorelick responded by pointing to the plain language of the amendment to the stock purchase agreement,which makes no distinction between novocs wells and other types of wells.
preliminary issues before the arbitrator 
at the arbitration,mactec sought to introduce extrinsic evidence of the parties intent over the meaning of the term remediation well to support its position that the royalty payments only applied to wells involving novocs or ubv technology.both sides briefed and argued the issue before the arbitrator.the arbitrator felt that extrinsic evidence of intent was only relevant if one of the contract terms was ambiguous.finding no ambiguity in the contract,the arbitrator excluded all extrinsic evidence of the parties intent.
mactec also raised two affirmative defenses in its hearing brief which was filed only a few days before the actual hearing.first,mactec claimed that gorelick interpretation of the contract constituted patent misuse under zenith radio hazeltine research,d.second,mactec argued that gorelick patent was effectively invalid because the european patent office concluded that the technology was not based on an inventive step.
gorelick,in his hearing brief,filed a motion to strike these two defenses.gorelick argued that the defenses were not timely raised because they were not included in mactec specification of defenses,filed on april,pursuant to the arbitrator scheduling order.after hearing argument,the arbitrator issued the following oral ruling 
t he motion to strike is granted on several bases.number one,we had a clear scheduling order.and i believe,if i accurate,that all claims and defenses had to be asserted in writing by april of this year.that was not done.
secondly,even if it were an issue of failure to specify on time,you ca bring up new defenses in a case where there been as much discovery and motions as there have been in this case.you ca bring up new defenses a week or five days before trial.
and thirdly,invalidity of the patent is beyond my jurisdiction.that a federal issue,and we not going to decide the patent issues here.if there was an invalidity of the patent,you got a right to file a lawsuit in federal court.those two issues are out of this case,period,okay 
arbitrator award and district court review 
at the conclusion of the hearing,the arbitrator found for gorelick and awarded approximately million in damages.pursuant to the stock purchase agreement,mactec sought review before a federal district court and filed an application to vacate the arbitrator award pursuant to the faa.in support of its application,mactec advanced three primary arguments it was improper for the arbitrator to exclude extrinsic evidence relating to the intent of the parties the court should not have struck the patent misuse defense and enforcement of the award would be patent misuse and would therefore be illegal.these actions,mactec argued,required vacatur under a and on public policy grounds.
after considering mactec arguments,the district court held that the arbitrator did not violate a by either a granting the motion to strike the defense of patent misuse,or b refusing to hear evidence of the parties intent and it was not a patent misuse or a violation of public policy to enforce the arbitration award.
c.the declaratory judgment action 
two weeks after filing its application to vacate the arbitration award,mactec filed a complaint in the same district court seeking a declaratory judgment that gorelick and,by implication,the arbitrator interpretation of the contract constituted patent misuse.gorelick moved pursuant to.b and to dismiss,arguing,inter alia,that the action was barred by res judicata and mactec failed to state a claim.in a order issued the day after denying mactec application to vacate the arbitration,the district court dismissed the declaratory judgment action with prejudice.the court did not expressly give its reasoning,stating only that it was acting for the reasons set forth in the earlier order denying mactec application to vacate.
mactec subsequently appealed both decisions to this court in addition to his opening brief,gorelick has filed a motion to dismiss for lack of appellate jurisdiction,which is a matter of initial concern before the court.
discussion 
gorelick motion to dismiss the arbitration appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.
ordinarily,this court jurisdiction to consider an appeal from a district court confirmation of an arbitration award arises under and a d.the jurisdictional problem in this case arises from the fact that in the stock purchase agreement,the provision dealing with arbitration contained a clause.it states,in relevant part 
judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and nonappealable and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
therefore,the question before us is whether such a provision is enforceable and,as a result,deprives this court of appellate jurisdiction.
as a general rule,judicial review over an arbitration award is very limited.the faa,a,lists only four situations in which it is appropriate at the district court level to vacate an arbitration award where the award was the product of corruption or fraud where there was evident partiality or corruption on the part of the arbitrator where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing,upon sufficient cause shown,to postpone the hearing or hear pertinent and material evidence and where the arbitrator exceeded his powers.in addition,the supreme court has held that vacatur is also appropriate when the arbitrator demonstrates a manifest disregard for the law.wilko swan,overruled on other grounds,rodriguez de quijas.express,d see also hoeft mvl group,cir.as for appellate review,the faa merely provides that decisions made under a may be appealed.the statute is silent on whether such an appeal is barred if the parties agree that the district court judgment confirming or vacating the award is to be.
this court considered a similar issue in bowen amoco pipeline,cir.in that case,the parties,pursuant to a prior agreement,arbitrated a dispute over damages caused by an oil pipeline leak.id.at.the arbitration panel found for the plaintiff and awarded damages.id.at.thereafter,the plaintiff sought,and received,a confirmation of the award from the district court.id.the defendant appealed,claiming that the arbitrators exceeded their powers and acted in manifest disregard of the law.id.at.
the plaintiff moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction,citing a provision in the arbitration agreement that stated that the district court ruling on the award was to be final.id.at.we noted in dicta that although parties to an arbitration agreement may eliminate judicial review by contract,their intention to do so must be clear and unequivocal.id.at citing dep t of air force fed.labor relations,cir.am.arbitration ass n,cir.we held that the parties agreement to make the district court judgment final did not clearly evince an intent to waive all appellate review,stating 
in fact,the very statute from which we derive our jurisdiction,grants appellate courts jurisdiction from all final decisions of the district courts.hence,by agreeing that the district court ruling shall be final,the parties have merely reinforced the appellate jurisdiction conferred by.
bowen,at.as a result we denied the plaintiff motion to dismiss the appeal.id.at.
in the instant case,the stock purchase agreement states not only that the district court judgment shall be final,but also that it shall be nonappealable.as a result,gorelick relies heavily on our dicta in bowen to argue that the instant clause should be held to have waived all judicial review over the district court confirmation of the arbitration award.
in a separate portion of bowen,however,we held that the parties may not contractually expand the standard of judicial review to allow the district court to vacate the award for insufficient evidence.at.in so doing,we noted that w hen congress passed the act in,it did so with the primary goal of changing the judiciary refusal to enforce arbitration clauses in private contracts.id.at.this policy notwithstanding,we refused to enforce the parties agreement to permit judicial review of an arbitrator decision based on sufficiency of the evidence.id.at.our decision was rooted in another policy goal of the faa b y agreeing to arbitrate,a party trades the procedures and opportunity for review of the courtroom for the simplicity,informality,and expedition of arbitration.id.at alteration in original quotation omitted.
we would reach an illogical result if we concluded that the faa policy of ensuring judicial enforcement of arbitration agreements is well served by allowing for expansive judicial review after the matter is arbitrated contractually expanded standards,particularly those that allow for factual review,clearly threaten to undermine the independence of the arbitration process and dilute the finality of arbitration awards 
id.we ultimately framed our bowen holding in broad terms we agree and hold that parties may not contract for expanded judicial review of arbitration awards.id.at.
from this holding,one might argue that if bowen expressly forbade private expansion of judicial review,it might also,by implication,prohibit private restriction or elimination of judicial review.after all,to justify our refusal to enforce the parties contractual provisions expanding judicial review,we described the supreme court jurisprudence in this area as suggesting that the faa is more than a collection of default rules,which parties may alter with comp
