labor relations and collective bargaining between most local california governmental agencies and their employees are governed by the act mmba,coachella valley mosquito vector control dist.california public employment relations bd.cal th,d,coachella.appellant city and county of san francisco the city is a public employer subject to the mmba,and has recognized respondent international union of operating engineers,local,as the exclusive bargaining representative for certain of its employees,pursuant to the mmba.
in this appeal the trial court rejected the city assertion that the court had jurisdiction to compel local to participate in arbitration of a labor dispute,as mandated by the city charter.it held instead that determination of the claimed violation of the city charter was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the public employment relations board perb under the mmba.we hold that government code section grants perb exclusive jurisdiction to decide whether unionized employees of the city are required by the terms of the city charter to participate in mandatory dispute resolution procedures.
factual and procedural background 
the city and each of its unions,including local,have signed contracts governing the terms and conditions under which the union members work.each contract is known as a memorandum of understanding mou,which extends for a defined period of time.when an mou is due to expire,the city charter obligates san francisco and the union to engage in good faith negotiations for a new mou.charter.however,the charter recognizes that agreement will not always be possible,and it provides a procedure to resolve any disputes.charter.under that procedure,disputes must be submitted to a three member board.charter,a.the board has the discretion to mediate or arbitrate the disputes or adopt other procedures designed to encourage an agreement between the parties charter,c.if the parties can not agree,they must submit to the board a last offer of settlement on each of the remaining issues in dispute.charter,d.the board must then select whatever proposal it finds most nearly conforms to those factors traditionally taken into consideration in the determination of public and private employment charter,d.
any mediated agreement or arbitration award must be approved by the city board of supervisors prior to the start of the city new fiscal year on july.the first step in the arbitration process,the parties selection of representatives for the board,must occur not later than january of any year in which bargaining on an mou takes place charter,b.accordingly,the city and its unions have only a brief window of time in which to mediate and arbitrate unresolved issues.
the city and local have used these arbitration procedures to resolve their labor disputes for several years.however,in october,local told the city that it would not participate in arbitration during the negotiations for the new mou that was to take effect on july.then in january,when a dispute arose,local declined to select an arbitrator as is required by the arbitration procedures.negotiations continued into april.
in april,the city filed the superior court action that is at issue in the current appeal.as is relevant,the city alleged two causes of action.the first was a petition for writ of mandate.the city alleged local was required by the terms of the city charter to submit all unresolved labor disputes to arbitration.the second was a petition to compel arbitration.in this cause of action,the city alleged that local was required under the terms of the mou that was already in effect to submit to arbitration under the city charter.
local opposed the petitions arguing they should be dismissed because the city had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies before filing suit.specifically,local argued that under section,perb had exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether local was required by the city charter to submit its labor dispute to binding arbitration.
the trial court ruled it did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the city petition for writ of mandate,holding instead that perb had exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute consistent with section,a provision of mmba.the court also rejected the city petition to compel arbitration ruling that local was not required by the terms of the mou that was then in effect to submit its disputes to binding arbitration.
while this appeal was pending several relevant events occurred 
the day after the court denied the city petition,the city filed a charge with perb alleging that local was required by the terms of the city charter to submit all outstanding labor disputes to binding arbitration.as part of that request,the city sought emergency injunctive relief through perb as authorized by section,subdivision j.the city sought an order requiring local to participate in the charter mandated impasse resolution procedures because negotiations with the city unions had to be completed and arbitration awards submitted to the board by may to include any change in compensation in the city budget for the new fiscal year.three days later perb denied the city injunction request,but it did issue a complaint against local alleging it was obligated by the terms of the city charter to arbitrate all outstanding labor disputes.an administrative law judge conducted a trial on that complaint and in april he issued a tentative decision ruling that local was required by the terms of the city charter to submit its outstanding labor disputes to binding arbitration.
in addition,the city and local were able to negotiate a new mou before the start of the city new fiscal year.the terms of that mou are not before us.
ii.discussion 
writ of mandate 
does perb have exclusive jurisdiction 
the city contends the trial court erred when it ruled perb has the exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether local was required by the terms of the city charter to arbitrate its outstanding labor disputes.
the mmba governs relations for most california local public entities,subd.c.one of the purposes of the mmba is to provide a reasonable method of resolving disputes regarding wages,hours,and other terms and conditions of employment between public employers and public employee organizations,subd.a.

b a complaint alleging any violation of this chapter or of any rules and regulations adopted by a public agency pursuant to section shall be processed as an unfair practice charge by the board.the initial determination as to whether the charge of unfair practice is justified and,if so,the appropriate remedy necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter,shall be a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the board

section,subdivision a,states that a public agency may adopt reasonable rules and regulations for the administration of relations under this chapter.among the rules and regulations a public agency may adopt are additional procedures for the resolution of disputes involving wages,hours,and other terms and conditions of employment,subd.a.
