the nlrb conducted an election at vincent medical center on september and.the union lost the nlrb issued a tally of ballots on september,showing that a majority of the valid votes plus challenged ballots had not been cast for the union.on october,the nlrb certified the election results it is certified that a majority of the valid ballots have not been cast for any labor organization and that no labor organization is the exclusive representative of these employees in the bargaining unit described below.
on october,the union sent a letter via fax to chw.the letter charged chw with committing eighteen violations of the agreement during the union organizing drive at vincent medical center.the alleged violations included 
chw,acting through its agents,violated section of the agreement by encouraging workers to vote against unionization.

concerning vincent medical center and the national labor relations board election in the unit involving the service and maintenance employees,i am advised that no timely objections were ever filed with the nlrb.i am further advised that no request for arbitration has been made regarding any purported objections to the election.accordingly,no valid objections to the nlrb election exist.

ii.discussion 
to determine whether the district court erred in granting the employer motion to dismiss we must decide whether the district court had jurisdiction under of the lmra and whether the union stated a claim upon which relief could be granted because we find that t he heart of the case is a contractual rather than representational dispute,pace honolulu disposal,cir,we hold that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction does not prevent the district court from compelling arbitration of alleged violations of the agreement governing the parties conduct during an organizing drive.therefore,the district court has jurisdiction under of the lmra.
the fact that the nlrb conducted the election at vincent medical center or certified the election results does not prevent the district court from compelling arbitration of the alleged contractual violations.the agreement states that disputes under this agreement,including the guidelines and recognition procedure,will be resolved according to the mediation and arbitration provision in this agreement the arbitration clause provides that the parties agree to submit any unresolved disputes about compliance with or construction of this agreement for final and binding resolution by an arbitrator.we therefore hold that because the arbitration clause in the agreement is susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute,at t,communications workers of,d,the union stated a claim upon which relief can be granted.the district court erred in not compelling arbitration of the alleged contractual violations.
a.the district court erred in determining it lacked subject matter jurisdiction 
section of the lmra vests federal courts with jurisdiction over cases involving the violation of private labor agreements suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization may be brought in any district court in the united states having jurisdiction of the parties,without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.a.although district courts have concurrent jurisdiction with the nlrb over such cases,federal courts must tread lightly in areas of the nlrb primary jurisdiction and must defer to the nlrb when,on close examination,section cases fall within the nlrb primary jurisdiction.united ass of journeymen apprentices of the plumbing pipefitting,local valley eng rs,cir.
to determine whether a case is within the nlrb primary jurisdiction,we have drawn the jurisdictional line by asking whether the major issues to be decided can be characterized as primarily representational or primarily contractual.pace,at quoting valley eng rs,at.we conclude that the major issue to be decided in this arbitrability of the alleged violations of the primarily contractual.unlike valley eng rs,in which we found that the case was primarily representational,the interpretation of the agreement in this case does not depend entirely on the resolution of the question of whom the union represents.at quoting cappa wiseman,cir fletcher,dissenting.the interpretation of the agreement in this case does not depend even partially on the question of whom the union represents.id.rather,the interpretation of the agreement depends on whether the arbitration clause in the agreement is susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.at t,at.although this case concerns alleged violations of the agreement restrictions on the parties behavior during an organizing drive before a representational election,the major issue can not be characterized as primarily representational.a case does not fall on the nlrb primary jurisdiction side of the jurisdictional line merely by having representational overtones.pace,at.
although the agreement in this case is not labeled a neutrality agreement,the agreement is similar in many regards to the employer neutrality clause in hotel and restaurant employees union marriott,cir.in marriott,we held that the district court had jurisdiction under over the neutrality clause because e nforcement of the neutrality clause raises no representational issues.id.like the employer neutrality clause in marriott,the contested portion of the agreement in this case governs and restricts the parties actions during an organizing drive.while the hotel in marriott agreed not to express any opinion on whether its employees should choose the union as their exclusive bargaining representative,here,the employer agreed to communicate only that which is factual and not to initiate conversations with employees about unionization.just as in marriott,the district court in the present case will not be required to designate an exclusive bargaining agent or identify an appropriate collective bargaining unit.id.quoting local int l woodworkers ketchikan pulp,cir.nor will the district court be required to resolve any other representational issues not already resolved by the parties.id.rather,the district court in the present case would merely be required to determine whether the arbitration clause in the agreement is susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute,and if so to compel arbitration.dutra group,at.compelling arbitration of the alleged contractual violations will not require the naming of an exclusive bargaining agent or a collective bargaining unit.marriott,at quoting ketchikan pulp,at.the agreement clearly states that in no case,may the arbitrator compel recognition of the union where a majority of the voters have not selected representation by the union.we therefore conclude that while this c
