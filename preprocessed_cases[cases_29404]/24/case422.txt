daniel murray murray brought this action against his employer,the united food commercial workers union,local local,and donald cash cash,a union managerial employee,alleging that they discriminated against him on the basis of his race in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,see west supp,and west,when they terminated him from his employment.murray also alleged a pendent state law claim for defamation against local and its organizing director,christian sauter sauter,arising from alleged defamatory statements made by sauter after murray was fired.the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss and to compel arbitration of murray discrimination claim,and granted defendants motion to dismiss murray defamation claim pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.we reverse and remand.
local of the united food commercial workers union is a labor union representing approximately members,many of whom are employed in retail food stores.in february,murray took a leave of absence from his position as a produce clerk at giant food,and began working as a union organizer for local.as a condition of his employment with local,murray was required to sign an agreement containing the following arbitration clause 
all representatives are employed under the terms of the bylaws of local.any claims of discrimination which ha ve not been properly remedied through local internal discrimination complaint process,shall be determined and adjudicated through final and binding arbitration.a single arbitrator shall be chosen by the alternate strike method from a list of arbitrators provided by the local president office.such arbitrator shall not have the authority to alter,change or diminish any power,right or authority granted to the president or acting president of local under the terms and conditions of the bylaws of local.
emphasis added.
on june,local and donald cash informed murray that his employment with local would be terminated effective july.murray returned to his position at giant food and,on july,instituted this action against local and cash under title vii and.murray,a white male,alleged that local and cash,who is african american,terminated his employment on account of his race even though he is qualified for that employment,and defendants plan to retain similarly situated african american employees because of their race.among other relief,murray sought reinstatement to his position as a union organizer and monetary damages.
in september,murray amended his complaint to add christian sauter,local organizing director,as a defendant and asserted a state law defamation claim against local and sauter.murray alleged that sauter defamed him after he was terminated from his position as a union organizer with local by telling one or more giant food employees that murray was not a good organizer.
defendants filed a motion to dismiss and to compel arbitration of murray discrimination claim,as well as a motion to dismiss murray defamation claim for failure to state a claim for relief under maryland law.the district court granted both motions,holding that the discrimination claim was subject to the arbitration agreement between local and murray,and sauter statements failed to state an actionable defamation claim under maryland law.the district court subsequently denied murray motion to reconsider,and the parties proceeded to arbitration of murray discrimination claim.
at the conclusion of arbitration,the single arbitrator ruled in favor of local and cash,concluding that murray had failed to establish a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination and,in any event,that local had articulated legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for murray discharge.the district court then confirmed the award and entered final judgment.murray now appeals the district court grant of defendants motion to dismiss and to compel arbitration of his discrimination claim,as well as the district court dismissal of his defamation claim under rule b.
we begin with murray contention that the district court erred in granting the motion to dismiss and to compel arbitration of his race discrimination claim brought under title vii and against local and cash.
the federal arbitration act faa,west represents a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d,in order to reverse the longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration agreements and to place arbitration agreements upon the same footing as other contracts,green tree fin.randolph,d alteration in original quoting gilmer lane,d.pursuant to th is liberal policy,any doubts concerning the scope of arbitral issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver,delay,or a like defense to arbitrability.hilton head,cir quoting moses cone,at.when parties have entered into a valid and enforceable agreement to arbitrate their disputes and the dispute at issue falls within the scope of that agreement,the faa requires federal courts to stay judicial proceedings,see,and compel arbitration in accordance with the agreement terms,see.
it is settled that the provisions of the faa,and its policy favoring the resolution of disputes through arbitration,apply to employment agreements to arbitrate discrimination claims brought pursuant to federal statutes,including title vii of the civil rights act.see circuit city stores,adams,d hooters of,phillips,cir.such an agreement is enforceable because b y agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim,a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than judicial,forum.hooters,at quoting gilmer,at.if the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate his or her statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum,the claim is appropriately subjected to arbitration in lieu of litigation.green tree,at.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
the strength of this policy favoring the enforcement of valid arbitration agreements,however,does not end our inquiry.rather,courts are called upon to determine whether the particular dispute at issue is one to be resolved through arbitration.in doing so,we engage in a limited review to ensure that the dispute is,that a valid agreement to arbitrate exists between the parties and that the specific dispute falls within the substantive scope of that agreement.hooters,at internal quotation marks omitted.although highly circumscribed,the judicial inquiry is not focused solely on an examination for contractual formation defects such as lack of mutual assent and want of consideration.id.rather,the faa specifically contemplates that parties may also seek revocation of an arbitration agreement under such grounds as exist at law or in equity,including fraud,duress,and unconscionability.sydnor conseco fin.servicing,cir quoting.and,of course,agreements to arbitrate federal statutory claims,such as those pursued under title vii,may be revoked if the prospective litigant demonstrates that it can not effectively vindicate his or her statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum.green tree,at.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted bradford rockwell semiconductor,cir t he crucial inquiry is whether the particular claimant has an adequate and accessible substitute forum in which to resolve his statutory rights.
with these principles in mind,we turn to the question of whether a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement existed between murray and local which compelled murray to submit his race discrimination claim to arbitration.murray asserts that the arbitration clause,drafted by local and to which he was required to accede as a condition of his employment,is not valid and enforceable because it is structurally biased in favor of local.more specifically,murray points to the agreement requirement that a single arbitrator shall be chosen by the alternate strike method from a list of arbitrators provided by the president office and that,in any event,s uch arbitrator shall not have the authority to alter,change or diminish any power,right or authority granted to the president of local under the terms and conditions of the bylaws of local.construed together,murray claims,these clauses render the agreement grossly unfair and by placing choice of the arbitrator exclusively in the hands of local and providing that,in any event,local can disregard the arbitration result because the arbitrator can not alter the president authority,under the local bylaws,to terminate the employment of any personnel at the end of an assignment or in the best interest of the local union.
in accordance with the principles outlined above,we have previously recognized that equity may require invalidation of an arbitration agreement that is unconscionable,see sydnor,at hooters,at,as well as an arbitration agreement that allows an employer to ignore the arbitration result,see johnson circuit city stores,cir,at.indeed,in hooters,we revoked an arbitration agreement plagued by rules and procedures which were so that their only possible purpose was to undermine the neutrality of the proceeding.hooters,at.among other unfair procedures,the agreement in hooters provided that hooters and the employee would each select an arbitrator,who would in turn select the third arbitrator.but,the employee arbitrator and the third arbitrator were required to be selected from a list of arbitrators created exclusively by hooters.no limits were placed on whom hooters could put on the list,giving hooters absolute control over the selection of the entire panel.see id.at.such a mechanism for selecting an arbitration panel to adjudicate the employee statutory claim,we held,was one crafted to ensure a biased decisionmaker.id.at.
in this case,we are presented with a quite similar method for choosing the decisionmaker.as a condition of his employment,murray was required to enter into an arbitration agreement drafted by his prospective employer that placed control over the selection of the single arbitrator for employment disputes in the hands of his employer.the parties ostensibly engage in an alternate strike method to select the single arbitrator from a list of prospective arbitrators,but they exercise these alternate strikes from a list of arbitrators provided by local with absolutely no specified constraints.in this respect,the selection method is virtually indistinguishable from the one we disapproved of in hooters 
the employer is free to devise lists of partial arbitrators who have existing relationships,financial or familial,with the employer and its management.in fact,the rules do not even prohibit the employer from placing its managers themselves on the list.further,nothing in the rules restricts the employer from punishing arbitrators who rule against the company by removing them from the list.given the unrestricted control that the employer has over the panel,the selection of an impartial decision maker would be a surprising result.
id.at.and,as in hooters,the nature of the arbitration agreement is not limited to the employer providing itself with the exclusive right to select the list of potential arbitrators from which the ultimate decisionmaker will be selected.in the unlikely event the arbitrator rules against local,the language of the arbitration agreement in conjunction with the union bylaws,even if not ultimately enforceable,might be construed by the employee as prohibiting a decision that would contravene the president right to terminate the employee in any event.
although an arbitration agreement will not be invalidated for failure to replicate the judicial forum,id.at,we again refuse to enforce an agreement so utterly lacking in the rudiments of,id.at.by agreeing to arbitration in lieu of litigation,the parties agree to trade the procedures and opportunity for review of the courtroom for the simplicity,informality,and expedition of arbitration.id.at quoting gilmer,at.they do not agree to forego their right to have their dispute fairly resolved by an impartial third party.see id.at noting that,although objections to the fairness of an arbitral proceeding in general must be submitted to the arbitrator in the first instance,the arbitration proceeding may be so skewed in one party favor as to deny the other party arbitration in any meaningful sense of the word.in such a case,the agreement is unconscionable and one under which the prospective litigant can not effectively vindicate the statutory cause of action.see green tree,at.
for its part,local asserts that we should look beyond the language of the arbitration clause,accept that arbitration under the agreement was conducted before a fair and unbiased arbitrator,and trust that had the decision gone the other way,local would not have asserted a right to terminate murray under the agreement deference to its bylaws.we decline to do so.
before the district court,local asserted that it did not maintain a list of arbitrators and that the president office would instead have to obtain a list of neutral arbitrators from the american arbitration association labor arbitration rules or the federal mediation and conciliation service as it does in its collective bargaining agreements with employers.when murray pointed out that this procedure for selecting an arbitrator in the collective bargaining context would not apply in individual employment cases,local then argued that it would instead request a list of arbitrators under the american arbitration association national rules for the resolution of employment disputes,which could apply to individual employment cases.after the district court granted local motion to compel arbitration,such a list was obtained and a single arbitrator was selected from it using the alternate strike method.
based upon this construction of the arbitration agreement selection provision,local asserts that the agreement is valid and enforceable because it must be construed as requiring the president of local to provide a neutral list of arbitrators from which the parties can choose an arbitrator.brief of appellees at.additionally,local argues that we should not construe the agreement provision denying the selected arbitrator any authority to alter,change or diminish any power,right or authority granted to the president of local under the terms and conditions of the bylaws of local,as allowing it to disregard the arbitrator decision because,the argument goes,a discriminatory termination could not be construed as an action taken in the best interest of local.
the flaw in local argument,of course,is that there is no reference to the aaa national rules for the resolution of employment disputes,or to any other rules governing the selection of an arbitrator,anywhere in the language of the arbitration agreement,no doubt engendering the uncertainty and confusion in this case.furthermore,the agreement is not merely silent as to the selection method the selection method is to be by the alternate strike method from a list of arbitrators arbitrarily selected or created by local,and then provided to the employee.local argument,therefore,is little more than a claim that because local says it will provide a list of neutral arbitrators and abide by the ultimate arbitration decision,the selection procedure is not and the agreement is not unconscionable.we decline to allow local to salvage the agreement simply because it may have provided,after much haranguing,a list of impartial arbitrators in this case,or because it promises to act fairly in future cases.the arbitration agreement is unenforceable as written and local may not rewrite the arbitration clause and adhere to unwritten standards on a basis in order to claim that it is an acceptable one.perez globe airport sec.servs,cir rejecting attempt to rewrite unenforceable arbitration clause in order to salvage it.
nor is it appropriate for us to now adjudicate local claim that the arbitration in this case was ultimately conducted in a fair manner before an impartial arbitrator,a fact that at least appears to remain the subject of some dispute.when the order compelling arbitration was entered,the parties reasonably believed that it was not immediately appealable under this circuit existing precedent.see,american cas,cir.consequently,this appeal is the first opportunity murray has had to challenge the order of arbitration.we now know that such an order compelling arbitration and dismissing the underlying claims is a final decision with respect to an arbitration,a,which is immediately appealable.see green tree,at.the supreme court decision in green tree,however,the district court order compelling arbitration.had it been otherwise,murray would have been entitled to immediately appeal the order compelling arbitration under the agreement and challenge the validity of the agreement here before being forced to litigate his claims in the arbitral forum at all.because of the uncertainty in the law,the fact that murray has not been able to appeal the issue until now can not be held against him.in the future,this procedural uncertainty will not exist.
to conclude,we hold that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable and,therefore,that the district court erred in compelling arbitration.although we note that the district court did not have the benefit of our decision in hooters or of the supreme court in green tree when it granted local motion to compel arbitration of murray discrimination claims,we are nonetheless constrained to reverse the order compelling arbitration and remand the claims for litigation in the judicial forum.
we now turn to murray claim that the district court erred in ruling that murray failed to state an actionable defamation claim against sauter and local under maryland law and,therefore,in dismissing the claim pursuant to rule b.in dismissing the claim,the district court ruled that sauter statement that murray was not a good organizer was not defamatory per se under maryland law,and that the statement was merely the expression of sauter opinion,as opposed to one of fact,which could be neither verified nor refuted in litigation.
under maryland law,a defamatory statement is one that tends to expose a person to public scorn,hatred,contempt or ridicule,thereby discouraging others in the community from having a good opinion of,or from associating or dealing with,that person.samuels tschechtelin,internal quotation marks omitted.to establish a prima facie case of defamation when the plaintiff is not a public figure,the plaintiff must prove that the defendant made a defamatory communication to a third person that the statement was false that the defendant was at fault in communicating the statement and that the plaintiff suffered harm.id.at.
while the tort of defamation is generally viewed as one based upon false assertions of fact,it may also be based upon the expression of an opinion to a third person if the opinion contains implied assertions of underlying objective fact.id.at.although loose,figurative,or hyperbolic language expressing a mere opinion may not fairly be viewed as being defamatory,milkovich lorain journal,d,a false statement of fact can not escape liability for defamation under the guise of opinion.samuels,at citing milkovich,at.a statement,even if expressed in terms of an opinion,can be defamatory under certain circumstances when the underlying facts used to form the opinion are not given along with the defamatory statement,the statement itself may be treated as being factual and therefore potentially defamatory.peroutka streng.
subsequent to the district court dismissal of murray defamation claim in this case,the maryland court of special appeals held that an employer statement that an employee had been terminated for poor performance was defamatory per se under its law.samuels,at see id.at.murray claim of defamation has its genesis in the allegation that sauter stated,at least twice,to one or more giant employees,that murray was not a good organizer,and that he did so with knowledge of the falsity of this statement and with the intent to injure murray.sauter,it is alleged,was the organizing director for local and made these statements shortly after murray was terminated from his employment as a organizer for local.while perhaps an expression of sauter opinion of murray,it is at least arguably an opinion that might be construed as implying murray failure to fulfill the duties of his position of a union organizer.because the alleged defamatory statement contains such implied assertions of underlying objective fact,samuels,at,and in view of this recent maryland precedent,we hold that murray allegation was sufficient to survive a rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for defamation under maryland law and,accordingly,reverse and remand this claim for further proceedings as well.
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the district court decision granting defendants motion to dismiss murray title vii claim and compelling arbitration,reverse the district court decision granting defendants motion to dismiss murray state law defamation claim,and remand this matter for further proceedings.

i concur with the majority decision in part iii.however,because i think an arbitration agreement is not rendered unconscionable merely by its failure to state how a party will obtain a list of arbitrators,i respectfully dissent from part ii of the majority opinion.
the issue presented in part ii is whether equitable grounds exist for the revocation of an otherwise valid agreement to arbitrate.the majority concludes that an arbitration agreement silence with respect to an employer procedures for obtaining a list of arbitrators renders the arbitration agreement unconscionable.the majority also indicates that an arbitration agreement contains unconscionable terms when an employee might construe the arbitration agreement and bylaws as allowing the president of the union to fire an employee irrespective of the arbitrator decision.
i consider the majority refusal to enforce the arbitration clause on unconscionability grounds inconsistent with both supreme court and fourth circuit precedent.see green tree fin.randolph,d hooters of am.phillips,cir.first,i do not believe that an arbitration agreement failure to specify how a party obtains a list of arbitrators is a contract provision egregious enough to shock the conscience.second,murray has failed to show an anticipatory breach by the union in providing a list of neutral arbitrators to hear the parties dispute.finally,i decline to read the arbitration agreement and bylaws as foreclosing a decision unfavorable to the union.accordingly,i would affirm the district court decision to dismiss murray discrimination claim and compel arbitration.
