michelle laurenti appeals from an order requiring her to pay all fees billed by a evaluator who was disqualified from further service in this family law matter on michelle successful motion.michelle contends the evaluator should receive no compensation because he violated court rules by making improper ex parte communications,and he was removed from the matter by the court before he completed his evaluation and made a recommendation.michelle also contends the trial court erred in failing to determine a reasonable fee for the evaluator services and,instead,ordering michelle to pay whatever amount the evaluator charged.we agree with the latter contention.accordingly,we reverse the order and remand the matter for the trial court to hold a hearing to determine a reasonable fee,if any,to be paid for the evaluator services and the proper allocation of that fee among the parties.
