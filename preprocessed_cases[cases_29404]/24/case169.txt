background 
the following facts do not appear to be in dispute.
a.the parties and the prior settlements 
merrill lynch is in the business of providing financial services,including retail brokerage services.schwartz has been employed by merrill lynch as a financial advisor fa since.
during schwartz tenure as a merrill lynch fa,it was the firm policy to compensate fas formerly called financial consultants on the basis of their respective production credits,which were based on the total commissions generated by each fa for the firm from his or her client accounts.the accounts of an fa who leaves the firm,dies,or retires are normally distributed to other fas at that merrill lynch office in accordance with the firm account distribution policy or adp or adp policy,which,since mid,has involved a ranking system that calculates adp scores by taking into account such factors as the fas education,revenues generated,membership in merrill lynch recognition clubs based on revenue production,and generation of new assets.if the departing fa was a member of a team of fas,those client accounts may instead be distributed to the members of his or her team.
in,schwartz was a member of a class of women who sued merrill lynch alleging principally that the firm engaged in gender discrimination by steering lucrative client accounts disproportionately to male fas rather than female fas,thereby causing female fas to have fewer production credits,and hence lower earnings,than comparably qualified male fas.see cremin merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,c.amended complaint,cremin.the cremin action was settled on a basis in,with merrill lynch agreeing to adopt new standards to ensure that client account distributions would be designed to serve the interests of firm customers based on nondiscriminatory standards.
in the settlement,merrill lynch also agreed,inter alia,to create two new dispute resolution mechanisms a claims resolution process crp in which members of the class could pursue their cremin claims before neutral mediators and arbitrators,and an employment dispute resolution program edr that gave female fas the option of presenting to neutral and independent arbitrators any future claims.the rules adopted to govern proceedings under the edr program edr rules provided,inter alia,that the arbitrators shall be governed by and required to follow the applicable law when making awards edr rule iii,and that any arbitral award will be final and binding and may be enforced under the federal arbitration act title and shall be reviewable only under the standards of the federal arbitration act edr rule iii.
following the settlement,schwartz pursued her cremin claim against merrill lynch through the crp.she and the firm settled that claim in a settlement agreement and mutual release,executed by schwartz on april,release or crp release.the release which was submitted to this court under seal and is hereby deemed unsealed only to the extent that it is quoted or described in this opinion stated that schwartz,defined as claimant,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives,releases and forever discharges merrill lynch and others defined therein as releasees with respect to any and all claims,rights,obligations,liabilities,promises,agreements,demands and causes of action of any kind whatsoever,in law or equity,whether known or unknown,existing or contingent,suspected or unsuspected,apparent or concealed herein collectively claims,claimant now or in the future may have against merrill lynch or releasees for,upon or by reason of any matter,cause or thing whatsoever to the day of the date she executes this settlement agreement and mutual release including,without limitation,any and all claims arising out of or relating to claimant employment,compensation and benefits with merrill lynch 
emphases added.the release stated that schwartz was not releas ing any claim that arises from events occurring after the date of this release.
schwartz new claims and the arbitrators decisions 
in,pursuant to the edr,schwartz sought mediation of claims asserting that merrill lynch had continued to discriminate against her as a female fa despite the cremin settlement and that the firm had retaliated against her for participating in the cremin class action.when mediation failed,schwartz new claims were submitted to arbitration in december.schwartz contended principally that merrill lynch continued to deny her valuable assets and resources,including account distributions and managerial and administrative support,on the basis of account distribution policy credits.she argued that this practice institutionalized the pattern of discriminatory conduct that had occurred during the era men were always ranked higher than women because years of discrimination in their favor had provided them with accounts that allowed them to generate greater production credits than women,and by reason of those rankings their ability to receive larger client accounts than those distributed to women was perpetuated.schwartz also asserted that merrill lynch had denied her equal opportunities to team with other fas,and that two of its branch managers had allowed male fas to form sham teams in order to enable the male fas to receive the client accounts of their departing team members.she alleged that this conduct,bypassing the adp policy,further increased male fas adp scores by reason of their receipt of such accounts.
merrill lynch promptly moved,inter alia,to confine schwartz edr arbitration to events subsequent to schwartz crp release.in april,arbitrator carol wittenberg,the single arbitrator before whom the matter was then pending,ruled that schwartz claims arising from events that occurred before april,were barred by the cremin settlement and the release,but that schwartz could offer evidence of events that occurred shortly before that date if they were relevant to her claims of discrimination on or after that date 
merrill lynch seeks to bar all claims that occurred prior to claimant settlement and mutual release of claims against merrill lynch dated april.claimant asserts that she seeks recovery only for new claims and new injuries occurring after april.claimant argues,however,that evidence regarding events that occurred prior to april,may be relevant and admissible to such claims,including claims of a hostile work environment.
the arbitrator concurs that the only claims for which claimant may seek recovery in this proceeding are claims that occurred subsequent to april,claimant settlement and mutual release of claims.however,claimant may seek to introduce evidence of events occurring in close proximity to that date only if reference to such prior event s is relevant to the current complaint.
order of arbitrator carol wittenberg dated april,at wittenberg order.
hearings on schwartz claims,before a panel chaired by arbitrator wittenberg the panel,were scheduled for the spring of.in may,the united states supreme court issued its decision in ledbetter goodyear tire rubber,dealing with the time within which a federal claim of discriminatory compensation must be filed.the court ruled that b ecause a decision is a discrete act,it follows that the period for filing an eeoc charge begins when th at act occurs.ledbetter,at emphasis added.the court rejected the contention that each pay check issued to the plaintiff constituted a cognizable act of discrimination,concluding that when the disparate pay is received during the statutory limitations period,but is the result of intentionally discriminatory pay decisions that occurred outside the limitations period,the claim for discrimination in salary in violation of title vii is,id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
prior to the presentation of evidence at schwartz arbitration hearing before the panel,merrill lynch moved in limine to preclude evidence it anticipated schwartz would offer with respect to events that preceded the april release.merrill lynch argued that such evidence was precluded not only by the terms of the release but also by the supreme court decision in ledbetter.in opposition,schwartz argued that evidence of events prior to april was needed to show that merrill lynch practices used criteria that were tainted by its genderdiscriminatory practices,with its devices institutionalizing the distributions that took place during the cremin period arbitration hearing transcript tr,at see also id.at urging the relevance of evidence as to the conduct of a merrill lynch branch manager going back to and.merrill lynch pressed its argument based on the release 
we dealing with a claim that has been released.she has released her claim as of april and it gone and events that happened prior to that,they inadmissible.
if you released that claim,you ca then come and offer evidence relating to things that you released.and here we talking about facts that are two years prior to the release.
the panel,pointing out that the chair ha d already ruled that schwartz case starts with april and that schwartz would not be permitted to go back and relitigate cremin id.at,decided that the testimony of two of schwartz proposed witnesses would be excluded because the time period when they were at merrill lynch is too remote to our date of april,id.at,but that two other proposed witnesses may testify as long as their testimony related to events that occurred in close proximity to the date of april,id.in the course of the hearing,the panel decided that events occurring not more than six months before april,would meet the close proximity test.see,id.at,see also id.at excluding,under that test,evidence of an august communication offered by merrill lynch.
the hearing was held on may and august.in a decision and award dated november,award,the panel began by stating that schwartz release had sharply restrict ed the scope of the claims that could be addressed by the panel and that schwartz argument that merrill lynch discriminated against her during the actionable period by relying on objective criteria which she claims were tainted by acts of discrimination prior to her settlement was foreclosed by her settlement and release.award at.as to the merits,the panel majority discussed the evidence in detail see id.at and concluded that schwartz ha d not established a violation of federal,state or local law pertaining to gender discrimination,retaliation,or breach of contract,or any other violation of law id.at.arbitrator wittenberg dissented from the merits decision,stating her view that schwartz had proven discrimination in violation of title vii and the new york human rights law between the summer of and october.see award at.
c.the fair pay act and schwartz petition to vacate the award 
in late january,congress the president signed into law the lilly ledbetter fair pay act to overrule the supreme court decision in ledbetter.the fair pay act provides that an unlawful employment practice occurs,with respect to discrimination in compensation in violation of title of the not only when the discriminatory compensation decision is made,but also when the victim of that decision is affected by application of that decision,including each time wages,benefits,or other compensation is paid,resulting in whole or in part from such a decision or other practice,stat.congress made the fair pay act retroactive with respect to claims under,inter alia,title vii that were pending on may,the day before the supreme court decided ledbetter.see,stat.
on february,schwartz filed her present petition in the district court to vacate the panel award,arguing,to the extent pertinent to this appeal,that since her claim was pending on may,the panel decision to exclude evidence of merrill lynch conduct was clearly contrary to the new fair pay act petition to vacate arbitration award.the district court,in a memorandum order dated february,reported at wl,denied the petition,finding that schwartz had identified no grounds under the faa for vacatur of an arbitration award and no manifest disregard of the law by the arbitrators.the district court found that there was no violation of the letter or the spirit of the fair pay act because the arbitrators had rendered their decision months before passage of the fair pay act,and they neither had relied on ledbetter nor had failed to apply the law as it existed at the time of the award 
t he panel decided to limit recovery on the basis of schwartz full release of her claims to april,not because of the supreme court decision in ledbetter the matter ultimately was an issue of contract law and the scope of schwartz full release.indeed,the final award gives no attention to ledbetter.even assuming the fair pay act overrode schwartz contractual release,the arbitrators issued the final award in november,prior to the passage of the fair pay act.see brown rauscher pierce refsnes,cir panel interpretation of law must be wholly unfounded at the time it is rendered to justify vacatur see also sobel yeshiva,i t is beyond question that a pending case must be decided under the law in effect at the time it is decided.a change in the decisional law after the entry of a final award is not grounds for vacatur.
wl,at.the court also found that the record did not support schwartz contention that the panel had disregarded relevant and admissible evidence of past discrimination 
the record shows the panel accepted evidence of the cremin settlement which detailed earlier discrimination at merrill lynch.moreover,the record reveals that the panel remained flexible about accepting evidence of activities so long as it was relevant.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,schwartz contends principally that the award should be vacated as a matter of law on the ground that,based on the supreme court decision in ledbetter,she was denied important legal rights provided by title vii and the fair pay act,namely,the opportunity to present and recover for her claims that she lost substantial compensation during the actionable liability period based on or related to discriminatory decisions and acts that the charge filing period schwartz brief on appeal at see also id.at the fair pay act allows recovery under title vii for acts that transpired prior to the liability period if they diminish compensation during the liability period.schwartz claims that a t the outset of the hearing,the arbitrators accepted merrill lynch ledbetter argument schwartz brief on appeal at.she asserts that 
merrill lynch relied heavily on the supreme court decision in ledbetter 
based on merrill lynch argument,the arbitration panel prevented schwartz from introducing any evidence regarding merrill lynch discriminatory practices prior to october,and barred schwartz from recovering for merrill lynch discriminatory conduct after april if the challenged conduct relied on or related to acts occurring before october.
