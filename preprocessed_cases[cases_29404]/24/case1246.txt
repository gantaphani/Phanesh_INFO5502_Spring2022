plaintiff bunker hill park limited bunker hill filed a petition to compel arbitration with its tenant,defendant bank national association,to resolve the parties disagreement over whether subleases automatically terminate if the underlying lease between bunker hill and bank terminates.the trial court denied the petition on the grounds that the parties disagreement had not ripened into a justiciable controversy meriting declaratory relief.bunker hill timely appealed.for the reasons stated below,we reverse and remand with directions to grant the petition.
factual and procedural background 
the facts underlying this appeal are not in dispute.the parties are to a year ground lease governing a parcel of land located at south figueroa street in downtown los angeles.landlord bunker hill owns the land,and tenant bank owns the five office buildings and other improvements erected on the parcel until the lease expires in or is terminated,at which point the improvements become the property of bunker hill.bunker hill may terminate the ground lease only if bank defaults.bank,on the other hand,may terminate the ground lease at any time so long as it provides bunker hill with days advance notice.bank also is permitted to assign its interest in the ground lease and to sublet the property.bank has exercised the latter right.
the ground lease requires bank to pay an annual basic net rent,the amount of which is to be adjusted in april and april.the parties were unable to agree on the proper amount of the april adjustment.pursuant to an arbitration provision contained in an amendment to the ground lease that requires arbitration of a ny and all disputes,controversies,or claims arising under or relating to the ground lease,this amendment,or the enforcement of the provisions thereunder or the determination of the parties rights and obligations thereunder,including but not limited to any unlawful detainer actions,the subject matter of the complaint the subject matter of the cross complaint.the parties arbitrated their dispute over the basic net rent in december.
during the course of that arbitration,bunker hill argued that the basic net rent should reflect the value of the land at its highest and best use,which its expert opined was not hosting a office complex but rather housing a or residential development.bank retorted that no redevelopment of the property could be pursued in the near future because it had entered into various lengthy subleases that could not be terminated prematurely.bank further argued that bunker hill would take title subject to the subleases in the event that the ground lease terminated before its expiration.bunker hill maintained that the subleases would terminate concurrently with any termination of the ground lease.
the arbitrator made no mention of subleases or their fate upon termination of the ground lease in his january,arbitration award the parties nevertheless continued discussing these issues.on february,bunker hill sent a letter to bank.the letter reaffirmed bunker hill position that any subleases would terminate along with the ground lease and requested that bunker hill views on the subject be made clear to the property manager,leasing agent,subtenants,and any broker that bank may engage,so as to minimize the likelihood of confusion or problems with subtenants or assignees.bank responded by letter dated february.as for the substantive issue about whether bunker hill is bound by the subleases,bank stated that it can not agree simply to disagree on the issue because in its view bunker hill stance effectively makes the property and unsellable and bank believes that bunker hill is attempting to interfere improperly with bank actual and prospective economic advantage and contractual rights.accordingly,bank invoked the ground lease arbitration provision and demand ed binding arbitration on the issue.
bunker hill acceded to the demand and the parties began moving toward arbitration pursuant to the expedited schedule set forth in the arbitration provision.bunker hill proposed three potential arbitrators on march,and the parties engaged in a exchange regarding their preferences before agreeing on an arbitrator on march,the final day of the day selection period set forth in the arbitration provision.counsel for bank proposed a draft arbitration agreement on march,which counsel for bunker hill took the liberty of revising on april.also on april,counsel for bunker hill contacted the arbitration agency to reserve an arbitration date of may,the earliest date on which the selected arbitrator was available.counsel for bank requested that bunker hill hold off on submitting the case management fee to the arbitration agency,however,so that he could confer with bank on several issues.
by april,bunker hill had not heard back from bank.bank silence prompted some concern on bunker hill end,as it feared that bank may be having reservations about proceeding with an arbitration on the sublease issue at this time.in a letter dated april,bunker hill informed bank that i t is important to bunker hill that the issue that bank has raised relating to the subleases be determined expeditiously.by the same letter,bunker hill formally request ed an arbitration on the sublease issue.it also expressed a willingness to work with bank to finalize the arbitration agreement and to consider an alternative schedule if necessary.
bank responded by letter dated april.in that letter,bank acknowledge d the request of bunker hill set forth in its february,letter,that bank take into account bunker hill position that subleases are not binding upon bunker hill upon any termination of the subject ground lease and agreed to take that position into account.bank further acknowledge d bunker hill request that its position on subleases be made clear to the property manager,leasing agent,subtenants,and any broker that bank may engage,and stated that it would provide the appropriate notifications at the appropriate times to the appropriate parties.in light of these acknowledgments,bank advised bunker hill that it d id not see the need at this point to proceed with a new arbitration on this issue.
bunker hill responded with a letter dated april.it advised bank that it is unclear exactly what notices bank is offering to provide,when the notices will be provided,and to whom they will be provided.bunker hill further asserted that in any case,such notices will not resolve the dispute and will thus be insufficient to eliminate the possibility that there will be litigation or an arbitration with successors to bank interest in the ground lease or subtenants.bunker hill also opined that the uncertainty that will remain until the issue relating to the effect of a termination of the ground lease is resolved will adversely impact bunker hill interest in the property in question.bunker hill therefore reiterated its intention to proceed with the arbitration and expressed hope that bank will cooperate in scheduling the arbitration and complying with the related requirements in the arbitration provision.bunker hill also enclosed another copy of the april,draft of the arbitration agreement for bank to review.
bank responded via email dated april.it contended that both of bunker hill reasons for moving forward with the arbitration were based on the faulty premise that there will be an early termination of the ground lease before its termination in.bank went on to explain that it has provided no indication,nor is there any independent basis to conclude,that there will be an early termination of the ground lease.we thus fail to see the need for arbitration of an issue based on the possibility of a future event early termination of the ground lease that is purely hypothetical in nature.bank also reiterated its april,contention that its agreement to provide notice of bunker hill position to subtenants further evidences that there is no live dispute to be arbitrated.bank acknowledged that bunker hill had the right to petition to compel arbitration,but advised bunker hill that if it did so,we would ask the court to send any arbitration if the petition is granted to chernick the arbitrator who resolved the net rent dispute,given his familiarity with the property.bank further reserve d the right to ask chernick,or any other arbitrator,to reopen the prior proceeding to consider lowering the basic net rent set by chernick in light of bunker hill post arbitration conduct,which we believe adversely impacts the basic net rent analysis conducted by judge chernick.
bunker hill responded on april.in its email,bunker hill set forth the reasons why it believed that t he dispute needs to be resolved promptly,namely the threats that bank has made the impact of the dispute remaining unresolved on bunker hill property interests the absence of an agreement on exactly what disclosures should be made,when they should be made,or to whom they should be made and the fact that merely disclosing the dispute to potential purchasers and subtenants will not eliminate the uncertainty or impact,resolve the dispute,or eliminate the possibility of future litigation.bunker hill advised bank that it planned to file a petition to compel arbitration later in the day.
bunker hill followed through on its promise to file a petition to compel arbitration on april.bunker hill provided the court with the arbitration provision,two of the letters the parties had exchanged concerning arbitration,a declaration from one of its attorneys,and the following explanation of the disagreement there is presently a dispute between bhpl bunker hill and bank regarding their respective rights and obligations under the ground lease the dispute.specifically,bhpl contends that,upon termination of the ground lease,any and all existing subleases,except those with respect to which a agreement has been executed by bhpl and an attornment agreement has been executed by the subtenant,will be automatically terminated.bhpl is informed and believes,and on that basis alleges,that bank disputes bhpl contention and,in particular,contends that each sublease will remain in place throughout its term,and that bhpl will be required to fulfill bank obligations under each sublease,regardless of the termination of the ground lease and regardless of whether bhpl has agreed that it will not disturb said sublease.bhpl disputes this contention.in the memorandum of points and authorities accompanying its petition,bunker hill argued that the parties disagreement was a controversy within the meaning of code of civil procedure,section,subdivision c and that it was entitled to an order compelling arbitration under section because it satisfied the statutory criteria and none of the three exceptions set forth in that statute was applicable to the instant case.
bank opposed the petition on the grounds that bunker hill failed to allege facts demonstrating the existence of an actual arbitrable controversy.bank contended that bunker hill improperly was asking for arbitration about a hypothetical whether the subleases are binding in the event that the ground lease ever terminates early at some point in the future,and seeking an advisory opinion about a hypothetical event.bank analogized the disagreement to a request for declaratory relief regarding potential future rights dependent on events that are highly unlikely to occur,and argued that declaratory relief about future potential rights based on events that have not yet happened and may never happen is not appropriate under these circumstances.it further argued that arbitration was inappropriate for the additional reason that it is the subtenants whose rights will be impacted by any arbitration ruling,b ut they are not parties to the ground lease or its arbitration provision and would not be parties to any arbitration compelled by this court.
in its reply,bunker hill argued that the dispute identified in bhpl petition is arbitrable under code civ.proc,and because it concerns a question or disagreement between the parties as to the consequences of a termination of the ground lease and as to which declaratory relief is available.bunker hill also attempted to distinguish the cases bank relied upon,and reiterated its contention that the only bases for denying the petition were those set forth in section.
in its order resolving the matter,the trial court recognized the strong public policy in favor of arbitration and the presumption in favor of arbitrability.it also noted that section requires the enforcement of arbitration agreements unless one of three limited exceptions applies a party waives the right to arbitration grounds exist for revoking the arbitration agreement and pending litigation with a third party creates the possibility of conflicting rulings on common factual or legal issues.acquire ii,colton real estate group th.without addressing whether any of these exceptions applied,the court denied the petition on the grounds that the issue of the effect of the termination of the ground lease on the subleases is not sufficiently crystallized such that declaratory relief is appropriate.the court,which characterized the question presented as whether the respective parties dispute over the effect of termination of the ground lease on the subleases presents an actual controversy,is ripe as petitioner contends,or whether adjudication of the dispute would be tantamount to rendering an advisory opinion as respondent contends,concluded that no actual controversy existed between the parties.the trial court added that it was also troubled by the lack of input or notice to the sublessees who might be directly affected by a ruling in support of the request being made by petitioner,bunker hill.it noted that the denial of the petition was without prejudice to refiling after termination of the subject ground lease,should such event ever take place.bunker hill timely appealed pursuant to section,subdivision a.

standard of review 
there is no uniform standard of review for evaluating an order denying a motion to compel arbitration.robertson health net of california th.if the court order is based on a decision of fact,then we adopt a substantial evidence standard.citations.alternatively,if the court decision rests solely on a decision of law,then a de novo standard of review is employed.ibid.the abuse of discretion standard also is applied in some cases,generally those in which the denial is based upon section,subdivision c.lindemann hume th.bunker hill advocates for the de novo standard because the pertinent facts are undisputed and no extrinsic evidence is in play.see,avery integrated healthcare holdings,th,avery interpreting a written document to determine whether it is an enforceable arbitration agreement is a question of law subject to de novo review when the parties do not offer conflicting extrinsic evidence regarding the document meaning.bank contends that the more generous abuse of discretion standard is applicable because the trial court denied the petition due to bunker hill failure to allege specific facts showing entitlement to declaratory relief,and analyzing the petition requires the court to determine whether declaratory relief is ripe.bank also contends that r egardless of which standard applies,the trial court ruling was proper and should be affirmed in all respects.
we conclude that the de novo standard of review is the appropriate one to apply here.the trial court decision rested on its conclusion that the petition failed to present an actual controversy sufficiently ripe for adjudication.whether this decision was based upon the court interpretation of the parties arbitration agreement,its application of section,section,subdivision c or some combination of those two provisions,or simply a general determination that the action was unripe,it was a legal decision that must be examined anew.avery,supra,th at wilson wilson city council of redwood city th,american meat institute leeman th,coopers lybrand superior court d.accordingly,in the course of our analysis,we may consider legal arguments that were not raised below,cal sierra construction,comerica bank th.
