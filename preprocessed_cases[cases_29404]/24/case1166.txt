leviton manufacturing,leviton appeals the grant of a preliminary injunction to enforce a forum selection clause in a settlement agreement which resolved a prior lawsuit brought by leviton against general protecht group,formerly known as zhejiang dongzheng electrical gpg.because the district court correctly determined that the forum selection clause applies to this case and did not abuse its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction,this court affirms.
background 
leviton and gpg are both manufacturers of ground fault circuit interrupters gfcis.in and,leviton sued gpg and three other defendants,including two of the appellees,in the district of new mexico for infringement of patent and patent and patent respectively.in,the parties settled that lawsuit pursuant to the terms of a confidential settlement agreement settlement agreement.the settlement agreement included the following covenant not to sue 
leviton also hereby covenants not to sue defendants for alleged infringement of the patents based on the dongzheng products currently accused of infringement and defendants for alleged infringement of the patent the patent with respect to an anticipated future new gfci product that defendant dongzheng has indicated its intent to market in the in the future,provided however that the future product conforms to a submitted design.

in addition,the settlement agreement included the following clause entitled governing 
any dispute between the parties relating to or arising out of this settlement agreement shall be prosecuted exclusively in the united states district court for the district of new mexico.the parties consent to the venue and jurisdiction of such court for this purpose.
protecht,wl,at.
in september,leviton filed a complaint with the international trade commission itc alleging infringement by gpg and its distributors the other appellees here of patents and patent and patent respectively.around the same time,leviton filed a complaint against appellees and other defendants in the northern district of california alleging infringement of the same two patents.the and patents are both continuations ultimately depending from the applications that issued as the and patents.both the and patents issued after the settlement agreement was executed and the prior litigation resolved.
following receipt of these complaints,gpg informed leviton that it believed it had a license to practice the asserted patents under the settlement agreement,and that leviton was required to bring its case in the district of new mexico pursuant to the forum selection clause in the same agreement.the parties were unable to agree,and appellees filed a complaint in the district of new mexico asserting claims for breach of contract,and invalidity.gpg also moved in new mexico for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against leviton continued litigation of the dispute outside of new mexico.
the new mexico district court granted the preliminary injunction enforcing the forum selection clause of the settlement agreement.the district court found that there was a likelihood of success on the merits because gpg had asserted a defense of implied license,which likely triggered the forum selection clause,and because gpg was likely to succeed on the merits of this defense.protecht,wl,at.the district court also considered the other three preliminary injunction factors irreparable harm,balance of hardships,public interest and found that each favored entry of a preliminary injunction.id.at.
leviton appealed and sought expedited review,which this court granted,and a stay pending appeal of the preliminary injunction,which this court denied.in december,pursuant to the preliminary injunction,leviton voluntarily dismissed its california action and moved to dismiss the itc case against the gpg products.that motion was granted.
on appeal,leviton essentially makes three arguments the forum selection clause does not apply because it does not extend to cases in which the only relationship the settlement agreement bears to the subsequent dispute is that it possibly gives rise to a defense even if the forum selection clause could apply in such cases,the settlement agreement does not give rise to an implied license defense in the present case as a matter of law and the district court erred in its application of the remaining three preliminary injunction factors.
leviton timely appealed and this court has jurisdiction pursuant to a,c,and a.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
although this court generally applies the law of the respective regional circuit on questions of procedure,this court applies its own law in reviewing procedural matters arising from substantive issues in areas of law within its exclusive jurisdiction.see.instruments tessera.in a case such as this,involving an injunction against participation in a district court suit for patent infringement and an itc investigation under section of the tariff act,this court procedural law applies.id.under federal circuit law,this court sustains a grant or denial of a preliminary injunction unless the district court abused its discretion,or based its decision on an erroneous legal standard or clearly erroneous findings of fact.id.
likelihood of success on the merits 
forum selection clause 
the forum selection clause in the settlement agreement states in relevant part that any dispute between the parties relating to or arising out of this settlement agreement shall be prosecuted exclusively in the united states district court for the district of new mexico.protecht,wl,at.thus,whether gpg is likely to succeed on the merits of applying the forum selection clause depends on whether its implied license defense crosses the threshold required to trigger the relating to or arising out of provision of that clause.the parties disagree about how high this threshold really is.
as leviton argues,if all that is required is a license and a bare allegation that it provides a defense,then virtually every subsequent dispute between contracting parties would trigger such a forum selection clause.on the other hand,as gpg argues,if a party seeking to enforce a forum selection clause in the context of a license defense must first establish,conclusively,that it would win the license defense,such a forum selection clause would be meaningless because if the defense should fail,then the merits would have been litigated in a forum other than that which was bargained for and if the defense should succeed,there would likely be nothing left to litigate once the case arrives in the proper forum.
in texas instruments,this court held that p atent infringement disputes do arise from license agreements and that where the governing law clause of the license agreement is not limited to license related issues such as the amount of royalty due,term of agreement,and cross licensing,that clause,as in any patent license agreement,necessarily covers disputes concerning patent issues.at.this case presents a dispute regarding the scope of a patent license.the outcome of that dispute will determine whether the patentee can sustain its suit for infringement.thus,there is no question in this case that the dispute relates to or arises out of the settlement agreement.the forum selection clause therefore applies,and the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the preliminary injunction on that basis.
implied license 
the controlling case on the implied license question presented here is transcore electronic transaction consultants.in settling a prior case,transcore had in effect licensed mark iv by covenanting not to sue under multiple patents covering automated toll collection technology.id.at.the settlement agreement included the following provisions 
transcore hereby agrees and covenants not to bring any demand,claim,lawsuit,or action against mark iv for future infringement of the asserted patents for the entire remainder of the terms of the respective patents.this covenant not to sue shall not apply to any other patents issued as of the effective date of this agreement or to be issued in the future.
transcore fully and forever release s,discharge s and dismiss es all claims,demands,actions,causes of action,liens and rights,in law or in equity known,unknown,contingent,accrued,inchoate or otherwise,existing as of june,that it has against mark iv but excluding any claims for breach of this agreement.no express or implied license or future release whatsoever is granted to mark iv or to any third party by this release.
later,transcore sued electronic transaction consultants etc,a third party consulting and systems integration firm engaged by mark iv,for infringement of three of the same patents and important for this case one additional related patent that was pending before the patent and trademark office but had not yet issued at the time of the transcore mark iv settlement.id.at.
the court found that transcore rights in the previously asserted patents,as against mark iv technology,were exhausted by its covenant not to sue mark iv.id.at.as to the continuation patent,the court found that it was impliedly licensed to mark iv and that the implied license also exhausted transcore rights in that patent as against the mark iv technology being installed by.id.at.
as this court reiterated in transcore 
the essence of legal estoppel that can be found in the estoppel of the implied license doctrine involves the fact that that the licensor has licensed a definable property right for valuable consideration,and then has attempted to derogate or detract from that right.the grantor is estopped from taking back in any extent that for which he has already received consideration.
id.at quoting amp united states.as this court further explained,t he basic principle is quite simple legal estoppel refers to a narrow category of conduct encompassing scenarios where a patentee has licensed or assigned a right,received consideration,and then sought to derogate from the right granted.id.quoting wang,mitsubishi elecs.
the transcore court then held that mark iv rights under its implied license to the continuation patent are necessarily coextensive with the rights it received in the transcore mark iv license agreement.id.at.and the court found that 
t he language of the settlement agreement,which states that t his covenant not to sue shall not apply to any other patents to be issued in the future,is not to the contrary.this language may protect transcore against broad claims that future patents generally are impliedly licensed,but it does not permit transcore to derogate from the rights it has expressly granted.
in the present case,the new mexico district court explained that u nder transcore the settlement agreement granted an implied license to the and patents,if gpg must practice the and patents to obtain the benefit of their bargain to practice the and patents.protecht,wl,at.finding this condition met,the court ruled in gpg favor.the district court also responded to leviton argument that this case could involve other products outside the scope of the settlement agreement by noting that if leviton wishes to conduct discovery whether other products allegedly infringe its patents,it may conduct such discovery in this forum.id.at.
on appeal,leviton argues that transcore does not control the present case because transcore is limited to cases where the claims of the continuation are broader than and therefore necessary to practice the claims of the expressly licensed patents the manifest mutual intent of the parties in the present case was to convey narrower rights than were conveyed in transcore such that no license can be implied here and such a result conflicts with this court holding in the earlier decided case of jacobs nintendo of america.we address each argument in turn.
i.the effect of transcore 
here,leviton urges that,because at least some claims of its continuations are narrower than the previously asserted claims,asserting the newer,narrower claims does not derogate from the right to practice the licensed claims.leviton notes that its new claims have limitations such as a electrical circuit,a mounting flange,and a socket,which were not claimed in the licensed patents.
leviton can not deny,however,that the newly asserted continuations are based on the same disclosure as the previously licensed patents and that,by definition,the continuations can claim no new invention not already supported in the earlier issued patents.moreover,the same products accused in the earlier suit are accused here.
transcore prohibits a patent licensor from derogating from rights granted under the license by taking back in any extent that for which it has already received consideration.at quotation omitted.in this case,leviton actions have unquestionably derogated from gpg rights under the settlement agreement.the same products were accused.the same inventive subject matter was disclosed in the licensed patents.if leviton did not intend its license of these products to extend to claims presented in continuation patents,it had an obligation to make that clear.
from our holding in transcore it reasonably follows that where,as here,continuations issue from parent patents that previously have been licensed as to certain products,it may be presumed that,absent a clear indication of mutual intent to the contrary,those products are impliedly licensed under the continuations as well.if the parties intend otherwise,it is their burden to make such intent clear in the license.it is well settled that parties are free to contract around an interpretive presumption that does not reflect their intentions.indeed,patent license agreements can be written to convey different scopes of promises not to sue,a promise not to sue under a specific patent or,more broadly,a promise not to sue under any patent the licensor now has or may acquire in the future.spindelfabrik suessen schurr,stahlecker grill gmbh schubert salzer maschinenfabrik aktiengesellschaft.in this case,leviton did not do so.
ii.mutual intent of the parties 
leviton argues that the mutual intent of the parties in the present case distinguishes this case from the facts of transcore.leviton contends that a number of provisions in the settlement agreement make clear that the parties intended that settlement to be merely a walk away.appellant reply br.at.for instance,leviton refers to provisions preserving leviton right to sue on related patents and gpg right to rely on the prior claim constructions and its inequitable conduct defense.leviton argues that each of these provisions,by anticipating future litigation,evidences mutual intent not to grant any rights that would imply a license to any other patents.
transcore is instructive in addressing leviton arguments.the settlement agreement there stated that this covenant not to sue shall not apply to any other patents issued as of the effective date of this agreement or to be issued in the future.transcore,at.nonetheless,this court found that,by filing the subsequent suit,transcore had derogated from the right it previously granted and that therefore the continuation patent was impliedly licensed.
the provisions to which leviton points manifest a mutual understanding that future litigation between the parties concerning related patents was a distinct possibility.but this does not address the question of whether the parties intended that continuations could be asserted against the same products.at best,the settlement agreement is silent on this point.at worst,the careful establishment of rules of engagement without any mention of later suits involving the same products and related patents shows that leviton did not reserve this right.expressio unius exclusio alterius.the question of mutual intent in the present case is controlled by transcore.
iii.jacobs does not conflict 
finally,leviton argues that,if interpreted to compel a finding of implied license in the present case,then transcore conflicts with this court prior holding in jacobs nintendo of america,an
