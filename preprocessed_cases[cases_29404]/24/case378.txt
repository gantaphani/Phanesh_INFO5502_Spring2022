this bankruptcy appeal presents the issue of whether two claims,one for declaratory relief and one for money damages,asserted by debtor oteria moses in an adversary proceeding,are subject to arbitration.the bankruptcy court retained jurisdiction over the first claim and denied the motion of cashcall,to compel arbitration.with respect to the second claim,it made recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law,likewise to retain jurisdiction over the claim and deny the motion to compel arbitration.on appeal from the bankruptcy court,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court denial of the motion to compel arbitration as to the first claim and,itself,denied the motion to compel arbitration with respect to the second claim.
on appeal,we hold,for the reasons given by judge niemeyer in parts i,and iii of his opinion,in which judge gregory joined,that the district court did not err in affirming the bankruptcy court exercise of discretion to retain in bankruptcy moses first claim for declaratory relief.we also hold,however,that the district court erred in retaining in bankruptcy moses claim for damages under the north carolina debt collection act and denying cashcall motion to compel arbitration of that claim.judge gregory and judge davis wrote separate opinions concurring in that judgment.judge niemeyer wrote a separate opinion on that issue,dissenting.
accordingly,the judgment of the district court is affirmed in part and reversed in part,and this matter is remanded to the district court with instructions to grant cashcall motion to compel arbitration on moses second claim for damages.
affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded with instructions.
to overcome financial difficulties,oteria moses of goldsboro,north carolina,borrowed from western sky financial,llc,signing a consumer loan agreement in which she promised to repay western sky and interest,for an effective interest rate of per annum.in signing the loan agreement,she agreed to make payments totaling.
while such a loan agreement was clearly illegal under north carolina law,as it provided for an interest rate nearly times the maximum allowable rate,western sky specified in the agreement that indian tribal law would apply and that any dispute under the agreement would be resolved by arbitration conducted by a representative of the cheyenne river sioux tribe.
when moses sought protection in a chapter bankruptcy proceeding,cashcall,the loan servicer,filed a proof of claim,which moses opposed on the ground that the loan was illegal and void.moses also filed an adversary proceeding against cashcall to declare the loan illegal and void and to obtain damages for cashcall allegedly illegal debt collection activities.in a strategic attempt to avoid the bankruptcy court adjudication of moses claims,cashcall sought to withdraw its proof of claim,but the bankruptcy court denied its request.cashcall simultaneously sought to dismiss the adversary action or to stay the proceeding and compel arbitration,which the bankruptcy court also denied.the district court refused to review the bankruptcy court interlocutory order denying cashcall motion to withdraw its proof of claim but agreed to review the bankruptcy court order denying cashcall motion to dismiss or compel arbitration.from the district court order affirming,cashcall filed this appeal.
we conclude that resolution of moses claim for a declaratory judgment that the loan is illegal under north carolina law could directly impact the claims against her estate and that sending this claim to tribal arbitration would substantially interfere with moses efforts to reorganize.thus,we hold that the district court did not err in affirming the bankruptcy court exercise of discretion to retain in bankruptcy moses claim for a declaratory judgment.
writing separately for myself in part,i would also affirm the district court exercise of discretion to retain in bankruptcy moses claim to obtain damages for cashcall efforts to collect an allegedly illegal debt.that claim presents the exact same question as moses claim for a declaratory judgment namely,whether the loan agreement is invalid.consequently,splitting the damages claim from the declaratory judgment claim and sending it to arbitration will be extremely inefficient,will present collateral estoppel concerns,and will waste resources that moses could otherwise use to repay her debts.such concerns are heightened in light of the fact that courts have called the tribal arbitration procedure specified in the loan agreement illusory,a sham,and unconscionable.see,jackson payday,llc,cir.therefore,i believe that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to send moses damages claim to arbitration.
facing financial difficulties,moses signed a western sky consumer loan agreement the loan agreement on may,promising to pay western sky or any subsequent holder,together with interest.upon signing the loan agreement,western sky gave her in cash and retained as a prepaid finance fee.in the loan agreement truth in lending act disclosure statement,western sky stated that the annual percentage rate for the loan was and that the amount of all payments that would be made as scheduled would be.the interest rate disclosed in the loan agreement far exceeded the maximum rate allowed by north carolina law.
western sky,which gave its address in the loan agreement as a post office box in timber lake,south dakota,was not licensed to make loans in north carolina,as required by north carolina law.the loan agreement provided,however,that it was governed by the indian commerce clause of the constitution of the united states of america and the laws of the cheyenne river sioux tribe and that no united states state or federal law applies to this agreement.
the loan agreement also provided that any disputes relating to it were to be resolved by arbitration,which shall be conducted by the cheyenne river sioux tribal nation by an authorized representative emphasis added,and it gave moses the right to designate either the american arbitration association or jams to administer the arbitration in accordance with its rules and procedures to the extent that those rules and procedures do not contradict either the law of the cheyenne river sioux tribe or the express terms of this agreement to arbitrate.in signing the agreement,moses also agreed that she could elect to have the arbitration take place either on tribal land or within miles of her residence,but she agreed that if she elected the latter,this accommodation would not relinquish or waive the cheyenne river sioux tribe sovereign status or immunity.courts that have considered loan agreements similar to the one at issue here have found that the cheyenne river sioux tribe has no laws or facilities for arbitration and that the arbitration procedure specified is a sham from stem to stern.jackson,at see also inetianbor cashcall,cir heldt payday,llc,d.
three days after signing the loan agreement,moses received a notice from western sky that the agreement had been sold to ws funding,llc,a subsidiary of cashcall,and would be serviced by cashcall.
on august,less than three months after signing the loan agreement and after having made only one payment on it,moses filed a chapter bankruptcy petition in the eastern district of north carolina to reorganize her financial affairs.one week later,cashcall filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding,asserting that moses owed it as of august.moses objected to the proof of claim,contending that the loan obligation was void and not enforceable in north carolina pursuant to two north carolina statutes that prohibit unlicensed lending,see.a,and limit interest rates to per annum,see id.c.she also initiated an adversary proceeding by filing a complaint seeking,in her first count,a declaratory judgment that the loan was void ab initio under north carolina law and,in her second,damages against cashcall under the north carolina debt collection act,id.to,for taking actions to collect a debt that was not permitted under law.
on october,the bankruptcy court confirmed moses chapter plan without objection.the approved plan called for moses to repay fully all secured,priority unsecured,and administrative claims over a period but did not anticipate that there would be sufficient funds to repay any general unsecured claims.
after approval of the plan,but while the adversary proceeding was pending,cashcall filed simultaneous motions in the bankruptcy court to withdraw its proof of claim with prejudice and to dismiss moses adversary proceeding without prejudice or,in the alternative,to stay the proceeding and compel moses to arbitrate her claims pursuant to the loan agreement arbitration clause.in its motion to withdraw its proof of claim,cashcall stated that it no longer wish ed to pursue its proof of claim and voluntarily abandon ed its claim for the outstanding balance of the loan to the debtor.but it did not consent to a finding that its loan was illegal and void under north carolina law,as moses alleged in her objection to the proof of claim and in her complaint in the adversary proceeding.because moses had already filed an adversary proceeding against cashcall,cashcall was not authorized to withdraw its proof of claim without court approval.see fed.moses objected to cashcall motion to withdraw its proof of claim,maintaining that cashcall,which had filed similar proofs of claim in the eastern district of north carolina to recover unsecured debts,sought to withdraw its proof of claim in her case only after she had challenged its practices in an attempt to divest the bankruptcy court of jurisdiction to hear her claims against it.
following a hearing,the bankruptcy court entered two separate orders dated january.in the first,it denied cashcall motion to dismiss the complaint or to stay and compel arbitration.in doing so,the court concluded that moses first claim in the complaint,which requested a declaratory judgment that cashcall loan was void,was a core bankruptcy proceeding,as it involved the allowance or disallowance of claims against the estate,citing b b.as to moses second claim,which sought damages under the north carolina debt collection act,the court concluded that the claim was,over which it lack ed constitutional authority to enter final judgment and could therefore only recommend findings of fact and conclusions of law for a decision by the district court,citing id.c.in the second order of january,the bankruptcy court denied cashcall motion to withdraw its proof of claim,finding that withdrawal would cause prejudice to the debtor by eliminating this court jurisdiction over any causes of action related to the claim.
cashcall sought leave from the district court to file interlocutory appeals with respect to both january orders,as required by a,acknowledging that the district court had discretionary jurisdiction to hear appeals from interlocutory rulings of the bankruptcy courts.the district court granted cashcall leave to appeal the interlocutory order denying its motion to dismiss or compel arbitration,but it denied cashcall leave to appeal the interlocutory order denying its motion to withdraw its proof of claim.on the appeal of the order denying cashcall motion to dismiss or compel arbitration,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order by order dated february.
cashcall filed a notice of appeal to this court from the judgment and order of the district court entered in this case on february,affirming an order of the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of north carolina that denied cashcall motion to dismiss or stay and compel arbitration of the underlying adversary proceeding.
in her complaint in the adversary proceeding,moses asserted two claims for relief.in the first,she sought a declaratory judgment that cashcall loan was illegal and unenforceable,in violation of.c and a.in her second claim,she sought damages for cashcall alleged violation of the north carolina debt collection act,asserting that cashcall sought to enforce a debt that was void under north carolina law.
the district court ruled that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction over moses first claim because it was constitutionally core under stern marshall,d,and cashcall did not challenge this finding.the district court then exercised its discretion to keep moses second claim that cashcall violated the north carolina debt collection act in the bankruptcy case because sending it to arbitration would frustrate,rather than facilitate,the efficiency favored by arbitration and could potentially lead to inconsistent results.the court noted that t he countervailing policy of the bankruptcy code is greatly served by allowing the bankruptcy court to consider both claims together and to enter findings of fact and conclusions of law on moses claim.
cashcall challenges the district court conclusions,contending on appeal that both the core and claims should be sent to arbitration.this is an expansion of the position that it took in the district court,where it argued only that moses claim for damages under the north carolina debt collection act was a proceeding and that proceedings are subject to arbitration,even in bankruptcy.it now maintains that if both claims are sent to arbitration,none of the matters to be decided will delay or diminish moses opportunity for a discharge,alter the chapter plan,or increase the payments she is required to make.thus,it argues,arbitration would not conflict with the policies underlying the bankruptcy code.
moses argues to the contrary,noting that both of her claims are premised on the invalidity of the loan agreement and contending that the resolution of those claims would directly impact the claims on the estate and the plan for her financial reorganization the raison of chapter bankruptcy proceedings.she maintains therefore that arbitration would conflict with the bankruptcy code purposes.
the underlying principles that are applicable here are not in dispute.bankruptcy courts may decide core bankruptcy claims,which include the allowance or disallowance of claims against the estate and counterclaims by the estate against persons filing claims against the estate.b b c.a bankruptcy court may also hear related claims,but it can not finally resolve them and must instead submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court.id.c.
the supreme court has modified these statutory assignments of responsibility,holding that article iii of the constitution prohibits bankruptcy courts from issuing final orders regarding statutorily core claims unless they stem from the bankruptcy itself or would necessarily be resolved in the claims allowance process.stern.at.and the court has subsequently held that when a bankruptcy court is faced with a claim that is statutorily core but constitutionally a stern claim it must treat the claim as if it were statutorily,submitting proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court for de novo review.exec.benefits ins.agency arkison,d.
here,there is no dispute that moses first claim,which seeks to declare that cashcall loan is unenforceable,is a statutorily core claim because such an action involves the allowance or disallowance of claims against the estate.b b.it is also constitutionally core,because the validity of the loan agreement would necessarily be resolved in adjudicating cashcall proof of claim and moses objections thereto.stern.at see also,tp,bank of,in re tp,holding that a counterclaim by the estate based in state law will necessarily be resolved in ruling on a proof of claim if it seek s to directly reduce or recoup the amount claimed pulaski dakota,llc in re pulaski,holding that an objection to a proof of claim based on violations of state law was constitutionally core in re olde prairie block owner,llc.
moses second claim,which seeks damages for cashcall violation of the north carolina debt collection act,is also statutorily core because it is a counterclaim by the estate against a person filing a claim against the estate.see b c see also,burns dennis in re southeast materials,holding that a cause of action seeking damages for a creditor unfair or deceptive trade practices,which had no bearing on the allowance or disallowance of a proof of claim,was a counterclaim by the estate sji,staehnke in re sji,holding that a cause of action seeking damages for a creditor breach of contract was a counterclaim by the estate.but the second claim is not constitutionally core.even if a bankruptcy court were to determine that the underlying loan agreement was illegal,it would still need to determine whether an effort to collect an illegal debt would inherently violate the north carolina debt collection act,as moses alleges.thus,moses claim would not necessarily be resolved in the claims allowance process.stern.at see also id.at distinguishing the case before the court,in which the bankruptcy court was required to and did make several factual and legal determinations that were not disposed of in passing on objections to a proof of claim,id.at quoting katchen landy,d,from a case where the legal elements of the claim and counterclaim were so overlapping that once the bankruptcy judge ruled on the creditor proof of claim nothing remain ed for adjudication,id.at quoting katchen,at internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,moses second claim must be treated as if it were statutorily.see exec.benefits ins.agency.at.
in sum,while the two claims in moses complaint in the adversary proceeding are statutorily core claims,only the first claim is constitutionally core.
cashcall argument that both moses core and claims should be sent to arbitration rests essentially on its argument that the strong policy favoring arbitration outweighs the conflicting policies of the bankruptcy code in this case.
to be sure,the arbitration policies implemented by the federal arbitration act faa,are to be robustly followed.see,compucredit greenwood,d the faa establishes a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements quoting moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d dean witter reynolds,byrd,d the preeminent concern of congress in passing the faa was to enforce private agreements into which parties had entered,and that concern requires that we rigorously enforce agreements to arbitrate.at the same time,however,congress intended to grant comprehensive jurisdiction to bankruptcy courts so that they might deal efficiently and expeditiously with all matters connected with the bankruptcy estate.celotex edwards,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.and in cases where tension arises between the faa and another statute,the supreme court has provided a framework for resolving it,holding that the party seeking to prevent enforcement of an applicable arbitration agreement must show that congress has evinced an intention to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory rights at issue.green tree fin.randolph,d.that intent must be deducible from the statute text its legislative history or an inherent conflict between arbitration and the statute underlying purposes.express,mcmahon,d see also gilmer lane,cir,aff,d.where such an intent can be deduced,the court of first impression has discretion to decide whether to withhold arbitration,a decision that is subject to review for abuse of that discretion.see cont l ins.thorpe insulation in re thorpe insulation,cir mintze am.fin,in re mintze,cir gandy gandy in re gandy,cir.as to the constitutionally core claim in this case moses claim for a declaratory judgment the bankruptcy court is the court of first impression to exercise discretion whether to withhold arbitration,but as to the claim moses claim for damages the district court is the court of first impression to exercise such discretion.
moses does not contend that the bankruptcy code or its surrounding legislative history demonstrates an intent to create an exception to the faa.rather,she argues that sending her claims to arbitration would inherently conflict with the bankruptcy code purposes.because moses complaint contains both a constitutionally core and a claim,each claim is analyzed separately.
with respect to moses first claim,the constitutionally core claim,we conclude that sending it to arbitration would pose an inherent conflict with the bankruptcy code and that the district court did not err in affirming the bankruptcy court exercise of discretion in retaining it in bankruptcy.
while arbitration agreements are to be rigorously enforced,bankruptcy too represents a fundamental public policy.grounded in the constitution,bankruptcy provides debtors with a fresh start and creditors with an equitable distribution of the debtor assets.to those ends,a principal purpose of the bankruptcy code is to provide debtors and creditors with the prompt and effectual administration and settlement of the debtor estate.katchen,at see also celotex,at.similarly,a principal purpose of the bankruptcy code is also to centralize disputes over the debtor assets and obligations in one forum,thus protecting both debtors and creditors from piecemeal litigation and conflicting judgments.see phillips congelton,in re white mountain mining,cir robbins piccinin,cir.ease and centrality of administration are thus foundational characteristics of bankruptcy law.french liebmann in re french,cir wilkinson,concurring.
inherently invoking these policies,moses filed a chapter petition under the bankruptcy code and a plan to reorganize her financial affairs,which the bankruptcy court approved in october.in any chapter plan,even after the debtor proposes and the court approves a specific schedule of payments over a period of years,the plan remains subject to modification for reasons including a debtor decreased ability to pay according to plan,as well as the debtor increased ability to pay,carroll logan,cir,until the completion of plan payments,pliler stearns,cir.
it is thus apparent that resolution of moses claim that the loan agreement she entered into with western sky was illegal could directly impact claims against her estate and her plan for financial reorganization,notwithstanding the fact that the plan was confirmed in october.if a tribunal were to hold that cashcall loan is valid,cashcall could petition the bankruptcy court as an allowed unsecured creditor to share in moses assets.see murphy in re murphy,cir noting that plan modification can be initiated by the debtor,the chapter trustee,or an allowed unsecured creditor.and the fact that unsecured creditors are currently anticipated to receive nothing under moses confirmed plan does not mean that they never will.see pliler,at noting that creditors may gain from a debtor chapter reorganization even if the debtor ha s zero or negative disposable income at the time of plan confirmation,because chapter debtors can and do benefit from windfalls such as inheritances or other unforeseeable income after plan confirmation but before their chapter proceedings are closed.under these circumstances,ordering arbitration of a dispute that directly pertains to moses plan for reorganization would substantially interfere with her efforts to reorganize.phillips,at see also id.at holding that a rbitration is inconsistent with the bankruptcy code policy of centralized because permitting an arbitrator to decide a core issue would make rights contingent upon an arbitrator ruling rather than the ruling of the bankruptcy judge assigned to hear the debtor case emphasis added internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
therefore,we conclude that forcing moses to arbitrate her constitutionally core claim would inherently conflict with the purposes of the bankruptcy code and that the district court did not err in affirming the bankruptcy court exercise of discretion in denying cashcall motion to dismiss or stay and compel arbitration of that claim.
nevertheless,the majority concludes that the district court erred in declining to send moses claim to arbitration.judge gregory concludes that moses failed to meet her burden of showing that cashcall statutory right to the enforcement of arbitration agreements should be trumped by adjudication of her claim in a bankruptcy court and therefore that the bankruptcy court ha d no discretion to refuse to arbitrate the claim.post,at.he insists that splitting moses core and claims so that the bankruptcy court can adjudicate her core claim and a representative of the cheyenne river sioux tribe can adjudicate her claim would not substantially interfere with moses efforts to reorganize,despite the fact that the main element of moses claim,the legality of the loan agreement,will necessarily be determined by the bankruptcy court in ruling on moses core claim and on her objection to cashcall proof of claim.writing separately,judge davis would hold that cashcall abandonment of its proof of claim renders moses core claim moot and eliminates any justification for retaining jurisdiction over moses claim in the bankruptcy proceedings,despite the fact that because we lack jurisdiction to revisit the denial of cashcall motion to withdraw its proof of claim,as we hold in part iii,post,at,the proof of claim remains to be decided by the bankruptcy court.
i believe that splitting moses closely related claims and sending moses claim to a questionable and perhaps illusory arbitration proceeding would inherently conflict with the purposes of the bankruptcy code,and therefore i dissent from the court judgment insofar as it holds that the district court abused its discretion in retaining jurisdiction over moses claim.
even though claims are ancillary to reorganization,it is apparent that they can nonetheless affect a debtor efforts to reorganize and that sending claims to arbitration can,in given circumstances,interfere with the debtor chance to complete a fair and efficient chapter reorganization.therefore,with core and claims alike,courts are required to inquire into the nature of the claim and the facts of the specific bankruptcy to determine whether enforcing arbitration would inherently conflict with the purposes of the bankruptcy code.see cont l,at t he distinction,though relevant,is not alone dispositive mintze,at the distinction does not affect whether a bankruptcy court has the discretion to deny enforcement of an arbitration agreement.in addition,when a court is presented with both a core claim and a claim in a single adversary proceeding,the discretion to retain the claim can depend on the strength of its relationship with the core claim.
here,if a separate tribunal were to award moses damages for cashcall efforts to collect an illegal loan,the increase in moses ability to pay should accrue to the other unsecured creditors.see arnold weast in re arnold,cir when a debtor financial fortunes improve,the creditors should share some of the wealth.but the many questions surrounding the loan agreement arbitration procedure raise doubts that arbitration would conclude in time for moses creditors to seek modification of moses chapter plan so that they could share in any recovery.
the loan agreement provides that arbitration shall be conducted by the cheyenne river sioux tribal nation by an authorized representative in accordance with its consumer dispute rules.it also provides that arbitration shall be administered by the american arbitration association,jams,or another organization agreed upon by the parties.thus,before arbitration could even begin,litigation over the arbitration procedure would seem likely.accord heldt,d at noting that because no party had identified an authorized representative of the cheyenne river sioux tribal nation who is an arbitrator in the american arbitration association or jams system,the arbitration agreement left a conundrum as to who would perform the arbitration.in addition,courts reviewing western sky loan agreements with language similar to that in the loan agreement in this case have found that the cheyenne river sioux tribe does not authorize arbitration and consequently has no authorized arbitrators or consumer dispute rules.see jackson,at the arbitration clause here is void not simply because of a strong possibility of arbitrator bias,but because it provides that a decision is to be made under a process that is a sham from stem to stern inetianbor,at similar heldt,d at t he unique circumstances of this case could give rise to a procedural nightmare and a lack of orderly administration of justice quoting farmers union ins.crow tribe of indians,d.
my colleagues suggest that the record is not sufficiently developed for us to make conclusions about the specified tribal arbitration.i submit,however,that we need not make findings on that issue.rather,the doubt already expressed by other courts about the legitimacy and adequacy of the loan agreement tribal arbitration mechanism indicates at the very least that the issue will be the subject of additional litigation.see colonial penn ins.coil,cir f ederal courts,in appropriate circumstances,may take notice of proceedings in other courts,if those proceedings have a direct relation to matters at issue internal quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,it might be years before any resolution of moses claim can be obtained.indeed,it is not hard to imagine scenarios in which an arbitral award would come after october,when moses chapter plan will have terminated,preventing moses creditors from petitioning for plan modification.such delays with respect to the determination of the validity of a claim made against one of moses creditors will not only interfere with the the prompt and effectual administration and settlement of the debtor estate,a principal purpose of the bankruptcy code,katchen,at,but also prejudice the rights of creditors to share in any increase in moses estate.in addition,it hardly undermines the policy favoring arbitration to deny arbitration where there are no rules,guidelines,or guarantees of fairness.jackson,at.
more importantly,moses claim is directly tied to her core claim moses alleges in her claim that cashcall efforts to collect the debt violated the north carolina debt collection act because the underlying loan obligation was illegal,the very issue presented by her core claim.therefore,separating her two claims will force an arbitrator and the bankruptcy judge separately to decide the validity of the underlying debt.that scenario inherently conflicts with the purposes of the bankruptcy code for several reasons.
first,having two tribunals adjudicate the identical issue is inefficient.cashcall argues that efficiency concerns are not a valid basis for ignoring the faa,noting that the supreme court has held that the faa requires district courts to compel arbitration of pendent arbitrable claims even where the result would be the possibly inefficient maintenance of separate proceedings in different forums,because the faa is not chiefly concerned with promot ing the expeditious resolution of claims,dean witter reynolds,at,emphasis added see also kpmg llp cocchi,d per curiam similar.while this analysis governs in other contexts,intervening concerns of bankruptcy change the analysis here,because the supreme court mcmahon framework directs courts to consider whether there is an inherent conflict between arbitration and the statute underlying purposes,at,and the expeditious resolution of claims is at the heart of the bankruptcy code.thus,as other courts of appeals have recognized,the arbitration calculus is different when bankruptcy is involved,requiring courts to consider efficiency concerns.see ins.of,at n i nsofar as efficiency concerns might present a genuine conflict between the federal arbitration act and the bankruptcy code for example where substantial arbitration costs or severe delays would prejudice the rights of creditors or the ability of a debtor to reorganize they may well represent legitimate considerations cont l,at observing that the general proposition that judicial economy and centralization of disputes are not sufficient bases for nonenforcement of an otherwise applicable arbitration clause does not hold in the bankruptcy context gandy,at e fficiency concerns may be legitimate considerations in the bankruptcy context,where efficient resolution of claims and conservation of the bankruptcy estate assets are integral purposes of the bankruptcy code citing ins.of,at.in sum,while efficiency is not considered in determining whether to withhold arbitration in other contexts,it is relevant where,as here,the bankruptcy code is involved.accord ackerman eber in re eber,cir distinguishing kpmg because it was not a bankruptcy case.to be sure,the efficiency from centralization may not,in and of itself,be a valid reason to deny arbitration,as judge gregory observes,post,at,but where,as here,decentralization would be particularly inefficient,an arbitration agreement should give way.
second,bifurcating moses claims will inherently conflict with the purposes of the bankruptcy code because an arbitration proceeding could come to a judgment before the bankruptcy court ruling and inappropriately bind the bankruptcy court on the validity of cashcall loan agreement,a constitutionally core issue for the bankruptcy court to decide.see phillips,at p ermitting an arbitrator to decide a core issue would make rights contingent upon an arbitrator ruling rather than the ruling of the bankruptcy judge assigned to hear the debtor case quoting note,jurisdiction in bankruptcy proceedings a test case for implied repeal of the federal arbitration act,harv,ackerman,at we find unpersuasive the creditors argument that the bankruptcy court inappropriately denied them the opportunity to arbitrate because it was concerned about being collaterally stopped by the arbitrator decision.and even if collateral estoppel were not to apply,bifurcation could yield different results and subject parties to dichotomous obligations.gandy,at.judge gregory suggestion that the district court could stay arbitration until it has ruled on moses core claim,post,at,only highlights further the inefficiencies associated with bifurcating moses claims.
third,the additional litigation costs inherent in being forced to litigate claims before two separate tribunals will harm moses creditors by reducing the amount of income that moses has available to pay her debts.see phillips,at holding that ordering arbitration and staying the adversary proceeding would substantially interfere with white mountain efforts to reorganize because arbitration would impose additional costs on the estate and divert the attention and time of the debtor,whereas allowing the adversary proceeding to go forward would allow all creditors,owners and parties in interest to participate in a centralized proceeding at a minimum of cost second alteration in original see also kent richland,stern marshall a dead end marathon,emory,particularly where the bankruptcy estate is relatively small,keeping the entire matter in the bankruptcy court may be the only way to preserve the estate against excessive costs.
moreover,at a more general level,courts have regularly refused to bifurcate related core and matters.in gandy,the debtor initiated an adversary proceeding alleging causes of action created by the bankruptcy code as well as causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty,negligence,fraud,constructive trust,and breach of contract.the fifth circuit affirmed the district court refusal to divide the debtor case by sending some claims to arbitration because p arallel proceedings would be wasteful and inefficient,and potentially could yield different results and subject parties to dichotomous obligations.gandy,at similarly,in ackerman,the ninth circuit refused to compel arbitration of a creditor claims for breach of contract,fraud,and breach of fiduciary duty because allowing an arbitrator to decide issues that are so closely intertwined with the creditor core claim that the underlying debt was not dischargeable would conflict with the underlying purposes of the bankruptcy code.at quoting cont l,at.and in continental insurance,the ninth circuit held that because a creditor breach of contract claim challenging actions that the debtor took in bankruptcy was inextricably intertwined with the debtor bankruptcy plan confirmation,adjudication of the creditor claim in any other forum other than a bankruptcy court would conflict with fundamental bankruptcy policy.at internal quotation marks omitted.
at bottom,i simply can not see how the district court abused its discretion by keeping moses claim together with the core claim for adjudication in the bankruptcy court in the circumstances of this case.i would therefore affirm.
to support his argument that the district court erred in keeping the related core and claims in bankruptcy,judge davis,in his separate opinion concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part,would have us review the unappealed and unappealable interlocutory january,order issued by the bankruptcy court denying cashcall motion to withdraw its proof of claim.he finds this approach necessary in order to conclude that the district court erred in affirming the bankruptcy court order denying the motion to dismiss or compel arbitration because,as he reasons,once cashcall abandons its proof of claim and releases moses from her obligations under the loan agreement,the sine qua non of the bankruptcy court justification for retaining jurisdiction over moses claim evaporates there is no core claim to remit to arbitration,and the only question is whether to compel arbitration on moses claim.post,at.but the only issue that cashcall has appealed and,indeed,that it could appeal is whether the district court erred in entering its order of february,affirming the bankruptcy court ruling that the related core and claims be decided together in the bankruptcy court and,to that end,denying cashcall motion to dismiss or compel arbitration of those claims.this is also the only issue that the parties briefed.because we have no jurisdiction to review the bankruptcy court january order and therefore no power to allow cashcall to withdraw its proof of claim,moses core claim is not moot.
in bankruptcy cases,courts of appeals have jurisdiction only over final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees of district courts,pursuant to d interlocutory appeals from district courts under the doctrine of cohen beneficial industrial loan.appeals from interlocutory or final orders of the bankruptcy court in which the bankruptcy court,the district court,or the parties acting jointly,certify an appeal and the court of appeals authorizes a direct appeal,pursuant to d and interlocutory appeals in which a district court states in writing i that an order not otherwise appealable involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and ii that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate determination of the litigation,b.see legal representatives for future claimants aetna cas.sur.in re wallace gale,cir.in addition,congress has created limited exceptions to the rule for orders implicating certain subjects.see,a a 
as cashcall itself recognized,the bankruptcy court order denying its motion to withdraw its proof of claim was interlocutory.pursuant to a,an interlocutory order of a bankruptcy court is reviewable by a district court only with that court permission.the district court here specifically denied cashcall permission to appeal the bankruptcy court order to it and accordingly the district court never reviewed the bankruptcy court order on the merits.thus,the district court proceedings never gave rise to a reviewable final order of the district court that we could review under d or to an interlocutory order of the district court that we could review under the doctrine or b.and no court ever made a certification under d.indeed,cashcall has not suggested that the bankruptcy court order is appealable under any possible formulation.
moreover,even if there were any question as to our lack of jurisdiction over the order denying cashcall motion to withdraw,cashcall did not appeal that order.a court of appeals only has jurisdiction over an order that has actually been appealed and presented to it.see fed.smith barry,d federal rule of appellate procedure dictates are jurisdictional in nature,and their satisfaction is a prerequisite to appellate review n oncompliance is fatal to an appeal.bowles russell,d t he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.cashcall notice of appeal did not even reference the bankruptcy court january order,instead carefully limiting the scope of the appeal to the district court february order 
defendant cashcall,appeals to the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit from the judgment and order of the district court for the eastern district of north carolina,entered in this case on february,affirming an order of the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of north carolina that denied cashcall motion to dismiss or stay and compel arbitration of the underlying adversary proceeding.
emphasis added.and unsurprisingly,cashcall never addressed the merits of the bankruptcy court january order in its briefing before this court.bogart chapell,cir recognizing that in order to demonstrate that the appellee had notice of an issue and the opportunity to fully brief it,the appellant needs to address the merits of a particular issue in her opening brief emphasis added edwards city of goldsboro,cir stating that failure to raise a claim and the reasons therefore in the opening brief triggers abandonment of that claim on appeal.
despite the clear absence of any power to review the interlocutory order of the bankruptcy court,judge davis would hold that the doctrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction gives us jurisdiction over that order.that doctrine,however,is not applicable to the circumstances presented here for several reasons.
first,there is no final judgment to which review of the bankruptcy court order could be appended.in swint chambers county commission,d,the supreme court refused to apply the doctrine of pendent appellant jurisdiction to consider an unappealable issue where the order to which that issue would be appended was an interlocutory order appealable only under the doctrine.the court explained that i f courts of appeals had discretion to append to a appeal from a collateral order further rulings of a kind neither independently appealable nor certified by the district court,then the arrangement b mandates would be severely undermined.id.at see also id.at a rule loosely allowing pendent appellate jurisdiction would encourage parties to parlay collateral orders into interlocutory appeal tickets.to safeguard congress mandate,the swint court held that in appeals authorized by the doctrine,courts only have jurisdiction to consider claims that fall within cohen exception to the rule.id.at quoting abney united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.here,the district court order affirming the denial of cashcall motion to dismiss or compel arbitration was an interlocutory order,and appellate jurisdiction over that order was authorized solely by a a,which permits an interlocutory appeal of an order refusing to stay an action pending arbitration.see thomson mckinnon,salter,cir under a,interlocutory orders refusing to compel arbitration now are appealable even though they are not final within the meaning of see also,campbell dynamics gov t,cir arnold arnold printed communc ns for,cir.to apply the doctrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction in this context would be to sanction the conversion of a narrow,statutorily authorized interlocutory appeal into a appeal,precisely the effect that the swint court sought to avoid,the practical and flexible approach to pendent appellate review that judge davis would have us adopt.see swint,at noting that such an approach would be incompatible with the statutory instructions congress has given to control the timing of appellate proceedings.
second,the concerns expressed in swint are magnified in this case because the district court,acting under a,specifically denied cashcall leave to appeal the bankruptcy court interlocutory order to the district court.as the second circuit recognized in gibson kassover in re kassover,cir,i n requiring that a district court grant leave to appeal before rendering a decision on the merits in a,congress surely intended to make the declining of such leave the end of the matter,save perhaps for the seeking of an extraordinary writ.were it otherwise,appellate review would proceed without the benefit of a district court findings of fact and conclusions of law.id.indeed,courts of appeals have regularly held that they lack jurisdiction to review issues in the analogous situation where a district court has declined to certify a question for interlocutory appeal to a court of appeals under b.see taylor robertson,cir unpublished as the district court expressly declined to issue the required certification,we deny the petition for an interlocutory appeal under b see also,in re ford motor,cir certification by the district court is a jurisdictional prerequisite to interlocutory review under b mason stallings,cir the district court in this case denied a b certification.therefore,it is not open to us to reverse the denial of summary judgment green occidental petrol,cir concurrence of both the district court and the appellate court is necessary and we are without power to assume unilaterally an appeal under section b in re master key antitrust,cir the district court refusal to certify the interlocutory appeal of its rulings is,of course,not appealable united states acres of land,cir we have no jurisdiction to review the trial court denial of the b certificate.in short,applying pendent appellate jurisdiction an exception to the requirement of limited and narrow application,rux republic of sudan,cir to review an issue that the district court expressly refused to consider itself under a and that was never certified to us under d or b would circumvent the clear intent of congress.
third,the bankruptcy court january interlocutory order is not,as judge davis contends,inextricably intertwined with the district court february order affirming the denial of cashcall motion to dismiss the adversary complaint or compel arbitration.although the doctrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction is available when an issue is inextricably intertwined with a question that is the proper subject of an immediate appeal,rux,at quoting swint,at,separate rulings are inextricably intertwined only if the same specific question will underlie both the appealable and the order,scott family dollar stores,cir emphasis added quoting ealy pinkerton gov t,app x,cir per curiam,cert.denied.here,cashcall motion to dismiss or compel arbitration presents the question of whether arbitration of moses claim would substantially interfere with the purposes of the bankruptcy code.by contrast,review of cashcall motion to withdraw its proof of claim would require a court to consider the distinct question of whether withdrawal would cause moses to suffer prejudice.
judge davis,also recognizing that cashcall never included the bankruptcy court january interlocutory order in its notice of appeal,asserts nonetheless that we have discretion to review that order,post,at,because notices of appeal are to be liberally construed,post,at citing powell symons,cir.but this case does not allow for any construction of the notice of appeal.cashcall notice of appeal was clear and explicit in limiting the appeal to the february order.cashcall did not appeal the bankruptcy court january interlocutory order,stating in its brief that it simply can not appeal that issue yet.we can not invoke the policy of liberal construction to create an entirely new document.that policy applies only when a party files a notice of appeal that is technically at variance with the letter of a procedural rule,but the litigant action is the functional equivalent of what the rule requires.united states little,cir quoting torres oakland scavenger,d see also gunther du pont de nemours,cir when it appears that adequate information is given by the notice,the appeal should not be dismissed for mistakes which do not mislead or prejudice the appellee.
somehow reaching the merits of the bankruptcy court unappealed and unappealable january order,judge davis would conclude that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in denying cashcall motion to withdraw its proof of claim because,as he views it,moses would not be prejudiced by the withdrawal.post,at.he fails,however,to consider the more relevant equitable considerations presented to the bankruptcy court.for instance,cashcall issued a loan at nearly times the maximum allowable interest rate under north carolina law and then filed a proof of claim to collect moses unpaid debt,just as it had done in other cases in the eastern district of north carolina.had moses not objected to cashcall claim,cashcall would have been more than happy to use the federal courts to collect,which amounted to a return on its investment over a period of less than three months.but as soon as moses fought back,alleging that the loan agreement was issued in violation of state usury laws and seeking damages for cashcall efforts to collect an illegal debt,cashcall attempted to withdraw its proof of claim in an effort to divest the bankruptcy court of jurisdiction and shunt moses claims into tribal arbitration,causing additional costs and delays.
cashcall gamesmanship could not have been clearer.denying moses the benefit of the bankruptcy forum and requiring her,with her meager funds,to challenge the questionable and perhaps even illusory tribal arbitration process and to try her case in another forum,only to bring back any proceeds to the bankruptcy court,would hardly serve equity.bankruptcy courts are courts of equity,see irs levy in re landbank equity,cir,and as such,they should not be required to give effect to this inequitable practice.while judge davis states that he is not blink ing at the underlying motivations of cashcall transparently tactical decision to withdraw its proof of claim in this case as a means to pretermit the adversary proceeding,post,at,his stated position reveals precisely the opposite.
at bottom,it is clear that the bankruptcy court order denying cashcall motion to withdraw its proof of claim is not before us and that the bankruptcy court still has jurisdiction to decide cashcall proof of claim and moses objection to it.
i agree with judge niemeyer majority opinion upholding the bankruptcy court exercise of jurisdiction over moses core claim for declaratory judgment sending such a claim to arbitration would indeed present an inherent conflict with the bankruptcy code insofar as the claim seeks to determine the validity of a demand on moses estate.see.express,mcmahon,d allowing the nonenforcement of an arbitration agreement when the arbitration of a claim would present an inherent conflict with a statute underlying purposes.
the same,however,can not be said for moses claim,which demands money damages for cashcall alleged violations of the north carolina debt collection act ncdca,nc.to.although the success or failure of the claim may have ancillary effects on moses bankruptcy primarily through the enlargement of the underlying estate due to any damages received any such results are simply too attenuated,and indeed extrinsic to the bankruptcy,to constitute an inherent conflict with the bankruptcy code purpose of facilitating an efficient reorganization.as the bankruptcy judge himself observed regarding the claim,t hese damages are unrelated to the defendant proof of claim and are only related to the bankruptcy case in that if successful,the bankruptcy estate will recover any funds and disburse them to claims in accordance with the bankruptcy code.in such circumstances,moses has failed to meet her burden of showing that congress intended to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies for the statutory rights at issue.mcmahon,at see also dean witter reynolds,byrd,d observing that courts must rigorously enforce agreements to arbitrate,at least absent a countervailing policy manifested in another federal statute moses cone mem l hosp.mercury constr,d describing the federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.
i would thus reverse the district court decision allowing moses claim to remain in the bankruptcy court.
to begin with the obvious,a claim is constitutionally because it is ancillary to the underlying bankruptcy.in recognition of that fact,a bankruptcy judge dominion over claims is limited by article iii,of the constitution to submitting proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court,for that court review and issuance of final judgment.stern marshall,d see also id.at holding that a bankruptcy judge authority is likewise limited for claims that are statutorily core but constitutionally see also pipeline constr.marathon pipe line,d describing the enforcement of private rights as separate and apart from the restructuring of relations.further,the bankruptcy code itself limits a bankruptcy judge authority to hear certain state law matters,even when the resolution of those matters may affect the underlying estate.see c requiring that bankruptcy courts abstain from hearing certain state law claims c providing that bankruptcy courts may abstain from hearing a particular proceeding,including core and matters,in the interest of comity with state courts or respect for state law see also stern.at.
the distinction,however,is not mechanically dispositive in deciding whether a bankruptcy judge may refuse to send a claim to arbitration.see cont l ins.thorpe insulation in re thorpe insulation,cir we agree that the distinction,though relevant,is not alone dispositive.in re mintze,cir the distinction does not affect whether a bankruptcy court has the discretion to deny enforcement of an arbitration agreement.instead,what matters fundamentally is whether compelling arbitration for a claim would inherently undermine the bankruptcy code animating purpose of facilitating the efficient reorganization of an estate through the c entralization of disputes concerning a debtor legal obligations phillips congelton,llc in re white mountain mining,cir.
although the mere designation of a claim as does not end the inquiry,i agree with our sister circuits that bankruptcy courts generally have no discretion to refuse to arbitrate a claim.as the ninth circuit has observed,surveying other circuits 
the core versus distinction has been articulated by our sister circuits as follows generally,bankruptcy judges do not have discretion to refuse to compel arbitration of matters because they are generally only tangentially related to a bankruptcy case.bankruptcy courts may,however,exercise discretion to refuse to compel arbitration of core bankruptcy matters,which implicate more pressing bankruptcy concerns.yet,even as to core proceedings,the bankruptcy court will not have discretion to override an arbitration agreement unless it finds that the proceedings are based on provisions of the bankruptcy code that inherently conflict with the arbitration act or that arbitration of the claim would necessarily jeopardize the objectives of the bankruptcy code.

dissenting from the majority conclusion that moses claim should be sent to arbitration,judge niemeyer cites the fifth circuit decision in gandy gandy in re gandy,cir,as supporting the proposition that courts have regularly refused to bifurcate related core and matters.in gandy,however,the fifth circuit went so far as to observe that bankruptcy courts generally do not have discretion to decline to stay proceedings involving matters.id.at emphasis added also observing that it is universally accepted that bankruptcy courts generally do not have such discretion see also hays,at.instead,gandy determined that a bankruptcy judge discretion primarily extends to refuse to enforce an otherwise applicable arbitration agreement when the underlying nature of a proceeding derives exclusively from the provisions of the bankruptcy code and the arbitration of the proceeding conflicts with the purpose of the code.at see also,at t he presumption in favor of arbitration generally will trump the lesser interest of bankruptcy courts in adjudicating proceedings that could otherwise be arbitrated.factually,gandy involved three causes of action that derive d entirely from the federal rights conferred by the bankruptcy code and were thus not available outside of bankruptcy to the debtor.at.the debtor complaint,the court found,also implicated contractual and tort issues in only the most peripheral manner.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.such causes of action,the court concluded,were simply inconsequential relative to the bankruptcy causes of action.id.at.as discussed further below,the same can not be said of moses claim under the ncdca.
a bankruptcy judge discretion to deny arbitration of matters is thus necessarily narrow.as we suggested in phillips in the context of a core proceeding,the discretion to deny arbitration should be limited to cases where arbitration would substantially interfere with the debtor efforts to reorganize.phillips,at.paradigmatically,substantial interference occurs when the resolution of the claim will necessarily affect reorganization in a significant way,and arbitration will thus inherently conflict with the purposes of bankruptcy code.see id.in phillips,for example,we confronted whether an individual was owed money by a debtor a classic core claim.the debtor bankruptcy plan had yet to be approved,the core claim was critical to the plan of reorganization,and sending the proceeding to arbitration would have jeopardized the reorganization process.id.
no such danger is present here,however,regarding moses claim under the state debt collector statute.moses chapter bankruptcy plan has already been approved,and unsecured creditors like cashcall will likely receive nothing.see.nonetheless,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court refusal to send the claim to arbitration,reasoning that the claim was essentially one for damages arising out of the core proceeding and was thus inextricably intertwined with it.j.
it is true that moses core and actions share one common question.the core action seeks a declaration that cashcall proof of claim was void under the north carolina consumer finance act.the claim is based,in part,on an allegation that cashcall sought to collect on an invalid debt,while also alleging that cashcall has willfully engaged in other and further violations of the north carolina prohibited acts by debt collector as may be shown through discovery and proved at trial.
but the fact that the claims may share a question does not mean that arbitrating one of them will pose an inherent conflict with the efficient reorganization of a debtor estate.although the district court itself provided no reasons why it believed such a conflict was inevitable,it suggested in one sentence that the potential for inefficiency and inconsistent results justified the bankruptcy court actions.as for any potential inefficiency and delay,if the bankruptcy court retained jurisdiction over moses claim,it could only issue findings of fact and recommendations of law,which would then be subject to de novo review by the district court before a final order could be entered.but if the claim went to arbitration,the arbitrator order would simply be subject to enforcement by the district court,with any proceeds then distributed as part of the estate see hays,at.
furthermore,moses claim shares little overlap with the core claim,apart from the question whether the underlying loan was void in the first place.the litigation will likely require detailed and findings regarding cashcall conduct in trying to collect on the loan,other violations of the state statute,and damages like emotional distress.as the bankruptcy judge observed regarding the claim,t hese damages are unrelated to the defendant proof of claim and are only related to the bankruptcy case in that if successful,the bankruptcy estate will recover any funds and disburse them to claims in accordance with the bankruptcy code.although the core and claims may overlap in one respect,they can not be said to be inextricably intertwined such that the denial of arbitration was proper.
moses additionally argues that arbitration of the claim could substantially interfere with the bankruptcy proceedings by allowing an arbitrator to decide an issue inextricably interrelated with the core claim the validity of the loan agreement and thus potentially bind a bankruptcy judge through collateral estoppel.such a danger,however,is speculative at best.as the supreme court has held,arbitration proceedings will not necessarily have a preclusive effect on subsequent proceedings.dean witter,at citing mcdonald west branch,d see also hays,at applying dean witter to a bankruptcy context.further,the court in dean witter noted that courts may directly and effectively protect federal interests by determining the preclusive effect to be given to an arbitration proceeding.dean witter,at see also hays,at.finally,to the extent that any danger of preclusion remains,a court may simply stay arbitration proceedings for some brief period until it has ruled on the underlying core claim.
there is thus no reason to believe that arbitration in these circumstances will substantially interfere with moses bankruptcy and present an inherent conflict with the purposes of the bankruptcy code.indeed,the mere possibility of generic exigencies,inherent in the act of litigating in another forum,can not justify the refusal to arbitrate a claim.as the third circuit observed in hays,congress decision to restrict a bankruptcy court jurisdiction over claims,and to require that certain claims be heard in state court,shows that centralization is not,in and of itself,a valid reason to deny arbitration.at.the court further concluded that even if there were some potential for an adverse impact on the core proceeding as a result of arbitration,such as inefficient delay,duplicative proceedings,or collateral estoppel effect,hayes sic has not shown that it would be substantial enough to override the policy favoring arbitration.id.at.
i reach the same conclusion about three additional possible rationales for a refusal to send a claim to arbitration in these circumstances.first,the fifth circuit in gandy determined that a bankruptcy judge may refuse to arbitrate claims when those claims are inconsequential compared with any.gandy,at.without embracing gandy legal conclusion about the arbitrability of such claims,i believe that moses claim can not be called inconsequential.whereas moses declaratory judgment action seeks invalidation of an alleged debt owed to cashcall,her state ncdca claim seeks substantial damages,including those for emotional distress and anxiety,and statutory penalties up to per violation of the act.as previously described,the state cause of action requires a court to make detailed determinations regarding cashcall conduct before moses declared bankruptcy apart from the single shared question regarding the illegality of the underlying allegations that cashcall has willfully engaged in other and further violations of the act that go beyond attempting to collect an invalid debt.j.against that backdrop,the action is not inconsequential,or entirely peripheral to the core claim.
second,judge niemeyer suggests that the bankruptcy court may have been justified because moses estate could be enriched or depleted as a result of litigation.if moses prevailed,the estate could potentially benefit from any damages received a result that certainly would not frustrate creditors who could share in the spoils.and if she lost,the costs of unsuccessful litigation could partly deplete the estate.but if such generic considerations were enough to justify a denial of arbitration,there would be little limit to a bankruptcy judge discretion.neither phillips nor the federal arbitration act countenance that result.as previously observed,phillips instead approved the bankruptcy court refusal to send a core claim to arbitration only after finding that the arbitration would have substantially interfered with the debtor efforts to reorganize.at.there has been no such showing here.
third,judge niemeyer argues that our holding pays insufficient attention to the pound gorilla lurking in the litigation,namely,the enforceability of the arbitration agreement itself.for the first time on appeal,moses argues that the tribal arbitration provisions specified in the agreement are illusory.she specifically maintains that there is no such thing as arbitration conducted by the cheyenne river sioux tribe,there are no tribal representatives authorized to conduct arbitration,and there are no tribal consumer dispute rules.br.of appellee.cashcall strategy,as moses alleges,is thus to shield its illegal scheme from any american court and any american law by sending claims into a legal black hole called tribal arbitration.id.at citing heldt payday,llc,no.civ ral,wl,at.
the choice of law and arbitration provisions in question indeed appear similar to others used by cashcall that have been increasingly scrutinized,and at times derided,by the courts.see jackson payday,llc,cir refusing to compel arbitration under similar provisions inetianbor cashcall,d,finding a similar arbitration agreement to be void heldt,wl,at enumerating pervasive problems with enforcement of a similar agreement.
moses,however,did not raise the issue before the district court or bankruptcy court,and those courts did not make any relevant factual findings about the nature of the loan agreement or its arbitration provisions.further,cashcall argues in its reply brief that the provisions governing moses agreement are substantially different from those that other courts have considered an argument that moses could not respond to and that we are not equipped to resolve.see in re under seal,cir our settled rule is simple a bsent exceptional circumstances,we do not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal.internal quotation marks omitted,alterations in original.without more fulsome briefing and a more developed record,we simply can not reach the enforceability of the agreement.
judge niemeyer nonetheless argues that the mere prospect of additional litigation over enforceability may itself help justify the decision not to send moses claim to arbitration.in essence,such logic would reject an arbitration agreement because the agreement may be challenged.the dissent imagine s scenarios in which the length of time it may take to litigate a challenge of the arbitration agreement could prevent moses creditors from sharing in any augmentation of the estate through damages received.but imagined conflicts are not enough to substantially and inherently interfere with a debtor reorganization.that is particularly the case here where moses bankruptcy plan has already been approved.
in sum,the refusal to send a claim to arbitration requires more than a finding that arbitration would potentially conflict with the purposes of the bankruptcy code.rather,the conflict must be inherent and sufficient to override by implication the presumption in favor of arbitration.lines,am.steamship owners mut.prot.indemnity ass in re lines,cir.on the facts before us,i conclude that moses has failed to carry her burden to show such a conflict.
the district court allowed a bankruptcy court to protect its jurisdiction over a state law claim by refusing to acknowledge that a proof of claim in the bankruptcy case had become moot by virtue of its abandonment and withdrawal by the creditor.i am constrained to reject this jurisdictional sleight of hand.
appellee oteria moses,faced with severe financial difficulties,obtained from western sky financial,llc western sky a loan appellant,cashcall,cashcall is western sky.upon moses filing of a bankruptcy petition,cashcall filed a proof of claim,seeking nearly from moses estate.moses objected and filed an adversary proceeding in which she requested a judgment declaring the loan agreement void under the north carolina consumer finance act nccfa and money damages for cashcall alleged violation of north carolina prohibited acts by debt collectors statute north carolina debt collection act or ncdca.
cashcall,explaining that it was abandoning its claim for the outstanding balance of the loan,filed a motion to withdraw its proof of claim and then,shortly after that,a motion to compel arbitration of the adversary proceeding.the bankruptcy court denied both motions.upon cashcall appeal,the district court denied cashcall motion for leave to appeal the denial of its motion to withdraw its proof of claim,and the court affirmed the bankruptcy court order refusing to compel arbitration.
on appeal to this court,cashcall challenges the bankruptcy court denial of its motion to compel arbitration.cashcall did not,however,note an appeal from the district court denial of leave to appeal the bankruptcy court order disallowing withdrawal of its proof of claim.at oral argument before this panel,while reiterating that it has abandoned its proof of claim,cashcall explained that it did not believe it could appeal to this court the district court denial of leave to appeal.
for the reasons stated below,i would elect to exercise our discretion to review the bankruptcy court denial of the motion to withdraw the proof of claim,reverse in part,vacate in part,and remand with instructions that the district court reverse the bankruptcy court denial of the motion to compel arbitration.
when reviewing a district court judgment affirming a bankruptcy court order,we consider directly the bankruptcy court findings of facts and conclusions of law.in re alvarez,cir.we review the bankruptcy court as well as the district court legal conclusions de novo.id.findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.id.
i look first to the bankruptcy court denial of cashcall motion to withdraw its proof of claim.moses suggests that,despite cashcall representations to the bankruptcy court and to this court that it has abandoned its claim on the loan,the bankruptcy court nevertheless properly denied the motion to withdraw the proof of claim.i can not agree.
federal rule of bankruptcy procedure provides that 
if after a creditor has filed a proof of claim an objection is filed thereto or a complaint is filed against that creditor in an adversary proceeding,the creditor may not withdraw the claim except on order of the court after a hearing on notice to the trustee or debtor in possession 
a motion to withdraw a proof of claim under rule has been analogized to a motion under federal rule of civil procedure a,and thus similar considerations govern both motions.see,in re varona,in re kaiser group int l,in re sport.as with a motion to voluntarily dismiss a civil action,a motion to withdraw a proof of claim is left to the court discretion,which is to be exercised with due regard to the legitimate interests of both parties.in re ogden new york,quoting sport,at.in general,withdrawal should be granted unless the party opposing the motion can demonstrate that it would be legally prejudiced by the withdrawal.see also in re lowenschuss,cir.
here,moses failed to demonstrate that she would be legally prejudiced by the withdrawal of cashcall proof of claim.the bankruptcy court reached the opposite conclusion by reasoning that allowing cashcall to withdraw its claim would eliminat e the court jurisdiction over any cases of action related to the claim,and force moses to file an action in the general court of justice for the state of north carolina or proceed with arbitration as required by the loan agreement.this was legal error the bankruptcy court is simply incorrect that moses would suffer cognizable prejudice by litigating her claims in state court or following the arbitration procedures set out in her loan agreement as supplemented by the availability of judicial review after any arbitration proceedings.in re armstrong,in re cnty.of orange.i would decline to hold,at least on the record here,that it constitutes prejudice not to have a united states bankruptcy judge as opposed to some other adjudicator decide a state law claim between private parties.given the absence of any legally cognizable prejudice to moses should cashcall proof of claim be withdrawn,the bankruptcy court committed legal error and thereby abused its discretion in denying cashcall motion.see dart cherokee basin operating,llc owens,d a court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law.quoting cooter gell hartmarx,d koon u
