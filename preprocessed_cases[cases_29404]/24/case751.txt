prm energy systems,prm,licensed certain gasification technology patents to primenergy,primenergy.through a network of agreements the agreements,prm licensed primenergy to use the gasification technology and enter into sublicense agreements in a number of countries.after a series of disputes between prm and primenergy,prm brought claims against kobe steel,kobe steel,a potential licensee,for tortious interference with,and inducement to breach,the agreements and for conspiring with primenergy to convert prm intellectual property for their own use.
kobe steel moved to compel arbitration of prm claims pursuant to arbitration provisions in the agreements,and the district granted kobe steel motion.prm now appeals,arguing that kobe steel,as a nonsignatory to the agreements,should not be permitted to enforce the arbitration provisions from those agreements.we affirm.
to give context to this dispute,we set forth the facts as alleged in prm complaint.
in the agreements,prm licensed primenergy to use prm gasification technology in a number of countries,including the united states but not including japan.although primenergy license did not extend to japan,primenergy maintains that the agreements gave it a right of first refusal for a license in japan.in,a subsidiary of kobe steel a japanese company contacted prm and expressed its interest in licensing the technology in the united states.prm referred the subsidiary to primenergy.in,kobe steel began discussing licensing in japan with prm,but kobe steel declined to sign a confidentiality agreement,and the discussions stalled.at the same time,kobe steel was allegedly negotiating with primenergy,inducing primenergy to breach the agreements by sublicensing the technology to kobe steel and planning joint projects in japan.in,kobe steel and primenergy reached a collaboration agreement in violation of the territorial restrictions in the agreements.neither primenergy nor kobe steel disclosed this agreement to prm.
unaware of the collaboration between primenergy and kobe steel,prm executed an option granting an unrelated company a license for the technology in japan.in,primenergy filed a demand for arbitration seeking to force prm to terminate the option,citing primenergy purported right of first refusal.primenergy also sought to invalidate certain royalty provisions of the agreements because the underlying patents had expired.prm asserted several in the arbitration,including a claim that primenergy breached the agreements by having undisclosed dealings with kobe steel.in a final ruling on april,an arbitrator found that the royalty provisions were unenforceable and that both parties had breached the agreements in regard to obligations concerning the territory of japan.the arbitrator enjoined primenergy from further discussions with kobe steel for a period of two years,but it did not award damages because prm had not shown any.
in,while the arbitration between prm and primenergy was pending,prm filed a complaint in the district court against primenergy and its officers alleging breach of contract,fraud,conspiracy,misappropriation of trade secrets,unfair competition,and tortious interference.on march,prm filed a complaint in a separate action against kobe steel asserting tortious interference and conspiracy.on may,prm filed an amended complaint in its lawsuit against primenergy that included specific allegations concerning the interactions between primenergy and kobe steel.on november,the district court granted prm motion to consolidate the two actions,but it dismissed the claims against primenergy,concluding that the claims were subject to arbitration.
on november,prm filed an amended complaint against kobe steel,asserting the existence of a confidentiality agreement and several exclusive collaboration agreements between primenergy and kobe steel.prm further alleged that primenergy and kobe steel conspired to hide their dealings from prm and that primenergy and kobe steel,through their concerted actions,were attempting to negotiate lower royalty premiums and broader territorial rights for the licensing of prm technology.
on march,the district court confirmed an april arbitration decision from the arbitration between prm and primenergy.kobe steel and prm then filed for judgment on the pleadings as to prm claims against kobe steel.on june,the district court granted kobe steel motion in part,allowing kobe steel to compel arbitration.the district court also entered a stay of the proceedings.the district court held that kobe steel could enforce the arbitration provisions of the agreements on an estoppel theory because all of prm claims either make reference to or presume the existence of the agreements,and allege substantially interdependent and concerted misconduct by both the nonsignatory kobe steel and one or more of the signatories primenergy to the contract.an arbitrator subsequently dismissed the claims against kobe steel.the district court later confirmed the arbitrator dismissal of the claims,and prm now appeals the june,order compelling the arbitration 
this court reviews de novo a district court grant of a motion to compel arbitration.donaldson,burroughs diesel,cir internal quotation omitted.the first question before us is whether a nonsignatory defendant may compel a signatory plaintiff to arbitrate claims under a valid arbitration agreement where the relationship between the parties is based on the concerted misconduct of the defendant and a different signatory.as we recognized in donaldson,the supreme court has held that state contract law governs the ability of nonsignatories to enforce arbitration provisions.id.at arthur andersen llp carlisle,d state law,therefore,is applicable to determine which contracts are binding under of the federal arbitration act and enforceable under if that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity,revocability,and enforceability of contracts generally.quoting perry thomas,d.
the supreme court issued arthur andersen,and our court issued donaldson,however,long after the district court ordered and subsequently confirmed arbitration in the present case and after the parties briefed and argued this matter to our court.below,the district court applied federal law to address kobe steel ability to invoke the arbitration provisions of the contract between prm and primenergy.in its brief on appeal,prm argues that federal law applies,and kobe steel cites only federal law in its brief as to this issue.accordingly,we rely primarily upon the federal law as discussed by the parties on appeal,and by the district court below,regarding the ability of a nonsignatory to compel arbitration
