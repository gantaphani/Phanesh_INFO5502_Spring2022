this is an appeal from a judgment confirming an insurance appraisal award.it is settled that appraisers have the power only to determine a specific question of fact,namely,the actual cash value of the insured item.safeco ins.sharma d.sharma.plaintiff jeff kacha contends the award here exceeds the appraisers jurisdiction as it includes determinations of whether certain damages were covered by his insurer,defendant allstate insurance company allstate,and the trial court erred by finding he waived the jurisdictional rule of sharma and section.kacha also contends the court erred by finding he is precluded from challenging the appraisal award because he took possession of,but did not negotiate,checks allstate provided him to cover the award.
we agree with kacha on both points.we reverse the judgment and direct the trial court on remand to enter an order vacating the appraisal award.
factual and procedural background 
kacha and his wife tania kacha custom home in the scripps ranch area of san diego was completed in july.in october the home and personal property were damaged by heat and smoke in a wildfire designated the cedar fire.homes on three sides of kacha property burned to the ground.
allstate provided kacha homeowners insurance.allstate valued the cost to clean the home and contents at,and it paid that amount to kacha.kacha then retained kevin dawson,of professional insurance evaluations,a licensed public adjuster,to assist him in the presentation of his claim.in december kacha demanded an appraisal,as provided by allstate policy if the parties could not agree on the amount of loss.
in may kacha submitted a sworn statement claiming in covered losses,supported by inventories dawson prepared.the claim included the cleaning of damaged property when applicable and the repair or replacement of permanently damaged property.the same month,kacha petitioned the superior court to compel an appraisal and appoint an umpire.allstate opposed the petition on the ground of prematurity,arguing an appraisal was inappropriate until and unless the extent of covered loss was established,on which a value could be determined.allstate advised the court that under sharma,supra,d,an appraisal panel is empowered to determine the value of a loss and not coverage issues,such as the extent of the loss.
the court granted kacha motion to compel an appraisal and appointed the honorable anthony joseph,a retired superior court judge,as umpire.each of the parties was entitled to choose an arbitrator.kacha chose keith charleston and allstate chose louis heilbron.under the policy,if the parties appraisers could not agree on valuation,a written award agreed on by judge joseph and one of the appraisers would determine valuation.
in an august letter,judge joseph asked the parties to agree on a draft form for the award.the following month judge joseph renewed his request.
in late october allstate provided kacha attorney,peter lawrence,and dawson with a draft form appraisal award.the form included several pages of damaged items kacha claimed were covered under the policy,such as kitchen cabinets and flooring,garage cabinets and flooring,and carpet and interior walls.for each item,the form provided damage,if any,to the,kitchen cabinets attributable to the fire of october.the form included a line for the entry of a dollar amount for each item.
the appraisal was held at kacha home,on november and,and january.allstate presented an appraisal brief that stated,t his is not your standard appraisal where value of the loss is the only issue there are still many issues regarding the existence and scope of damage that have not been resolved between the parties.this is due in large part to the insureds prematurely demanding appraisal without coming to an agreement upon a scope of loss or even providing allstate with the specifics of their claim.the brief asserted that damage to numerous items was not caused by smoke or heat from the cedar fire.
on november,allstate provided the panel members with its draft appraisal award form.the parties had not yet agreed to the form,however,and judge joseph instructed them to do so before the conclusion of the hearing.
on november,the parties stipulated in writing that the appraisal panel should utilize replacement cost value less depreciation to determine the actual cash value of the loss.the parties also stipulated to the amount of loss for certain items,including interior light fixtures and cleaning of windows,hvac heating,ventilation and air conditioning ducts and o zone.the same date,kacha increased the value of his loss to,and that prompted judge joseph to schedule the third hearing day.
on november,dawson sent allstate attorney,dale amato,via,a proposed revised form for the appraisal award.dawson reorganized the form by adding the italicized language to the following introductory paragraph that appeared in amato version we,the undersigned,in accordance with our appointment as appraisers umpire,without bias or personal interest,have observed the subject property and have examined the evidence submitted to us and,in accordance with our appointments,have made the following determination and award of damage,if any,to the structure of the insured residence attributable to the fire of october.italics added.the form then listed the claimed items,without repeating the italicized language for each item,as amato version had,and provided space for an award for each item.
in a december,amato sent dawson minor amendments to the appraisal award form,including the deletion of the words structure of the in the italicized sentence in the preceding paragraph,and asked dawson to let him know if they were acceptable.in a december,dawson responded,i reviewed the changes,all is fine.accordingly,the introductory paragraph of the appraisal award form stated the panel members have made the following determination and award of damage,if any,to the insured residence attributable to the fire of october.
allstate submitted a supplemental appraisal brief,again claiming certain damages were unrelated to the cedar fire.for one example,allstate asserted that discoloration of a door could have been caused by sunlight,weather a breakdown of the factory applied finish.allstate urged the appraisal panel to award kacha nothing for items that were damaged but,according to allstate,not in the cedar fire.
in a reply appraisal brief dated december,dawson,on behalf of kacha,objected that there can not be a determination of coverage or cause of loss by this p anel.dawson urged the panel to establish a value based upon the damage to the premises not based upon arguments by allstate regarding blame,responsibility and speculative theories on the cause of loss.in closing,the brief stated,we implore you to ignore the theories of cause of loss,as those issues are irrelevant to the appraisal process.
on december,amato submitted to the panel the appraisal award form he and dawson negotiated.in an accompanying letter to the panel,amato stated,please note that the language of the appraisal award specifically authorizes the appraisal panel to determine if there is any damage to the kacha home as a result of the fire of october.amato advised,it is also allstate position that the strictures of sharma,supra,d.are not applicable to the instant appraisal hearing.italics added.amato faxed a copy of the letter to dawson.
dawson immediately wrote to amato that w e are concerned about your continued communication with the a ppraisal p anel outside of the agreed briefing schedule,and i t is time to allow the p anel to consider the evidence,establish an a ward according to the claims and to submit that a ward to the parties for payment.the letter also stated,if you have any legal arguments that you would like to make we invite you to return to the san diego superior court after the a ward is rendered.thereafter,the court will surely hear your arguments.
several weeks after the last day of the hearing,january,the panel delivered an appraisal award for in replacement cost value and in actual cash value.it was signed by judge joseph and heilbron,but not by charleston.the award included amounts of zero for numerous items,such as marble and stone work in a bathroom and a shower,an interior brass and stainless steel banister,the front entry door,baseboards,concrete pool and decking,block fencing,a retaining wall cap,the driveway and entry walk,speakers,amplifiers and video games.allstate sent kacha two checks totaling,representing the sum,less the amount it already paid on the claim.kacha,however,did not endorse or negotiate the checks.
kacha applied to the appraisal panel to correct the award,arguing the panel exceeded its authority by making coverage determinations reserved to allstate.the petition also stated,we informed the p anel that we did not give you the authority to determine or decide if a loss occurred or if the loss claimed caused the damage.
allstate opposed the application,and judge joseph and heilbron issued an order denying it.the order stated the form agreed upon by both sides for the appraisal award provided that the determinations and award of damages,if any attributable to the fire should be determined by the panel.it is clear the parties stipulated to determinations by the panel of whether damage had occurred.
kacha then filed a petition in superior court to vacate the appraisal award.in support,dawson submitted declarations that stated at the last hearing day on january he immediately objected to the form of the appraisal award when amato took the position it allowed the appraisers to determine coverage issues.one of dawson declarations stated he advised,our position is that the determination of damage or coverage was to be made by the parties and evaluation of the damage was to be made by the appraisal panel.
lawrence,kacha attorney,also submitted a declaration.it stated that d uring discussions with the p anel and allstate counsel,we made it clear that we expected to establish the value of the submitted loss.allstate attorney took the position that the panel should determine the cause or causes of the damage to the kacha real and personal property.we informed allstate that their multiple theories of causation were inappropriate and inadmissible evidence in an appraisal.the declaration also stated dawson and i,never agreed that the panel could determine causation or damage to the property.no agreement on the p anel authority to determine damage ever occurred.it also stated that during the hearing,whenever allstate argued a lack of coverage he or dawson objected.
in opposition,allstate argued that despite the declarations kacha submitted,the drafting history of the appraisal award clearly evidences that the parties agreed to allow the panel to determine if any items were actually damaged by the cedar f ire.amato submitted a declaration that stated on january,the final day of the appraisal proceeding,a ny attempt by kacha to repudiate the appraisal award form was met with resistance by panel members,all of whom indicated that based upon the form of the award that was presented on the first day and how the evidence was being received,the panel was proceeding on the basis that they were to decide if any damage had occurred.
after a hearing,the court took the matter under submission.it later issued an order denying kacha petition and confirming the appraisal award.the court found that because of the language of the appraisal award form to which dawson had agreed,the rule of sharma,supra,d,was inapplicable and the appraisers were authorized to determine coverage issues.further,the court found kacha accepted and retained allstate checks,and by doing so waived his right to challenge the appraisal award.on august,judgment was entered in conformance with the order.
discussion 
istandard of review 
appraisal hearings are a form of arbitration and are generally subject to the rules governing arbitration.judicial review of an arbitration,or appraisal award,is circumscribed.see sy first family.partnership cheung th,d.courts may not review either the merits of the controversy or the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the award.ibid.the court,however,shall vacate an appraisal award under certain circumstances,including when the appraisers exceeded their powers and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the controversy submitted.code civ,subd.a.
we review the trial court ruling on a challenge to an appraisal award under a de novo standard,drawing every reasonable inference to support the award.pierotti torian th,d.to the extent the court ruling rests on issues of disputed fact,however,we apply the substantial evidence test.malek blue cross of california th,d.i f the word substantial means anything at all,it clearly implies that such evidence must be of ponderable legal significance.obviously the word can not be deemed synonymous with any evidence.it must be reasonable in nature,credible,and of solid value it must actually be substantial proof of the essentials which the law requires in a particular case.beck development southern pacific transportation th,d.
no waiver of section or sharmaa 
we are persuaded by kacha contention the trial court erred by finding the form of the appraisal award constituted a waiver of his rights under section and the rule of sharma.
since its substance was first enacted in,section has directed that the standard form for fire insurance policies include an appraisal provision to settle disagreements concerning the amount of loss.gebers state farm general ins.th,d,italics added.the policy must provide for an appraisal when the insured and this company shall fail to agree as to the actual cash value or the amount of loss,subd.a,italics added.it must also state the appraisers shall appraise the loss and,failing to agree,shall submit their differences,only,to the umpire.an award in writing,so itemized,of any two when filed with this company shall determine the amount of actual cash value and loss,italics added.the allstate policy covering kacha property recites this language.
as our high court held in jefferson ins.superior court cal d,jefferson although arbitrators are frequently,by the terms of the agreement providing for arbitration,given broad powers citation,appraisers generally have more limited powers.as stated in hughes potomac ins.d.hughes the function of appraisers is to determine the amount of damage resulting to various items submitted for their consideration.it is certainly not their function to resolve questions of coverage and interpret provisions of the policy.third italics added see also figi new hampshire ins.d.an appraiser only evaluates the loss and does not consider questions of policy,interpretation or scope of coverage.
the sharma court repeated this rule,citing the language of section and the jefferson and hughes opinions.sharma,supra,d at.the sharma court elaborated as follows in no authority is it suggested that an appraisal panel is empowered to determine whether an insured lost what he or she claimed to have lost or something different.when an insurer disputes an insured description of the lost or destroyed property,it necessarily claims the insured innocently or character of the loss in filing a proof of loss.in turn,this claim opens the door to allegations of fraud.were an insurer permitted to include the former issue within the scope of an appraisal,a determination in the insurer favor would foreclose a court from determining one essential element of fraud in any subsequent litigation.certainly,an insurer is free to litigate whether the insured has misrepresented what he or she lost but it is beyond the scope of an appraisal.id.at.when an appraisal panel exceeds its powers by deciding coverage issues,and the award can not be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision,the decision must be vacated.id.at.
a fire insurance policy must also provide no permission affecting this insurance shall exist,or waiver of any provision be valid,unless granted herein or expressed in writing added hereto.no provision,stipulation or forfeiture shall be held to be waived by any requirement or proceeding on the part of this company relating to appraisal or to any examination provided for herein,subd.a,italics added.although the portions of the allstate
