opinion of the court 
hamilton park health care center filed a petition to vacate an arbitration award in a dispute with the seiu united healthcare workers east union.the district court denied the petition and confirmed the award.on appeal,hamilton park asserts that the court erred by approving a arbitration award when the parties collective bargaining agreement cba only contemplated a award.because the parties consented at arbitration to a award,we affirm this portion of the court order.
hamilton park also argues that,even if a award is permissible,the court should have severed a provision authorizing a new round of arbitration at a later date.we agree thus we reverse and remand as to this portion of the order.
background 
hamilton park is a care facility that was previously a member of a bargaining group.morris tuchman,represented the group referred to as tuchman homes in negotiations with seiu,which was the exclusive bargaining agent for the group employees subject to exceptions not at issue here in,tuchman homes and the union agreed to a cba beginning on march of that year and extending through february.the cba gave the union the option to reopen negotiations in november to bargain for new wages,hours,and general terms and conditions of employment for the cba last year february,february.if the union exercised its right to reopen and the parties did not agree to terms by february,they could submit any unresolved items to binding interest arbitration 
the cba provides that it can not be changed unless in writing,and signed by the authorized representatives of the parties.it also says that the arbitrator can not add to,subtract from,or otherwise amend or modify the terms of this agreement.although the cba only authorizes interest arbitration for the contract last year,it does not expressly bar any other types of arbitration.finally,the cba empowers the arbitrator to determine his jurisdiction and grant all appropriate remedies.
in november,the union invoked its right to reopen negotiations.the parties reached an impasse,and they submitted the unresolved issues to arbitration.one of the main sticking points was the percentage point increase in contributions that was necessary to maintain the level of health benefits that employees received.the union wanted tuchman homes to cover the entire increase,but the latter opposed paying any of it.during a hearing on march,the arbitrator,martin scheinman,suggested that the parties consider allowing him to fashion a award that went beyond the scope of the february,february,jurisdiction provided by the cba.the purpose of this would be to spread out increased employer contributions over a longer period of time.as scheinman recounted in the award he ultimately issued,the parties tentatively agreed to the request for expanded jurisdiction.he said that,in subsequent ex parte meetings,they firmly committed to this plan.specifically,he said that b oth sides agreed my jurisdiction permitted a award,at my discretion.however,these agreements were never in writing.
in november,scheinman issued a award that extended through june.it dealt with,among other topics,wages and health benefits contributions.with respect to the dispute over health benefits,the award called for a percentage point increase in employer contributions at the outset followed by a further percentage point increase in march.
scheinman also included a provision allowing the union to reopen negotiations for the contract last year june,june,and to submit any resulting disputes to binding interest arbitration.the effect of scheinman award was to create what courts frequently call a second generation interest arbitration agreement.see,globe newspaper int l ass of machinists,d.as the name implies,this refers to a scenario where an arbitrator uses his authority to decide a particular dispute to impose a requirement,not previously agreed upon by the parties,to arbitrate future disputes.
scheinman did not address why he included the second generation interest arbitration provision.nor did he ever conclude that the parties consented to it.he did,however,explain his reasoning for including a reopener provision.he said he followed the parties format,derived from the cba,of permitting the union to reopen negotiations for the contract last year.in both the cba and scheinman award,the reopener and arbitration provisions work in tandem reopening followed,if need be,by arbitration.it appears that scheinman presumed that the parties,having once in the cba elected to resolve disputes through interest arbitration,would continue to choose that model for future disputes.
hamilton park responded to the award by filing a petition in the district court to vacate it.the crux of its argument was that scheinman exceeded his authority under the cba by issuing a award instead of confining himself to the year ending february,and by inserting a second generation interest arbitration provision.hamilton park position was that it did not provide oral consent for scheinman actions and that,even if it had,it would be insufficient because the cba requires written authorization.
in support of the contention that it never provided consent,hamilton park submitted to the court a letter its counsel had written to tuchman along with an unsigned declaration from tuchman that was attached to the letter.the letter stated that hamilton park counsel had spoken with tuchman and prepared the declaration on his behalf based on that discussion.it closed by asking tuchman to execute the declaration,which asserted that he never consented to any modification of the cba authorizing scheinman to issue an award beyond one year.however,hamilton park later informed the court that tuchman refused to sign the declaration.
hamilton park also submitted declarations from its chief financial officer,donald wuertz,and from jacqueline cousins,an administrator at cranford health and extended care,another member of the tuchman homes bargaining group.the declarations said that neither the group as a whole nor hamilton park individually gave scheinman or tuchman authorization for a award.but they are silent on whether tuchman,as the group representative,authorized scheinman to issue such an award.
