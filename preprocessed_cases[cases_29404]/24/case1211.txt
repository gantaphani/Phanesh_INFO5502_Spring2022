statement of facts 
in november,plaintiff jose cruz filed an action against defendants pacificare health systems,and pacificare of california.collectively pacificare,alleging claims for unfair competition and false advertising in connection with pacificare sale,marketing,and rendering of medical services.in his first amended complaint,cruz alleged that he was an enrollee in one of the various health plans pacificare offers and operates in california.he also alleged that through its misleading and deceptive material representations and omissions,pacificare has employed a fraudulent,unlawful,unfair scheme designed to induce persons to enroll in its health plans by misrepresenting that its primary commitment is to maintain and improve the quality of healthcare provided.in fact,cruz alleged,pacificare has been aggressively engaged in implementing undisclosed systemic internal policies that are designed,inter alia,to discourage pacificare primary care physicians from delivering medical services and to interfere with the medical judgment of pacificare healthcare providers.the result of these policies,he alleged,is a reduction in the quality of provided healthcare that is directly contrary to pacificare representations.
cruz emphasized in his first amended complaint that he does not challenge the denial of medical benefits to any enrollee or subscriber,but challenges the manner in which pacificare induced persons to subscribe to its health plans by misrepresenting or failing to disclose internal policies that lower the quality of services provided.cruz alleged that he was filing the action in his individual capacity and on behalf of the general public,and he sought to represent a class of approximately million pacificare health plan enrollees in california.
based on these general allegations,cruz alleged four causes of action.in the first,he alleged that pacificare had violated business and professions code section by engaging in false advertising that reduce d the quality of medical services available to enrollees and decrease d the value of the health coverage for which they paid.to remedy this alleged violation,cruz requested an order enjoining pacificare from violating business and professions code section and requiring it to disgorge all of its gains and monies wrongfully acquired.the second cause of action alleged that in violating various state statutes,pacificare had committed an unfair,unlawful,or fraudulent business act or practice under business and professions code section that reduce d the quality of medical services available to enrollees and decrease d the value of their respective h ealth p lans.to remedy this alleged violation,cruz requested an order enjoining pacificare from violating business and professions code section and requiring it to disgorge all of its gains and monies wrongfully acquired.the third cause of action alleged that pacificare misrepresentations violated the clra.to remedy this alleged violation,cruz requested an order enjoining pacificare wrongful acts and practices and requiring that pacificare make restitution of all monies paid to it.cruz also stated his intent to add a request for actual damages if pacificare failed to remedy the damage from its violation.the fourth cause of action was for unjust enrichment,and alleged that as a result of pacificare conduct,enrollees had receiv ed a lower quality of care than advertised and represented by pacificare.as to remedy,cruz requested restitution,refund,or reimbursement of certain monies paid by or on behalf of enrollees,and disgorgement of the excessive and monies obtained by pacificare as a result of the unlawful,fraudulent,or unfair business acts and practices and untrue and misleading advertisements.
pacificare moved for an order compelling cruz to arbitrate his claims and staying the action pending completion of arbitration.pacificare argued that cruz,who obtained health coverage through his employer,was required to arbitrate his claims under several provisions of the subscriber agreement between his employer and pacificare.pacificare relied primarily on paragraph of the subscriber agreement,which provides in part arbitration.pacificare uses binding arbitration to resolve any and all disputes between pacificare and group or member,including disputes relating to the delivery of services under the pacificare health plan.pacificare,group and member each understand and expressly agree that by entering into the pacificare subscriber agreement,pacificare,group and member are each voluntarily giving up their constitutional right to have all such disputes decided in a court of law before a jury,and instead are accepting the use of binding arbitration.pacificare also relied on paragraph of the subscriber agreement,which establishes a procedure for member appeals not related to quality of care and provides that a member who is not satisfied with the outcome of pacificare internal appeals process may submit or request that pacificare submit the appeal to binding arbitration before the american arbitration association aaa.paragraph also provides upon submission of a dispute to the aaa,member and pacificare agree to be bound by the rules of procedure and decision of the aaa.paragraph concludes by stating pacificare and member understand that by entering into this agreement,they are giving up their constitutional right to have any dispute decided in a court of law before a jury and instead are accepting the use of arbitration.pacificare also relied on cruz signed enrollment form,which stated that he agree d to and underst ood several terms and conditions,including to be bound by the pacificare subscriber agreement and that a ny differences between myself and pacificare relating to pacificare or its performance are subject to binding arbitration.finally,pacificare relied on the member handbook it sent to cruz,which describes pacificare internal appeals process and,for members unsatisfied with the result of that process,the option of arbitration before the aaa.the member handbook also states members understand that by enrolling in pacificare,they agree to give up their constitutional right to have any dispute decided in a court of law before a jury and instead are accepting the use of arbitration for resolving disputes with pacificare.
cruz opposed pacificare motion on several grounds.he first argued that the applicable arbitration provision does not encompass this dispute because the paragraph in the subscriber agreement requiring arbitration before the aaa governs appeals not related to quality of care and his complaint is solely directed to the quality of care provided by pacificare.second,he argued that his requests for injunctive relief are inarbitrable under broughton.third,he argued that the arbitration clause is unconscionable.finally,he argued that because pacificare did not enter into any agreement with either him or his employer,it may not invoke the arbitration clause.
pacificare offered several arguments in response.regarding cruz contention under broughton,pacificare argued that broughton prohibits arbitration only of claims for injunctive relief under the clra,and does not prohibit arbitration of cruz monetary claims for disgorgement,restitution and reimbursement or his request for injunctive relief under business and professions code sections and.regarding the scope of arbitration,pacificare argued that because the language of paragraph of the subscriber agreement requires binding arbitration to resolve any and all disputes between pacificare and group or member italics added,it includes claims related to quality of care.supporting this interpretation,pacificare asserted,is the fact that the one example paragraph provides of a covered dispute allegations against pacificare of medical malpractice addresses a claim involving quality of care.pacificare also argued that even if quality of care issues were exempt from arbitration,cruz does not raise quality of care issues,and his claims therefore do not fall within this exemption.finally,pacificare argued that the arbitration clause was not unconscionable.
the trial court denied pacificare motion to compel arbitration.it reasoned that broughton expressly precludes arbitration of cruz claim for injunctive relief under the clra,and it extended broughton reasoning to claims for injunctive relief under business and professions code sections and by an individual acting as a private attorney general.the court also reasoned that cruz claims for disgorgement,restitution,and unjust enrichment are inarbitrable as essentially equitable remedies distinct from damages.given these conclusions,the court expressly declined to rule on any of cruz other objections to pacificare motion.
the court of appeal affirmed,relying on broughton and rejecting pacificare argument that the united states supreme court had abrogated broughton in subsequent decisions.it also upheld the trial court extension of broughton to claims for disgorgement and restitution under business and professions code section et,relying primarily on the public benefit derived from those remedies and the interrelationship between those remedies and injunctive relief.the court limited its holding to equitable remedies within the context of class action claims.like the trial court,the court of appeal did not consider any of cruz other arguments against arbitration.we then granted pacificare petition for review.
ii.discussion 
a.did green tree and circuit city overrule broughton 
pacificare contends that our decision in broughton,supra,cal th,d,holding that injunctive relief claims under the clra are inarbitrable,should be overruled in light of green tree,supra,d,and circuit city,supra,d.according to pacificare,these two decisions,read in conjunction with earlier united states supreme court decisions,make clear that only not state create exceptions to the federal arbitration act faa requirement that arbitration agreements be enforced according to their terms,and that therefore state courts can not hold that certain requests for public injunctive relief are inarbitrable.we disagree.
in broughton,we recognized that the united states supreme court has emphasized congress and its own policy in favor of arbitration and,at least since,has rejected numerous efforts and arguments by state courts,federal courts and litigants to declare certain classes of cases not subject to arbitration.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.indeed,we acknowledged the supreme court broad statement in its seminal arbitration case,southland keating,d,that i n enacting of the faa,congress declared a national policy favoring arbitration and withdrew the power of the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.
we nonetheless held that requests for injunctive relief designed to benefit the public presented a narrow exception to the rule that the faa requires state courts to honor arbitration agreements.we reasoned that the supreme court has acknowledged that congress may require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration broughton,supra,cal th at,d,quoting southland keating,supra,at,and that t he unsuitability of a statutory claim for arbitration turns on congressional intent,which can be discovered in the text of the statute in question,its legislative history or in an inherent conflict between arbitration and the statute underlying purposes.broughton,supra,cal th at,d,quoting gilmer lane,d gilmer.
we then concluded that there was indeed an inherent conflict between arbitration and the clra authorization in civil code section,subdivision a for injunctive relief designed to protect the public,to stop deceptive business practices.as we stated t here are two factors taken in combination that make for an inherent conflict between arbitration and the underlying purpose of the clra injunctive relief remedy.first,that relief is for the benefit of the general public rather than the party bringing the action.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.in reaching this conclusion,we distinguished requests for public injunctions from other sorts of actions,such as antitrust suits,in which the public benefit is incidental to the plaintiff award of damages unlike private suits for damages,in a public injunction action a plaintiff acts in the purest sense as a private attorney general.id.at,d.second,the judicial forum has significant institutional advantages over arbitration in administering a public injunctive remedy,which as a consequence will likely lead to the diminution or frustration of the public benefit if the remedy is entrusted to arbitrators.id.at,d.we reasoned that an arbitrator lacked the institutional continuity and the appropriate jurisdiction to sufficiently enforce and,if needed,modify a public injunction.id.at,d.we concluded given this inherent conflict,we will presume,absent indications to the contrary,that the legislature did not intend that the injunctive relief claims be arbitrated.broughton,at,d.we discerned no such legislative intent.ibid.
we further concluded that denying arbitration in this one area would not violate the faa.as we stated a lthough the court has stated generally that the capacity to withdraw statutory rights from the scope of arbitration agreements is the prerogative solely of congress,not state courts or legislatures southland keating,supra,at,it has never directly decided whether a legislature may restrict a private arbitration agreement when it inherently conflicts with a public statutory purpose that transcends private interests.in the present case,as discussed,we believe there is such an inherent conflict between arbitration and a statutory injunctive relief remedy designed for the protection of the general public.although both california and federal law recognize the important policy of enforcing arbitration agreements,it would be perverse to extend the policy so far as to preclude states from passing legislation the purposes of which make it incompatible with arbitration,or to compel states to permit the vitiation through arbitration of the substantive rights afforded by such legislation.
in other terms,our holding does not represent a suspicion of arbitration as a method of weakening the protections afforded in the substantive law to complainants out of step with our current strong endorsement of the federal statutes favoring this method of resolving disputes citation.rather,it is a recognition that arbitration can not necessarily afford all the advantages of adjudication in the area of private attorney general actions,that in a narrow class of such actions arbitration is inappropriate,and that this inappropriateness does not turn on the happenstance of whether the rights and remedies being adjudicated are of state or federal derivation.
nor does anything in the legislative history of the faa suggest that congress contemplated public injunction arbitration within the universe of arbitration agreements it was attempting to enforce.indeed,the primary focus of the drafters of the faa appears to have been on the utility of arbitration in resolving ordinary commercial disputes.citations.although the court has interpreted the faa to extend to noncommercial statutory claims,it is doubtful congress would have envisioned the extension of the faa to enforce arbitral jurisdiction over a public injunction.broughton,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
the recent united states supreme court cases cited by pacificare have little if any bearing on our holding in broughton.in circuit city,supra,d,the court concluded that section of the faa,which exempts from the scope of the faa contracts of employment of seamen,railroad employees,or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce,did not exempt most employment contracts.the opinion was principally concerned with an analysis of the meaning of section,not the preemptive scope of section.the majority rejected the position of various amici curiae,including attorneys general of states,who argued that applying the faa to employment contracts would interfere with the employment policies of the states.in rejecting this argument,the court reaffirmed southland,and declined to chip away at that case by what the majority termed an unconventional reading of section.circuit city,supra,at.broughton,of course,was neither predicated on overruling southland nor on construing section of the faa.the circuit city court did not address the central question in broughton whether public injunctions were arbitrable.nor did it shed any further light on the inherently incompatible exception to arbitrability.
still less is green tree,supra,d,relevant to broughton.that case was narrowly focused on the issue of cost sharing in the arbitration of federal statutory claims.green tree holding did not concern federal preemption of state arbitration claims.nor did its reiteration of congress strong policy id.at.call broughton into question.as discussed above,broughton takes such a policy as a given.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.
in sum,nothing that is novel about green tree or circuit city has any bearing on broughton.the only parts of these opinions that remotely pertain to broughton are recapitulations of familiar themes regarding the importance of enforcing arbitration agreements and the inability of states to prevent that enforcement.these were amply considered in broughton.moreover,we were presented in broughton with extensive argument that clra public injunctions were arbitrable.see broughton,supra,cal th at,d,dis.opn.of chin.we decline pacificare invitation to revisit this argument.
are injunctions under business and professions code sections and arbitrable 
pacificare contends that even if we affirm our holding in broughton that claims for injunctive relief under the clra are inarbitrable,the same should not hold true for injunctive relief claims under the unfair competition law ucl,business and professions code section et,and claims of false advertising under business and professions code section.we disagree under the circumstances of the present case.
the ucl is intended to proscribe unfair or fraudulent business act s or practice s and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising bus.the law provides that any person engaged in unfair competition may be enjoined.moreover,s tanding to sue under the ucl is expansive unfair competition actions can be brought by a public prosecutor or by any person acting for the interests of itself,its members or the general public.korea supply lockheed martin cal th,d,korea supply,quoting bus.the ucl is intended to protect competitors as well as consumers from unfair practices.tippett terich th,d.thus,there may be occasions in which the injunctive power of the ucl is used primarily to redress injuries to competing businesses and only incidentally for the public benefit.see,communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.in broughton,we declined to decide whether requests for injunctive relief designed primarily to rectify individual wrongs were arbitrable.broughton,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
we need not decide whether ucl injunctive relief actions brought by injured business competitors are arbitrable.in the present case,the request for injunctive relief is clearly for the benefit of health care consumers and the general public by seeking to enjoin pacificare alleged deceptive advertising practices.the claim is virtually indistinguishable from the clra claim that was at issue in broughton.broughton,supra,cal th at,d,broughton sought to enjoin health care company alleged deceptive advertising of its medical services.
the same is true of cruz request to enjoin pacificare alleged misleading advertising under business and professions code section.that section makes unlawful untrue or misleading statements designed to induce the public to enter into any obligation to purchase various goods and services.ibid.section authorizes the enjoining of such statements by various government officials and members of the public.cruz injunctive relief claim under section is essentially requesting the same relief for the same reason as is his ucl claim.see committee on children television,general foods cal d,same false advertising claim may give rise to actions under the ucl and bus.in other words,cruz action to enjoin pacificare alleged deceptive business practices is undertaken for the public benefit,whether designated as a claim under the clra or business and professions code section or section it is designed to prevent further harm to the public at large rather than to redress or prevent injury to a plaintiff.as such,for the reasons discussed in broughton,there is an inherent conflict between arbitration and the underlying purpose of those statutes injunctive relief remedy.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.
we therefore conclude that cruz injunctive relief claim is inarbitrable unless there are indications of legislative intent to the contrary in the ucl or business and professions code section.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.we discern no such intent.business and professions code sections and both provide that injunctive relief claims are to be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction.italics added.pacificare points to certain features in the clra not present in the ucl,such as the clra antiwaiver provision,and the fact that it provides for more extensive remedies than the ucl or business and professions code section.see broughton,supra,cal th at,d.but these were not the characteristics we relied on in concluding that requests for injunctive relief under the clra are inarbitrable.broughton,at,d.the absence of these features in the ucl or in business and professions code section does not persuade us that the legislature intended to allow arbitration of public injunctive relief requests under these statutes.we therefore conclude that each of cruz injunctive relief requests is inarbitrable 
are cruz claims for restitution and disgorgement under the ucl arbitrable 
pacificare contends the court of appeal erred in extending broughton to hold that claims for restitution and disgorgement under the ucl are inarbitrable.we agree.
in broughton,we held that damages claims under the clra are arbitrable,notwithstanding the fact that such claims vindicate important statutory rights.after reviewing united states supreme court precedent regarding the arbitration of antitrust and other federal statutory claims,we concluded that such precedent establishes that statutory damages claims are fully arbitrable.such an action is primarily for the benefit of a party to the arbitration,even if the action incidentally vindicates important public interests.citation.in the context of statutory damage claims,the united states supreme court has consistently rejected plaintiffs arguments that abbreviated discovery,arbitration inability to establish binding precedent,and a plaintiff right to a jury trial render the arbitral forum inadequate,or that submission of resolution of the claims to arbitration is in any sense a waiver of the substantive rights afforded by statute.citations.by agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim,a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than a judicial,forum.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.
under the ucl,remedies are limited.a ucl action is equitable in nature damages can not be recovered.citation.p revailing plaintiffs are generally limited to injunctive relief and restitution.korea supply,supra,cal th at,d.in the ucl context,an order for restitution is an order compelling a ucl defendant to return money obtained through an unfair business practice to those persons in interest from whom the property was taken,that is,to persons who had an ownership interest in the property or those claiming through that person.kraus trinity management services,cal th,d,fn.omitted.
as we noted in cortez purolator air filtration products cal th,d,civil code section defines damages every person who suffers detriment from the unlawful act or omission of another,may recover from the person in fault a compensation therefor in money,which is called damages.we concluded that damages,thus broadly defined,may include a restitutionary element.cortez,supra,cal th at,d.given this overlap,there appears to be no reason why restitutionary claims,like clra claims for damages,should not be arbitrable.nothing in broughton functional analysis suggests that the mere designation of restitution as an equitable remedy makes the request for the remedy inarbitrable.moreover,although cruz argues that restitution under the ucl accomplishes a public purpose by deterring unlawful conduct,the same could be said of damages under the clra or under various federal statutes.this deterrent effect is,however,incidental to the private benefits obtained from those bringing the restitutionary or damages action.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court has made clear that such actions,notwithstanding the public benefit,are fully arbitrable under the faa.ibid.
the court of appeal in the present case expressly limited its holding of inarbitrability to ucl class action suits.a class action may be primarily for the public benefit.but public benefit is only one of the factors we identified in broughton as weighing in favor of the action inarbitrability.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.the other factor,the institutional advantages of the judicial forum over arbitration in the administration of a public injunction,is not present.ibid.it may be the case that under the ucl,a class action would allow for disgorgement into a fluid recovery fund and distribution by various means.see kraus trinity management services,supra,cal th at,d,korea supply,supra,cal th at,fn,d.but the establishment of such a fund and the distribution of its proceeds does not present the same order of institutional difficulty as does the maintenance of a permanent statewide injunction requiring judicial supervision.we agree with the one published case on this issue that u nlike a public injunction,disgorgement of funds does not need to be continuously monitored because its object is limited in time and scope.once the profits to be disgorged and the recipients of those funds are identified,there is no need for long term modification and correction necessitating judicial supervision.therefore,disgorgement of funds is essentially the same as awarding money damages,and within the power of the arbitrators to award.t here is no inherent conflict between this remedy and arbitration.arriaga cross country bank d.
moreover,in this state we recognize classwide arbitration as a means of bringing collective legal action by parties bound to an arbitration agreement.keating superior court cal d,overruled on other grounds in southland,keating,supra,d blue cross of california superior court th,d.without addressing questions not before us,we anticipate that courts may find it appropriate to become involved in supervising the equitable distribution of assets resulting from a class recovery,assuming entitlement to such recovery has been established.but we foresee that they would be able to do so without becoming involved in the merits of the underlying dispute.the same can not be said for the supervision,continued enforcement,and modification of a public injunction,wherein judicial involvement would appear to be both inevitable and desirable.see broughton,supra,cal th at,d.
amici curiae trial lawyers for public justice et argue that a recent united states supreme court case,eeoc waffle house,d,supports their position that all ucl claims are inarbitrable.in waffle house,the supreme court majority held that the equal employment opportunity commission may sue employers not only when it seeks to enjoin discriminatory employment practices,but also for relief,such as reinstatement and backpay,even when the employee on whose behalf it is acting is a party to a binding arbitration agreement.the court reasoned that the eeoc was neither a party to the arbitration agreement nor a mere proxy for the employee on whose behalf the action was brought,but rather an agency charged by congress with the vindication of the public interest.id.at.the court noted their conclusion might have differed if the eeoc could prosecute the action without the employee consent,or if the employee had the final say in the eeoc prayer for relief.id.at.the dissent agreed with the majority that the eeoc was not bound by employee arbitration agreements when it pursued relief,but would have held that it was prevented by the arbitration agreement from bringing an action for relief on those employees behalf.id.at.dis.opn.of thomas.
amici curiae compare the private attorney general action brought under business and professions code section with an action brought by the eeoc,and argue that anyone acting in a private attorney general capacity should not be bound by an arbitration agreement.but in light of the united states supreme court strong presumption in favor of enforcing arbitration agreements reviewed above,we do not read waffle house as permitting a party to an arbitration agreement to evade its contractual obligation to settle its own restitutionary claims through arbitration merely by acting as a representative on behalf of other similarly situated claimants 
we therefore conclude that cruz actions for restitution disgorgement,whether brought as an individual or as a class action,are arbitrable by the same logic,his common law claim for unjust enrichment,which is essentially an action for restitution see lauriedale associates wilson th,d,is also arbitrable.
finally,we note that when there is a severance of arbitrable from inarbitrable claims,the trial court has the discretion to stay proceedings on the inarbitrable claims pending resolution of the arbitration.code civ,madden kaiser foundation hospitals cal d.we agree with the court of appeal in coast plaza doctors hospital blue cross of california,supra,th at page,d,that such a stay is generally in order under these circumstances.a stay is appropriate where i n the absence of a stay,the continuation of the proceedings in the trial court disrupts the arbitration proceedings and can render them ineffective.ibid.
iii.disposition 
although cruz monetary equitable relief claims are not inherently inarbitrable,he contends,as noted,that the arbitration agreement should not be enforced for other reasons,such as because his claims are outside the scope of the arbitration agreement and because the agreement is unconscionable.the trial court,holding all of the claims inarbitrable per se,did not address these contentions.these objections to arbitration may be reasserted on remand.
the judgment of the court of appeal is affirmed in part and reversed in part,and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the federal arbitration act et.faa evinces a supreme and preemptive federal policy favoring the enforcement of arbitration agreements involving interstate commerce.in broughton cigna healthplans cal th,d,broughton,this court articulated the principle that,notwithstanding the faa,california may act in contravention of that policy by requiring a judicial forum for public injunction requests that parties contracting in interstate commerce have agreed to resolve by arbitration.there we held that claims by one party against another for public injunctive relief under our state consumer legal remedies act clra were inarbitrable despite the parties agreement to arbitrate all their disputes.
i joined the majority opinion in broughton,supra,cal th,d.but as justice chin cogently and compellingly explains in his concurring and dissenting opinion herein,broughton reasoning has been undermined by three subsequent decisions of the united states supreme court eeoc waffle house,d circuit city stores,adams,d and green tree fin.randolph,d.accordingly,while i concur fully in the majority conclusion here that plaintiff jose cruz claims for restitution,disgorgement,and unjust enrichment are arbitrable pursuant to the parties agreement,i can not join in its determination to follow and extend broughton to bar arbitration of plaintiff requests for injunctive relief under the clra,the unfair competition law ucl bus,et,and business and professions code section.
not only do the recent supreme court authorities cast grave doubt on broughton legal analysis and conclusion,but as justice chin also points out,claims under the ucl are easily alleged in the context of business activities.conc.dis.opn.of chin,post,at d at,at.therefore,extending broughton to ucl injunctive relief requests will surely frustrate the legitimate contract expectations of a great many who seek to secure the benefits of a nonjudicial forum for resolving their disputes.indeed,virtually every lawsuit involving a business entity will be subject to compounded costs and delayed resolution of claims when bifurcated litigation of the suit proceeds one part after the other in dual fora first,an arbitration proceeding in which any restitution,disgorgement,and unjust enrichment claims and any damages claims are resolved and second,a judicial action in which the ucl claims seeking public injunctive relief are litigated.see,ante,at d at,at.this additional consideration is a paramount one that further contributed to my reevaluation of broughton.
for all the foregoing reasons,i hereby dissent from the majority decision that plaintiff requests for injunctive relief are inarbitrable.
i concur in the majority holding that the claims of plaintiff jose cruz for restitution,disgorgement,and unjust enrichment are arbitrable.however,i dissent from the majority decision to follow and extend broughton cigna healthplans cal th,d,broughton,in holding that cruz requests for injunctive relief under the consumers legal remedies act clra,et,the unfair competition law ucl bus,et,and business and professions code section are not arbitrable.broughton holding that clra claims for public injunctive relief are not arbitrable is inconsistent and incompatible with the united states supreme court binding construction of the federal arbitration act faa et in three decisions circuit city stores,adams,d circuit city,eeoc waffle house,d waffle house,and green tree fin.randolph,d green tree.moreover,given the ease with which a plaintiff may allege a claim under the ucl,the majority extension of broughton to ucl claims destroys the enforceability of arbitration agreements and eviscerates the public established by both the california legislature and the united states strongly favors enforcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms.finally,the majority sacrifices this public policy for no good reason even if we hold an individual plaintiff to his or her agreement to arbitrate,under this court prior construction of the ucl,the attorney general of california and any other california citizen who has not signed an arbitration agreement may bring a court action for injunctive relief to protect the public and vindicate the public interest in enforcement of the statutes here in question.
i.the faa preempts state laws that limit the enforceability of arbitration agreements.
in enacting the faa,congress intended to revers e centuries of judicial hostility to arbitration agreements,citation,by plac ing them upon the same footing as other contracts.express mcmahon,d.section of the faa provides a written provision in a contract evidencing a transaction involving interstate commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction,shall be valid,irrevocable,and enforceable,save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.this provision requires courts to enforce privately negotiated agreements to arbitrate,like other contracts,in accordance with their terms volt info.sciences leland stanford,d volt,and mandates enforcement of agreements to arbitrate,even if they include statutory claims.shearson,supra,at.the liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,citation,manifested by this provision and the faa as a whole,is at bottom a policy guaranteeing the enforcement of private contractual arrangements the faa simply creates a body of federal substantive law establishing and regulating the duty to honor an agreement to arbitrate.citation.mitsubishi motors soler,d,fn.omitted.
the united states supreme court has demonstrated the primacy and scope of this duty by repeatedly invalidating,under the supremacy clause of the federal constitution,state laws that attempt to limit the enforceability of arbitration agreements in invalidating these state laws,the high court has explained that section of the faa is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,notwithstanding any state substantive or procedural policies to the contrary.perry,supra,at,italics added.according to the court,in enacting section of the faa,congress withdrew the power of the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration southland,supra,at.in order to foreclose state legislative attempts to undercut the enforceability of arbitration agreements.id.at,fn.omitted.thus,the faa ensures that an agreement to arbitrate specified claims will be enforced according to its terms even if a rule of state law would otherwise exclude such claims from arbitration.mastrobuono,supra,at,italics added.a ny state policy that purports to invalidate an arbitration clause in a contract that is otherwise enforceable under state law is unlawful,for that kind of policy would place arbitration clauses on an unequal footing,directly contrary to the faa language and congress intent.citation,supra,at,italics added.in short,under the high court binding construction of federal law,the faa state laws which require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration.citation.volt,supra,at.accordingly,state courts can not apply state statutes that invalidate arbitration agreements to which the faa applies,supra,at.
ii.broughton manufactures an exception to the rule of faa preemption.
in broughton,the plaintiffs sued a defendant that had provided them with health care coverage.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.they alleged in part that the defendant had violated the clra by deceptively advertising the quality of medical services provided under its health plan.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.they requested actual damages,punitive damages,and an order enjoining the defendant deceptive conduct.ibid.the defendant moved to compel arbitration,relying on a mandatory arbitration clause in its combined evidence of coverage and disclosure form.ibid.the superior court denied the motion as to the clra claim.ibid.
in a closely divided decision,a majority of this court affirmed the superior court decision insofar as it declined to order arbitration of the plaintiffs request for an injunction under the clra.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.the majority opinion in broughton concluded the california legislature did not intend that requests under the clra for this type of injunctive relief be arbitrated.id.at,d.this conclusion rested on two factors.id.at,d.first,according to broughton,the evident purpose of the clra injunctive relief provision is to remedy a public wrong and to protect the general public from being victimized by the same deceptive practices as the plaintiff suffered,not to compensat e the plaintiff who brings and pursues the clra claim.id.at,d.in other words,broughton continued,the plaintiff in a clra damages action is playing the role of a bona fide private attorney general.citation.ibid.second,broughton found that private arbitration is inherent ly unsuitabl e as a means of resolving clra injunction requests.id.at.broughton based this finding on the view that private arbitration has several institutional shortcomings in the field of such public injunctions,specifically arbitrators are not accountable to the public continuing supervision of an injunction is problematic because arbitrators are not necessarily bound by earlier decisions of other arbitrators in the same case and are unconstrained by judicial review an arbitration award does not have collateral estoppel effect in favor of nonparties to an arbitration unless the arbitral parties so agree and modification or vacation of arbitral injunctions involves the cumbersome process of initiating a new arbitration proceeding.id.at,d.according to broughton,these two factors taken in combination make for an inherent conflict between arbitration and the underlying purpose of the clra injunctive relief remedy.id.at,d.based on this inherent conflict,broughton presume d the legislature did not intend that clra injunctive relief claims be arbitrated,and found no indications of a contrary legislative intent to overcome this presumption.ibid.in reaching this conclusion,broughton held that despite the express statutory declaration in code of civil procedure section that arbitration agreements are valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract,the legislature may express its intention to make a statutory right inarbitrable implicitly in those rare circumstances in which the fulfillment of the statutory purpose inherently conflicts with arbitration.broughton,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
broughton next found that this construction of the clra,although invalidating agreements to arbitrate clra injunction requests,did not violate the faa.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.relying on gilmer lane,d gilmer,broughton concluded that despite the faa,a court may invalidate an arbitration agreement if it finds,based on an inherent conflict between arbitration and a state statutory right or remedy,that the state legislature intended to prohibit arbitration of claims involving that state right or remedy.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.broughton acknowledged that the high court had recognize d an inherent conflict exception to the faa only with respect to federal statutory claims,and that gilmer and the other high court cases discussing that exception occurred in the context of an inquiry into whether congress had intended federal statutory claims to be exempt from arbitration,first italics added.citing southland,broughton also recognized that the high court has stated generally that the capacity to withdraw statutory rights from the scope of arbitration agreements is the prerogative solely of congress,not state courts or legislatures citation broughton,supra,cal th at,d.nevertheless,according to broughton,the high court faa preemption decisions ha d never directly decided whether a legislature may restrict a private arbitration agreement when it inherently conflicts with a public statutory purpose that transcends private interests.ibid.broughton also reasoned that it would be perverse to extend the policy of the faa so far as to preclude states from passing legislation the purposes of which make it incompatible with arbitration ibid.finally,broughton reasoned that the inappropriateness of arbitration as a means for resolving certain private attorney general actions does not turn on the happenstance of whether the rights and remedies being adjudicated are of state or federal derivation.ibid.broughton thus concluded that notwithstanding the high court pronouncement that the faa state laws which require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration volt,supra,at,state legislatures and state courts may require a judicial forum for public injunction requests that contracting parties have agreed to resolve by arbitration.
though invalidating agreements to arbitrate clra injunction requests,broughton also held that agreements to arbitrate clra claims for damages are enforceable,at least to the extent the faa governs such claims.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.broughton stated that the clra might be interpreted as requiring that clra damage claims be resolved solely in a judicial forum.ibid.however,broughton also explained a s the high court decisions make clear,statutory damages claims are fully arbitrable under the faa.such an action is primarily for the benefit of a party to the arbitration,even if the action incidentally vindicates important public interests.citation.in the context of statutory damages claims,the high court has consistently rejected the arguments that abbreviated discovery,arbitration inability to establish binding precedent,and a plaintiff right to a jury trial render the arbitral forum inadequate,or that submission of resolution of the claims to arbitration is in any sense a waiver of the substantive rights afforded by statute.citations.by agreeing to arbitrate a statutory claim,a party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral,rather than a judicial,forum.citation.ibid.thus,in order to make the clra consistent with the faa,broughton interpret ed the clra as permitting arbitration of damages claims,at least to the extent the faa governs such claims.ibid.
iii.the high court decisions require that we overrule broughton.
since we decided broughton,the high court has issued three relevant arbitration decisions.the high court statements in these three decisions require us to overrule broughton holding that california may prohibit enforcement of agreements to arbitrate clra requests for public injunctions.
the first refutes one of broughton critical premises that gilmer inherent conflict exception to the faa may apply based on the intent of a state opposed to that a state legislature therefore may,notwithstanding the faa,prohibit enforcement of an arbitration agreement where the legislature concludes that arbitration inherently conflicts with a statutory right or remedy.in circuit city,the high court construed the faa to apply to all contracts of employment except those of transportation workers.circuit city,supra,at.opposing this conclusion,v arious amici,including the attorneys general of states,argued that this broad construction of the faa would intrude upon the policies of the separate states by effect ively ing state employment laws that restrict or limit the ability of employees and employers to enter into arbitration agreements.id.at.amici curiae contended that states should be permitted,pursuant to their traditional role in regulating employment relationships,to prohibit employees from contracting away their right to pursue discrimination claims in court.id.at.the high court responded that under gilmer,arbitration agreements in employment contracts can be enforced under the faa without contravening the policies of congressional enactments giving employees specific protection against discrimination prohibited by federal law.circuit city,supra,at,italics added.as for the policies of state laws,the court found them irrelevant under southland holding that congress intended the faa to state antiarbitration laws to the contrary.citation.circuit city,supra,at.see also id.at.southland held that the faa is preemptive of state laws hostile to arbitration.the court also declared that courts may not chip away at southland by indirection.circuit city,supra,at.thus,circuit city holds that we may not,as broughton did,chip away at southland by applying gilmer exemption analysis,including the inherent conflict exception,based on the intent or policies of a state legislature.under circuit city,only the policies of congressional enactments are relevant to this analysis state policies are simply irrelevant unless,as the faa provides,they establish grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.circuit city,supra,at,italics added.
circuit city also undermines broughton analysis and conclusion in another important respect.as i have explained,amici curiae in circuit city argued for a construction of the faa that would leave states free to prohibit employees from contracting away their right to a judicial forum for resolving discrimination claims under state law.circuit city,supra,at.in rejecting this argument,the high court reasoned in part that amici curiae construction would enable states to deprive parties of the real benefits to the enforcement of arbitration provisions.id.at.arbitration,the court explained,allow s parties to avoid the costs of litigation these litigation costs would be compounded by the difficult questions that are often presented in disputes arising from the employment relationship citation,and the necessity of bifurcation of proceedings in those cases where state law precludes arbitration of certain types of employment claims but not others.id.at.the court also explained that amici curiae construction would produce considerable complexity and uncertainty regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements in employment contracts,which would call into doubt the efficacy of alternative dispute resolution procedures adopted by many of the nation employers,in the process undermining the faa proarbitration purposes and breeding litigation from a statute that seeks to avoid it.citation.ibid.as both broughton and the case now before us amply demonstrate,broughton holding produces precisely these effects it deprives parties of the benefits of arbitration,necessitates bifurcated proceedings and compounds litigation costs,and creates both complexity and uncertainty regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements,thereby placing in doubt arbitration efficacy as an alternative dispute resolution procedure,undermining the faa proarbitration purposes and breeding litigation from a statute that seeks to avoid it.citation.circuit city,supra,at.
the majority here errs in asserting that because circuit city was principally concerned with the construction of section of the faa,whereas broughton involved the preemptive scope of section,circuit city has little if any bearing on broughton,ante,d at,at.first and foremost,as i have explained,circuit city expressly relied on the preemptive scope of section,ante,d at,at in rejecting the argument that the high court should construe the faa so as to leave states free to implement their own policies regarding the nonarbitrability of discrimination claims under state law.circuit city,supra,at.again,the high court found the argument foreclosed by southland in section of the faa s state antiarbitration laws.circuit city,supra,at.second,the high court based its construction of section on the language and judicial construction of section.regarding the former,the court contrasted the expansive language of section with the narrower language of section.circuit city,supra,at.regarding the latter,the court explained that the plaintiff broad reading of section was inconsistent with the court expansive reading of.circuit city,supra,at.the court reasoned that the plaintiff construction of section would deprive parties of the arbitration benefits that section confers and,by creating considerable complexity and uncertainty regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements,would undermin e section proarbitration purposes.circuit city,supra,at.the court also explained that it would be incongruous to adopt a reading of section that would undo the broad coverage in that implement s proarbitration policies.circuit city,supra,at.third,the plaintiff argument in circuit city regarding section was premised on the high court construction of coverage provision.circuit city,supra,at.fourth,and finally,before even discussing the scope of section,the high court considered,and rejected,the plaintiff argument regarding the construction of,that section of the faa did not apply because an employment contract is not a contract evidencing a transaction involving interstate commerce within the meaning of section.circuit city,supra,at.thus,the majority errs in asserting that section of the specifically its preemptive scope,ante,d at,at were not critical components of the high court opinion in circuit city.
the majority also errs in asserting that circuit city does not shed any further light on the inherently incompatible exception to arbitrability,ante,d at,at.in circuit city,the attorneys general essentially argued that arbitration is inherently incompatible with state statutes that prohibit employees from contracting away their right to pursue discrimination claims in court,and that requiring arbitration of these claims would intrude upon the policies of the separate states reflected in these statutes.circuit city,supra,at.as i have explained,in rejecting this argument,the court held that whereas sets forth the inherent conflict analysis broughton adopted involved a federal statute and thus governs enforcement of agreements to arbitrate claims under federal law circuit city,supra,at,enforcement of agreements to arbitrate claims under state law is both governed and required by southland holding that the faa s state antiarbitration laws.id.at.thus,circuit city establishes that an exception to the faa may not be based on a state view that arbitration is inherently incompatible with some state policy.
in this regard,circuit city is consistent with another high court decision that broughton completely ignored mastrobuono.there,the high court held that the faa preempts a new york rule prohibiting an arbitrator from awarding punitive damages even where an arbitration agreement authorizes the award.mastrobuono,supra,at.new york established this rule based on its view that punitive damages are exemplary social remedies intended to punish and deter,not to compensate,and that as a matter of strong public policy,only the not private wield the power to punish.garrity lyle stuart,garrity.according to the state highest court,new york public policy requires rather close judicial supervision in the administration of this public penal sanction and,contrary to this public policy,there is no effective judicial supervision over punitive awards in arbitration.id.at.in finding that the faa preempts the new york rule,the high court explained that under its prior decisions,if contracting parties agree to include claims for punitive damages within the issues to be arbitrated,the faa ensures that their agreement will be enforced according to its terms even if a rule of state law would otherwise exclude such claims from arbitration.mastrobuono,supra,at,italics added.therefore,in the absence of contractual intent to the contrary,the faa would the new york rule,despite its basis in the state public policy.mastrobuono,supra,at.according to the high court,the question thus came down to what the contract not new york law ha d to say about the arbitrability of the claim for punitive damages.id.at,italics added.the court found that a t most,one contractual provision introduce d an ambiguity into an arbitration agreement that would otherwise allow punitive damages awards.id.at.explaining that the faa requires resolution of such ambiguities in favor of arbitration,the court read the arbitration agreement to permit arbitration of a punitive damages claim and it ordered enforcement of the arbitrator award of punitive damages notwithstanding new york law precluding such an award.mastrobuono,supra,at.
mastrobuono,which broughton did not consider or even cite,undermines broughton analysis and conclusion in several critical respects.first,it directly contradicts broughton statement that the high court ha d never directly decided whether a legislature may restrict a private arbitration agreement when it inherently conflicts with a public statutory purpose that transcends private interests.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.second,it directly refutes broughton view that arbitration of clra injunction requests is impermissible because of the need for continuing judicial supervision of clra injunctions.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.finally,and perhaps most importantly,mastrobuono directly refutes the fundamental premise of broughton analysis that the high court cases leave states free to prohibit arbitration of a state remedy if the primary purpose and effect of that remedy is to protect the public,not to compensate for an individual wrong.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.in the high court view,by definition,the purpose of punitive damages is not to compensate the injured party,but rather to punish the tortfeasor newport fact concerts,d and to protect the public by deterring the defendant and others from doing such wrong in the future.citation.pacific mutual life insurance haslip,d.given the court view that the purpose of punitive damages is to protect the public and not to compensate the victim in any sense,mastrobuono invalidation of new york rule against arbitration of punitive damages clearly established that the faa preempts state laws prohibiting arbitration of such public,noncompensatory remedies.
the majority errs in suggesting that broughton can be reconciled with mastrobuono because punitive damages are different from public injunctions in some relevant sense,ante,d at,at,fn.consistent with the high court view,we have explained that the purpose of a punitive damages award is a purely public one to punish wrongdoing and thereby to protect the public from future misconduct,either by the same defendant or other potential wrongdoers.citation.adams murakami cal d,fn.omitted adams.thus,under existing california law,punitive damages have the same primary purpose and effect that,according to broughton,public injunctions have not to compensate for an individual wrong but to prohibit and enjoin conduct injurious to the general public.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.as the preceding quote demonstrates,broughton held that arbitrability depends not,as the majority suggests,on whether a remedy confer s a direct benefit on the plaintiff,ante,d at,at,fn,but on whether the primary purpose and effect of the remedy is to compensate for an individual wrong or to prohibit and enjoin conduct injurious to the general public.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.applying this test,broughton held that clra requests for public injunctions are inarbitrable because such relief is designed for the protection of the general public.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.broughton analysis and conclusion are clearly irreconcilable with mastrobuono,which held that requests for punitive damages are arbitrable even though their sole purpose is to protect the public and not to compensate the victim in any sense.thus,that this case involves a request for injunctive relief rather than punitive damages is not a valid basis for distinguishing mastrobuono.indeed,as i later explain in more detail,the high court rejected this very distinction in its decision in waffle house 
the majority attempt to distinguish mastrobuono fails for an additional reason.the majority suggests that regarding judicial supervision in arbitration,the new york rule at issue in mastrobuono was premised on the inadequacy of judicial and appellate review,whereas broughton was premised on the monitoring,enforcement,and modification that is required of public injunctions,ante,d at,at,fn.however,broughton discussion of this subject stressed the fact that a rbitrators are unconstrained by judicial review and are not necessarily bound by earlier decisions of other arbitrators in the same case.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.thus,for several reasons,the majority attempt to distinguish mastrobuono is unpersuasive.
in circuit city and mastrobuono,the high court simply applied the general constitutional rule regarding the supremacy of federal law specifically in the arbitration context.the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,art.vi,cl invalidates all state laws that conflict or interfere with an act of congress.citations.rose arkansas state police,d,italics added.according to the high court,this rule applies regardless of the magnitude or nature of the public policy the state law seeks to implement.the relative importance to the state of its own law is not material when there is a conflict with a valid federal law,for the framers of our federal constitution provided in the supremacy clause that the federal law must prevail.citation.free bland,d.thus,the proper inquiry is whether there is a conflict between the state law and federal law,not the significance of the state public policy at issue.see also fidelity federal sav.loan de la cuesta,d federal preemption under the supremacy clause applies even though real property law is a matter of special concern to the states.broughton reliance on the importance of the public interest at stake when a plaintiff seeks a clra injunction is inconsistent with these binding high court precedents and pronouncements.regardless of the state interest,a state statute that authorizes the precise conduct that congress sought to prohibit is repugnant to the s upremacy c lause.rose arkansas state police,supra,at.thus,under broughton,the clra is repugnant to the supremacy is therefore as it authorizes california courts to do precisely what the faa prohibits invalidate agreements to arbitrate requests for clra injunctions on grounds other than those that exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.in short,mastrobuono and the high court decision in circuit city,consistent with and following the high court supremacy clause jurisprudence,refute a foundational assumption of broughton analysis that states may create faa exceptions for public policy reasons.
indeed,mastrobuono takes on increased importance with respect to this issue in light of the high court second relevant decision in waffle house,which held that under the faa,there is no difference in terms of arbitrability between requests for public injunctive relief and requests for compensatory or punitive damages.in waffle house,the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc filed a discrimination action under the americans with disabilities act both in the public interest and on behalf of the specific victim of the discrimination,who had signed an arbitration agreement with the defendant.waffle house,supra,at.the complaint requested injunctive relief to eradicate the effects of the defendant past and present unlawful employment practices and specific relief designed to make the victim whole,including backpay,compensatory damages,and punitive damages id.at.the court of appeals held that the victim arbitration agreement precluded the eeoc from seeking relief in court,but not from seeking injunctive relief.id.at.in so distinguish ing between injunctive and relief,the court of appeals concluded that the eeoc is barred from obtaining the latter because any public interest served when the eeoc pursues make whole relief is outweighed by the policy goals favoring arbitration.id.at.however,the court of appeals reasoned,when the eeoc seeks broad injunctive relief,the public interest overcome s the goals underpinning the faa,fn.omitted.
the high court in waffle house held that under the faa,a distinction in terms of arbitrability between requests for broad,injunctive relief to protect the public and requests for monetary relief,including punitive damages,is invalid.waffle house,supra,at.the court explained that this distinction does not serve its avowed purpose of preserving the eeoc public function while favoring arbitration.for that purpose,the category of relief is both overinclusive and underinclusive.for example,it is overinclusive because punitive damages serve an obvious public function in deterring future violations.citations.punitive damages may often have a greater impact on the behavior of other employers than the threat of an injunction,yet the eeoc is precluded from seeking this form of relief under the court of appeals compromise scheme.and,it is underinclusive because injunctive relief,although seemingly not,can be seen as more closely tied to the employees injury than to any public interest.id.at.while injunctive relief may appear more broad based,it nonetheless is redress for individuals.id.at.thus,the court held,if the faa policy favoring arbitration trumps the plain language of title vii and the contract,the eeoc should be barred from pursuing any claim outside the arbitral forum.if not,then the statutory language is clear the eeoc has the authority to pursue relief regardless of the forum that the employer and employee have chosen to resolve their disputes.ibid.the high court ultimately held that because the eeoc was not a party to the arbitration agreement,it could pursue an action in court for both injunctive relief and,monetary relief.id.at.
the high court decision in waffle house requires that we overrule broughton as being inconsistent with binding high court precedent.as i have explained,broughton held that clra requests for injunctive relief are not arbitrable because the purpose of such relief is to remedy a public wrong and to protect the general public,not to compensat e the plaintiff who pursues the clra claim.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.in waffle house,the high court rejected this analysis,explaining that even requests for public injunctive relief can be seen as more closely tied to the victim injury than to any public interest and is redress for individuals.waffle house,supra,at.the high court also explained that in terms of public protection,p unitive damages may often have a greater impact on a defendant behavior than the threat of an injunction ibid.this statement,in light of mastrobuono holding that the faa requires enforcement of agreements to arbitrate requests for punitive damages notwithstanding a state law precluding such arbitration mastrobuono,supra,at,contradicts broughton conclusion that we may base an faa exception for clra injunctive relief on the public nature of such relief.as i have also explained,broughton held that although the faa requires enforcement of agreements to arbitrate requests for monetary relief,it does not require enforcement of agreements to arbitrate requests for injunctive relief designed to protect the public.the high court in waffle house rejected this approach as well,holding that the precise distinction broughton requests for injunctive relief to protect the public and requests for,monetary invalid under the faa,and that as a matter of federal law,the faa requires courts to enforce an agreement to arbitrate requests for injunctive relief,even if that relief is designed principally to protect the public.waffle house,supra,at.thus,waffle house requires that we overrule broughton and hold that federal law requires enforcement of agreements to arbitrate clra requests for injunctive relief.
the majority discussion of waffle house completely misses the point of that decision.in waffle house,the high court did not,as the majority suggests,base its decision on the extent to which the eeoc act s on behalf of the public,ante,d at,at,fn.in fact,the high court found that the lower federal court had erred in focusing on precisely this factor.waffle house,supra,at.instead,the high court held that because the faa does not require parties to arbitrate when they have not agreed to do so,the determinative issue is simply whether the eeoc is a party to the contract containing the arbitration provision.waffle house,supra,at.if not,then the eeoc has statutory authority to seek in court both injunctive relief to protect the public and damages.id.at.however,if the eeoc has agreed to arbitration,then it must arbitrate all of its any request for,public injunctive is barred from pursuing any claim outside the arbitral forum.id.at,italics added.in the latter situation,in terms of arbitrability,no line may be drawn between injunctive and relief.id.at.thus,waffle house establishes that contrary to broughton,consumers,like cruz,who have agreed to arbitration must arbitrate all of their claims,including requests for public injunctions.
while the high court decisions in circuit city and waffle house undermine one of broughton fundamental states may decide that injunctive relief is somehow different from monetary damages for purposes of applying the high court third relevant decision in green tree undermines broughton other fundamental premise its assumption that private arbitration has several institutional shortcomings that render it inherently unsuitable for resolving requests for public injunctions.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.in green tree,the plaintiff argued that the arbitration agreement she signed left her unable to vindicate her statutory rights in arbitration and was therefore its silence with respect to payment of costs and fees create d a risk that she would be required to bear prohibitive arbitration costs if she pursue d her claims in an arbitral forum.green tree,supra,at.the high court disagreed,finding that the agreement mere silence on the subject of fees was alone insufficient to render it unenforceable.id.at.instead,the court held,a party seek ing to invalidate an arbitration agreement on the ground that arbitration would be prohibitively expensive bears the burden of showing the likelihood of incurring such costs.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court acknowledged that the existence of large arbitration costs could preclude a litigant from effectively vindicating her federal statutory rights in the arbitral forum.id.at.however,the court held,absent evidence in t he record on this question,t he risk that a plaintiff will be saddled with prohibitive costs is too speculative to justify the invalidation of an arbitration agreement.id.at.to invalidate the agreement on that speculative basis,the court explained,would undermine the liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements,citation and would conflict with the court prior holdings that the party resisting arbitration bears the burden of proving that the claims at issue are unsuitable for arbitration.ibid.thus,the court held,courts may not justify invalidating arbitration agreements with generalized attacks on arbitration that rest,not on evidence in the record,but on suspicion of arbitration as a method of weakening the protections afforded in the substantive law to complainants.citation.id.at.
broughton analysis is fundamentally inconsistent with the high court subsequent decision in green tree.as i have explained,in invalidating agreements to arbitrate clra requests for injunctive relief,broughton asserted that several institutional shortcomings of arbitration render it inherently unsuitable for resolving requests for public injunctions.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.however,broughton cited no the record or judicially noticeable facts to establish,or even support,this assertion.nor does the majority here cite any such evidence.nor did the plaintiff in broughton or cruz in this case offer any evidence on this question under green tree,it was their burden,as the parties seeking to invalidate the arbitration agreements,to offer such evidence.thus,t he risk that arbitration institutional shortcomings render it less effective than court proceedings for dealing with public injunctions is completely speculative and insufficient to justify the invalidation of an arbitration agreement requiring arbitration of clra requests for injunctive relief.green tree,supra,at.indeed,the very existence of those shortcomings is completely speculative.in short,broughton holding regarding arbitration of clra injunction requests rests on the very generalized and unproven suspicion of arbitration that green tree holds may not be a basis for invalidating an arbitration agreement.green tree,supra,at.as the high court stated in green tree,t o invalidate arbitration agreement s on such a speculative basis undermine s the liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements.citation.green tree,supra,at.thus,green tree and the high court other relevant decisions require that we overrule broughton insofar as it invalidates agreements to arbitrate clra injunction requests,and that we hold that all of cruz claims are arbitrable.
iv.extending broughton to ucl claims eviscerates the strong public policy favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements.
as broughton recognized,the faa is a federal statutory mandate that establishes a strong public policy in favor of enforcing arbitration agreements.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.section of the faa is a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements moses cone hospital mercury constr,d.it create s a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability,applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the faa.ibid.q uestions of arbitrability must be addressed with a healthy regard for this federal policy favoring arbitration the faa establishes that,as a matter of federal law,any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration,whatever the question at hand.id.at.
as broughton also recognized,california has a similar statute citation and a similar policy in favor of arbitration.citation.broughton,supra,cal th at,d.code of civil procedure section provides that written arbitration agreements are valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.this section establishes the fundamental policy of california arbitration scheme that arbitration agreements will be enforced in accordance with their terms.vandenberg superior court cal th,fn,d.through the statute enactment,the legislature expressed a strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution.citations.moncharsh heily blase cal th,d.as we explained more than years ago,t he policy of the law in recognizing arbitration agreements and in providing by statute for their enforcement is to encourage persons who wish to avoid delays incident to a civil action to obtain an adjustment of their differences by a tribunal of their own choosing.utah const.western pac.ry.cal.thus,california law,like federal law,establishes a presumption in favor of arbitrability.engalla permanente medical group,cal th,d.
in extending broughton to hold that ucl claims for injunctive relief are not arbitrable,the majority guts the strong federal and state public policy favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements.as we have explained,the ucl scope is broad and i ts coverage is sweeping,embracing anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.citations.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.in proscribing any unlawful business act or practice,business and professions code section borrows violations of other laws and treats these violations,when committed pursuant to a business activity,as unlawful practices independently actionable under the ucl and subject to the distinct remedies provided thereunder.farmers ins.exchange superior court cal th,d,italics added.in other words,a n unlawful act in the business context is,by definition,an action of unfair competition that may support a ucl action.stop youth addiction,lucky stores,cal th,d,conc.opn.of baxter,italics added.of course,because arbitration clauses are contractual,every arbitrable dispute will,by definition,involve business activity and acts in the business context.thus,under the majority holding,in every case where the parties have signed an arbitration agreement,the plaintiff can frustrate the defendant contractual right to the benefits of an arbitral,rather than a judicial,both the high court and this court have by alleging a claim under the ucl and requesting injunctive relief.thus,the majority statutory construction guts the strong public policy favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements that both the california legislature and the united states congress have established by statute.it also does precisely what the high court has held states may not do wholly eviscerate congressional intent in passing the faa to place arbitration agreements upon the same footing as other contracts,citation,simply by passing statutes that make certain arbitration agreements void as a matter of state public policy.southland,supra,at,fn.
more specifically,because a ucl action may be based on a violation of other laws,the majority holding will enable artful obtain judicial determination of claims that they agreed to arbitrate and that the united states supreme court has expressly held to be arbitrable.in southland,the high court held that where the faa applies,claims under the california franchise investment law are arbitrable notwithstanding a california statute prohibiting arbitration of such claims.southland,supra,at.similarly,in perry,the high court held that where the faa applies,claims under california law for unpaid wages are arbitrable notwithstanding a california statute prohibiting arbitration of such claims.perry,supra,at.of course,a plaintiff may easily plead a violation of either our franchise investment law or our wage payment statutes as a violation of the ucl.under the majority conclusion,by doing so,a plaintiff can frustrate the defendant contractual right to an arbitral,rather than judicial,forum for claims under the franchise investment law and our wage payment statutes,despite the high court binding and express holdings in southland and perry that the faa requires enforcement of agreements to arbitrate these claims indeed,the majority conclusion vitiates numerous other high court holdings in precisely the same manner.the high court has held that the faa requires enforcement of agreements to arbitrate claims under the federal age discrimination in employment act of,the sherman act,the securities exchange act of,the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act,and the securities act of.gilmer,supra,at.however,contrary to these binding holdings,because a violation of any of these federal statutes is also a violation of the ucl,the majority conclusion enables a plaintiff to frustrate the defendant contractual right to the benefits of an arbitral,rather than judicial,forum for these arbitrable federal claims simply by alleging them as violations of the ucl and requesting injunctive relief 
finally,given the extremely broad standing provisions applicable to claims under the ucl and business and professions code section,the majority vitiates these binding high court precedents and sacrifices the strong public policy favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements without justification.as the majority acknowledges,ante,d at,at,business and professions code section provides in part that ucl actions for injunctive relief shall be prosecuted by the attorney general of california,any district attorney,specified county counsel,city prosecutor s and city attorney s,or any person acting for the interests of the general public.bus,italics added.under our prior construction of this provision,members of the public other than a specific victim also have standing to pursue unfair competition claims,so the policy underlying the unfair competition statute can be vindicated in court by multiple parties even if the specific victim has signed an arbitration agreement and is required to honor that agreement.rubin green cal th,d.a similar standing provision applies to actions for injunctive relief under business and professions code section.bus.given these broad standing provisions,and given that a violation of the clra also constitutes a violation of the ucl,we need not eviscerate the public policy strongly favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements in order to protect the public or to vindicate the public interest in enforcement of these statutes.here,we need not let cruz out of his arbitration agreement so he can proceed in court as a private attorney general,when the attorney general himself,and any member of the general public who has not signed an arbitration agreement,can play that role.accordingly,i dissent from the majority conclusion that cruz requests for injunctive relief are not arbitrable.
