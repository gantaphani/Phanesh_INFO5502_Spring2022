these consolidated appeals arise from an arbitrator decision,confirmed by the trial court,assessing civil penalties,costs,and attorney fees against lionsgate corporation lionsgate and in favor of solano county.in case number,lionsgate contends the arbitrator lacked the authority to rule on charges made by the county under the false claims act,et,improperly awarded the county prejudgment interest and attorney fees,and misinterpreted certain conduct by lionsgate as amounting to false claims.in case number,lionsgate development corporation,kenneth barker,and lois barker challenge an order amending the judgment to include them as judgment debtors.
in the published portion of our opinion,we hold that the arbitrator properly considered the county false claims act charges,but that the county was not entitled to prejudgment interest until after entry of the final arbitration award.otherwise,we affirm.
background 
the parties dispute concerned lionsgate performance of a contract to replace a bridge in solano county.the contract incorporated caltrans standard specifications,including the following arbitration clause 
claims demands for monetary compensation or damages arising under or related to performance of the contract shall be resolved by arbitration unless the department and the contractor agree in writing,after the claim has arisen,to waive arbitration and to have the claim litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction.arbitration shall be pursuant to public contract code sections,inclusive,and applicable regulations see subchapter sections,inclusive of chapter of title of the california code of regulations.the arbitration decision shall be decided under and in accordance with the law of this state,supported by substantial evidence and,in writing,contain the basis for the decision,findings of fact,and conclusions of law.

after a lengthy series of hearings,the arbitrator issued detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law.he found that lionsgate false claims in connection with the bridge contract had caused the county to incur substantial investigative and administrative costs.however,the arbitrator concluded those expenses were not recoverable as damages.he limited the county recovery to civil penalties under the false claims act.the arbitrator found that lionsgate had breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,but with no resulting damages,and that lionsgate had not committed fraud due to the absence of detrimental reliance on the county part solano was ably represented throughout the performance of the contract by competent officials and employees,who protected its interests and avoided any losses.

discussion 
the false claims act issues were subject to arbitration 
lionsgate challenges the propriety of the arbitrator ruling that the contract authorized arbitration of the county false claims act charges.we review the trial court determination on this point de novo,but we give substantial deference to the arbitrator own assessment of his contractual authority.alexander blue cross of california th,d belgum th,d.we can not say the arbitrator erred in this instance.
lionsgate first contends we should give controlling effect to our decision in greenlining institute public utilities com.th,d.we disagree.greenlining did not involve arbitration it addressed the public utilities commission jurisdiction to conduct administrative hearings.here,we are concerned not with the jurisdiction of an administrative tribunal,but with a contractual arbitration clause incorporating statutory provisions that expressly authorize arbitration of public contract disputes.greenlining is simply inapposite.
lionsgate primary argument centers on the false claims act references to a civil action to recover penalties and damages,and to assessments and findings by the court,see also.however,it is settled that statutory claims are not inarbitrable merely because the statute in question includes such provisions.business and professions code section declares that a ctions for relief pursuant to this chapter shall be prosecuted exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction nevertheless,our supreme court has held that claims for restitution and disgorgement under business and professions code section et are arbitrable.cruz pacificare health systems,cal th,d,compare greenlining institute public utilities,supra,th at,d.similarly,although civil code section,subdivision c formerly specified that actions under the consumers legal remedies act clra must be filed in any court having jurisdiction of the subject matter,the high court ruled that actions for damages under that version of the clra could be arbitrated.broughton cigna healthplans cal th,d.it has also been established that antitrust claims under the cartwright act bus,et are subject to arbitration,despite language in business and professions code section,subdivision a contemplating civil actions in any court having jurisdiction crown homes,landes,supra,th,d.
lionsgate attempts to distinguish crown homes,landes,supra,the case on which the arbitrator relied in rejecting lionsgate objection to the arbitration.lionsgate argues that,unlike the arbitration clause at issue in crown homes,which included a number of exceptions but none that excluded cartwright act claims see crown homes,landes,supra,th at,d,the contract before us could exclude false claims act charges,which are not contract claims.however,the county allegations under the false claims act were at least in part c laims demands for monetary compensation or damages arising under or related to performance of the contract,under the operative terms of the arbitration clause in the parties contract.in its petition to vacate the arbitration award,lionsgate argued that its claims for adjustment of amounts due,which gave rise to the county false claims act charges,were presented pursuant to the standard specifications incorporated in the contract.clearly,lionsgate could reasonably expect to arbitrate the county responsive false claims act causes of action for compensation or damages.
in its reply brief,lionsgate asserts it never agreed to arbitrate claims for civil penalties under the false claims act.this argument was also presented in lionsgate objection to the arbitration.however,lionsgate never requested a severance of the penalty claims.when there are arbitrable and inarbitrable remedies derived from the same statutory claim,the arbitrable claims should be severed from those that are inarbitrable and sent to arbitration.broughton cigna healthplans,supra,cal th at,d,see also cruz pacificare health systems,supra,cal th at,d.moreover,the arbitrator findings and conclusions clearly indicate the award was designed not simply to penalize lionsgate,but rather to compensate the county for administrative expenses the arbitrator believed were not recoverable as damages.
the imposition of penalties as a form of compensation was well within the arbitrator
