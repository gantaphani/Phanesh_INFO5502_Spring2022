this case presents the issue of whether the right to arbitrate is waived when a timely but procedurally defective demand for arbitration is made.our resolution of the dispute requires us to consider a clash between important public policies.on the one hand,where the arbitration agreement specifies a time limit for making a demand,courts should uphold the parties bargain by finding a waiver of the right to arbitrate where the demand is untimely u nless legally excused,a contracting party can not compel arbitration when it has failed to make a timely demand.platt pacific,andelson cal th,d,platt.on the other hand,arbitration is strongly favored under california law,claims of arbitration waiver are closely scrutinized,and the party claiming such waiver bears a heavy proof burden.saint agnes medical center pacificare of california cal th,d,saint agnes.
service employees international union,local,union pursued a grievance with the cupertino union school district district through multiple steps required under their collective bargaining agreement cba.when the grievance was not resolved to its satisfaction,union submitted to district two first being union expressed intent to arbitrate the matter in the future once the grievance had been formally denied,and the second being a clear demand for arbitration from union attorney.both letters were timely under the cba but neither complied with its procedural requirements,transmission of notice to a state mediation service.accordingly,district refused to arbitrate,contending that union had waived its arbitration rights and that the grievance was deemed settled under the terms of the cba.union petitioned the court below to compel arbitration.the court,however,agreed with district that union forfeited its arbitration rights by failing to submit a timely demand that complied with the procedure outlined in the cba.
on appeal,we examine the nature and extent of union failure to comply with the cba arbitration demand requirements and whether a proper application of the holding in platt,supra,cal th,d,compels the conclusion that union forfeited the right to arbitrate the instant grievance.we conclude that platt and the cases it relied upon are not controlling and that union did not forfeit its arbitration rights by submitting a timely but procedurally defective demand.we therefore reverse the order denying the petition to compel arbitration.
on or about january,union and district entered into a written agreement,the cba.a dispute arose between the parties that resulted in a written grievance being filed on december,by union member gavin ward.the grievant claimed that district had used workers to perform certain tasks in violation of certain contracting out language of a side letter,and sought r eimbursement of lost wages to all affected workers.on december,district issued its written informal level decision denying the grievance.on january,ward and union submitted another written grievance that was substantively the same as the prior grievance.district again denied the grievance in writing on january,the letter,sent by district human resources manager,terry nolan,was addressed to ward,and included three union representatives as cc recipients.
on january,union representative leah was among those listed as having received a copy of district january,to district nolan,indicating that she was following up on the parties last meeting concerning the grievance and was amending the grievance to claim the challenged action violated the cba as well as the side letter.the letter stated further that union intended to arbitrate the grievance,and that it would make a request for arbitration to the state conciliation services scs after receiving district final decision.berlanga delivered this letter to nolan on january,at the same time,nolan told berlanga that she had previously sent district response to the grievance on january,and nolan handed berlanga another copy of that january response.
on february,district received a letter dated february,from attorney daniel boone concerning the grievance,stating this firm represents the union in the above matter.this is a formal request for arbitration.the letter went on to propose three potential arbitrators and indicated that union would seek all appropriate legal remedies if district refused to arbitrate.on february,nolan advised berlanga orally that union arbitration request was improper and untimely.similarly,on february,attorney gregory dannis,on behalf of district,advised boone in writing that district did not acknowledge boone february letter as being a proper arbitration request he noted further that union had not,as of february,submitted the required letter to scs in this matter.
on march,boone,on behalf of union,wrote to scs,requesting a list of arbitrators to resolve the grievance under the cba.on april,dannis again wrote boone to advise that it was district position that union had not submitted a timely arbitration request.dannis noted that,pursuant to the terms of the cba,district considered the matter settled based upon its january,denial of the grievance and would not agree to participate in an arbitration that was based on union untimely request.
procedural history 
on july,union filed its petition to compel arbitration pursuant to code of civil procedure section district opposed the petition,arguing both that the grievance was not substantively arbitrable,and that union had failed to make a timely demand for arbitration under the terms of the cba.
the petition was heard and denied by the court on september.the trial court concluded that,while the grievance was a matter that was subject to arbitration,the petition to compel should be denied because of its untimeliness the court finds that the failure of union to timely demand arbitration without sufficient excuse constitute d a waiver of the right to arbitrate.the contract states that if the matter is not arbitrated it is deemed settled.district is entitled to stand under the rights given to it under the negotiated agreement.
union filed timely its notice of appeal on november.the order denying union petition to compel arbitration is directly appealable.see code civ,aggrieved party may appeal from a an order dismissing or denying a petition to compel arbitration see also mercury ins.group superior court cal th,d.
discussion 
standard of review 
the trial court determination that a petition to compel arbitration should be denied on the ground that the petitioner has waived its right to arbitrate under code civ,subd.a is ordinarily a question of fact and determination of this question,if supported by substantial evidence,is binding on an appellate court.citation.doers golden gate bridge.dist.cal d.although waiver and estoppel findings are typically factual,w hen,however,the facts are undisputed and only one inference may reasonably be drawn,the issue is one of law and the reviewing court is not bound by the trial court ruling.platt,supra,cal th,d.
in this instance,the facts relevant to the trial court finding that union waived its right to arbitrate the grievance were undisputed.we therefore review the court finding de novo and are not bound by its ruling.
ii.issue on appeal 
the sole issue on appeal is whether the court properly concluded that union had waived its right to arbitrate the grievance because of its failure to make a timely demand for arbitration under the terms of the cba.
union argues that under napa association of public employees county of napa d.napa association,a finding of arbitration waiver is improper unless there is,in addition to an untimely demand,an allegation and proof of intentional abandonment of the right to arbitrate or substantial prejudice resulting from the delay.as neither circumstance was presented here union argues,the court erred in finding that union had waived its right to arbitrate the grievance 
district responds that napa association is inapplicable because it concerned the procedural timeliness of initiation of a grievance procedure,not of making an arbitration demand.district argues that under platt,supra,cal th,d,case that was not cited in the proceedings clearly forfeited its arbitration rights by failing to make a timely arbitration demand under the terms of the cba following a brief discussion of applicable arbitration law,we discuss the parties contentions and resolve the controversy concerning whether union forfeited its right to arbitrate the instant grievance.
iii.contractual arbitration 
under california law,a party to an agreement requiring resolution of disputes through arbitration may seek a court order enforcing its contractual arbitration rights.on petition of a party to an arbitration agreement alleging the existence of a written agreement to arbitrate a controversy and that a party thereto refuses to arbitrate such controversy,the court shall order the petitioner and the respondent to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists,unless it determines that a the right to compel arbitration has been waived by the petitioner or b grounds exist for the revocation of the agreement.code civ.
thus,a petition to compel under code of civil procedure section essentially seeks specific performance of an arbitration agreement.see freeman state farm mut.auto.ins.cal d,freeman.in deciding such petition,the court determine s in advance whether there is a duty to arbitrate the controversy.citation.this determination necessarily requires the court to examine and,to a limited extent,construe the underlying agreement.citation.green diablo hospital dist.d.
where the agreement to arbitrate does not specify a time for demanding arbitration,the demand must be made within a reasonable time to avoid forfeiture of the arbitration right.spear california state auto.cal th,d,johnson siegel th,d.where,however,the parties have agreed that a demand for arbitration must be made within a certain time,that demand is a condition precedent that must be performed before the contractual duty to submit the dispute to arbitration arises.platt,supra,cal th at,d.
iv.terms of cba and union purported arbitration demands 
this case turns on article of the four and page portion of the agreement entitled grievance procedure.the cba describes two stages of the formal grievance process that a grievant must follow to attempt to resolve the dispute through dialogue with district.immediately following two sections of the cba concerning the formal grievance procedure section of the cba entitled reads in part as follows selection of the arbitrator.if the union is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at step,the union may submit the grievance to arbitration within twenty working days from the receipt of the superintendent decision,by submitting a letter to the state conciliation service scs requesting a list of arbitrators,with a copy to the superintendent.that section provides further that t he function of the arbitrator shall be to hold a hearing concerning the grievance and to render a decision on the issues presented by the parties.such decision will be binding on all parties.
a separate section of article of the cba entitled general provisions includes the following c.the time allowance set forth in this grievance procedure may be extended by mutual agreement of the grievant or the grievant representative and the district.any grievance not appealed to the next step of the procedure within the prescribed time limits shall be considered settled on the basis of the answer given in the preceding step.
in this instance,union acknowledges that it did not make a written request to scs for a list of arbitrators within working days of receipt of the superintendent decision on step of the grievance procedure.it is undisputed that union request for arbitration to scs in this form did not occur until march.union,however,claims that it submitted two timely arbitration demands that were,admittedly,not sent to scs the january,letter from union representative berlanga and the february,letter from union attorney boone.we conclude that only the second letter constituted a timely but procedurally improper arbitration demand.
both letters were timely under the cba.union january,letter was plainly within working days of receipt of district final response to the grievance,which response was made on january.since the time period for submitting a demand commences on receipt of district final response to the grievance,and district stipulated that union had until february,to submit a request for arbitration,boone february,letter to district was also submitted in a timely fashion 
berlanga january,letter,however,was not an unequivocal demand for arbitration.it read,in relevant part the intent of this letter is to reiterate the position of union which is to take this grievance to arbitration.please review the grievance attached which has been amended upon receiving your letter rejecting the grievance,i will forward our request for arbitration to scs to request a list of arbitrators.rather than an unequivocal demand for arbitration,the letter expressed union intention to seek arbitration at a date in the future.aside the fact that the letter was not sent to was not an effective arbitration demand.see corbin on contracts ed,statement of intention is the mere expression of a state of mind,put in such a form as neither to invite nor to justify action in reliance by another person beck american health group,d.letter outlining terms to appear in contemplated future written contract was agreement to agree western homes herbert ketell,d.agreement reflecting that parties contemplated hiring third party to manage project constituted an expectation or intention rather than a promise or undertaking,and was thus not a contractual obligation.
boone february,letter to district contained no such equivocation or expression of future intentions.it stated this is a formal request for arbitration.we thus conclude that boone letter was a clear expression of union intent to arbitrate the grievance.in the next section,we address whether the timely but procedurally improper submission of union intention to arbitrate embodied in this february,letter precludes a finding that union waived arbitration.
whether union waived arbitration rights 
we now consider whether napa association,supra,d,supports union contention that it did not waive its right to arbitrate,and whether,conversely,platt,supra,cal th,d,compels affirmance of the court denial of union petition to compel arbitration.we conclude that,based upon the particular facts presented here involving union arbitration demand,neither case is dispositive.we then address rules of contract interpretation and public policy favoring arbitration that guide our decision.
applicability of napa association and platt 
in napa association,the court addressed the denial of a labor union petition to compel arbitration after the public entity had refused to consider or arbitrate the union grievances on the basis that the grievances were untimely napa association,supra,d at.the appellate court reversed,concluding that it was error to find arbitration waiver as a matter of law because of the union alleged failure to timely file a grievance all we hold is that the mere assertion of a party failure to file a grievance within the time specified in the agreement,in the absence of an allegation and proof of intentional abandonment of the right to arbitrate or substantial prejudice resulting from the delay,is not of itself sufficient to raise a question of waiver within the meaning of code of civil procedure section,and that the trial court therefore erred in finding waiver as a matter of law.id.at,fn.omitted.
napa association is plainly distinguishable.as the supreme court has explained,napa association involved the timeliness of submitting a labor grievance,not a demand for arbitration.platt,supra,cal th at,d.indeed,the napa association court made clear the distinction between a contractual statute of limitations with respect to the time within which arbitration must be demanded that was not present the issue that the appellate court was deciding,namely,a time schedule with respect to the filing and processing of grievances.napa association,supra,d at,original italics see also platt,supra,at,d,emphasizing that napa association did not involve question of arbitration demand timeliness.
here,there is no issue concerning the timeliness of union filing of the grievance the sole question is the timeliness of its arbitration demand.napa association plainly has no application to this case.moreover,to the extent that union attempts to export napa association holding concerning waiver in the context of filing an untimely grievance to the entirely different issue of an untimely arbitration demand,the supreme court in platt expressly rejected that argument in holding that the failure to timely submit a labor grievance was not a waiver of the right to arbitrate in the absence of intentional relinquishment of the right or substantial prejudice,the court in napa association emphasized that its decision was limited to the grievance issue citations.therefore,there was no reason for the court in napa association,to address the consequences of failing to make a timely demand for arbitration.platt,supra,cal th at,d.
we also disagree with district that platt,supra,cal th,d,requires us to conclude that union waived its arbitration rights.the facts presented in platt,as contrasted with the facts here,are important to consider.there,the parties entered into an arbitration agreement following nearly five years of construction litigation.id.at,d.the agreement contemplated that they would participate in a voluntary settlement conference before a retired judge,and that they would arbitrate the matter if the efforts at the settlement conference proved unsuccessful.ibid.the agreement provided further that the parties would jointly demand arbitration no later than august,and that either party could file its own demand for arbitration if the other failed to cooperate,stipulating but in no event shall such a demand be filed later than august,original italics.the plaintiffs waited until nearly two months after that deadline october,to file an arbitration demand with the american arbitration association aaa.id.at,d.when the aaa declined to proceed with arbitration absent a court order,the plaintiffs filed a petition to compel arbitration.ibid.
the superior court denied the petition because the plaintiffs had not sought arbitration within the time specified by the agreement,and the court of appeal affirmed.platt,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court affirmed as well,holding when,as here,the parties have agreed that a demand for arbitration must be made within a certain time,that demand is a condition precedent that must be performed before the contractual duty to submit the dispute to arbitration arises.id.at,d.the high court concluded consistent with established law,we hold that,in the absence of legal excuse,a party failure to timely demand arbitration results in a contractual forfeiture of the right to compel arbitration.id.at,d.
platt is distinguishable on at least two bases.first,the plaintiffs in platt made no attempt whatsoever to meet the contractual deadline for demanding arbitration.instead,they submitted their demand nearly two months late.platt,supra,cal th at,d.in contrast,union the february,letter of its a timely and unequivocal demand for arbitration.that demand clearly apprised district within the notice period specified in section of the cba that union wanted to arbitrate the grievance.
second,the contractual language in platt established a clear condition precedent that arbitration be required only in the event of a timely demand.the requirement that the arbitration demand be made in no event later than august,platt,supra,cal th at,d,original italics,stands in stark contrast with the permissive language here that union may submit the grievance to arbitration within working days of receipt of district decision concerning the grievance 
in short,we reject equally union claim that napa association,supra,d,compels reversal,and district assertion that platt,supra,cal th,d,requires affirmance of the order denying the petition to compel arbitration.
contract interpretation and policy favoring arbitration 
our conclusion that this case is distinguishable from platt,supra,cal th,d,finds support in traditional rules of contract interpretation as well as in familiar policy considerations discussed,post.it is a well established principle that conditions precedent are not favored by the law,and are to be strictly construed against one seeking to avail himself of them.citations.antonelle kennedy shaw lumber cal,see also pacific allied century steel products,d.thus,stipulations in an agreement are not to be construed as conditions precedent unless such construction is required by clear,unambiguous language and particularly so where a forfeiture would be involved or inequitable consequences would result.citations.alpha beta food markets retail clerks cal d,alpha beta food see also rubin fuchs cal d.
further,the civil code requires that a condition involving a forfeiture must be strictly interpreted against the party for whose benefit it is created.thus,f orfeitures are not favored by the courts,and if an agreement can be reasonably interpreted so as to avoid a forfeiture,it is the duty of the court to avoid it.the burden is upon the party claiming a forfeiture to show that such was the unmistakable intention of the instrument.citations.a contract is not to be construed to provide a forfeiture unless no other interpretation is reasonably possible.citations.universal sales cal.cal d,universal sales,quoting nelson schoettgen d,see also lowe ruhlman d.
for instance,in universal sales,supra,cal d,our supreme court considered whether a particular provision in a contract for the purchase and sale of a certain machine provided for a forfeiture of the buyer rights to royalties derived from the sale of other similar machines.the seller argued that a provision that relieved the buyer of the obligation to pay for the machine if it did not prove functional and limited the seller liability to a refund of the purchase the buyer tender of the machine and demand for a as a termination of the contract,including a forfeiture of the buyer right to any royalties from the sale of other machines.universal sales,supra,cal d at.the court rejected this argument,noting that forfeitures are disfavored id.at,that the agreement provided in a subsequent clause that it was to remain in effect for years id.at,and concluding if by this language specifically restricted to the measure of the seller liability upon the buyer return of the machine,the parties contemplated a stipulation for termination of the contract,necessarily involving the forfeiture of the buyer rights thereunder,it would have been a simple matter to have so provided in plain terms.ibid.
here,similarly,the cba did not directly and specifically condition union ability to arbitrate a grievance upon it making a timely and procedurally proper demand.as we have noted,the provision in section a of the cba did not contain words of limitation,such as in no event or subject to,that would have made it clear that the failure to demand arbitration as provided in that section would result in a waiver of arbitration rights.it is only by resort to a different d,found on a different page of the,through liberal interpretation favoring district,we might construe the failure to give proper notice as resulting in a waiver of union arbitration rights.such a finding would stand the rules of interpretation on their head we are required to strictly construe the purported condition precedent against district,the one seeking to avail itself of the condition.antonelle lumber,supra,cal.at.furthermore,we are compelled to reject the existence of a claimed condition that would result in forfeiture unless there appears clear,unambiguous language creating such condition alpha beta food,supra,cal d at,a circumstance not present here.
moreover,in this instance,were we to ignore settled rules of construction by liberally interpreting the cba in district favor to find the existence of a condition,the result would be a substantial forfeiture.by so applying section d to preclude arbitration,the grievance would be deemed to have been settled in favor of the district bas
