opinion of the court 
this case involves an effort by appellee the flintkote company flintkote to compel arbitration on a theory of equitable estoppel against appellant aviva plc aviva,a to the agreement containing the arbitration clause at issue.aviva appeals the district court order compelling arbitration and denying as moot aviva motion to dismiss or transfer.applying delaware law,we conclude that aviva is not equitably bound to arbitrate on these facts.we will therefore reverse the district court order insofar as it compels arbitration,and will vacate the order to the extent that it denies as moot the motion to dismiss or transfer.
flintkote,which is incorporated in delaware and headquartered in california,was one of the nation major suppliers of products.from onward,flintkote parent company,genstar corporation,hedged against the possibility of bodily injury claims by procuring a vast number of insurance policies from prominent london insurance firms among them aviva one of the largest insurance companies in the world.within a matter of years,it became apparent that flintkote claims under these policies would result in costly and protracted disputes regarding the scope of coverage.
on june,flintkote and several of the london insurers,but not aviva,entered into a mass settlement known as the wellington agreement,which provided a structure for resolution of flintkote and future insurance claims.specifically,the wellington agreement required that disputes over coverage be resolved through a adr process consisting of open negotiation via mediation,binding arbitration,and an expedited appellate process.app.section xx of the agreement required the london insurers to make certain payments to flintkote,and flintkote was obligated to reimburse the payors,with interest,if it also received those same payments from another insurer.app.
in,flintkote and aviva entered into a separate agreement the agreement,which in substance was largely similar to the wellington agreement,including as to reimbursement for claims also paid by other insurers.crucial to this case,however,is the fact that the agreement contained a clause explicitly reserving each party right to resolve any disputes arising under that agreement through litigation 
flintkote and aviva shall resolve through litigation any disputed issues to this agreement,and nothing contained in any provision of this agreement or in any provision of the wellington agreement,as applied to this agreement,shall require aviva and flintkote to resolve any disputes that may arise between them relating to this agreement through adr under the wellington agreement.
flintkote filed for bankruptcy in,resulting in a case which remains pending in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware.see in re the flintkote flintkote mines.in,invoking the wellington agreement,flintkote initiated a mediation with the london insurers.the mediation agreement,which itself contained no reference to the wellington agreement,provided that the parties conduct and statements made in the course of mediation were to be confidential app.aviva,although not contractually obligated to participate,opted to join the mediation in an effort to resolve flintkote pending claims for coverage.
throughout the subsequent proceedings,aviva and the other london insurers were jointly represented by the same counsel,attorney fred alvarez.in a letter dated august,alvarez requested that flintkote participat e in submitting a joint motion to lift the automatic bankruptcy stay in flintkote bankruptcy proceeding,citing a concern that the stay might prevent aviva and the other london insurers from fully present ing their defenses and claims in the wellington adr.app.yet for reasons unknown,no such motion was filed at that time.as described below,the automatic stay remained in place until early.
during the course of the ensuing mediation,flintkote reached individual settlements with some of the london insurers,but not with aviva.on july,counsel for aviva and the remaining other london insurers wrote to flintkote seeking reimbursement or with respect to prior payments as well as interest under section xx of the wellington agreement.app.the july letter further stated that a bsent resolution of the issues in the pending wellington adr,the london insurers intend ed to include the reimbursement issue in the wellington arbitration.id.flintkote took no action on the demand.
two months after the july letter,the parties began to exchange draft arbitration agreements.the drafts contained standard reservations stating that they were provided only for discussion purposes,were subject to client review and approval,and were provided without prejudice to the parties rights under the applicable accords.app.the last draft arbitration agreement was sent to flintkote by alvarez on behalf of aviva and the london insurers on december.
on december,aviva,now acting separately from the remaining london insurers,moved in the delaware bankruptcy court to lift the automatic stay imposed under d to allow it to pursue a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the northern district of california to determine the scope of the insurance coverage available for flintkote under certain insurance policies aviva had issued.app.on january,before the bankruptcy court ruled on aviva motion,flintkote filed the instant declaratory judgment action against aviva in the district of delaware.
on february,the bankruptcy court granted aviva motion to lift the stay,but delayed its effective date until february,thus preventing aviva from filing its complaint in california until that date.on february,as plaintiff in the district of delaware,flintkote moved to compel arbitration pursuant to section of the federal arbitration act faa.the next day,aviva filed its own declaratory judgment action in the northern district of california.
on march,aviva moved to dismiss flintkote action or transfer it to california.on march,flintkote filed a motion to dismiss the aviva action initiated in california,or have it transferred to delaware.on may,the california court stayed aviva action pending the delaware court resolution of aviva motion to dismiss or transfer flintkote action.
in a memorandum and order filed september,the delaware district court granted flintkote motion to compel arbitration,concluding that aviva was equitably estopped from avoiding arbitration by virtue of its participation in the lengthy mediation process.the district court denied as moot aviva motion to dismiss or transfer.aviva filed a timely notice of appeal.on november,in light of the delaware district court order compelling arbitration,the california district court dismissed aviva suit without prejudice.see aviva plc flintkote,wl.

we exercise plenary review over the district court order on a motion to compel arbitration.quilloin tenet healthsystem,cir.in assessing the motion to compel arbitration itself,we apply the standard for summary judgment in rule a,under which the motion should be granted where there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.we view the facts and draw inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.quilloin,at.we apply this standard because the district court order compelling arbitration is in effect a summary disposition of the issue of whether or not there had been a meeting of the minds on the agreement to arbitrate.century indem.certain underwriters at lloyd,london,cir quotation marks and citations omitted.
